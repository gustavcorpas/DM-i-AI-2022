5,I decided to upgrade my recording setup this month. As the investment kept rising I found it easy to justify a boom arm upgrade...I had one of the cheaper boom arms you could buy on Amazon it came in at a little more than 1/3 the price of this one. And while it did the job it felt and looked cheap and was extremely stiff. It was also a bit short.This Gator Frameworks 3000 remedies all of that. It looks great operates almost effortlessly and smoothly. And if you are upgrading to a mic that needs an XLR cable like I did it includes a nice and long XLR cable saving you about $20. It's a great value even without the cable this makes it a no-brainer.The cable runs through the inside of the boom arm. This makes for a nice clean look. But as far as I can tell to change out the cable you'd have to run a naked cable through a small hole in the bottom disassemble the stand to run the cable through (not too difficult) and then solder/crimp/however-you-attach-an-XLR-connector. I show a pic of the only spot I found that would require the connector to be attached after assembling. I suppose you could Dremel the top of that hole off and you'd be able to run your cable with the connectors attached. Maybe. (Hole close up shown in pic.)All this cable talk leads me to the one little gripe I have about this unit. The whole unit is black. So why oh why did we have to use a silver XLR connector on this cable? The reason it bothers me is that when on video if I have the mic in real close that silver connector jumps out and draws attention. Without it the whole unit would just blend in and be much less noticeable. Tiny gripe I know. I'll be painting the outside of the connector and my trauma will soon be forgotten.*** Note about the desk mount: I'm using the desk mount from my old boom arm the pins are the same size. The mounts that come with this unit are awesome though! Very robust. It comes with one that can be screwed to the desk top — I might end up using that one. The other one is a really solid desk clamp it just won't fit where I have my unit located in a small crack between the desk and a desk extension I have my phone on.
5,This was probably the best purchase I've made for my streaming setup. It holds my Shure SM7B perfectly. It is great. Explanation point. High quality and definitely recommend. Get the most expensive one they have as the quality is far better than the other models. There is so much adjustability on this. It's heavy duty. And I've been using it for almost a year with zero issues. My other boom arm broke in only a few short months. I will have a video on this product page very soon as I'm doing a full video review. I highly recommend this. Do not think twice. It also has an LED that can be changed from blue to red or purple! Perfect for streamers or podcasts. I also use it to produce music as well.
5,I really love how this looks in my studio but what i love the most is that if I hit the desk by mistake during recording I don’t get the vibration that I used to get from cheap stands
5,Don't do what I did or this Gator boom stand will cost you anywhere from $19-35 more (because of the mistake you made in purchasing a different boom stand such as the "Aokeo Mic Stand Arm Boom" that claimed to support the blue Yeti specifically and 3.3# generically).  The other boom stand worked for 2 weeks and then collapsed.  Nothing that's readily adjustable etc.HOWEVER This baby-- the Gator boom stand-- has adjustable bend points that you can easily tighten or loosen.  It supports over 4# which allows it to easily support my Blue Yeti Pro with isolation ring pop filter and 5-pin stereo XLR cable).  Although $99 is a lot-- it's less than $99 + the other boom stand you buy that fails.  Worth it in my opinion.
3,The lowest joint (the one right by the table) creaks like an old wooden door in a horror movie!  Granted the joint itself doesn't creak all that loud but neither the clamp mount nor the screw mount do anything to prevent that creaking from transferring into your desk and reminding you of your favorite 80s horror flick.The clamp mount has only a few millimeters of rubber on each side.  It does only an okay job of keeping it in place and the glue holding it in wants to tear away at the first sign of lateral movement.  The screw in desk mount has NO FOAM or rubber dampening of any kind.  I think it is actually a bit worse for transferring vibration down into your desk.  And yes I tried adjusting the tension knob on the problem joint.  All the way from so tight it can't move at all to so loose the knob almost fell off.  Works great if you never want to reposition your mic ever at all for any reason.
5,Easy to setup - Love thats theres an XLR built in - looks and feel sturdy. I used the clamp instead of drilling it in to my desk and it's pretty solid.Highly recommend this for sure
4,The reason I even ordered this in the first place was because of the one-day shipping (lol) I didnt even care about what stand I was getting. After I ordered it I started reading the reviews (10/10 decision making) and I saw way too many that were bad so I was really nervous about this.Right now it's hooked up to my desk and everything. It moves around fine sits fine and is just a pretty decent mic stand that is capable of holding my Shure SM7B. I'm not sure if this mic stand is worth its price though. I think you could get a better bang for your buck elsewhere but it definitely gets the job done. I think it's a 25/75 of wether or not you get a defective stand or not. But yeah it seems good enough to me.Ill update if anything breaks
4,Kind of sad to see my desk damaged but yeh its got grip. I had it mounted to my desk for couple weekw. Came home to my mic on my desk and the arm tore a chunk out of my desk LMAO. Like im not super mad just dam its got gator grip..for sure.
3,This is a nice mic stan BUT....  This stand is very easy to use.  However the totally enclosed cable cannot be replaced.  We all know cables fail.  Here when the cable develops a short the boom arm becomed unusable if you are concerned with aesthetics.  There slightly more expensive boom has a replaceable cable.  Pay the extra for it.
4,This mic extender arm was just what I needed! The other 'maximum extension' arm I ordered from someone else didn't allow me to attach the mic to the side of my desk and have it reach near my face. This one is longer and almost perfect! I do wish that I could tilt the microphone head towards me a bit but it lets me adjust it to straight down. I do a lot of streaming and Zoom meetings and this is perfect for that!
5,Very sturdy and mobile. Perfect set up for me. Worth the price.
5,Very sturdy and it stays where you put it. Looks pretty clean and have great built in cable management.
5,Honestly before I purchased this arm I couldn’t justify spending over 100 dollars on a microphone arm. It just seemed ridiculous quite frankly and I figured this was something I could get by on by using cheaper arms. But after going through a couple of cheap setups that were simply either poorly designed or would lose strength to hold up the microphone and would collapse after short use. I figured I might as well invest in a “good arm”. So naturally I looked up what Joe Rogan uses in the new studio and this is what came up. As soon as I took it out of the package I could tell it was built different from the rest and was far sturdier and heavier. The installation was very easy as well. As soon as I started to adjust it with my microphone I realized I should have just bought this right out of the gate. I probably spent just as much money on the cheaper ones if I added them all up. No matter what position I wanted the mic at it held up perfectly even at positions where the arm was fully extended out(where my other arms usually collapsed). I even left it in a somewhat “taxing” position for a week and it still held the mic right where I left it last. To add to it it has a built in XLR cable. Call me a newbie but I always wondered how the major podcasts didn’t have cables wrapping around the podcast arms like I always had... that’s because the cable is built in(of course). So in addition to its sturdiness it makes your setup look more clean with the built in cable and saves you from having to buy an extra cable. All in all I love it. If you are in the same boat as I was this is money well spent. Great product!
3,Product only came with the mounting bracket was missing the clamping bracket all together
3,Hello folks!I would like to start off that the boom arm itself is a quality piece and I have not had any issue with the stand itself. It is sturdy the range of motion is to be expected and the aesthetic is clean and professional. The boom arm is also equipped with an integrated XLR cable and here is what REALLY wanted me to give the product an overall 2 stars.I received the product earlier this year and is about 8 months of use now. At this point the XLR cable is noticeable shorting and audio signal is getting cut. My assumption is the inner threading of the cable and amount of arm movement used during it's time. Regardless the cable needs to be replaced. This process is not a quick fix; either calling in or replacing on your own which one would need soldering knowledge. If I have read into this more before I would have not purchased the boom arm stand at this price point. The lack of convenience in replacing such a "simple" fix is not worth it to me and I'm regretting this purchase.Final thoughts: The arm looks great BUT if you're like me and prefers more convenience this mic stand is not it. The time is takes to resolve a simple fix of swapping out an audio cable is far greater than the way it looks. TIME is the only thing we can't get back...I hope this helps in some people's decision making. Thanks you for your time.
5,Bought this for podcast.
5,Initially i saw a lot of people using these articulating arms and i thought they look GREAT i want one!! once i got this product i found out why its more than  just a pretty face. its solid well built evenly balanced and a smooth moving apparatus.  and the investment will last you far into the end of your pod cast streamer life. So yes its pretty looks professional but underneath its attractive exterior is a SOLID super hero of a mic stand.
5,I have had a few Mic Booms and this by far is the BEST!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Owned for one year and the cable connector to the spring has broken. The mic boom has worked and met my expectations up to this point but as much money as this costs and finding cheep internal components is very frustrating…good mic boom over all.
4,Only problem with it is that it doesn't turn.
3,I was looking for a more solid mic stand and this one is more solid once you lock it down but there are issues. Once you lock it down it isn't going anywhere without a lot of effort. That's actually a problem if you want to make a quick adjustment because of the height of your seat or desk (anyone with an adjustable seat or standing desk). As others have mentioned there is no spring tension but rather the stand relies upon strips of metal that want to flex straight and so you bend them to get your angles. I'm not sure how long they will last. The cable that comes mounted inside the arms is also non-replaceable and of average quality. Looks very unprofessional compared to another XLR cable I have which is powder coated all black. I'm not sure if I'll keep this used stand or not but it's definitely not worth the cost new.
4,I am upgrading form a scissor style mount (not sure on the name).  This boom arm is super quiet and solid. The clamp holds tight and there are plenty of locking positions. I change positions often while podcasting and wish this was a little easier to position while live. The arm attached to the mic is the same size if not a hair longer than the arm attached to desk which doesn't let me stow away easily with the mic attached. This came with a table top mount and hardware too. I was so happy to not have to buy another attachment to use this arm in different locations. And finally the integrated XLR cable is so clean looking!Pros:Professional LookingSturdyLockableMultiple mounting positionsIntegrated 10' XLRHolds all my mics in all positions (SM7b SM58 Rode Podcast mics)Cons:Lockable arms from only one sideMiddle joint is stiffer than base joint so it is a little awkward to reposition live with one handI was looking for a pro arm and came across this on JRE. When I saw the price ($125) I couldn't pass it up.
3,So this is a nice boom mount I use a Rode Podmic and it holds it securely in place so not much issue there. I also think the articulation feels good and the internal springs offer good support/resistance.I have 2 main complaints though.The first is that the head only allows you to mount the mic pointing down. The nature of the rode pod mic i am using intends for you to speak into the "top" of the mic and it is mounted into a frame. Meaning you can only use this arm with the mic hanging down and the boom above. I tend to use this for live streams and content creation meaning the arm and mic obscures my vision the video massively. If I was using a condenser mic that you addressed from the front this wouldn't be the case but here we are.Secondly i bought this arm because the cheap $15 arm clamp would slip off the edge of my desk because it was very shallow and my mic was very heavy. This arm does seem to have a "better" clamp but it is still far too shallow and still wants to slip off the desk. It doesn't help that this arm is heavier than the previous so it just makes the problem worse.  I expected more in this regard adjusting the mic makes the clamp twist and rotate and ultimately come loose.So here I am deciding if I want to drill holes into my desk to securely mount a boom arm that doesn't position the mic appropriately to avoid the same situation I had with my $15 mic stand.Still it is a good boom arm and if i was setting up a studio where I knew the arm position wouldn't be an issue and I was going to permanently attach the base I would think this would perform well.
5,This boom arm is amazing. I wanted the rode psa 1 to match my rode pod mic and rode interface but it was not available. I'm not disappointed at all!Easy to move into position. Comes fully assembled and ready to clamp onto your desk or they have a very nice desktop mount I opted to use instead. It came with some very nice coarse thread screws to securely attach it to a desk.The xlr cable included seems very good quality metal end connectors. The knobs can be secured down firmly to keep it in one place or left semi tight so you can move it around more easily if you actively move your mic around while using it.The sound isolation from my desk noise is very good! Coming from a traditional desktop mic stand I used to be able to hear every click of the mouse and keyboard stroke. Not anymore!My only complaint with the boom arm is the final adjustment point that the mic attaches to. I wish it adjust the opposite direction it currently does. It looks possible to flip it around but I'm not sure if i want to try because it functions well enough as is.Overall I love how safe my microphone feels when on the stand and would absolutely recommend this to anyone needing a boom arm.
4,The middle joint is too tight. (maybe just the one I got)I have to really tighten the middle knob down to keep it from trying to extend the boom but then it is too tight to be free enough to be easily bent or extended without having to readjust the knob.The arm works but this is a little annoying.It's like the spring in the lower assembly is too tight and i do not know how to adjust it.
3,It's strong enough to hold onto whatever mic and move it around silently. It looks sharp and keeps the area tidy. It starts out stiff though and it has to be worn in to really get it to be physically flexible. At first when I was setting it up I was worried while extending it that it wouldn't stay clamped because the arm starts out wanting to snap together. I really had to give it elbow grease but once tightened and given a week's use things mostly cleared up. The included cable isn't bad but I would like to be able to swap it if I wanted.My biggest complaint is that while it will hold the heaviest mic you have the clamps are Really not that sturdy. I do worry that if I move it too fast or bump into the desk too hard the clamps will come undone and the mic will collapse. If I had to do it again I'd get a different one but it does get the job done.
2,Package was just delivered. Clearly repackaged. Tape was already cut on box along with a missing part of the original box (ripped off by whoever bought this first). Bag that the mount comes in was tied up instead of heatsealed like something new would be. Nothing seems damaged in box but should be advertised as such.Two star rating is based on item coming opened/used and not new. Item itself seems decent but for the price I would go with another brand next time.
2,This is the second mic arm by this brand I’ve bought. The first one had a broken xlr cable that did not work (whereas any other one I had laying around did) unfortunately I couldn’t remove the cable it came with with that model. I bought a newer model that allows me to remove the cable as a replacement…another $150…it came and will not support the weight of my SM7B and seems to have a broken joint (it will not tighten either). I’m highly disappointed and embarrassed to say I’ve spent ~$300 on these when they come broken and are extremely hard to replace/return.
2,Bought May 2021 broke October 2022. When you buy a piece of equipment so mundane as a boom arm for $200 you'd expect it to have a bit more mileage than one year. Might have been the case if only they didn't use plastic to hold the adjustable pieces of this METAL mic arm steady. I just snapped in the middle of the night. I'll look elsewhere for a replacement.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Was disappointed to find the box completely open when the package arrived. In addition the XLR cable which should have been threaded inside of the boom arm was separated from the mechanism and cleanly severed.This means that I have to purchase a new XLR cable and deconstruct the boom arm to thread it in myself.The boom itself is rock solid and what I expected. Just disappointed with what came in the mail.
5,my son likes it.
5,Definitely recommend this mic stand. The SHURE mics are a little heavier so the cheaper ones dont really do well.  This one is perfect.
5,my original mic boom died from metal fatigue. the pin that the boom rotated on bent. I spent several days searching for a replacement and settled on the Gator Frameworks Deluxe Desk-Mounted Broadcast Microphone Boom Stand. I haven't been disappointed. it offers 2 methods of desktop attachment; a well built clamp-style and a bolt-in stand support.  it absolutely locks into place doesn't drift away it's silent and supports my heavy XLR Audio-Technica microphone. highly recommend it based on my first months use of it.
2,There were 3 things I hated about this product. First was the built in XLR cable. But that is clearly in the description so not their bad.The next one is the clamp is totally useless. It failed to expand to the width of the table I wanted to use and the clamping surface is not flat and felt lined making it super slippery. I did mount it to a thinner table but couldn't get it tight enough to not just slip around wit the slightest movement of the arm.The other thing I hated about it is the lack of range. It's basically a big long arm that won't fold back on it's self and get low. Unless you are bolting this thing down to a table about 3 feet way from a couch or something it's just frustrating to manage.Beautiful product that was utterly useless for me. I ended up sending back all my mics and recorders. If I do end up setting up a podcast studio I'll get the shorter table mic stands and use a sit up bar height table or something like that. These arms are clunky in the way.
3,The plastic on this unit is a crime for how much you pay. Your fingers will be in pain from twisting these knobs to get any amount of tension. Purchased May 26 2021 for my Shure SM7B. Yesterday I came to my office and found the whole boom crashed. Main tension spool by the clamp completely gave out. Every single joint's plastic parts became unhinged. These are garbage. Reached out to Gator for warranty information but I am already on the market for something else. Luckily there have been a lot better options that have come out in the last 8 months.
4,The mount works well but is of cheaper quality than expected. There's more plastic than I expected.
2,The base does not swivel well and the cable it comes with is cheap and you cannot replace it internally. Definitely not worth the money. More effective better stands available for a much better price. Overall build/components are strong not cheap and well built. Not a the best versatile stand overall.
3,I bought this because it had the internal XLR cable but if you screw the base down instead of using the clamp you won't get a tight fit and it will break eventually. It's like that base isn't made for the boom arm.When this one broke I bought the Donner boom arm and it's working much better. It only has the edge clamp but it's much sturdier.
5,This thing is well built. I’ve had a lot of boom arms but this one has been the best far and away.
5,Its solid and lives up to its name.  If you are the type of person who moves the stand when speaking into the mic it does not swivel like some of the others but it is a great mic stand to and very sturdy
4,After seeing multiple podcasters using this I purchased it. It's a hoss... solid as a rock. However I find it to be a bit stiff. If you're looking for a boom stand that needs to stay locked in the same general area then this is the one for you. However if you need to move it out of your way regularly you might look around a bit more. I got tired of muscling it non-stop so I put it back in the box and into storage.
5,The boom arm feels solid and all the locks lock tight. The spring tensioners are silent when you bend the arms to adjust the position. It holds a KingBee 2 mic just fine which weights in at just over 2.5 pounds.
5,High quality. Love it.
3,This thing is fine. It'll hold your mic up. I've got an existing recording setup and it integrates great. Does what I wanted it to do. BUT I have decent cables here. Nothing too fancy just decent enough to use and trust. Which is NOT the quality level brought by the included cable with this boom arm. I plugged it in hit record and immediately heard the worst hissing wobble noise crackles each time I even breathed near the mic.Everything was fine once I switched out the cable for one of my own (Planet Waves mid-grade) mic cables. I'm just wondering WHY Gator thought it'd be a good idea to include such a terrible cable *embedded within* the stand. Does Gator have even the smallest bit of respect for the professional studio time wasted by an engineer having to replace this cable? I'm going to have to take the arm apart (assuming that's possible the arm came with no instructions) to run my own cable through it. Wonder when I'll get to that. In the meantime I have this lame cable hanging out the side here like a broken catheter. Lame.Edit: I just cut the thing off in the end.
4,The other ones with the springs dont stay in place. This one does. Does exactly what I needed it to do: allow me to adjust then stay there and not slip lower. Easily adjustable.The XLR cable is kinda crap though. The female jack (the one that plugs into your microphone) wiggles too much and can cut out on active mic's which causes loud popping. No good. Replaced it with a better one. If youre not willing to unscrew everything and do some soldering just twist-tie a new cable to it. Maybe just unsolder and replace the female XLR with a quality (snug fitting) jack? That would allow you to keep the internal cable (which seemed fine) intact.
4,Like the title says it falls off the desk sometimes when you adjust the mic. Sometimes when I am gaming I like to push the mic away (closer to the base clamp) and it will fall off. Other than that it’s a great mic stand
5,Incredibly sturdy spring loaded and solid so it can definitely hold your microphone's weight. Articulates everywhere I need it and it even comes with an XLR already fed through it. Absolutely worth the money if you're on the fence!
4,Very sturdy and strong. Very reliable stand. Honestly I could give this a five star rating if my desk setup wasn’t so restrictive. Once I get to a bigger room with the room and space I need for an ideal broadcasting environment; I’m certain this could get 7 stars.I specifically purchased the 4000 series for this and am ready to purchase another when my next environment will be created.
5,I bought this for my initial start into podcasting/recording equipment. This was a recommendation from a Amazon influencer video and I came across it while I was looking at different mics. The reviewer included this one and said how good it is (and it is!) and the price was reasonable. I like that the mic cable is already fed through the arm. It also has adjustable points at every bend so you can unscrew/adjust/tighten how you like it. Very happy with my choice.
4,Love the design and sturdiness of this boom. I have 2 complaints - 1 the clamp that attaches to the table gets loose easily and 2 the length of the boom is not a fit for my needs.I needed to get a Heil 12" riser and 3 Shure A26X 3" Extension Tubes to turn it into the overhead boom I was looking for.  If you're looking for an overhead boom then you either need to buy these additions or find another boom.I'm happy with my setup now.
4,I love it - structure function & look. Only issue is that the mic cord is IN the arm and if it goes out or gets damaged on either end you must replace the entire arm. Serious oversight design flaw. You'll see the same comment online more than once.BTW One of the terms Amazon has listed to evaluate the item "sheerness" is unusual at best. Most formal sources have it defined as a naval term referring to deviation. I'm not even sure what it's meant to assess.
2,This Frameworks mic arm started out OK but after very light use the whole thing started loosening up at every metal/plastic junction and now the whole thing creaks squeaks and cracks every time you move it even slightly. Super disappointed with the quality for the price.
4,Its a very nice arm just be carful unboxing it and taking the Velcro straps off its spring loaded and will break glass if its swung open. It put a nice sized dent in my wood desk how ever its my fault not the products. Overall very happy it hold my Hyperx Quadcast with ZERO issues.
2,TLDR: THE XLR CABLE CAME BROKEN build quality is excellent but the product was faulty for me so 2/5.This product gets a 2 star rating from me because it’s build quality is fantastic it’s very sturdy and everything I wanted in a mic boom arm. What is absolutely awful though is the fact that there is an XLR cable that is soldered into the arm I wish you could route your own cable. Not even 20 minutes into UNBOXING the product I plugged in my SM7B and the cable shorted out and was not picking up any audio input after one adjustment to the cable. I still intend to use this boom arm with my own XLR cable but I shouldn’t have to do that the product should work. As of writing this review I have a replacement on the way so we’ll if it was just this one that I got that was faulty…
2,My main issue with this stand is that it is very difficult to get the mic to screw onto it.  There is too much give on the piece of metal and absolutely no way to grip it so I can't get the microphone to screw on without the whole piece spinning.  I thought I had it but this morning I discovered my microphone (very expensive one) had fallen off overnight and was hanging by the chord.  Luckily I had the arm extended past my computer because it would have caused damage.Update: I was finally able to get the piece to screw the mic onto the arm. Now the joints are too weak to keep the mic in the orientation I need for my recording.  I wish I did not purchase this product.
2,This is for the  ‘4000’ level arm.  Out of the box I am surprised how stiff the unit is.  The nobs are difficult to turn and the unit feels needlessly stiff in the joints.  I guess this is because they want it to be somewhat adjustable instead of locking it all the way down and having it be ridged.  It would be nice to be able to move it up and down a little while you adjust position while on a long Zoom call. I am not impressed with this execution of that feature.The real shame is buying this for the on air light.  This light IS NOT TIED TO THE MIC or the computer.  What a shame.  I purchased this over other units because I wanted the visual cue that my mic was hot on Zoom.  This doesn’t accomplish that goal at all.TL:DR; for an accessory that costs more than most entry level mics this unit misses the mark with value.  Poorly executed design and key feature puts this in the “return” column.
5,After having a Blue Compass fall apart on me within 6 months I was looking for a better alternative. This stand is solid. I am using a Shure SM7B as my mic and these things are heavy. Like really heavy. This stand holds up and adjusts effortlessly. Gator Frameworks comes through with the perfect desk mount stand.
5,10/10 would recommend when u bump your table or anything else the vibrations get cancelled out for the most part so it's not as loud plus it holds up my rode podcast mic with ease so in my case its the perfect product.
3,I love this boom arm but the cable buzzes and is unable to be replaced. I had a buzzing noise in my recordings and could not figure out the cause. Eventually I tried unplugging the built In cable and using another cable I had laying around and that resolves the issue. Very unfortunate. Planning to return and buy another and hope that cable isn’t defective because I like the stand otherwise.
5,this arm has a few negative reviews attached to it but mostly positive for a reason. either they got faulty boom arms (the far more likely scenario) or they’re straight-up lying. it’s that simple. this boom arm absolutely SLAPS for its price and i have had zero issues. it articulates in a very smooth and stable way easy but not too easy. the mic stays in place where i leave it and the frame attaches easily to your desk (though i will admit i added a little chair leg pad thing to keep the bottom side of the clamp from potentially scratching my desk). in short i would recommend this boom arm to anyone. buy it.
3,For the money this is rather disappointing. Simply because Gator is very limited in my opinion. I say that because the is the structure I’m after but the company refuse to make it flexible or run a 1/3 plug or even a USB cable. The unit is basically designed for Podcast use only. They have chosen to not service all the gamers out here. Then if you want the ability to change the cable it’s gonna cost $200 for the next up design which is not the Boom Stand I want. To use this boom stand with XLR I’m force to have to purchase a mini-mixer. I feel that Gator Framework is very short sighted when it come to whom they want to service.
2,Super hard to adjust
1,This may be more about the merchant than the product But below is feedback on both.I received a used one. :-( The box looked like someone taped it at home. The contents appeared to have been removed from the protective plastic and manually bundled up (hand wire-tied the cable and loosely re-bagged). The arm/boom had minor scratches as expected from an install. Plus there was no paperwork in the box no information no warranty nothing! Very disappointed since I purchased a "new" one and not a "used" or "refurbished" one.The product itself isn't very nimble (i.e. adjustable) even after adjusting the tension screws/nobs. It's just a bit unmanageable. However it's got nice cable management which gives it a clean look. If you need a fixed position with minimal movement then this might work for you.
3,The arm works great. It dows squeak a little where the pivot arm is closest to the table mount. Going to try applying a very light amount of grease/oil to prevent that squeak.The cable on the other hand was not functioning and would only work if I wiggled the female end (and only then would it cut in and out static-y)I tried my other XLR Cables and they work just fine without needing to wiggle the connections (I had worried it was an issue on the cloudlifter's side).I'm working with the Shure SM7B cloudlifter and Scarlette 18i20 3rd Gen.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 If I had to pick something I didn’t like about this product it would be that the knob That loosens the base to swerve from left to right Is located on the back of the product which prevents my table from Sitting flush against the wall.  Which isn’t that big of a deal.  Besides that’s.  It’s perfect.  Perfect. Perfect.  I’ll take a photo to show you what I’m taking about.  I’ll also make a video to show You how easy it is swerves vertical  // horizontal.  It also comes with a mount you can screw into a table if your looking to do that.
5,My old mic boom was really basic compared to this one.  I feel that my home studio took a huge step up with this mic boom stand.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Overall I am satisfied with it though there are a couple things I am not to crazy about that you really need to know about before you buy it and I go over those in detail with my video.If you want to have a detailed view and look at this boom arm then watch my video :)
5,I think I've ordered (and returned) every single mic boom on Amazon.  This was exactly what I was looking for!  It is sturdy and able to be articulated as needed.  I would recommend without any hesitation!
3,Overall it feels flimsy. I'm not confident in the build quality. The desk clamp is horrible. I tightened it down tight enough to where I was worrying about the plastic tightening wheel breaking and it was still loose and not holding it's position on the desk. I ended up having to drill holes in my desk and use the screw mount adapter in order for it to stay in place.It seems expensive for how cheap it feels but it gets the job done. Just a shame that in order to have it feeling sturdier you have to drill holes into your desk and use the screw mounted adapter. Would've been nice if the regular clamp was strong enough to hold it in place.
2,Bought it probably 4 or 5 months ago just to have it break the xlr cable which was causing a static issue after speaking into my sm7b with a goxlr mini spent more money on a good xlr cable which fixed it and after moving my microphone to tighten it down the piece that screws into the microphone snapped off with barley any force on it all in all not worth the money kinda pissed it doesnt have a warranty either or replacement parts...
1,There is an inexplicable dearth of solid desk mount mic booms. The Gator Series 3000 seemed like the clear answer. It is not.I purchased a boom stand by Blue that does not have any of these problems.Here are the issues:1. Built in mic cable. Like there is formed plastic around the areas where the cable feeds in and out and there is absolutely no way to replace the cable. This is marketed as a "broadcast" stand. I’m surprised that any sound professional would *ever* use a cable that came built into equipment like this let alone purchase equipment that did not allow cable replacement.2. The tension mechanism is a long strip of metal which is exposed at the joints. Screws tighten into this strip of metal to provide resistance. Monitor arms that cost less than this have much more sophisticated tension mechanisms I don't know why they couldn't pull of something more suitable for this mic stand. It is very strange to move around and feels like it wants to stay put. Not fluid at all.3. The base rotation is facilitated by a round peg sticking out of the bottom of the stand that goes into the clamp. There is not a true allowance for rotation unless you only partially tighten down the screw that goes into the base.  Attempting to move the stand while this screw is tightened enough to only allow controlled movement *will* cause the clamp itself to move regardless of tightness.I would not use this boom stand at any price.
1,I have 2 issues with this boom arm:1. It has a built in XLR cable. The cable in my arm was defective and was going in and out regularly. Company wouldn't honor a refund so I just had to trash it for a new one.2. I move my boom arm regularly. Up and down when I using / not using the arm. Due to it's weight it kept shifting and disconnecting from my table.I bought a new boom arm and it's great.
5,I have no regrets buying this even though it cost a fortune to ship to Qatar. Spend wise spend once.
3,Was hoping this would give me more mounting options and better reach than the Blue microphone arm but didn't feel nearly as well built as the Blue model.  I'm going to stick with the Blue option for now.
3,The stand is built pretty well besides the screws that I had to screw-in to make it more sturdy its a good microphone stand for any low-end microphone. However for a Rode NT-1 it's not strong enough to hold it. I can't put my microphone any direction but facing down (which is fine) but shows that the strength of the stand can not really hold a microphone that's $400 + and in that range it would be better to go with the Rode Arm. Maybe the stronger version of this is good but I can't recommend this stand for people with Rode NT-1s and microphones of the same caliber.
1,*WARNING: Product causes DAMAGE to your hard earned microphone and desk*I was excited and waiting to start a channel for Youtube that I wanted to do for fun during quarantine. I'm a college student with not that much money but I wanted to purchase something nice so I bought their 130 dollar boom stand. I expected a quality product to come in the mail and was met with massive disappointment.The product that this company sells is a cheap pile of chinese garbage that is NOT worth the money under any circumstances. It is impossible to toy with and get to work it is stiff it is unintuitive it is trash. The only reason someone would buy this product is if they enjoyed throwing away garbage in their freetime. It's quality isn't its worst part though.This product caused scuffed damage to my desk and to my microphone because the thread adaptor got stuck and it was impossible to get out (EVEN WITH PLIERS.) Another result from this product being cheap chinese garbage disguised as a quality product.Do NOT buy this under any circumstances. I contacted the seller and they told me to send their pile of garbage back after I had already thrown it away even after they heard about my damages. (Are you kidding me you want me to walk to the post office and return your product after it caused damages to my stuff?)Horrible seller horrible product do not buy under any circumstances. There is a reason there are a lot of bad reviews I assume all of the good ones are fake. Buy a different boom stand.
2,Had I known that I would not be able to replace the XLR cable without literally cutting it out of the stand I would not have purchased the product. This should be a big disclaimer.Secondly the springs in this stand are if very low quality. Avoid the hassle and spend the money on a boom arm that is quality. These are a low quality headache and not worth the money.
5,Absolutely rock solid mount that keeps your mic where you want it. I have it mounting a Shure SM7B and it produces no vibration on movement or readjusting during our YouTube shows or podcasts.The integrated XLR cable is a bonus as well and plenty long enough to make it the soundboard.
5,Handles a heavy mic like the Shure SM7 with ease. Easy to install as well. The only con is that there is no counterbalance weight on the adapter where it attaches to the desk so if you want to use the clamp mount it has a tendency to jiggle loose if you are aggressive with the arm. If you are easy and careful with the arm this issue doesnt exist.
5,Does what it is made for well.
5,Very sturdy mic mount flexible and durable.It looks great as well.After buying one for myself I ended up buying two more for my guest as well since this mount is the best way to fix the issue of people talking to far away from the mic.A bit pricey but one of those items you buy only once.
5,Love the arm sturdy with Shure SM7B.  However the Silver XLR was contrasting too much so I heat shrunk a black sleeve.  If this bothers anyone else order some 3/4" Heat Shrink and cut small piece and now XLR matches Mic.  Here is what O used - : DOUBLESTAR 4 Feet I.D Polyolefin 2:1 Heat Shrink Tubing 20mm(3/4in) 25mm(1in) 30mm(1.25in) 35mm(1.4in) 40mm(1.5in) 50mm(2.0in) (20mm(3/4in))
5,I'm not sure why there are many reviews saying there is problems with the tension and tightening. I am guessing you need a professional mic with considerable weight to counter balance the gas spring. In any case it works perfectly with my RE-20. With very very few adjustments out of the box it holds my mic perfect and goes in any direction and stays put without needing to tighten anything after the initial tweaking of the joints. Exactly what i was looking for!
5,I've never had a boom arm quite like this one.  I've always used the ones with the external springs that squeak and make noise if you accidentally touch them.  It was odd getting used to the fact that the knobs are to set TENSION not POSITION but once I got past that this thing is amazingly well constructed and works great!
1,I really wanted to like this stand because it looks premium and is solid. Unfortunately that's where the pros stop. This mic stand had a horrible ground loop noise when turning up the gain on my audio interface (same results even on new replacement). To diagnose this I used a cheap Amazon XLR cable attached to a $50 Neewer Microphone Desk Stand all going to the same audio interface. The neewer stand and  Amazon XLR cable had NO ground loop noise while the Gator Frame Works did.Here's my setup:Focusrite Scarlett SoloCT-1 Klark teknik Microphone Preamp (MIC BOOSTER CT 1)Shure SM7BThis may work for others with a different audio interface or Preamp Mic activator but it definitely has issues with my setup.A few things to note:- I have grid supplied electricity that is stable and clean (low THD)- Platinum 1200 watt corsair power supply- Premium Asus motherboard Video cards (SLI) and Samsung Evo SSDs. No issues with PC at all- Noise obvious when mic gain turned @ 75% and headphone volume at 50% or greater. It's audible and lower volumes but less obvious.Hopefully this will help anyone that may have already purchased this stand and are questioning whether they have PC issues. I'm certain that there are costly methods of correcting the noise; however doing so has no ROI so using the cheaper mic and stand is a much better solution.
2,Purchased New and received a Used one. Box was taped all around. Their is clear wear marks at the base of the boom arm even before installing and light scratches all around the boom arm
3,The clamp wasn’t designed for the weight of this one so every once and awhile I have to battle to remount the arm mid stream.
5,Great product don’t waste your money on cheap versions
5,owo
5,Got this in a pack with my new mic and it adjusts super easy with an included allen wrench.  Very sturdy no wobble at the base of my desk no sag with a decently heavy mic and honestly I wasn't expecting it to look so nice.  It's very nice
5,This is a great product. I'm so happy with the purchase. It's durable solid and it stays easily in place when it's positioned and the knobs are tightened. I love having the XLR cable run through the arm itself as well. Wish I bought it sooner.
5,My microphone is pretty heavy and this are holds it well.
5,Works very well there is a xlr on the inside so it looks clean and is very convenient. Great purchase!
1,Do you want a good desk clamp stand?  Look anywhere else.  It's noisy about as mobile and flexible as a dying slug the parts have a 50/50 chance of either working or being a complete failure (My desk clamps top hole was so small I couldn't even fit the pole in it entirely removing the point of a desk stand) and my air conditioner on low was wobbling the actual stand.  If your metal stand is falling apart to the extreme adversity of a light cool breeze your product sucks. I wouldn't even use it if this was free.  You'd have to actually pay me to use it.Waste of money and time.  I am returning for a refund.
2,Design is a great idea unfortunately the unit I received is either manufactured badly or something. The cable came in pinched and torn as if it was run over by something and the arm itself will not fit into the clamp base right out the box. There is a black sleeve on it that I only assume is an adapter because when I took it off (extremely hard to get off tight and rugged fit) the metal stem is left and is way too skinny for the base. The screw down clamp won't even reach the metal stem. So now it's just floppy and insecure in the clamp base. (Very uncomfortable feeling with any decent mich attached to it)  I tried to get a replacement sent out but there is no option for replacement only refund.  🙃 huge waist of time and money. Thanks. Do better than me and just something else. Rode PSA1 OR BLUE COMPASS.
1,What an absolute piece of junk.  I took a risk buying this over a YellowTech Mika boom arm and regretted it within minutes of setup.  The spring loaded arm is aggressively tightened with no way to adjust tension. when one of the three joint knobs are loosened the boom arm aggressively flings back to a fully extended position. To tighten the boom in place you must exert a tremendous amount of force (twist of hand) to the point of pain to get it to hold without movement.  With the three joints tightened so much just to keep it in one position it is therefore impossible to grab the boom or mic and adjust it freely as you can with other professional booms.  a knob must be loosened the mic adjusted and the boom fully re-tightened (wear gloves it will hurt to tighten!). Also be careful and watch your face when you loosen one of the joint knobs it will SNAP back up aggressively even with a heavy mic attached.The desk mount provided is very cheap. if you tighten its knob to the desk with the force of HULK it will still slide around the surface as if its laughing at you.This unit needs a complete re-design (maybe with real-world use as a guide).It will be immediately repackaged and sent back as a return.  Time to fork out hundreds more for a YellowTech fthat actually works as needed in a professional environment.
3,Had high hopes for this arm turns out to just be another expensive arm with not much value. You cannot change the XLR cable that is inside of the arm and while using it I experienced some interference. The joint at which the mic is being held cannot do a full 180 degree rotation because of the way it is built meaning you can't have the mic in a complete upright position.Overall not worth it for the money. Find a RODE PSA1 or a Yeticaster.
2,For advertising that it would be good for a shure sm7b is a complete lie. Only if you get an extended rod would this work good. The very large xlr plug they use will only allow your swivel halfway around meaning if you want this to have more of a straight angle you are very limited in the range of motion. Easy fix would be to manufacture with a smaller xlr plug but I suppose forcing people to buy an extended rod on top of an already hefty price tag is the way to go. That isn't even talking about the absolutely horrible clamp it comes with. You will be constantly tightening the clamp I ended up using the desk screw mount.
2,The boom arm is fantastic feels good don't get me wrong. But after two weeks my boom arm's XLR cable got damaged somehow on the inside and kept producing static noise up until nothing was being transmitted. This was later confirmed by me plugging in a seperate XLR cable which made my mic sound so much clearer. You CAN NOT replace the XLR cable on the 3000 model - Do not buy it (This is critical and I found it the hard way). I will be returning it.
5,These are outstanding! Quite movement low noise and vibrations from the table and sturdy.  It’s everything I look for in a professional stand. The friction slip pivot joints take a little dialing in and they tend to favor a heavier mic. Overall great product; well done Gator.
4,Working good and i like the size
5,finally something flexible and easy to set up. ALSO IT HOLDS A Shure SM7 perfectly. i havent had a good stand for this mic for so long. feels great to not have to think about it ever again. Gator always makes solid products so im not surprised by this but i am excited to tell you it's worth your money.
1,I was looking for something sturdy and started with the 3000. There wasn't a place for a pop filter so I returned it. I guess for podcasts people use the SM7B so I get that but I want to attach a mic for recording. For the 4000 the pieces didn't fit. There is a sleeve on the stem of the arm that prevents the arm from fitting into the desk clamp. If I remove the sleeve the stem is loose in the desk clamp. There is an extension to which I wanted to attach the pop filter but the extension did not fit the arm's thread. For the 4000 I did get a refurbished one from Amazon so it may not have had the correct parts. I wanted to like this but there are no instructions and the pieces in the box do not fit. I'm returning the 4000. I ordered a different arm from Blue and will see if that works.
2,I was satisfied with this for about a year but yesterday the built-in xlr cable no longer had a clean connection. I'm sure that part is my fault but since it's not designed to have the cable replaced I had to attach the replacement cable to the outside myself.Seems like a pretty glaring flaw if you do anything that might wear the xlr connection like moving it around or changing the mic. My next boom will allow the cable to be changed.
5,Super awesome mic stand- essential for daily video calls podcasting etc .... what a durable and awesome looking mic stand.  If you have a great mic and need a desk stand this is exactly what you want!
1,It can barely hold my Neumann in it's shock mount. It's not sturdy or easy to use the metal thing broke on the first day. Confusing setup. Just bought a replacement for $20 that holds more weight. Not worth the money much cheaper better ones available now
5,We have 3 of these. Used on a daily basis for online music lessons and production for podcast and broadcast. I sent two previous ones back. Gator has always been a brand I trust on the budget side of things. This is their lightest weight most budget-friendly version. I wouldn't go any cheaper than this. Only time will tell in regards to longevity. So far so good!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It's perfect!Doesn't hurt the microphone when you move it.You can adapt however you want when you play your assignment/GameConsJust buy a separate stand it should fix it moving.
1,Like many others have written the metal stem on the bottom of my boom arm doesn't fit the clamp it's a little bit too thick and won't go in. The stem has a sleeve on it which I presume is to give the clamp screw something to attach onto. If I remove the sleeve then the stem is too thin in the clamp and the screw doesn't even reach it so it's not held in there at all. It's just rattling around loose. This is the "Professional" 4000 series. As it stands it's a $150 useless piece of metal and I'm sending it back as faulty. It doesn't instill much confidence in the quality control.
2,Paid extra for this podcasting boom to light up to show that the episode is on air. Only to find out it can with the power cord completely cut and the piece missing to facilitate that function of the added expense.
5,Works perfectly. Couldn’t ask for a better stand.
5,Bought this as a replacement to a pathetic mic stand I had prior. It was quick to setup and added so much legitimacy to my Podcasting Workflow. I love it and highly recommend it.
1,EDITED:As I have feared this product's critical flaw is the poor quality cable included. After less than week of owning the arm the integrated cable has totally broken. Not worth returning the entire arm (especially without the original packaging...) but a shame to see the cable so poorly designed.Original:I've had this stand for only a week but here's my preliminary review:The joints on the arm are solid much better than the very cheap joints found in low-end scissor arms.  They can be tuned finely enough to allow the microphone to move when pushed but otherwise stay very rigid. No complaints on any of the quality for the arm.The packaging experience was weird -- one of the tension knobs was fully unscrewed and floating in the packaging loose. Getting these on isn't super easy since you have to apply enough pressure to get the screw to thread but not too bad.The included cable is nothing special and not user-serviceable for the most part. My XLR cable didn't come with fitting gaskets on the connector so I got some weird static effects on the cable until I added one. Would have been nicer to see more priority put into a high quality connector since it's not serviceable.
3,The cable to the mic is not very good. If i so much as touch it there is a lot of input that goes through the mic and is deafening. My $15 boom arm had a better cable and connector. Other than that everything is as advertised and seems to be high quality.
5,Sturdy as heck. 200$ for a product that works as intended no questions asked. Unlike similar products that claim to hold up heavier mics for 120 really don’t like the color blue to much 😉😉😉
3,Bought it because of WFH not a heavy user broken after 8 months not recommend!
5,Got this mic stand for causal gaming and it works great. There were no instructions included in the box which wasn’t a problem for me because I had prior knowledge of this kinda stuff but it would be nice for someone who didn’t.
1,It looked nice and has a bunch of good reviews and after getting it I can only assume there are a bunch of bot reviews for this.- The desk clamp couldn't hold onto a piece of candy if a premature baby was trying to take it let alone keep the thing steady on my desk when I'm trying to adjust it.- The flexible parts of the boom are made of cheap plastic and the seems split when you put any stress and pressure.- Oh and let me tell you about stress and pressure you need hulk strength to turn the adjustment nobs where as soon as you unlock it the arm will try to fling itself to its fully extended position(be careful not to lose a few teeth).- It does not "free float" as in I cannot push the mic away when I don't need it and pull it to me when I do instead I need to wrestle with the adjustments whenever I need to do that or try to force the mic to move which will cause the desk clamp to just slide off causing the boom and your expensive mic to fall.
2,The arm itself seems pretty well made but the design they have chosen that clamps onto a desk is very subpar. I found that instead of the swivel moving above it when I tried moving my mic the clamp was actually coming loose from the desk instead. Not only is that annoying but it could easily drop your mic if you aren't looking for it. Beyond that there is a ton of wobble in the "joints" of this arm. Something I would expect from a $30 purchase not a $130 one.Very disappointed. I'll be sticking with my other $60 arm until I can find another decent boom stand.
4,Escritorios mas descongestionado y mayor flexibilidad en mi escritorio
1,The arm is nice and looks great in a set up but is impractical and doesn't have great movement. I have an issue where mine constantly can't handle the weight of the SHURE SM7B mic and constantly falls on my desk which never happened with the older models. No matter how tight loose or change in direction the arm just falls. So I'm having to use the mic arm half laying on the desk and half up. For the amount it costs I would go with a regular arm or the one model prior as the only difference is the small LED light.UPDATE: the weight that it can support is just so little. It's terrible. Will be buying something new
5,Versatile and strong. Holds my SM7B in a isolator up perfectly with no sag or need for readjusting.This is a set it and forget it type not a easy swivel type.
5,Very good at keeping shape takes a little time to get some smooth movement. 100% worth.
5,this is a beast of a mic stand with such a clean look as the cable is pre-assembled inside the arm. glad i splurged
1,Wobbly after a while... terrible construction and product integrity...
2,This is super aggravating to use. The elbows have a spring loaded action and you really have the wrestle with them to get them in place. You have to crank the nobs until your fingers hurt and sometimes the spring loaded action will just spring the arm in the opposite direction to where you want it. Honestly feels like you have to wrestle with it. I’m a pretty fit guy who lifts weights every day and wrestling this thing took way too much effort . It’s almost best to just install it and leave it in one place for the rest of it’s lifespan. If you are constantly unpacking this setting it up And then dismantling this between podcasts or recordings... shoot me in the face.
3,Ordered the 3000 series new received product that has clearly been used. In good shape but has marks where screws have been tightened and the screws themselves have had screwdriver use.Added one star for receiving some money back due to its used status.
1,I wanted to replace my Rode PSA-1 after using it reliably for 3 years and saw a lot of people talk about Gator. I got a 4000 model. This thing is absolute garbage. The desk clamp doesn't stay tightened to the desk and wiggles no matter how hard you screw it in. The tension screws get so tight randomly you'll end up destroying your hands. I had to resort to pliers. Trying to adjust the flexibility of the arm sometimes produces a grinding noise. It has nowhere near the level of adjustment and freedom as the PSA-1 does.It is an absolute crime this thing costs $200. Believe the bad reviews. Reinstalling my PSA-1 as soon as I submit this.
5,I use this on my main desk and it is plain AWESOME!  Keeps everything nice and tidy (no messy cables!) is sturdy and it is very stable with the MXL 770 mic and pop filter on it.  Love it!
2,No instruction manual in the box and simple curiosity and a lack of caution led me to break the screw holding the spring basically immediately. Searched for a instruction manual or instructions on the box as thoroughly as I could to no avail and now I’m HOPING i can still get it to be usable. Definitely not worth the money if they can’t spend pennies to make instruction manuals and I can’t figure out the secret formula for the mobility I bought it for. At least I have an overpriced fancy looking stationary boom arm right?
1,The cord gave out and gave a terrible crackle noice through the audio. Once the cord is broke there is no fixing it... you'd have to break it to reach the built in cord. It would be amazing if the cord was replaceable.
5,This is a great product very sturdy very durable very good for my use a very good product
2,I didn’t really care for it. It is always in the way of the camera. I got a low profile stand instead.
5,It's so nice to have a polished setup for corporate zoom chats or discord with your mates or catching up with your mum. Very nice.
1,I am hoping I got a defective product because literally this thing disintegrated in comical almost dangerous fashion. First setup I noticed there was no bend or give at all. I went to loosen a joint and noticed that one of the circular metal joint covers had flown off the side. So I tried to unscrew a joint and it was not wanting to come loose so I tried the other ones. They were the same. So I’m looking around at it and move the joint closet to the mic threading  and the joint popped apart and in a manner. What I assume is that there is a tension cable intended to keep some rigidity. Anyway it burst straight through the gap created between the two pieces making up the middle joint. It was so violent it cut/snapped through the soft plaster that is adjoining the metal spans between the joints.Anyway..... $200 mic arm...... wooo!
2,I wanted to record myself on a grand piano and the range of motion is so small I don't recommend it at all... Build good strength good but I tried this in 5 places and can't use it anywhere! Anyone want to buy it off me?!?
5,I bought it for my new home studio set up and I love it. The cables are hidden which is a big plus it is not the cheapest one but worth every penny.
1,The thing is this isn't a mic stand. It just looks like one. Terrible grip. Impossible to mount securely. Have a flat top desk? It's gonna slide and tilt. Have a desk with round legs? It's gonna slide. Square legs? It's gonna slide and tilt and the legs better be narrow but it won't matter because of the aforementioned terrible grip.Even if you manage to miraculously mount it to your desk the range of motion is poor and it won't hold any adjustment. No matter how much you tighten it anything short of straight vertical placement is going to fall down.Waste of money. Invest elsewhere. .
2,1. A $30 Boom Arm is packaged more professioy than this $200 professional item.2. Item received was obviously used.3. It’s impossible to adjust the knobs to tighten or loosen the joints. Even when Ive fastened the joints every segment still felt springy and flimsy. It’s also impossible to adjust the segments to desired length and angle.4. Overall the item wont hold its place even when everything’s tightened.5. Not a professionally-made product.
5,Light is bright and wide. great for my workshop
1,I bought this product 2 years ago. The first one lasted about 16 months before the tension metal broke unexpectedly causing the arm to stay limp.I bought a new version 6 months ago and it has already malfunctioned; there is static in microphone every time I move the boom.Would not recommend this product to someone for this price. You are getting a bad product that only lasts 6-18 months.
5,Es muy bueno solo le falta tener un poco de mas movilidad
5,Honestly only complaint I have is it was very stiff when I first got it. After a couple of days of using it it loosens up. 10/10 product
5,I love this mount! It is very sturdy and feels like a good quality product. Would 100% recommend
5,Pretty strong and easy to set up. Recommend since it's the cheapest with good quality.
5,i really dig my mic stand stands out from other brands because of its looks
5,The perfect stand I was looking for to pair with my Shure SM7B! Very sturdy!
1,Complete garbage. 'Glued on' labels fell off main spring behind lower joint was either defective and/cheap materials. I bought another $60 product (no names) that works no problems.
1,The screw on the clasp was broken because it could not be fixed with a scuff.
1,Was too stiff and didnt work as intended due to design flaw. Also didn’t like that I couldnt remove the XLR cord. I returned it for a different brand with an excellent range of motion and easy to move up and down and side to side.
5,I'm not lying it's legit the best boom arm for the shure sm7b the perfect weight and blanance 10/10 will buy again
5,This works fantastically for my sure SM7B.
1,Having worked in radio for well over 35 years I have worked with very boom out there. This one would never make it in everyday commercial usage. Too tight not many ways to adjust tension. It takes a lot of force to move it. This would never work in a radio station. Who wants to have a work out moving a mic boom. It should move very easily not requiring a ton of effort. I would recommend more conventional option. Yeah it looks good but that is about it. I can't return now so I am using it for my guest mic which can be somewhat stationary.
5,Looks great! & amazingly sturdy! Another must have 👌🏽👍🏽
5,It is the best product I have bought for the microphoneI recommend for anyone who wants to look professional.
5,Pro quality and great range of motion at a 1/4 of the price of similarly made booms
1,Purchased Gator Frameworks 4000 Series Boom Stand in April 2021 on Amazon for $199. Before resorting to leaving a negative review looked for a way to contact Gator here and on Internet to no avail. Which is another problem in itself. I had a Shure SM7B on the Gator 4000 series Boom Stand when in mid-sentence I heard a click (from the area of the stand base) and the stand collapsed. Luckily I caught it before it hit the studio desk or worse damaged the SM7B. End result am out $199 and have a useless Gator Frameworks 4000 Series Boom Stand. Substandard product + Zero customer support. Buyer beware.
5,Great product for the price overall good sturdy arm.
1,My package came damaged. I had waited more than a few days for it to come in and the box was ripped and I almost sent it back off of that alone. Very confusing to set up with no user guide or anything again my box was damaged so it’s possible that fell out. Overall after setting it up the coolest thing about this arm is the light  and the colors. When moving it around in different angles it seems like the plastic doesn’t want to move easily at one point I thought I was going to break it . After the set up with my mic  and really having it in one position  it’s fine. Not worth the money I spent.
1,I live in Iraq so I thought if I'm gonna buy something to mount my microphone on from the US I might as well buy the best one.I was mistaken.Paid double for it cause it's nice looking and the cable goes though and then paid about $175 extra to ship it and when it came I was excited but wow!the cable was not working I'm not gonna be able to send it back so i used my Own XLR cable looking horribly bad taped outside the metal mount. oh well what can you do?then it started falling a part not even 3 months since i bought it. Knobs falling screws broken.What a waste of money!Don't go thorugh what I went though buy something cheap that actually works.
3,Great boom arm but desk clamp isn’t great
3,I enjoy the mic arm but the mic cable built in has a loose connection to the mic.
1,The knob broke in half when turning it when first attaching to desk. Not well made. Would recommend getting something else.
2,it came missing a tightening handle for the end and almost fell apart within 5 minuets of having together. along with having no way to tell if this is how its suppose to work. also cant aim the mic where i would like due to no lock ring on the threaded end. quality of parts is as expected tho. sadly underwhelmed by it. will probably send it back.
1,Bought it for my studio rebuild.  I didnt install it for 30+ days (after amazon return policy).  Running into my mixpre3 (or any input) the integrated cable has audible hum.  Tried Gator Framework support department but they don't respond.  Beware!
1,I bought this model because I thought the integrated cable would be a convenient way to keep cables organized. I bought a new mic this stand and a mic activator -all brand new -at the same time. When I plugged everything in my mic was still super quiet and I couldn't understand why. I bought a new xlr cable and stopped using the integrated cable and now everything works fine. If you want a mic stand this will do the job but don't spend the extra money for the integrated cable. Because of the design the cable cannot be removed so now I have an extra cable hanging out of the stand.
2,Had to return this.  Doesn't offer full 360 orientation with certain mics and the build isn't quite as nice as I expected.I would not recommend.
1,So many people recommended this thing. The box came and I was all excited. But the arm was not protested at all inside the box besides a thin plastic bag. Just left to get its ass kicked by whichever shipping service decided to put their hands on it. Opened it up and the plastic is really cheap. Also the bottom is super jumpy and I don't think this is right at all. Also there is not enough clearance for cords where the mic and arm screw together. I'll be returning this hunk of crap for sure. So disappointed.
1,• Locking knobs are extremely tight sound like they're grinding and don't actually lock• Metal tubes are supported by plastic ends that stress when you move it around already showing stress marks after a few minutes of use• Desk clamp is unable to tighten enough without sliding off when moving arm and would break if tightened with a wrench• Definitely not something you can adjust while live - way too much creaking• On-air light is silly - doesn't actually connect to anything so you have to turn it on and off manually - what's the point?• Looks and feels like it's worth about $30 maybe
1,The range of motion is absolutely terrible and it doesn't stay in place at all.  It has like one way it can be set up and it's like the worst way to set it up.
5,Excellent product worth the money
5,Nice boom for the awesome Shure MV7 mic
5,yes
5,Muy buena inversión! Funciona muy bien y es bastante estable.
5,Excelente sonido
5,Great seller and great price.
2,The cable connecting the mic to the sound interface was low quality I had to change it but there’s no way without inserting a new cable unless you cut the plugs from each side and then you put them back together. Really inconvenient.
1,I was disappointed with my order the product came with a good packaging but the original box was damaged as shown in the picture. When I opened the product it is broken. Looks like they just sent me a product returned to them and didn't inspect if it's broken or not.
1,So the internal XLR cable is super noisy and it can't be changed out without disassembling the arm and probably breaking something.  The elbow joints are very stiff which is fine once you get everything into position but in order to move the microphone very much you have to loosen the elbows and then they immediately spring out to maximum extension.  The other option is to brute force the elbows into different positions but then the mounting clamp slides around and eventually falls off of the desk.Garbage.  Spend the extra 20-30 bucks and get a different boom arm with a channel for your own XLR cables.  Going to refund this one when my new boom arm arrives.
1,The XLR cables were shot within a few weeks. Waste of money
1,Bought new got an opened box...This is an absolute rip off....I should also point out that the stand itself is non-functional. The center tightening screw does nothing. The springs still move the arm with it tightened completely without breaking it off...For such a heavy mount it also has very little surface area to mount to a desk edge WILL cause damage with long term usage especially with all the struggling you will have with it trying to keep your mic where you want it to be.The irreplaceable cable is also a problem.Overcharging for a used product when selling it as new should be criminal.
1,Literally dead on arrival.  Every single screw and nut were stripped out. The thing looks like it had been ran over. I am now being told that it will take an additional 2 to 3 days for the company that is selling this object to reach out to me to see if they can replace it. Then in turn while it's being returned which will take an additional 2 to 3 days  It's going to take another week for it to be delivered to me.If I could rate this 0 stars I would. I am never doing business with this company again.
2,Although the range of motion is great the mic stand falls apart at random times. I'm always on edge that it will drop my mic.
1,Where it's supposed to tighten to my desk is not tightening so it keeps coming loose. Tried tightening it as much as I can but nothing.
1,The adapter of mic clip is badly designed. It could stuck in your mic clip. If this apply to you don't panic use a coin(dime) and a plier to unscrew it out.Unfortunately I did it too late the adapter is too tight to release. After ruined 6 coins I acknowledged it will never be saved.Good job to ruin my $400 mic. I hope you can fix your cheap part make it worth for your $100+ sale price.
2,I got this today and immediately regret the purchase. The thing is not very flexible doesn't have enough variety of motion for positioning and trying to move the parts around is extremely janky. I would never recommend it and will be returning it.
2,Very Sturdy and good quality.You pay for what you get.It's easily a 4+ if the proper components were sent over.
1,Total garbage:1) the first 3 threads came squashed as the pic shows2) the knops are so dam hard trying to move them hurts your total hand  it eventually got broken trying to get this thing movingWhat a waste of money and time effort bought everything up smb7 cloud lifter and this arm hoping for it to WorkWill have to order another arm for my smb7
1,Check what actual streamers are using for their setups and not this lying pile of garbage. You think your paying for the quality and features of a nice mic stand but it’s a hunk of junk . Super stiff . Hard to use. Causes damage to gear . This is a bait .
1,Right out of the box as " NEW " 3 scratches right in the front that was my 1st red flag..2nd when I plug the XLR on my dynamic mic it was hell of lose it got a big Olay in it that create a weird haze sound..Overall I don't recommend this Boomstand better get a $50 over this.
1,The build on this is cheap. The clamp  mechanism is not sturdy. The XLR cable built into it crapped out within the first month of use. Now I can’t figure out how to disassemble to replace it. It’s essentially unusable which is a shame.
1,Failed right out of the box. Built in cable failed. It can't be replaced.  Should have gone with the exposed cable brands.
1,Why on Earth would you include an XLR cable built into this product? at least if you are going to do this then either make it very high quality or make it able to be replaced. To put a cable that is impossible to be replaced and also crappy quality is just the dumbest decision ever. Trying to look like you have a product that makes things convenient and cheapening out on the ingredient only makes you lose customers.
1,The Stand is alright but you mite as well get the rode psa1 .... to not have  hydraulics  but rather having to tighten each joint is a huge design flaw when compared to what’s out there quality wise.I just order the Rode PSA1Studio mic stand for the same price and now I’m stuck reselling this mic stand. Definitely won’t by gator products again unless it’s a case!
1,Cheaply made flimsy and knobs immediately break upon use. It’s not like I’m some “hard to impress” mic equipment critic either. I just expected the thing to hold a mic without breaking or falling over. Swing and a miss. Will be returning
1,This item is too tight! It is hard to move the joints around. I would look elsewhere for a mic arm. Not even worth $10
1,Just got my stand today and the cable is not working! I'm trying to look for youtube videos on how to easily replace the cable.  Unfortunately no luck!
1,As soon as opened this item and started to adjust the arm angles the thumb tighteners stripped the threads off the screws making the product completely useless. this happened on all 3 locations on the arm. Something that could resolve this issue would be to have longer screws but for how much money I payed for it I really expected better.
1,Clamp shoe buckled under very little pressure and and use. Now the screw has put a hole in the under side of my desk. Can not use anymore and do not recommend it.
1,The screw used to attach to the bottom of the Blue Yeti microphone is not wide enough to catch the threads of said microphone. That's kind of important you'd think they quality test this with proper specs.
1,Buyer beware! I’ve ordered two of these now and both times they are missing the Fixed Mount Hardware.  The mount seems nice otherwise but is useless to me without it.
3,So I don't typically write reviews for products but I recently acquired this stand for my job as I do voice overs for work.  I thought this might help anyone in my product.Pros:-Sturdy-Easy to setup-Large range of motionCons:-XLR Cable is NOT good.  Come prepared to use another cable if you have one or purchase one.  I have to do a lot of post-audio editing because there is a constant buzz with the cable this came with.  Not the biggest pain in the world and my client base likely won't notice due to my edits but it'd save me a BUNCH of time in post.  Once I swapped cables I was good to go.-You cannot easily replace the XLR cable inside thus having to have a weird cord setup if you want to use a better cable.-The screw thread on the little desktop stand was completely unusable wouldn't thread properly.-The felt material on the clamps easily comes off but to be fair could have been from me moving it too aggressively unknowingly.  Not quite sure but something to keep in mind.Overall it does what I wanted it to do but for $130?  I don't know.. I think you can find a better bargain.  The allure of this stand was the built in XLR but if it's garbage and I'm not able to replace it I don't see the point in purchasing this unit if you can find something with a better price.
1,Horrible experience. Came with missing xlr cable! I couldn’t even use it. I returned it same day
5,Nice product but wish there was a physical user guide with the product. I had to search for videos about how to properly install since this is tension-based. Otherwise great product.
1,I do not like the fact that the vendor sold me a broken boom mic
1,This pricey item is another example of Chinese garbage.  Absolute garbage.  The clamp mount bracket broke on the second day as I was tightening it.  The metal bracket could have been snapped in two with the slightest pressure.  Cheap materials cheap construction.A picture is worth 1000 words.
1,This product is terrible. Do not buy
1,Completely dismantled itself out of nowhere falling during a zoom call. Stick to the rode mic stands
1,It broke my mic do not buy this mic
5,Gator makes great gear! And the Frameworks stands hold up to the expectation and high standards. The desk mount is a winner. It's totally sturdy on my traditional chunky desk but also on my skinny modern one. I've used a few mics on it. Works perfectly for speaking into during Zoom lessons and also just right for mic'ng my upright bass and acoustic guitars when doing overdubs. Love it!! Saves me space too. There's always concern about a clip-on desk mount stand popping off but this is solid as a rock.
4,I didn't purchase my unit off of Amazon but rather SweetWater because I had originally purchased the Rode PSA1 (which is the worst boom arm by quality control standards). I had purchased my original PSA1 it was defective. Replaced for a second same issue and went for the Gator FrameWorks since Joe Rogan used it.Pros:- Definitely a superior product to the Rode PSA1 by design and functionality. I cannot believe anyone would choose the Rode PSA1 and hold onto it. Absolutely horrible product.- Hides the XLR cable inside the boom arm- Sleek designCons:- Obviously the ridiculous price to benefit. There are other boom arms out there that must do as well as this one for a better price. I wasn't blown out of the water when spending $120-$130 on my boom arm and using it for the first time.- Is not ideal right out of the box and needs some modifications: (1) If you want to replace the integrated XLR cable with a USB cable you will need to cut out the XLR cable and cut into the FrameWorks boom arm to modify for the USB cable instead. You will also need to do this if the XLR cable ever goes bad or if you want to upgrade to a higher quality XLR cable. This will require the use of a Dremel or similar cutting tool. Don't worry if you do this part right then you will never notice the adjustments that you have to make and will always be able to change out cables when needed. (2) YOU NEED TO LUBRICATE THIS PRODUCT. My God was this thing scratching and creating a lot of plastic dust and debris from use over the last year I have owned the product. I was afraid that I was damaging my product to the point of needing a replacement. I took the product apart entirely and lubed all friction points on the product with clear multipurpose synthetic grease. It glides so much better and doesn't create friction now. It also doesn't create that screeching noise when I adjust it on and off stream. Took about an 2-3 hours of learning how to take the product apart creating the modifications for the new cable greasing and putting back together. What a pain in the a$$!!!All in all this is still a really good product since there really isn't a whole lot of great options on the market. I strongly recommend that Gator makes the proper modifications to this particular model as it is still very sleek and functional by design. I am just not sure where their heads were when integrating a permanent cable into the product. This is similar to the auto industry where vehicle parts can be proprietary and it is difficult to work on your vehicle without the proper tool for the job.
1,Looks really nice but bad quality screws. One of the tightening wheel thingies broke in less than a month.
1,It came without the thread for a microphone. Can’t use it.
1,They sent a used mount. The cable didn't work
1,It's sad when you buying new product but receiving used.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I don't think mic stands are supposed to sound like this.
1,within one month of owning this mic stand the cable stopped working and now only works if i hold it in a specific position (kind of like the crappy iphone chargers that stop working after a while). it worked great before that but now its useless. there's no way to fix it because its attached to the stand so you'd have to buy an entire new stand to fix it. the seller should rep[lace the stand fi this happens but havent heard from the seller so good luck if you buy this youll be disappointed.
1,I had to order this item twice since the first time they did not ship it. After a long time fiinally I got it. But such disappointed! There is a small damage see the pic 1. Ok I can take it even if I am not happy. But then there is no desk mount! How can it stand on a desk? Do I have to hold it?! I don't know what these two parts are see the pic 2. But there is no mount!
4,If you plan to use an XLR microphone with the “Fixed Internally Guided 10’/3. 05m XLR Cable” then this is an absolutely fantastic boom arm.On the other hand… if you didn’t realize the XLR cable was routed through solid holes and isn’t designed to be removed at all then this may not be the boom arm you’re looking for.To take it a step further the user can’t route other cables inside of it either. So although the built-in XLR cable is fully concealed any future cable management is impossible.I bought this from Guitar Center yesterday and will be returning it.
1,Spot the differences - it's a 1:1 copy of the luxurious K&M 23860 microphone arm. Down to the retainer brackets and section shapes. It just breaks if used. Buy the real thing.
2,I liked the look of this boom arm and I've typically been satisfied with Gator products. Not this one. The advertising boasts that the clamp for the arm has a dual position feature as if it can be mounted vertically (to a squared table leg for instance). This is false. Due to the angle the arm sits in the clamp it cannot be used that way at all. When you use it in the regular postion on the edge of a desk the weight of the boom arm/mic are positioned OFF the desk so it's constantly bouncing and requires frequent readjustment and re-tightenting. Finally the permanently installed mic cord which cannot be changed is highly susceptible to interference. I havent taken it apart to view the shielding but it's no star-quad and I suspect the shielding is not braided. If you have this thing anywhere near a power supply you'll have interference. All in all for the price this was a big disappointment. I bought it long before I needed it and by the time I realized its issues it was too late. I wish I returned it right away.
3,So I've used Gator stands for a long time as a performing musician as well as studio work. As I work from home my last cheapy boom stand broke so I thought I'd go a bit more quality to hold my Shure SM7b.  I'm about to throw down my experience this far:1) Whenever the package arrived the box was damaged by USPS and I thought for sure pieces would be missing but alas everything was there and everything looked just fine.2) As I unpackaged everything the boom stand is held together compactly with two supplied velcro straps that you can use later to secure cables.  Here's where it gets interesting.I was unaware as there was zero warning or instructions that this boom stand is freaking spring loaded ready to take out everything in it's path whenever you take off the velcro straps.  The top boom arm sprang out violently with such speed that it broke my $300 monitor on my desk. I fear that if my 2 year old daughter had been standing next to me it would've injured her pretty badly.  There should've been some kind of warning to hold the arms in place as you release the straps. Now I'm down a $300 monitor.3) It is indeed sturdy.  It holds my heavy SM7b like it was made specifically for it. It articulates well and silently. Wherever I put the boom it stays.I gave it 3 stars due to the weaponized practical joke-like sping-loaded arm with zero warning. Otherwise it's a good quality product.Just don't loosen the velcro straps in you're around anything you value; people places or things.
2,I've had the whole arm with my SM7B fall about three times the first week of ownership.  The clamp just somehow isn't strong enough to keep the stand in place and moving the boom acts as a lever against it.  I had to remove it from my desk and mount it to a TV tray next to the desk with a 20 pound weight on it to keep it from coming off.  I had the whole thing come off in my hands during a meeting.  Not cool.  Also you can't really move it up and down or in and out without adjusting the knobs or applying undue pressure to the base triggering a dismount from the desk.  I've ordered a RODE PSA1 base from RODE because I've heard the stand will fit into one of those.  This is so much less of a mic boom than a PSA1.  Only get it if you intend to keep it in place or can rotate the thing completely out of your way and have an easy flat desk to attach it to.  If you don't have to adjust it it might work for you.  If you expect it to operate anything like a PSA1 that's fully adjustable on the fly don't kid yourself.  The captive unreplaceable cable is good and tested well for noise but it's also got an ugly steel-colored XLR shell which looks awful against a black stand with a black mic.  Over-priced under-delivering.  I really only just like the way it looks because it doesn't look like a lamp stand.  Good news is you can clamp it down so it will stay in the shape you want it but if your posture changes you have to use two hands to move it around carefully and hope it doesn't pop off the desk.
2,Out of the box it looks stellar. Very clean and feels like it's built well in your hands. My issues are that the locking mechanisms seem to be inconsistent as in I twist the lock into place and the plastic around it seems to bulge but the arm is still loose. It creaks if I move it droops and the LED stopped working on day 2.I wanted to love it but I feel as if I got a $20 experience on a $200 arm.
5,Essentially the best deal on the market locks at all positions streamlined good looking absolutely perfect.
1,It is utterly absurd that the built in cable cannot be removed from this product and a complete deal breaker.How this thing ever got to market despite this incredible oversight is incomprehensible to me. It is the OBVIOUS first concern anyone would have other than maybe... "will it hold my mic?"Somebody was probably fired over this.Don't buy it.
5,Worth the money! This Boom arm is a sturdy & quality product!  Very happy with my purchase & would highly recommend!
5,This thing features an all metal body and is absolutely rock solid! I genuinely feel like I could mount a whole camera right with cage monitor batteries & lighting on this thing no problem.  the included XLR cable is a nice touch and an added bonus is that the desk mount isn't one of those drill through you desk types. It's just 3 smaller screws meaning you could easily fill & fix those holes if you had to. This mount is beefy works great and looks great doing so.
4,You can do better with less money
1,Not worth the money. More affordable options. It malfunctions on me now. Bought it a few months ago.
5,Great product and came in a timely manner!! It comes with the mic cords so you don't need to order that separately!
5,I don't think the people with negative reviews understand how to use this product. It is extremely sturdy and I would even suggest it is overbuilt for what it is. If you don't loosen the knows before making adjustments sure something could break but that's why there are adjustment knows. It holds all my mics perfectly and has pretty good range of motion. The XLR cable is decent quality. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Looks and feels premium. Adjustable articulating points makes for a great product!
5,This is a nice boom. I bought this to replace my old $20 spring scissor arm. That thing squeaked and creaked whenever i moved it and it kept getting lose so i'd constantly have to tighten it.There are several reviews trashing this one and maybe they got a defective unit. Or maybe they are some kind of super professional or something who notices tedious things. This thing is great for my needs. It's quiet it's sturdy it looks nice. I like the built in cable although it would be nice for it to be accessible and replaceable. As for the bad reviews I don't really believe you are going to get a noticeable cut in sound quality from this cable compared to any other cable. I don't really fall for all that "monster cable" scandalous nonsense. But if this one were damaged it would be nice to be able to stick a new one in without buying a whole new boom.
5,love the way it adjusts. So much easier than the spring loaded kind.
5,This mic stand is awesome. It's thick sturdy and definitely can hold up my shure sm7b with no problem at all. The built in xlr cable is good too though longer than I need that's still alright with me. The value for this mic stand definitely matches the price tag.HOWEVER the packaging for this mic could and should be better. The box that arrived at my doorstep was beat up with one end just barely covered by tape. If the box is cheap then the company should at least insert some foam or something to keep the mic inside from rustling around while in transit. That's all I've got to say. Otherwise great product!
5,I read a lot of reviews that’s were somewhat negative. I very happy with it does what it’s intended to do. I haven’t had an any issues with it. I do like the aesthetic on this type of arm. Sturdy easy to move around stays where I want to stay. Great product.
1,Amazon suggested it with a UCB mic but the built in wire doesn't work with a UCB mic. So the stand might be fine but Amazon's recommendation is very poor.
5,hardware wasn't included in the first package but they quickly sent a replacement package free of charge.
5,I like the design and the sturdiness. the good part is XLR Cable comes with this.
5,Robust mix stand with integrated cabling. Down side is it does not have access panels to run additional or new cables. Only had for 4 months but great so far.
5,One of the best boom arm in the market. My two annoying protest is that you need to set up your mic position before recording because it squeaks really bad. It does holds the position you put it in and does not move! And my second protest is the desk vice seems a bit small. But besides that it is strong and looks amazing!
5,It’s really nice I’d go so far as to say one of the best. Nice design isn’t a pain in the ass to move around snakes the xlr cable through itself and even comes with a second mount you can screw into something with if you’d rather drill your boom arm into your desk or something. BEST PART? No squeaking. So many boom arms I had squeak so much.My single complaint is the price but I guess that’s the price you pay these days for something that’s actually gonna last.
5,We have an acoustic band that practices at my house. My "place" is on the couch. Previously I used a traditional floor stand and boom to hold my mic but it took up floor space so I bought this on a whim to see how it would work out. It's perfect! I have it clamped to the end of my coffee table. Frees up space but more importantly holds my SM 58 perfectly. Easy to adjust allows me to move the mic wherever I want it and stays wherever I put it.
4,The adhesive padding on the desk clamp was put on incorrectly and is misaligned. Not a huge deal but for the cost of this product something as simple as placing an adhesive makes me think where else were corners cut? Ive mounted it and it’s my first day so far so I will update my experience with it.Looks great and feels sturdy! Went from a 50$ Newwer boom arm and the comparison is laughable. It has a clean aesthetic with the xlr cable being routed inside of the boom arm. Would definitely recommend.
5,After much research I decided on this mic stand for my Shure and it's a perfect fit. The comment about it springing too much or not enough is easily neutralized if you adjust the tension knobs just a little. When set properly which takes seconds there is neither too much nor too little tension. Perfect!Even better is the fact that the clamp-on base is very sturdy and durable. There's also a screw-on base for more permanent installations. The boom arm is solidly made and I expect it will last quite a while.
2,As the most expensive boom they offer I expected better workmanship and quality. We constantly have the microphone cutting out due to the cable and to put it into perspective we are using SM7B's. Already had to return one because a nut and bolt had stripped upon first use. Idk what to say. I bought them because they look like the best on the market. That being said I expected a lot better.
5,I bought this to replace a scissor stand I had been using for 5-6 years that had become extremely squeaky and I wanted to try something new. It is dead silent it holds more weight in the correct position and doesn't reposition with small bumps all positive. only downside is that once you get it in place you do have to loosen up the knobs to get it to move at all. if that's a positive or negative that's up to you.I used to essentially collapse my scissor mount back near the base when I wasn't using my mic now I lift this stand up above my monitor. both options are out of the way but the scissor mount took up less space with the instant move out of the way vs the gator arm which requires you to either mess with the knobs for 45s or just move it slightly out of the way or up high in the air.overall product is silent holds my mic well the cable doesn't produce any noticeable noise when compared directly to my more expensive cables and looks nice (in my opinion). That being said personally I probably would go with a scissor mount over this for pure convenience sake.
1,I love the mic stand and agree that there seems some unfair comments regarding flimsiness and quality...However my overall rating of one star reflects seller:Amazon selling me an open-box item as new. Items in box were not in their plastic packets and unwrapped and main boom show definite signs of use (see attached picture.)Not impressed.
2,El material del boom de micrófono es muy bueno se siente resistente. El inconveniente es la poca flexibilidad y dureza para ajustar la posición es muuuy duro para posicionarlo para flexionarlo debes ajustar las perillas de los brazos. Para el precio sí esperaba el tipo de material de fabricación y también esperaba flexibilidad y facilidad lo cual NO cumple. Mi recomendación para este precio sería buscar otro tipo de boom distinto.
4,I took a chance and bought a warehouse deal (cosmetic damages but works as new) - which turned out to be false.  One of the adjustment knobs was stripped.  Easily fixed with a butterfly nut but not as sexy looking as the original part lol.  Beyond that this is super sturdy very quiet looks amazing and holds both my TLM 103 and my RE320 with no issue!  It's the first stand I've had that holds the shock mount for the RE320 nice and tight too!
1,Figured I'd get a deal with Amazon Warehouse Deals as they have been a great way tosavea few dollars.Opened the box expecting the 3000 Series and to my surprise found a 1000 Series. Even worse no cable.Like are you serious did they even check the item when it was returned? :/Super disappointed by Gator Frameworks and their  Desk-Mounted Broadcast Microphone Boom Stand for Podcasts & Recording (GFWMICBCBM3000).
5,This Mic arm is the best one I’ve had yet. It’s super sturdy very flexible as well you can put it anyway you want. 10/10 do buy this arm. The price is a perfect fit!
5,Comme support à microphone professionnel.  100%  satisfait répond parfaitement bien aux besoins et aux attentes
2,Not happy with the product It either springs up all the time or is too stiff to move there’s no in between with adjusting the joint tension
4,Very solid boom stand. I know this may sound obvious but just be care not to place your palm on the middle hinge when articulating the arm upwards - that can hurt a bit trust me.
5,Worth the money. I used to hook my Shure sm7b microphone
4,Excelente material y calidad pero solo recomendado si no vas a estar cambiando constantemente su posición o si no vas a llevarlo a varias partes.
5,Streaming
5,Ce produit est de très bonne qualité le câble xlr glissé dedans est vraiment pratique est esthétique le bas respire la solidité je recommande vivement.
5,I used to use a cheap boom arm with external springs. It was quite light and the connections were poor quality.I did some research (mostly YouTube reviews) and the Gator Frameworks boom arm looked like the one for me.It is far superior to my original cheap boom. It's longer quieter sturdier and looks better. It has an integrated XLR cable which is great because I was about to spend €20 on another cable.It comes with 2 desk mounts - one is a C clamp that's the one I'm using and it's very solid. The other is circular mount that screws into the desktop - long screws are provided. I haven't used it but I'm assuming the quality is as good as the rest of the kit.Overall this is a high quality mic boom arm well worth the money in my opinion.
5,J'adore ce pied je l'ai acheté pour y fixer un Micro Sure special podcast pour mes cours de piano et chant et mes concerts et interviews en live stream et cela a changé ma vie et mon experience en terme d'organisation de gain de place de precision sonore. Top!
5,🤷🏼‍♂️Good enough for Joe Rogan good enough for my own TrueHouse livestream YouTube channel.The Gator FrameWorks mic boom arm is WICKED. Aesthetically & ergonomically spot on.You'll find a tad more range of motion on a Blue Compass or Sontronics but this thing ROCKS!!!The XLR (nice & long/) routing inside the arm is a really nice touch normally reserved for MICA YellowTecs (pricey)... The ONLY mic arm I'm after next is the low profile OC WHITE beauties. But this Gator FrameWorks is DEFINITELY worth £120 which is exactly what I paid for it. Came from 'Merica in 6 days - RAPID. I'm super happy. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
5,No estaba seguro si pedir esta serie o la siguiente; finalmente puedo decir que en calidad precio es el mejor sin duda. Me fascina su movimiento y su firmeza. Recomendado
5,This is perfect for SM7B Mic. I would say it’s tailored for SM7B. Sturdiness is what matters as the mic itself is quite heavy so the desk mount does the job perfectly.
5,Really good robust mic stand if its a permanent fixture then you can screw the base onto your desk which gives it that 100% sturdy feel
1,I use this boom arm for a weekly podcast. After just five months there was a seriously loud feedback noise and as the cable runs through the centre of the boom arm I can't replace the cable. Very annoying and disappointing not to be able to get help!
3,I am pretty disappointed in that mic arm. I mean it feels sturdy not cheap. Once place it barely wobbles if you shake the desk. My Shure mic and did not move much or fall to the weight. However the cable is too much in the way and unable to move it so to have the best "cable management" as possible. The Cable is also extremely long again if it's what you need you'll be okay but the fact that i can't chose and unable to move it around is a big downside for me. It would have been better with a compartment that you are able to adjust how much cable you need therefor making it easier on cable management. Second reason why i wouldn't recommend the mic arm the fact that the mic arm is not height adjustable makes it almost impossible to place it exactly where you want especially if you have limited space. I had tried to place it over my screens but it didn't have enough height (my screen are not even at the height they should be)The head of the mic arm is also only adjustable one way (up and down) it should also be able to rotate this way you can have higher customization to exact placement. For the price point i expected more. If it goes on sale i would recommend but not at almost 200$. So basically i had no way to have it placed to a specific position for my stream. I would recommend the Elgato one (low profile) which has a higher customization for about 35$ cheaper. or the Rode PSA1
2,The XLR connectors used for this are low quality and do not provide a snug fit into the microphone. That caused the contact to be intermittent. As the cable was too difficult to replace without disassembling the boom I had my local audio shop replace the connectors with Neutrix ones and the problem has been solved. Shame Gator cuts corners like this to maximize profits.
5,The arm doesn’t come with a universal shock mount like other cheaper options out there which was a real bummer so make sure you do your research when you purchase your specific shock mount for your particular microphone. Other than that this beautiful strong Microphone Arm is really practical for anyone’s set up. Looks especially good on camera. Moving and adjusting the arm by twisting the knobs is NOT as “annoying” or “time consuming” some other reviewers are making it out to be. All in all I had a great experience and will be purchasing several more for my podcast. They even sell a bag that holds six or so mic arms in the bag separately on Amazon.

2,I bought this for a new studio setup and it looks great but the XLR built-in cable has a loose connection. Simply touching the housing of the connector causes a lot of static. The mic I'm using is the RODE NTG4+ and there are no connection issues when connected to other XLR cables. The arm moves effortlessly without noise and stays where you position it. I would recommend you check the wire before throw away the box.
5,Es un producto muy rigido puede parecer muy duro de manipular pero su mayor caracteristica es ser rigido y estable para no estarlo moviendo todo el tiempo.
5,Construcción robusta. Lo uso para un mic SHURE MV7. Me gusta que las articulaciones mantienen su posición donde las dejo sin vencerse por el peso del microfóno.
5,Increible resistencia y calidad
1,The first time I got this item I was very confused on why I could not tighten the middle knob when I took a closer look I found that the screw opposite of the knob is turning as I also turned the knob. I attempted to tighten it with a screwdriver but that didnt work eitherSo I talked to Amazon and since they didnt have a exchange feature for this product (weird I know )  I had to refund and buy another one.The 2nd one came and it has the exact same problem..............
5,Honestly was rather skeptical about dropping so much money on a boom arm. But after much internal debate I decided to purchase it. Overall I don't have many cons about the arm just that if you like to move it a lot it tends to un-clamp from the desk. Which makes sense if you move the damn thing A LOT. One night I was gaming and I was moving it around and the entire thing just slides right off the desk like a.. well you get the point. It scared the crap out of me. Other than that I really like the product. Hopefully it won't be squeaking in 9 months.
5,Liked that it is a strong frame and the layers of storing books etc
4,El brazo tiene muy buenos materiales solo que en partes estaba maltratado tambien otro inconveniente era que en la parte del uso ya que no es tan flexible como lo describe y como yo muevo el micrófono no es muy cómodo como es rigido al moverlo se siente que se esta forzando prefiero otros tipos de brazo para la comodidad ya que este me gusto por el aspecto y su reduccion de espacio.
1,1-No es nada práctico2-El cable que tiene es de pésima calidad3-Si quieres ponerle otro cable tendrías que cortarlo y soldarlo ya que lo hayas puesto4- Sin dudarlo lo regresé
5,Excelente calidad. Es rígido y estable. Estéticamente es perfecto. Tiene un aspecto totalmente profesional.
5,I like the stand it works well and is precisely what I was looking for. Good product. The only issue I have is that the box I received was beaten up and everything inside was poorly repackaged.
5,Can't recommend this enough - this thing is rock solid and super adustable. More importantly the swivel action is smooth.
5,What I like: Looks slick with solid frame and internally routed cables. Feel high quality with some strong tension metal arms and the plastic knobs don't feel like they will crack off from cranking a bit. Stays where you put it when you adjust these 3 large tension knobs.What I don't like: Integrated cable functional but would love an option to switch it out. Difficult to unscrew the mic mount if you don't back out the black inner adjustment ring a bit BEFORE installing it. Stand grips the desk well enough if you adjust the swivel tension so it can move freely but stay put. If that top swivel clamp knob is too tight the stand will wiggle free from the desk eventually from moving the arm position.TLDR: I Love this stand and I'd buy it again. It works well and looks great on camera. Easy to overlook the negatives as proper handling and adjustment makes it a perfect stand.
1,The base snapped off in about month.
4,Quite happy with this boom stand. I used a Shure extension for my MV7 microphone.  So far it has been very solid.  My only thing is that the microphone cannot turn left-right once it's tightened.  The arm can swing but hard to turn the mic L-R.
5,PROS- very well build- very sturdy- no problem handling heavy mics like the sm7b- comes 2 diff mounting options- the clamp mount can mount 2 separate ways - vertical & horizontalCONS- Expensive- very expensive- compare to my previous boom arm the thronmax cost about $99 this is very very expensive!
1,Internal cable crackle and broken. thought i could just buy a replacement and u cant change it
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Bought 2 of these one seems to be working fine while the other is now completely useless after the screws on the mounting clamp stripped. Was not using in any excessive manner or handling aggressively. Very disappointed as you would assume a > $150 purchase would last longer than 3 months.
5,When it comes to these desk mic booms it's worth it to just spend the money and get a good one. I've gone through a couple of the cheaper ones and have regretting every one of them. I've had this one for a month or so now and use it almost every day. No problems to report.
5,Easy to setup sturdy and easily supports my heavy mic! Satisfied with this stand and would easily recommend :)
1,Por que viene abierto el paquete. No trae garantía ni las instrucciones de uso. Muy mal
5,This mic-boom is extremely sturdy. The stand allows for two main articulation points and has a mic cable that runs through the boom arm. The quality of this cable is just as good as the Audio-Technica AT2020 Cardioid Condenser Studio XLR cable and have not chosen to replace the cable. The range of motion of the boom arm was my main reason for purchasing due to having a ASUS ProArt Display OLED 4K display that is 32inchs. This boom arm easily reaches above and in front of the monitor without obstructing my view. The boom has a weighted base that has two twisting screws that can been tightened to your desk however there is also other hardware included to screw directly into a wooden desk for example if your desk is too thick. I would recommend this mic-boom to anyone doing any recording dictating or video conferencing.
1,Is crooked and plastic broke on the joint after 3 months of use it was EXTREMLEY stiff and hard to work into place. Hard to tighten not the best.
5,mi a colpito  la sua robustezza e' la qualita' di come e' stato progettato  e costruito ottimo materiale e sopratutto sul movimento veramente nulla da che dire  unica pecca che ho almeno riscontrato io  ma e' colpa del mio tavolo che il gancio non' e' abbastanza largo  ma ripeto e' pultroppo colpa del mio tavolo con il vetro nulla da che dire posso fare solo i complimenti  grazie per il prodotto
4,I believe this microphone will be the last microphone I will need. It does not shake even when I slam the desk. It is incredibly sturdy yet very adjustable. It stays exactly where I put it.I currently have the Amazon Basic's Professional Microphone on the microphone and it is heavy (at least as heavy as the blue yeti). I have total confidence this will hold whatever microphone you may have.My only issue with this product is the integrated XLR cable. Although it makes the microphone setup look tidy I have concerns with wear and tear on the XLR cable. I often swivel the lowest part of the boom arm (this is where the integrated cable exits from) and I think this is probably the most likely part to break. There is no obvious way to remove and replace the integrated XLR cable. However when the cable does eventually break you can always continue to use the microphone arm and zip tie an external XLR cable.
5,Installing this stand was super easy to do. We have two of them in our broadcast studio and they keep the desk clear. The articulation even allows us the ability to keep the mics off screen.
5,A entrega foi rápida e o material é muito bom. Recomendo!
5,Excelente producto
5,I like the build quality and the motion range very sturdy. Happy with the product.
2,Arm is sturdy enough moves freely and works well enough as a stand.  The integrated cable is terrible though. Bad quality popped from day 1 thought it was an issue elsewhere in my setup. Finally changed the cable out today and problem solved. The internal routing for the cable is also in need of a redesign. the gooseneck at the end of the stand can cause the cable to bend sharply past 90°.The arm itself doesn't feel like the cheapest thing out there but unless you're willing to do work permanently mounting it it may as well feel like it with how flimsy the included clamp is. So all in all not at all worth the "premium" there are many other boom arms for sale on amazon I'd recommend saving your money.
1,Voir ci-dessus.
1,The product was fine Frameworks makes a great mic boom...the problem was with the purchase experience.I first ordered this product (series 3000) two weeks ago but was unpleasantly surprised to find they had sent the much cheaper series 2000 which I immediately returned.Fast forward until today when I finally received what I wanted in the first place only to find that the product had clearly been used. There were fingerprints all over the mounting area where the arm attaches to the bracket is scuffed and scraped and the overall condition is disappointing.Had this been a $50 whatever I would probably have just let it slide but I just spent over $160 on this thing...give me a break.Normally I would simply return it again for a refund but I need this for a project right now. Just wanted to express my sheer disappointment.
5,Implemented XLR cable into boom stand could cause a lot of headache if it got damaged. Keep it in mind. Lastly small con screaming brand's names along side of a boom stand.
1,I can't tighten the clamp at all so it's solid because it's stripped and cannot clamp well enough to my desk.
