4,Works with most of my important websites/accounts. The small form factor is nice when I just want to leave it plugged into my laptop while I'm home but trying to get it out is another store very hard to grab and remove. Othewise works just great and  great peace of mind. The YubiKey 5C NFC is much better suited for applications where you want to insert and remove more often. I use the Nano for all the time and the NFC as my backup and travel key.
5,Having used this product for several months I can say this is overall a wonderful security key that easily adds another layer of security to your compatible accounts and devices. I have modified the settings so that my laptop requires the key to log in and enabled multiple other accounts to require the key to log in. For some this may be inconvenient as you are literally required to keep that key with you at all (or most) times but the idea that you don't have to be concerned as much that the chances of your account being compromised is a great mental reliever.If you are the type that wants to boost your security without breaking your bank this product is a great investment! The one thing that I would suggest to everybody is to ensure that you purchase a spare key in case your primary key ends up being lost destroyed damaged or stolen. It definitely doubles the work to initially set up your keys to be registered to your accounts but having that redundancy lowers the chances of you being locked out of your account.
4,The need for two-factor authentication (TFA) is here and now. It is too bad that so many websites and apps are just now developing TFA. I love the idea of a key like Yubikey to help me survive a day at my computer moving from one app to another when I have to TFA for each app or web link. I found it impossible to register my Yubikey even on Microsoft back on March 22 when I purchased it. In August I find that websites and apps are finally catching up and offering more straightforward procedures to register my Yubikey.I look forward to 2023 when perhaps I can use my key for all my log-in procedures.If you are inexperienced plan on a LONG learning curve setting up the key. Once you get your key set up you will love being able to touch your key and be done logging in.
5,It works great for securing my accounts from Google to Coinbase. I feel much more confident in the security of my online assets and accounts. I suggest attaching an Apple air tag because this thing is small and easy to lose.
5,I have watched several videos and online reviews for this product so my expectations were pretty high. But this product really matches and exceeds that expectation as the best 2FA key for anyone out there. It can really level up your security but at the same time to accessible by lots of people.
3,this key idea is great and for most part will work great for 2FA also will work good for encryption if you know what your doing  DO NOT AND I MEAN DO NOT CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH PROBLEMS ON HOW TO SET THIS KEY UP ........RYAN AND MEREDITH HAVE TO BE THE WORSE REPS TO DEAL WITH THEY HAVE A SITE THAT HAS INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SET THINGS UP BUT IT IS SO OUTDATED AND HALF OF THE INSTRUCTIONS THEY GIVE YOU ARE WRONG THEN EITHER OF THESE TWO CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CONTACT THEM IS THE RESPONSE ARE A SERIES OF LINKS SENT TO YOU NONE OF WHICH ARE EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT YOU ASKED HELP FOR  THEN THE ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM IS BY EMAIL DAYS AND DAYS OF EMAIL WITH THEM ASKING REPEATED IDIOT QUESTIONS AND NEVER RESOLVING YOUR PROBLEMSTO SUM UP  GOOD KEY THE WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE OF ALL TIME I BELIEVE THE REPS THEY HAVE WORKING FOR THEM MIGHT JUST BE WALK INS FROM THE STREET TO FILL A POSITION AND THEY ARE HANDED A SCRIPT BOOK TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS THAT MOST TIMES DONT ENEN REFLECT YOUR QUESTIONS  GOOD LUCK WITH YUBIKEY LIKE I SAID IF YOUR SOMEWAHT TECHY YOU CAN FIGURE OUT MOST OF IT  JUST DONT CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE UNLESS YOU WANT A REFUND AND EVEN THEN GOOD LUCK
5,Works as described.
4,There needs to be a way to export the tokens from the key and the OTP's from the app in case of loss and for making redundant keys easily en masse. I understand this poses a certain risk but it needs to happen. Trust the users. Or adoption can't grow in a business setting.
4,I bought this based on its reputation and value for the dollar.  If you need something like a security key you may want to consider another product.  I installed the key per the instructions and had nothing but trouble configuring and using the key.  When trying to uninstall it it refused to do so several times.  Even getting help from the local computer people even they had problems with it.The bottom line is that I would return it except for Amazon and their return windows.
4,Exactly what I wanted however without a hole for a keychain loop this device is easy to lose / misplace.
