5,2022 UPDATE: Just ordered another one for an additional vehicle.These units work very well at "rapid charge" for Samsung S20 and IPhone 13.(earlier UPDATE:)  The replacement works  very well!I have received a replacement no charge from the vendor of this product after a baffling series of problems with the previous example.Both the Galaxy 7 and the Galaxy 10 show "fast charge" with their two respective cables attached and this unit plugged into an "always on" accessory receptacle in our truck.  Rapid charge was completed in about the time the screen estimated on both.Charging two phones at the rapid rate probably comes close to the rated capacity of this unit. But the charging plug barely got warm which tells me there's a good margin of safety.  The metal housing of this charger helps disappate what little heat is normally generated.I have since charged just one or the other of the two Galaxies and there is no difference in charging "time" estmated. This tells me the charging unit is well regulated and capable of its full safely-throttled power to avoid damaging the smartphone.  I would have been concerned if the charging time displayed had changed significantly. A reduction in that time would suggest the charger was delivering higher current (for good or bad) than when both phones were charging.  A significant increase in that time would suggest poor regulation with one phone and marginal capacity if the time were prolonged when trying to charge both phones.Another positive discovery:  This charger does NOT cause interference in my car radio !!!  I have another brand the Skyocean QC 3.0 that generates an audible hash on AM broadcast stations I try to listen to. It also causes enough interference on FM that stations cut out a lot more often when their model is plugged in and I'm driving along. NO such problem with the Ainope.Recommended product.--- initial review follows ---There might be a problem using this product for rapid charge with the Samsung Galaxy models S-7 and S-10.I am prepared to upgrade my rating of this device after testing a second one that's on its way.  The initial example had an intermittent problem achieving rapid charge which is the main reason I bought it.  This unit is supposedly capable of both charging protocols  Qualcomm 2.0 and 3.0.  The technical differences are available in an internet search but for this review just say the older 2.0 standard might be difficult for this unit to deliver.I have two Samsung Galaxy smartphones. Both are "Android" the superior system over Apple in offering a refined fast charge system.  The Galaxy S7 is Qualcomm (QC) 2.0 and the Galaxy S10 is 3.0.  At first I thought perhaps the cable was to blame for being able to get only the regular-rate of charge on the S7 from this product.  But I tried the same cable on a different brand of car charger that had previously worked and indeed the screen told me a rapid charge was underway.I also tested the S10 which uses the newer type "C" connector. on its charging cable. Here the first time I tried it this product successfully delivered a rapid charge but on subsequent attempts I could get only "regular" rate charge.  This suggested the unit not my cables was to blame.  The vendor may have initially used a talking points script (their checklist to tell people regardless of report) to make sure I was aware of cable shortcomings when I already had told them my sequence of testing above.  Eventually they directly discussed my concerns and suggestions.I had learned from a technical source that there are counterfeit chips among many brands of chargers that can imitate some but not all of the Qualcomm features one of which is the backward compatibility of the present-day "3.0" to the older "2.0."  But the Galaxy S7 has sold more than 55 million examples since 2016 according to published figures and I told the vendor of this charger that I would be surprised if I was the first one to notice a problem if a batch of bogus chips had made it to their production line.  So they are considering my initial purchase a possible defect and are sending another.  (Twice they ignored my question about the possibility of bogus chips in their production run.)Will update this review.
5,I had just a little issue with the first changer I received. It happens that some of them are defective. But the company which sold it to me is AMAZING! They were responsive and basically sent me a better version of the defective charger which is perfect! They have earned my business in the future. If they read this review I want to say again thank you so much for being so wonderful!
5,Works a charm and continues to work. Doesn't stick WAY OUT and produces enough amps so Garmin is happy (not an easy thing). Don't know if it would continue to be "ampy" enough if I had another device plugged in but for my purposes it's good.
5,I've been using it for nearly four months and it has yet to fail me. I like that it fits closely and has nice blue lights.
5,Fits compact for closure of lighter lid.Charges quickly for 1 or 2 devicesEconomically priced to meet everyones needs
4,Charger works well but is not as fast as I was expecting.  Also I was surprised by how small this device is.  For my car the small size makes it a bit challenging to plug and unplug the charger.  I may return this to find something easier to work with.  Just be aware that its small size may not work for your situation.
5,This is a GC 3 charger required for fast charging many newer phones.
5,This is exactly what I was looking for. So small in size yet powerful. Fast charging for my s21 ultra. Only thing to note is: use high quality or the original usb C cable.
5,With newer tech with latest fast charging needs this was a good upgrade. In the end when I needed another one I ordered this item again.
5,Heavy duty and will last a while
5,This powerful metal-shell Anope Qualcomm 3.0 quick charger arrived nestled in a plastic shell inside a carboard package.When inserted into your 12 volt power socket it fits nearly flush.If you place your fingernails underneath the USB end you can lift the charger out of the socket.  I purchased this 15 months ago and it is still working fine.Note:  The design on the USB faceplate end of this charger has been improved and does NOT match the old design from early 2021.
5,This is a great charger for a cigarette plug. Plug is being use to charge a Note 20 Ultra and a iPhone fast charging with no issues providing ample power to keep both devices charged while connected.
5,Charges phone while I do uber. All I need. Just make sure you get a good charge cable
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've had this little thing just over a week and it WORKS. It very much works when I'm running late for work and need to top off quickly. My week has been saved from having a dead phone on my way home as well. The compact size is awesome and takes up very little to no space at all. This chargers metal material hasn't gotten hot to the touch (at least not yet) in the week I've had it so durability is questionable.  I'll update this after a month. Doubt it'll break by then.  The blue ring light is cool for late night charges. Easy to find the charging cable. Cable not included *obviously* but here's a link to the one I purchased:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQJZQSY?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_shareThe "worst" problem is mostly how tough it is to remove from the charging port. I'm guessing since it's new and hasn't been plugged/unplugged numerous times it's stiff. Unless you plan on taking this charger between a handful of vehicles it's a pretty great purchase. Even better when the price drops.
5,Very nice
5,So far this has worked perfectly I've tested it in newer model vehicles as well as 23 year old pickup and it works great everywhere. Fast charge and nothing seems to be putting off much heat. It's much faster than the built in USB connection in one of our cars. Getting another for older vehicle that kids are inheriting to learn to drive in.
5,Great product has lasted a long time is durable
5,Good
5,Compact solid and does exactly what it is advertised to do.Also fast shipping
5,It looks good and charges faster than my old charger. Keeps up with power usage of 5g phone.
5,Great fit and finish. Plugs in and stays in place (two ball-bearing pressure points). Plugs in flush so I can close my console without having to remove it!Perfect for rapid charging TWO items at once (if needed). I use this with my iPhone wireless charging pad - the perfect pair!I highly recommend this!
4,it fit nicely into my car.  Easy to use USB ports.  Does as promised in the ads.  Phones charge fairly quick.  As advertised.
4,Will fit tight on your 12 volt socket. Make sure you take of the plastic rapping & pinch side in when installing have not had a battery run down with plug in all the time
5,Received item promptly. Functions as it should no complaints.
5,Works great!
5,Fast charging not super fast charging.
4,So far it does what it says it does
5,It fits tight and sits low flush. It's one of the fastest chargers I can find. I have 3 of these
5,I've bought one of these for all of my cars whether they have USB or not. They are super low profile durable as can be and charge fast and incredible deals as far as I'm concerned
5,Brought one to try out it charges fast so got three more for rest of vehicles work perfect would buy again
5,Small (subtle). LED light to know it’s working. Charges.
5,All metal body is nice! Build quality seems excellent. Best of all it charges my S22 Ultra super quick. I'll be ordering a second one for another vehicle once I'm done writing this review. Just click that buy now button already!
5,Heavy quality made weight like a D battery... Does what it says charges on level of a fast charger without having to get usbc to usbc.... All that can be said lol
3,Since day 1 I had to push deeper the charger every time a pull the cable a little so not the big fan of that after a month I needed to turn the charger until it make contact and started charging so I have to play with the direction every now and then so it keeps charging. It was disappointing since it has a nice design and quality materialsUpdate: They have an incredible costumer service! Definitely I would buy something from them in the future specifically now that I know how much they care about their costumer satisfaction
5,This is an amazing product very quick charge 0 to 80 in 35min
5,Better quality than expected
5,My GS9+ gets about 2.1 amps which has out-performed all other car charges to this point.
5,Like the flush mount and easy of use. Perfect upgrade from the big bulky ones I've had before.
5,Charges my S9 and S10 much faster than any other car charger that I've had. Well worth it.If your charging in your car its because you didnt get enough charge at home and your in a rush...this charger does it.
4,I used the older 4.8 amp version of this and it was starting to get a little tired. When I upgraded to a new (2021 model) wireless charger and a new (also 2021 model) Bluetooth adapter I thought it would be a good idea to get a charger with a little more juice. The old favourite Aniope charger works okay as I said but the LED was getting dim so I figured why not? 30 watts would certainly be enough for a 15 watt qi charger and a Bluetooth adapter right? Not so fast (pun intended)... It seems the QuickCharge 3.x circuitry doesn't seem to get along too well with my devices (that don't use that feature?). I'll be driving along and the charging will stop then restart. A few minutes later the Bluetooth adapter will reset causing calls or music to cut out. Either it's not getting enough juice in "fallback" mode or there's some switching going on between the two that's trying to detect QC that's (obviously) not there. If you plug a phone directly in with the cable it's flawless but that's not what I need for my driving.  I still have the old one for that so I will keep looking. Oddly enough the USB+USB-C (PowerDelivery) port model had the same exact issue. I will end on a positive note: customer support from the company is awesome.
5,Fits nearly flush and the blue glow matches the Ford OEM ports
5,Fast delivery sturdy item
4,Es muy buen cargador. Pero no entró al 100% para mi Rav 4 2007. No le caería mal tapita de plástico para evitar que le entre algún objeto pequeño.
5,Great output for fast chargers
5,This charging port doesn’t feel cheap and it certainly charges my devices much quicker than others I have used in the past. What I really like about it is that it sits absolutely flush in the cigarette lighter socket. No complaints whatsoever. Definitely recommend it!
5,Buen producto!
5,I love how this mini fast charger fits sits nicely flush into the Cigarette Lighter. The metal body is good quality and fast charge.
5,I purchased one and like it so much I purchased another. However within 90 days 1 of them stopped working. I move it to the port where the other was working-no good. Moved it to a separate vehicle-no good. I then reached out to Aniope and they sent a replacement.
5,Excellent quality and performance!
5,Works as expected to charge my iphone in the car.
5,Good charger so far. Improvement over my slow high profile previous one.
5,Gets the job done I use it just about every day to charge my phone and watch
5,So I bought this vehicle charger based on good reviews. Yes the 3.0 is fast charging on Samsung phones. There are two other things I discovered about this product that were not listed and probably can't be guaranteed by the manufacturer for obvious reasons. One is the product is somewhat crush proof and the other is in my experience it was waterproof.  While unloading my boat on a beautiful day at the lake I dropped my charger in the water on the boat ramp.  I didn't realize this act of stupidity until I rallied up the troops for a day of fun in the sun. I went back to the boat ramp and found my Ainope charger in the water and it had just been ran over by another boat trailer. Somewhat disgruntled  I was sure to pass this one off and not let it ruin the day. My first thought was to toss it in the trash but then I thought maybe just maybe the sun will dry it out.  Me being the frugal person I am did just that. End of day successful boat trip behind us I took this charger and put it in my truck to see if it work. Fully aware that it may blow a fuse it worked. So I had to wait till I got home to pry it out of the power port because when it was crushed by the boat trailer it was slightly out of round and needed a little session in the vice to set things straight. So I couldn't get it back to being perfectly round and ordered another one. So what I'm telling you is this product is AWESOME!!
5,Have a pile of these car adapters lying around dating back to starting when charging phones in your car became a thing! These by far are the best looking and most powerful of ‘em all. Low profile so it sticks only a few mm out of the car port (don’t like it call it a cigarette lighter). When charging my iPhone 12 Pro through a wireless charger/phone holder in the car the battery goes up a percent every couple of minutes or so!
5,Great item. Works great looks sleek
5,Very fast charger.
5,So you will need to use the original or get a fast charging cable for it but once you do it really is fast charging
5,Charges my phone pretty good
5,Does what it's supposed to do.
4,I'll start off with this - overall I love this device.  It charges my phone and I have no issues with the cradle gripping holding and only releasing when I need it to.  The only downside is the windshield mount - and I'm not sure anyone can overcome both of the issues here.I have an Android phone the Samsung Galaxy S8+ Issue 1: As others have said it just plain does not stay stuck to the windshield.  The design of the arm with the weight of the phone being where it is - on a hot day with the sun beating through the windshield it simply melts off and I find it on the floor.  I've had other holders that stuck just fine for years so the design of the attachment needs some attention.Issue 2: This one they probably cannot fix.  The nature of inductive charging just means more heat for our phone.  You're not plugging directly into a battery connection and flowing electricity that way it's going to generate heat.  In the short time I did have the windshield mount working I did not have even one day without the "your phone is too hot temporarily disabling charging".  It's jut hot in the dash area - plus the heat from the inductive charging - it's just not going to work well.Switching to the air-vent clip now the phone gets a nice constant cool breeze it doesn't fall and everything works like a champ.  4 stars - I'd have given 5 if the darn arm stayed connected to the windshield...the overheating problem is not your fault :)
5,This charger is very durable and has a heavy high quality feel. Uses a metal housing for added durability. It glows blue when plugged in but it isn't bright just enough so you can find it easily.
5,Business vehicle
4,Good quality and charging capacity. Car charger is well lit and identifiable by night. Works as intended and ports are easily identified when plugging in cables.
5,This does the job it was bought for. All is good
3,Only worked for a short period of time
5,Fast charges both my wife's iPhone and my Samsung S10+.
4,feels like a quality made piece. works to fast charge my Samsung a71a cell phone
5,I like this flush mount charger as I keep it in my console which closes with two cable plugged in. My outlet is always on so I can charge my phone or bluetooth speaker while the truck is off. The lights on the charger let me know that its on. It's plastic and doesn't feel as sturdy as higher priced options but as it will just sit where it is it will do the job fine until I need a higher amp charger for the phones of the future.
5,Great Dual car charger well built about 3 months of occasional use so far fast charges my Samsung galaxy s21 does NOT super fast charge fyi not worth it by wrecking your battery  for constant use anyway... good cheaper alternative to anker which I use a lot for cables and wall chargers also have an official dual Samsung brand car charger that fast charges as well for my other vehicle recommend all 3 brands haven't let me down so far!
5,It's pretty good charges my iPhone 11 pro max at a decent rate I'd say just like you would at home with a regular charger. Real numbers - it was at 69% and I had a drive of roughly 50 minutes with minor traffic included by the time I've reached my destination it was little over 90 so I can't say it's a "fast" charger but for a car and considering how long it takes to charge my phone it's a good time.
5,This thing is exactly what it says it is. Fast charging & compact. And to top it off this doesn't pop out like many others we've had.Originally we thought about buying a replacement lighter charger to make it look like the USBs belonged in the vehicle but didn't want to really tear anything apart. This is the perfect plug to avoid unnecessary labor. Fits like it belongs.We will buy more for any future vehicles we may end up getting. Probably gifts for those that would understand & appreciate this powerful little thing. Highly recommended!BTW: we received absolutely no endorsement to make these comments. Just our opinion based on personal use.
5,Worked as expected! No real concerns!
5,My car’s USB charger stopped working and this keeps my phone charged
5,Easy to use and charges my iPhones with no problem
4,I have nothing to complain about at all with this charger. It provides fast charging for our Samsung phones as promised and fits flush in the 12V outlet in my car. It happens that my Ford Fiesta has a hinge-mounted cover and the charger does interfere with this but this is more the cover-s fault than the charger's and if I could remove the cover without breaking it I would.On rare occasions the charger will work loose in the port and not be powered but it's easy to tell when this happens as the charger is brightly lit.Four stars only because there is nothing truly innovative about this device. It does its job and does it well. I suspect the intensity of its lighting and the inability to adjust that in any way might be bothersome to some especially those whose 12V outlets are mounted on the dash and who install this device in one that is powered even when the car is off.
5,Go for it well made and actually fast charges! I have owned a lot of chargers that claimed fast charging all  were not this one is the real deal.
5,It’s super fast!!! Even charges my IPad with ease.
5,It feels like a really solidly built device and i love that it's low profile. It sits flush so it doesn't poke out too much from the jack. Fast charging on my Samsung works good.
5,Exactly what I needed to fast wireless charge my Pixel 5 in my car.
5,Fits tight in the lighter plugs of 2020 Subaru Imprezza Limited I pull my cord out of the plug and it doesnt pull this item out of lighter plug I first had it in the front chair middle armrest usb plug with a 6 ft cord now I have it in the front dash plug with a 3 ft cord and it's perfect it reaches everywhere you need it too the car comes with two 2.1 usb plugs stock in same locations but this item is wayyy faster. This unit illuminates both the usb plugs blueish purplish so you can see where your plugging into the cars own usb plugs dont illuminate and are in awkward to see/reach places. It's also very low profile like in one of the pics it looks very flush and it is in real life. I like it and I like that its illuminated and was impressed at it Fast Charging my Note 8 best speed charging you'll get as of this review and I'm always looking on for that faster multiple usb charger plug and this is it. I just need the one but may get another for middle armrest for charging back seat users. One usb plug is never enough this dual port is perfect.
5,This is the real deal charges really fast.  It felt like it is 2x faster than the 2Amp charger that can with my Honda.  I usually charge my iPhone 8S plus in my car durning my one hour lunch time.  Usually I noticed phone is 50-60% full after lunch.  But now it is 85-95% full.  Just have it for a week and loving it. Let’s see how long it last.
5,This charger is the closest to flush that I could find that also supports fast charging and is made of quality materials. Buy this one I've already bought 3 for all of our cars and a friend's!
5,Make sure you buy the correct charging cables! Charges two Samsung S21+ as fast as a single Samsung supplied charger.
5,Fits perfect doesn't shake out and my phone says it's actually fast charging!
5,I've never seen my phone charge so fast. Worth every dollar. The only con is that it can damage my auxiliary port when pulling it out. I have to firmly push down the sides of my port when removing it.
5,I do food delivery and I'm in my car often and I use my phone often to receive orders and complete them. This charger has been a lifesaver several times. It's quick and both ports deliver the same speed of charging ability much to my delight. The little bugger is super solid and heavy for its size. I love the way it lights up and I love the compactness of it. I found it to be a great value and and am beyond completely satisfied with this purchase. A few days ago a friend needed a charger and I thought it was a good idea to let him use mine and I ended up forgetting to take it out of his car. When I asked him for it he said that it is a great little charger and he really liked it so I gave it to him. And of course I ordered another one.
5,Perfect simple plugin
5,this works just as it should. haven't had any problems with it yet but I've also not used it much yet.
5,+ Dual (not shared) Quick Charge 3.0+ Lights up when plugged in+ Compact+ Easy install with solid build- Only 2 USB- If you don't have the grip strength it will be hard to take it out because it sits very close to the outlet. (Double edged sword for being so compact)- Does not come with its own designated cableI wanted to get a new car charger due to my old one not working and charging anymore. This one is 5/5 in my books.I was able to charge my spouse and my phone at the same time BOTH with quick charge.It was very nicely packaged too. The unboxing was very premium! A lot of times these cheap little thigs don't get special treatments but not this one. It came with a nice box wrapped up in plastic. Of course the minimalist in me doesn't like it but it does show that the makers put time and effort into trying to make a good product and present it well to their customers.The only problem I had with it was that it's small and can definitely make it difficult to remove if the charger ends up expanding.
5,Small and very powerful great
5,With the right cable it fast charges my pixel 6 and pixel 6 pro
5,Works perfectly. Excellent construction. Holds tight in socket and to USB plug. Fairly priced. Well done.
5,My LG G8 has the Qualcom rapid charge and this works GREAT.  My friends Samsung A51 doesn't have that internal charging function and this thing is slow to charge that other phone.
5,The charger a well-made charges my Galaxy a71 5G phone as fast as my super fast Chargers plugged into an outlet we'll see how long it lasts but it appears to be great so far
5,Fits into the lighter very tight doesn’t wiggle and charges fast like it’s description!!!
5,Fast shipping. Works as expected.
5,Held yp with 4 kids on an 8 hour trip there and back!
5,Nice quality car charger! You can tell it's not cheaply made by the weight of it! and it works as advertised! It fast charges my Galaxy s22 ultra so I'm very satisfied with this purchase!!
4,I like to have a charger in the car for when I forget to charge my phone and have to leave with no time to do it at home.
5,I was worried this little charger wouldn't work let alone fast charge because I have a ton of these and they're all junk but this charger WORKS. It kept my Note 8 juiced up and battery at a constant 100% all throughout an 11 hour road trip and back. It worked with my stock cable; I haven't tried it with an aftermarket cable I also love but I'm sure it would work too. The design is very sleek and the charger has some weight to it with an expensive feel if that makes sense. It is a true quick charging charger and I like that it stops charging when your phone reaches 100%. My cable also fits smooth and snug in both of the charger's ports. The charger fit perfectly inside the 12v (cigarette lighter) sockett of a 2019 dodge ram 1500. Charger also stays cool all throughout charging. I really can't find one negative thing to say about the product; it is high quality and does exactly what it says.
5,Started out working great but has slowly lost output wattage over the few months I have used it. Tends to run hot as well which probably accounts for the progressive degeneration. When it was brand new I could fast charge my tablet and cell phone simultaniously then eventually it would only fast charge with one device connected now it will not fast charge with either device and occasionally my tablet will come up with the "charging slowly" message we all dread.For a short term infrequent use option this might be just fine but for mid to long term use or use to its advertised capabilities look elsewhere.
5,The charging items works great
5,Use on trips in the car. Kids use this to charge 2 devices.
5,Charger provides ample power for a speedy charge and the flush fit is great for my 2019 Rav4.  Been using mine for 2 years.Highly recommend.
5,The only complain i have it. The sticky pad won’t stay even Wait more then 12 hours and then put the charger with mount. While driving it fell down while phone was charging. I glad I didn’t get any kind off accident. And if you check the reviews few peoples already complain about and it still has not fixed. With that sticky pad charger mount hold strongly. Suggestion makes better quality or don’t send it with charger.
5,This product is a step up from the older products. It does its job as promised with increased power.
5,I had a problem with one of these chargers and they sent me a replacement promptly with no hassle.  It seems to be well-made fits the socket securely and charges fast.
4,It's a great product I love it. I use it almost every day. had it for almost a year-Great charging speed-love how compact it isThe only bad thing is that now only one of the ports works but might be from just leaving charger plug almost permanently.
5,SO LIKE WHEN YOR PHON DEAD YOU PLUG THING IN AN IT MAKE PHONE BATTRY GO UP BIG FAST
5,I was surprised to see that the port actually delivered what it said it can. Dual port quality material and design that actually fast charge at the same time. Android and iPhone user
3,Rating is only for being able to insert and remove this adaptor. It sits flush with the dashboard and was too hard to remove. Couldn’t imagine having to struggle with such a simple task all the time so returned it for a different design. Some concern as well about these getting stuck in the socket.If many adaptors are evolving toward a flush mount look this leaves many of us with arthritis or hand mobility issues out of luck.
5,Works good fits will does what it should
5,It’s very fast
4,Originally had a charging issue with the first item received but the excellent customer service was able to respond promptly and send me out a replacement which seems to be working much better than the first one - it’s hard to tell the accurate charging speed since I’m using it to charge a wireless charging car mount to then charge my phone but it’s been working efficiently so far so can’t complain…. Smallsleek and sturdy
2,I've bought this product 4 times and every single time one of the two ports stops working. One of them lasted a year two lasted a couple months the newest one lasted about a week. I don't know why I kept buying this one when there are others available. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least one port worked.
5,Great charger
5,Fast charger Works excellent
5,Full transparency I'm writing this review with only one week of use with this product.So far the experience has been good and the product is just what I needed. I really wanted something that was high quality durable and that would fit flush into the cigarette lighter so I could close it. This product is low profile and it fits snugly into the cigarette lighter.  ***Note- the product is a tight fit so I would suggest putting it in the cigarette lighter and leaving it there constantly removing it could create wear or cause it to become loose.***The product is made of thick plastic which appears to be very durable.The porch of fast charging so it gets the job done. So far this product meets my expectation.
5,It showed up a month late and after about two weeks one of the outlets no longer works. It charges very quick but what sucks is that it's no longer a dual charger.Update: After this review they contacted me and replaced the charger with a new one. The customer service was amazing. I got the new one within days. The new one works like it's suppose to. I must of received a defaulted one.
5,This is NOT a cheap plastic car charger.  It is metal and very sturdy. I purchased 6 months ago and heldp off writing a review to see how it held up.  During this time we did a lot of driving and had two phones on it for many hours.  It performed spectacularly.  I'm getting another one.
5,Really faster charger
5,Nice charger with a metal housing and fast charging
5,This charger is ver nice.  Made with quality materials and charges fast.
5,Metal casing.
5,I originally wasnt expecting much from it given my Past Experience with these type of quick adaptive chargers. I was ordering a new one to replace a newly (3 weeks old Which charged very quickly but then it was slowly charging.How ever THIS Charger. Has been fast charging my Samsung S7 since it was received!It's all Metal Body Fast Charging ( my S7 display reported that the S7 was Fast Charging my  S7).Here's hoping that this will be the last one I'll ever need!
4,Great charging speed definitely fast charger but the spring probes don't grip very well within the cigarette port. I brought this up to customer service and was told basically there are allot of ports in vehicles and it may not seat well in all.. So yeah.
5,Great construction. It is metal!! Able to charge galaxy s9+ rapidly
3,Everything seems fine except...While some folks have complained about these "popping out" I had the opposite issueGetting it to go far enough into the socket to make contact proved challenging - I was rather concerned the socket mount would break for the amount of force needed to get this unit snugged in there far enoughSeems to work fine and operates a charger which claims to only function properly with QC3 adapters
4,Works good but it's a little hard to get out of the charging slot. High quality metal and is fast charging.
5,Stays in place.  Does not wobble or fall out of slot.
5,I'm really impressed with this low profile USB charger.  I specifically use this in my vehicle where almost everyone in my family needs something to charge.  That being said with the need for quick charge capabilities finding a good low profile charger was not as easy to find.  This is the fist one with a good build quality and actually could provide quick charge capabilities.  Its very easy to keep two iPads running and topped off without the need to catch up.  When using to charge it works well but I haven't had the 52% faster charge rate they claim.  Still much faster.I would recommend this product.
5,Muy bueno carga rápido mi celular.
5,Exelente cargador con carga rápida buen producto.
5,Fast charging two USB ports and it's for the car 👍🏼
5,I installed this in my 1998 Jeep Cherokee to replace another one that I bought at a gas station a couple of years ago had stopped working.  The differences between the old and new are quite noticeable.  The Ainope has a metal body not flexible plastic and has some actual heft to it.  It fits right into the socket no wiggling around.  The USB sockets are a tight fit as well; no looseness in the cables when connected.  It doesn’t get warm to the touch at least not the handful of times I’ve used it and charging is quick  Longevity is the only other factor that I can’t comment on but I expect it to be long given what I’ve seen so far.
5,Turns out the USB port on our pontoon is for input only; it doesn't provide charging power.  I looked at a lot of chargers to fit a cigarette lighter and found this on Amazon.  Like to build of the product and the low profile look.  With the additional purchase of two six foot Anker USB to Lightening cables we now nave phone charging capability on our pontoon.
3,the outpower is now what i was looking for but the flush design allow for me to close the compartment in my car and hide the charger.
4,Overall it's a decent metallic car charger. Unfortunately it does not sit as flush with my car's surface as I was hoping it would but it seems like I might just have a short port.
5,My wife and i can both simultaneously charge our phones with this charger. Since our car only has one power port we have to share the port. We have burned out 2 other brands of dual charger. They would run extremely hot and melt the plastic before just quitting. So far after about a month. This unit is working well on my wife's Samsung Galaxy and my iPhone. So far so good.
5,It is a fast charge item.  Both my Pixel 5 and the wife's iPhone 12 pro max indicate fast charging is working at the same time.  The power light is not too bright which is a plus.  I love how flush this sits in the car socket.  If it sat any more flush I don't think you could get it back out without some pry/extraction tool use.  One very minor detail of negativity it did come packaged in a barely noticeable plastic covering and it wasn't easy to remove.  Some users may unknowingly think it was supposed to be there on purpose.  Not sure why it was there but it was redundant.
5,This charger is awesome. Bought this because my phone was almost dead driving home and now I honestly don't have to worry about that anymore. This lil guy charges super fast! Probably my favorite purchase so far on Amazon oh and it has a cute lil LED light inside
5,I broke my old one so I bought another one. These are durable and provide fast charging while also being low profile and dual port. Would buy again.
5,Charges quick works well.
5,Fully charge my phone in about 20 minutes with this adapter.
3,As opposed to the description this adapter DOES NOT sit flush in the accessory outlet of my vehicle instead it sticks out about 1/4 inch before the flare at the end
3,The charger does a great job quickly charging phones and laptops and it feels solid but it is very difficult to remove.  I used it in a rental car and had a lot of trouble getting it out.  It fits very tight and there is very little to grab onto making it far more difficult to remove than necessary.
2,This charger looks durably built however it doesn't stay flush within the socket it's super difficult to remove it from the socket and it's only able to supply about 1A of current for my pixel 6 (so charges at ~4W) whereas it can easily charge at a rate of15W from a wall outlet. The only reason I have it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it's still better than my previous charger which claimed to supply 2.4A but only provided 0.15A of charging current.
2,Not sure what other reviewers were using but I tried this charger on 2 different vehicles with different cords including braided fast charge cable and red Warp charge cable and still no fast charge for my OnePlus 8 Pro. In 30 minutes only charged 10 percent. Got a faster charge on a 15w wireless charger. I didn't find it was worth the money. Might just keep as a backup but going to continue to use the 3 dollar one I got at a gas station
5,So far so good. It does fast charging..worth it especially with the dual port.the one port didn't do fast charging evwn whem I unpluged  it but when I switch to the other it went fast charging immediately..
5,So far is really good and does fast charging. Went from 50% to 92% in about 30 minutes on my drive home from work. And the charger never heated up or got even warm. As far as longevity I'll have to see. But for now its great.
5,Fits nice and flat great for one you don't move much might be too flush and difficult to pull out of you don't just leave it in your dash like me. Fast charging is working perfectly. I have another cheap plastic one from a different brand that says it supports the newest quick charge standard but it doesn't charge nearly as fast as this one even though the quick charge icon pops up on my phone with it too.  Doesn't look or feel cheap like every other car charger I've owned. Time will tell if it's as durable as the metal construction and build quality make it feel but so far I'm impressed.
5,I was looking for a QC for the car that was low profile and this checked both boxes and works very very well.
5,Very sturdy metal construction (it's heavy!). It is also very compact so when you insert it into a car 12-volt outlet it fits nearly flush. The always on blue led light is a nice feature. I've bought three of these chargers to use in my two cars and they've been working great. I definitely recommend this product.
5,Works as advertised. Lower profile than my last "low profile" charger fits ALMOST flush in my 2012 Tacoma. I paired this with 2 right-angle USB cables from uGreen and it freed up a good amount of space behind my cup holders so now they don't bump into the drinks. Works to charge 2 Android phones simultaneously and yes they *fast-charge* and the unit doesn't seem to get very hot. Good stuff definitely recommend.
5,This item works great and charges my phone pretty quickly when I'm super low on battery; that's when the quick charging is most evident. For me this charger is tucked away in my center console but it is also very low profile so even if I needed to have it out by my dash it would not look obtrusive or bulky. The materials feel nice and sturdy and I have not had issues with this charger since I bought it like 3 months ago I would totally recommend this product to someone who cares about quality and aesthetics.
4,Only one port is a QC. Plugged into the first port and it gave me a charging time of 3hrs. Moved it to the second port and it changed to 42mins.It did charge quick but it's not a dual QC. Does the job for the $ but call it what it is.
5,It does what it supposed to do. Fast charging works and comes in very handy at times. All in all its a great product.
5,We use this to charge iPhones and iPads and it works great if you're still using the older USB plugs.  I've upgraded some of my chargers to the USB-C type but this works with our old cables.
5,I've purchased this product more than once.  I charges my phone 📱 so quickly.  I highly recommend it.
4,Update: this company has one of the best customer service people I have run across. They sent me an email telling me they would refund my money and not to bother returning the product. They are going to try to come up with a better design. This does not stay seated in my Harley. It pops right out as soon as you plug it in. I really like the looks of it and it seems to charge really well. But right now I have a USB cable pushed into the wiring on the bike that is putting pressure on the plug to keep it seated. It made a 150 mile ride that way with no problems. I wish I could find one this well made that had a way to tighten it into the socket.
4,Charges my Galaxy S10 at 12 watts on either port. Not sure why not 15 since that's what my phone supports but I guess I'm not too upset.
5,I didnt realize the importance of a good cigarette phone charger until recently. This has been a great buy as it charges up phones very quick in the car I have an IPhone 10 and a work phone (Memory logic with a USB-C plug) that I charge in my work truck using the Ainope USB car charger and they get charged very quickly. I haven’t actually timed how much faster or slower my phones charge with this but I’ve found myself like “Wow its done already?!?” a few times already. If anyone is thinking of purchasing this USB car charger then it is totally worth it as it will charge phones or anything powered up with the USB very fast.
5,If you have a phone or device that uses QI fast charge technology this is the only charger to have. It works as advertised and most of all it is ultra compact. Don't try to use it with an Apple products for fast charge. Apple blocks anything other than their own products for fast charge. If you have an Android product this is the best you will find it is even Samsung approved.
5,Carga muy rápido excelente
5,Excellent fast charger. Works great with my Iphone 11 pro. The plus point is that both ports are fast charging ones. Definitely recommend it!!
5,Perfect charger
3,The charger is quite fast but the 2 USB A ports are not in the same depth. While plugging in a cable in one of the ports the plug will stick out and is not flush with the charger. While this is not a huge deal it does raise a question about the quality of the charger.
5,Holds great in the port
4,Es un cargador de muy buena calidad probado en Huawei P40pro P30pro P10pro y Iphone 11. Si bien el material es resistente en ninguno de los casos activa la carga rápida en los modelos indicados.
5,Excelente producto cumplio con todas las expectativas buena calidad de los materiales buena carga.
5,Having two extra USB ports is extremely helpful. I would buy again.  Does what it’s supposed to do.
5,Has the power I need to charge my (ageing) Pixel 3 more quickly on a Qi compatible phone holder in my car. While my battery indicator in phone settings still says "charging slowly" this charger is superior to other allegedly 18W single or 36W double chargers I've tried. Charging makes good progress while running a map or streaming. Device has a sturdy solid heft to it. Compact design keeps it out of the way of bumping/breaking. I will order a second for travel/second car.
5,I’d bought an expensive wireless charger that was supposed to be fast-charging but turned out not to be.  This charger does exactly what manufacturer says it will.  It’s small and unobtrusive too.
3,The first day it charged my phone so fast I was astonished. It charged it faster than my charging block did. BUT the day after and since then charging has been a bit slow it's still faster than other car chargers I have had.
5,It’s hard to find car chargers strong enough to charge a larger phone or tablet but this one has been working great so far. It feels like it’s built well but only time will tell. I like it so far.
5,It's the one on the right in the pic. It fits pretty flush in my 2019 KIA Forte I can even close the cover with it in. It's definitely a snug fit. I bought this because I do DoorDash and I can't have my phone plugged into the car's USB port when using the DD app so I needed a way to keep my phone charged when I'm out doing deliveries. It seems pretty well made I can see it lasting a while. If it doesn't it was cheap enough that I can buy another one.
5,I have a Samsung S7 which is starting to drain it's battery fairly quickly. I was finding in the car that with GPS going my old charger couldn't keep up. This charger is great. I see fast charge on the phone when I plug in. It charges the phone quickly.
5,Great
5,Such a low profile.  And it charges amazingly fast
5,Very well made product. Looks nice and fast charge.
5,Fast charges two phones at the same time.
5,This thing works as described!!! It charges really fast compared to my last one. The quality of the material used on this feels like it should cost more. Really satisfied with my choice on this one.
5,Got two of these for my cars and they are owesome they dont slow down when you charge two devices at once unlike others that i previously owned.
5,Purchased so that I could fast charge on my wireless car charger. Got my old Samsung S7 to fast charge wirelessly in my car and now I have an extra usb port as well
5,for my golf cary
5,Fast and the flush mount gives a cleaner appearance to my dash.
1,The charger worked as described for the first 2 months after that it stopped working properly sometimes it would work and sometimes it wouldn't on my phone or on any other phone it would. I contacted customer service via email and told them that i wanted to file a warranty claim and they responded with "please send us proof of issue and details of the issue" which i did and its been  more that 2 days haven't received and email with the response but with the first email they responded with a couple of hours.
4,Sturdy solid metal with a light so you know its connected
5,Perfect fit for my needs. I needed a stubby charger to fit under the center console cover in my Volvo with the usb cable plugged into it. Most car USB chargers are too long so they sit too high. This little charger along with a USB cable with a 90° bend to it fit the bill. I tried one other stubby charger. But that one didn't allow my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge to fast charge. This one does.
5,Es de buena calidad.No se aprecia bien la luz cuando conectas dos cables
4,I was looking to replace my original Samsung fast charger . I have long commutes and really don't like that even with a 30-minute drive with the WAZE and other apps running my battery is still stagnant. I had looked at the reviews and thought that this would be a solution to my problem. I have a Samsung phone and when I tried either port neither are registered as a fast charge. Although it does charge like a regular store-brand I could have pulled from Radio Shock it does the job. I just wish that I would have known it would not be the fast charge compatibility I was looking for.
5,Love it. My wife & I are driving down the hiway she's talking on phone while I am using Waze and we are both on fast-charge. It is very sturdy and popped right in while it offered enough resistance on the way out that it won't just pop out when you fiddle with the cables. The blue leds are just enough to indicate it's charging without lighting up the whole area.
4,Everything was great just as I want. Thank you!
5,Charges fast great price no errors when using with any cord
2,I wouldn't buy again and I bought 2 of them.  Too bad I missed the return date. Because I just wasted my hard earned money.
5,This charger is great. I ordered several for my vehicles. The fit and finish is great. The small size is even better. And having fast charging takes the cake. Verfied fast charging on a Samsung phone. Should work with Apple too. Absolutely nothing to complain about in my opinion. Even the price is reasonable.
4,Always on the phone either listening to Sirius radio or having to talk to my boss always keeps my phone fully charged 24 seven very happy with the product I’ve ordered three of them one for each vehicle so I don’t have to move them in in and out would recommend them highly to other people
5,Works well
5,This is the best car charger for phones that I've found.  It fits nearly flush with the 12 volt port so if you have a door covering your port it still closes it does QuickCharge so modern phones charge superfast and it has two ports for charging two devices at once without needing a splitter.  My car only has one port up front (despite 3 in the back) so this is great for the two front-seat users at once.  Feels very high quality; it's held up through regular use including road trips over a couple months so hopefully it lasts longer than the cheaper ones I've gone through.
5,Fits nicely in our 2012 Honda Odyssey. We use in one of the ports up front.  The port cap closes part way now  so not all the way but that doesn't bother us at all.  We're glad the port cap isn't stuck fully open anymore.  For us it's a win.  Makes the front look tidier.  Quality so far is superb. Charges our Galaxy S9 phones fairly fast.
5,Dual Fast Charger for Car Lighter Socked.  Mounts Flush (nothing protruding) .  It basically turns a lighter socket into a dual USB charger socket.  Nothing protruding looks great consumes 0 space high quality.  Great for every car and to take it on the road for use in car rentals.  Keep two phones or phone and spare battery pack or phone and ear piece charged when mobile.
3,The charger I received does not fast charge. It charges at regular speed. Also it looks slightly different is it from the images.  I'm not sure if I received the correct product. Email the seller and haven't had response.Update:Seller reached out after a few emails back and forth to verify what happened. They sent me the correct charger. Awsome customer service. The charger fast charges and works great.
5,This thing has a metal housing feels very solid and charges fast.  It also locks into the 12v outlet in my truck very firmly. Almost too firmly!
2,Using this for a while now .... And my phone pixel6 never says it's fast charging and I see no battery percentage being added it only maintains the charge
5,When I am on the road I did not have a slow charging issue for smart phone with other normal charging device.However when I try to charge my son’s iPad in my car I have a charging issue because a normal charging device is so slow that my son cannot use iPad once battery is gone. My son cannot use iPad although USB cable is plugged in because battery is not charging fast enough while he is watching YouTube.With this charging device it is charging iPad really fast and my son can continue to use iPad in the car without bothering me driving ^^One extra tip I also purchased and use fast charging USB cables and with these combinations I see the super fast charging time for my son’s iPad in the car.
5,This thing charges our android phones in the car like nobodies business (made a good purchase by paying attention to the charge rating for QC3.0 - all fast chargers are not the same read the fine print).  The low profile allows me to close my center console and leave the charger in place when not in use.
5,I was shocked that the fast charging actually worked! No issues in the month I've had it
5,This works great charges my phone quickly while I am using multiple delivery apps.
5,Not sure if it is this unit or the fast charging cord I also purchased but wow!  My phone charges so fast now!From empty to full is like 1.5 to 2 hours.  My last cord was 8 hours!
2,This is NOT a Fast charger. this charges at normal rate at best.  My non fast wireless charger charges 2X faster.  Also this does not sit flush in socket as advertised.  it does stick out by 1/4 inch above socket.  returned item for refund and company did respond automatically and offered to replace with a upgraded charger of same size for free after getting refund from Amazon. The new model is a fast charger that charges just as fast as others I have. I would recommend that one it is 48w qc3 +pd and has 1 usb a and 1usb c port and comes with usbc to c cable.
5,This fits in the center console outlet on my second generation IS sedan and powers my phones easily so I don't have wires running all over the middle of the car.  This adapter paired with a 90 degree USB wire even allows me to close the lid with the adapter and wires still installed.  Exactly what I wanted in the form factor but it also charges FAST for a standard USB.  No it's not 60w USB C fast but it's way better than anything else I could squeeze into the tiny space I planned for this device to occupy.
5,A wonderful purchase! I enjoy and utilize it daily. Unplug anything while not using so it won’t drain battery slowly overnight.
5,This is a very good charger.
5,I use it in my 2018 subaru outback. it keeps poping out. the small side contact buttons are the problem with the super spring in the tip. i haf a non fast charging one for 3 years never had it auto eject. the sides had bigger contact area. not thrilled. I'm an over Comer so one wrap of electrician tape(not overlaping) and it seems to be held in by the tape. kinda sux. maybe send a strip of tape in the packaging.still using it. I don't usually less than 5 stars. so i 5 starred you juts because.update april 2020:i have a 2020 outback now still using it. still works. still has the tape on it.
5,Good value. Fast charger. I storm chase so my phone is constantly on using mobile data and apps that suck battery life quickly. This charger gets the phone or my bluetooth speaker back up to a working charge very quickly. Even faster than charging on house power.
5,Works perfectly. Good qualoty.
5,I love this double USB car charger.  Unlike ones I've had in the past that were made of plastic and broke over time this adapter is made of metal and is constructed very well.  I liked the first one I got so much that I bought another.  You will not find a better quality product for this good a price I can tell you that because I have searched.  You will not be sorry that you bought this.
5,With newer phones old chargers can not keep up. I have a One Plus 8 pro and this might be the first charger that could put in more juice than it drains. Used it on a 2 day road trip and had no problems with it.
5,Works as advertised very fast charging. The profile is so low that it just looks like a factory charging port. My power port is only powered with the ignition on so i leave this charger in the port all the time. The charger has nice led lighting so its easy to find the ports in the dark.
5,Quality product well pleased with all of their chargers
5,I like that it has enough amps to fast charge my phone. It lights up to make it easier to find in a dark car.
5,This car charger stands out from most all others that I have seen including the one that I got from one of the leading cell carriers.  It is extremely sturdy and the quality of material can be seen and felt.  And it charges my phones quickly.The low profile is one of the features that I selected this charger for.  It is low enough that I can leave it plugged in and still close the cover on my W212 Mercedes SL350.
5,This thing is compact but delivers big charging capability! A true fast charger for my note 20 ultra!
5,I knew this thing was a keeper when I opened it.  It has a heaviness to it that makes it seem like a quality product - and I think it is.  It sticks out of your 12v receptacle about 1/4" which is great and about as minimalistic as I could find in a QC 3.0  charger.  The LED light is inside the port so it isn't too bright and once you have things plugged in almost unnoticeable.  I have no complaints!
5,I wanted a usb charger for the back seat of my 2019 Lexus RX for when my grandsons are in the car and need to charge their tablets.  It works perfectly - so far- and fits in the cigarette lighter fairly flush.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.
5,This is a great purchase
5,Quickly charges my phone while commuting.  My old one lost phone power while trying to charge.
5,I use it in the cockpit with 28V DC power supply. It functions without any problems. VERY nice fit and finish and fast charging! A little on the expensive side but I think it is worth it for what it is and what it does.  Have not had it long enough to be able to comment on the reliability. Might update the review later about that.
5,You need this if you're in your car more than you are at home or if you're constantly on the road and need your phone charged fast when you go from point A to point B. Like it's bomb! I also use a fast charging USB cable for my phone so I'm definitely getting the fast charging. Never tried it with a regular USB cable but I'm sure it would work just as good.
5,I love how both USB ports are fast charging. Best of all the slim profile sits almost flush with the power port allowing it to fit inside my arm rest console with a USB cable plugged in. I have another charger that's a bit longer and it didn't fit in that space. This is great!
5,Works great fits nice and slim inside the outlet and charges FAST without getting hot. I’m charging an iPhone 11 Pro
4,I bought this charger for my Ford Fusion arm rest charging outlet. It charged devices - Galaxy s9/s9+ Fitbit Versa- quickly and reliably as long as you make sure it stayed seated. As others have found it can rise up and disconnect during charging especially if the cables are jostled. It did not seem to heat up which was a plus. I still give 4 stars because although it didn't seat tightly in my car we had no issues with it seating snugly in my husband's Chrysler 200.
3,I ordered this form type to have a flush look in my outlet but compared to a similar one I have this one sticks out by 1/4” so not ideal for my 2016 GMC Acadia.  I ordered this to power a 7.5w iPhone wireless charger that required a qc3.0 adapter to achieve the faster charge rates and after a couple of tests I saw no faster charge rates than my existing 2.4 amp adapter.  I cannot say for sure it is this adapter or the wireless charger at fault for that.  Since my outlet is always has power I don’t care for the built in LED lights having a small battery drain which I would expect to be minimal but the wireless charger also had led lights so for my setup I did not like all the extra lights on all the time and not concenient to unplug each time.Materials and build quality appeared top notch.
5,Good quality feeling product
5,Very satisfied
5,I like this charger but it has a major flaw: it won't stay in the port (cigarette lighter port).  After driving a bit I realize that my phone stops charging.  I have to either push it in or out so there is a proper connection.Update:  after hosting this review I was contacted by the seller. They offered me a free replacement for an upgraded product. I accepted and it was delivered to me quickly. This new version now works perfectly. It stays firm in the cigarette lighter and charges as it should. This is now a 5-star product.
5,Out of the box this USB charging plug is very sturdy. It has a hefty non-plastic weight to it so it is definitely well constructed. When plugged in my Samsung Note displayed the "Fast Charging" notification and inspecting the charge session with the AccuBattery app it maintained a consistent current of 2.4A (screen on). Unfortunately I did not have a chance to see what the numbers were when two devices were plugged in at the same time but the unit is advertised as both USB ports being QC3.0 "fast charging" capable. If you're searching for a fast-charging USB lighter plug this is the one!
5,Contacted customer support and they sent me a replacement. Best cellphone charger I ever had.
5,This is a great charger!  I love that I can charge 2 at a time and both are fast charge (unlike both of my other ones).  I paired this with a good wireless fast charger and LOVE IT!  This thing feels so well make and is very low profile.  I hope it lasts but will update if it doesn't.  I recommend this and would but it again.
5,This is AMAZING. In my Lexus I couldn't get anything to charge. Anytime I would connect a charger my phone would say 7 or 8 hours. With this it charges my phone faster than at home. It's amazing. It is worth every penny!
2,Returned this. It was too short in the charging port. Wanted it to sit above the port.
5,Worked fine for about a month but now one port doesn't work at all and the other just flickersUPDATE:Seller was kind to send a new one free of charge. New one works perfectly and have had no issues.
5,good value for money
3,Like: very good as a chargerDislike: I didn't drive my car for a few days the charger has ate the battery completely. Never had such issue before. Don't forget to disconnect it any time you park your car. Very inconvenient.
5,I bought this as the main port for charging while I drive for Uber. The material feel is very premium surprisingly so in fact. It fits very tights into the lighter socket of my 2016 Prius there is zero chance of a loose connection. I can honestly say that this far it is the best one I have ever purchased and also not the most expensive...fantastic buy. Charges very quickly for a car charger. So far I’ve put about 600 miles on my car with it installed and used it the entire time will update in a few months.
5,The metal housing is great as I use this for my boat - so far so good still.
5,Fits very tight In my outlet. Charges fast no problems so far.
5,Funciona muy bien 👍
5,Worked as expected 👏🙌👍🏼.  Build quality was excellent.  The weight is heavy and feels premium. Fits flush into the cigarette lighter with little to none of the unit protruding to far..  If you are looking for a sturdy metal build with fast charging capabilities this is the charger to get.  5stars! I was impressed 👌
5,Awesome USB charger. With the appropriate cable it does charge devices much faster. The metal construction and the fact that when inserted it sits a little proud are great for when it needs to be removed. Some other brands are thin plastic and can snap the top off when trying to remove.It does light up all the time if you 12v outlet has constant power but the tiny LED light will never drain the battery unless you car sits for over a year.
3,Quality material and charges great but expensive and the design with such a small lip and such a tight fit in the socket makes it really hard to pull out when not in use or when I shut off my truck (the socket in my truck is live when truck isn’t running).  If your 12 v socket turns off when you shut off your vehicle you’ll be fine.
3,So I liked the quick charge function. I recently upgraded my phone to a Samsung galaxy note and while charging from my radio the phone would LOSE battery percentage. So I tried my 1.5a generic USB adapter with the same result. I specifically searched for a 3amp quick charge adapter and ordered this one. I was very happy with it until today. My charge cable lights up when charging. I noticed it was out. So I switched sides on the adapter but shortly afterwards the light was out again. So the Adapter is dead. I'm back to using the radio until I get a new adapter.  This little adapter didn't even last 90 days before it burnt out.
2,This is my 2nd unit it was delivered before I sent my 1st one in for return.Both of them worked quite well for a day [2nd] or few [1st] BUT THEN one of the charging ports goes dead!
3,Great build. Great price. I have a 2017 Toyota Highlander and this thing is a super tight fit. The design makes it sit flush with the car surface but DAMN this adapter just does not want to come out. Not sure I want to use it anymore. Maybe it needs a nice lube.
3,This charger would not charge my new iPad
5,This is a really neat car charger.  I bought it for my van but it fit so perfect into my Techoss portable power station that that's where it ended up.  A perfect flush fit and the colors matched too now this power station has 2 portable QC3 usb ports.
5,I didn’t think this would’ve made a difference because I tried so many car charges and none seem to work well. After getting my adapter I plugged it in and this changed everything! I absolutely love it and it chargers my phone quicker than all others. The first thing I noticed was that it said fast charging which I didn’t expect to actually fast charge since I’m some cases it goes away after a while. With this charger it didn’t yes it fast charges my galaxy 8 and works well!! Great charger adapter for a decent price. Love it
5,Works great with my wireless charging car mount as i'm now able to get "fast wireless charging" capability for my Samsung Galaxy S9 due to the QC3.0 USB ports. Fits the cigarette charger below the radio just fine on my '15 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The build quality is impressive; feels solidly built and seems like it'll last a long while.**2/19/2020 - UPDATE** I liked it very much that I purchased a second one to use in a 2006 BMW 325I which fits the the cigarette charger in front of the shift lever.
4,Great built quality and very nice and hefty material. Come packaged very well. Remember to remove plastic fill before use.Works perfectly getting fast charge for Samsung S9+ as expected.Cons:A little longer than I imagined.Doesn't seat very securely in my Infiniti G35 center console lighter outlet. It will pull out when I try to remove my USB cable. So it will get annoying very quickly if I need to do that frequently. Docking a star for that.
5,My old one piece charger died the cord kept breaking. I bought this one because it was snug fast charging and had dual slots. I had a lightning cord already and the two of them work together wonderfully! Worth the money!
5,Yo its legit  best charger i have i use it with a cable creation cord and it charges my s9+ from dead to full in about 45 mins also its not light it has some weight to it doesnt look or feel cheaply made at all. I will update afte 30 days and 3 months of use.
4,The name of the product is "...3.0" which means 3 amps not 6.The specs written on the side of the item say 3A which makes sense: 36W = 12V x 3A.Not sure why the product listing claims it to be rated at 6A.
4,This thing is solid I could probably knock someone out with it. The USB ports are arranged such that the top of any device you plug in is facing the other port: this creates clearance issues if you want to plug in a cord and a device or two devices. A second charger or short USB extension cord can solve the issue. Kind of trivial but adding things defeats the point of the clean look this is intended to provide.
5,For those that are wondering this charger puts out enough power to provide Apple MagSafe fast wireless charging if using a MagSafe charger or aftermarket MagSafe compatible charger. Yes you will get the MagSafe animation as well. That verifies that your iPhone 12 series device is fast wireless charging.
5,The charger is built like a tank! Love how it is made of aluminum rather than cheap plastic! Please do yourself a favor and spend the money and buy only this charger or ones of similar quality (which I have no found yet). My friend bought a  junk charger from a retail store and lets just say his repair bill would have been non-existent had he listened to me and bought a quality charger like AINOPE!
5,Good workmanship and materials
3,Very fast charging. Absutly no problem with output.Does not stay in charger port... fix this with a strip of duct tape which makes it fit snuggly.5 star if they fix the fit.  Very solid made...NOTE... SELLERS ARE FULL OF **** with most stating this is new version re-engineered to fix..ITS A LIE.  BUT price is good and fix is easy.If unfixed you'll need to push it down daily.
3,I purchased this "Mini" USB charger as the one I currently own made by Belkin sits slightly proud of the car dashboard when fully inserted and so looks weird to me. I purchased the AINOPE model as it was described as MINI so assumed that it would be kind of small in length and sit nice and flush and look as if it was a standard part of the car. No such luck. It actually sits out further than my original Belkin model which is approx. 5 years old if not more.Very disappointed. On a positive note the charger appears to work very well and is constructed from metal which gives it a more expensive feel.
5,The adapter feels solid in your hand. I was surprised at the weight. (It is made of metal). It fits snugly in the socket although I have had it creep out a bit. I just push it back in every month or so. It has never failed to charge my equipment. I use an old iPod Nano and a Mototola smartphone. Both charge at the same time without any problems.
5,Heavy and durable. Great quality and works flawlessly
5,Super fast charging durable built well not like that cheap plastic junk you get at 7-Eleven. Stays put and doesn’t wiggle loose no matter how bad of a bump you hit. I use it daily in my semi while hauling freight. I run a 6 foot lightning cable and a 6 foot USB-C to charge my iPhone battery backup GoPro and earbuds.
4,A fantastic car charger.  Well designed  sturdy and functional.  Great stocking-stuffer...
5,Delivers a powerful charge and stable charge. Dosent heat up while during long term use. As a truck driver I will have a gps and my phone hooked up to it well over 8 hrs into 11hrs a day.Made out of metalHeavy dutyAnd very durable.5 out of 5
5,I had pretty much given up on car chargers because they barely charged my phone but with my phone now being 2 years old and me not wanting to drop $1000+ on a new phone since mine works fine with the exception of battery drainage I started looking into portable charging options.  After reading reviews on this charger I decided to give it a try and I am so completely happy with it.  It fast charges like for real I am very impressed.  I am using a USB-C 3A cord along with it.
4,I don't even pull on it and it doesn't stay plugged in.
5,Best Charger I’ve Ever Owned!
5,Charges fast with two devices connected. Feels like good long lasting material
4,Very good at quick charge. Does heat up like some others
5,Very well constructed.  Very secure in the socket.  I highly recommend this if you are seeking a quality unit that will last.
5,I think we are all used to buying the chargers from the phone store or grabbing a cheap one on the way out of the grocery.Well I'll never do that again! This charger has my phone fully charged all day long. Charges up your phone pretty fast.
5,Need to write a new review for 2 reasons. 1: After received the original purchase and found it "different" the customer service department made all the necessary to replace it. 2: They made a replacement order in the least amount of time imaginable and it came in perfect functionality. Now the new charger works as advertised and fast as it can be. Thanks a million for being so responsible with the customer and attend each claim in so of professional way. Thanks again.
5,Nice small addition to your car and phone.
4,Bigger than my previous one but built better. Not very flush sticks out about 1/4”
5,Love how it sticks and quick charge!
5,I use this in my car and it sits down in the plug so I can close the flip up lid that covers the connections it in my car when not in use.  It works great.
5,It chargest fast and its metal so you dont have to worry about plastic breaking or overheating.  Best car adapter i have ever bought.
5,It really does charge fast. Phone says "turbo boost connected". It's a moto g stylus. Definitely made with quality. Has some weight to it. Not like those cheap plastic chargers. Might buy another!
5,So far soo good This unit charges my phone in the turbo setting without any problem. Would reccomend
3,It should have a better hand grip. If I am not using it I pull it out and its too hard to get a good grip. It also pinches electrical  port cover. strap and eventually break it.
5,IT DOES NOT COME OUT OF THE CAR CIGARRETE LIGHTER RECEPTACLE  I HAD SOME OTHERS AND IS ALWAYS HARD TO  MAKE THEM STAY IN THE RIGHT POSITION.PLUS IS SMALL AND WONT INTERFIERE IN YOUR SPACE.CHARGE FAST!
4,Excelente
5,This is exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted a compact unit.  I am completely satisfied!
5,Little more than some of the others but worth the value. Feels sturdy it has nice weight to it and functions as it is supposed to.
5,Very Fast and Very Heavy Resistent Material
3,Sadly this isn’t even close to flush fit in my car.
5,This unit charges my phone just like the plug I use in the house. So very happy.
5,Pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product. It's not just some cheap plastic.
5,This is a great adapter to have. it is low profile and fits snuggly. I have had zero issues with this adapter and will have one in all my vehicles. It also charges quickly.
4,Would be a lot nicer if the USB charger sat flush with the vehicle chrgirging port. Or include some type of plastic washer or ring adapter to get rid of the gap between the port and lip of the USB charger. Honestly looks like a stuby little metal mushroom that pokes out of the charger port. Otherwise it's a good product.
5,Good product  perfect fit
4,Great  for my car. Looks very nice and love the glow.Metal instead of cheap plastic
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is a dual QC 3.0 charger in a very compact package.  We use Samsung phones and Google Maps or Waze for navigation and this little charger works very well to quickly charge two large phablets.  It came very nicely packaged and is clearly a well built small charger.  It's small enough that we can even close the door to the car's ashtray when not in use.
5,Update: It appears there are multiple size. Company contacted me to find out my auto and then sent one that works well. Kudos to proactive customer service.I would buy again. It would be helpful if company listed car types or other method of determining size prior to order.. Good product good customer service but needs more accurate marketing.DON"T BUY - this extends way beyond Toyota lighter socket and pops out as soon as you insert it.
4,It is heavier than most. Seems to not be plastic which I like.
5,Just received this car charger and it's fantastic! The build quality is great and its performances fantastic! I have a Samsung Note 9 with fast charging capability. This car charger charges my phone as quickly as my home charger. I highly recommend this product for anybody who is sick and tired of buying cheap car chargers and being disappointed by them.
5,Husband uses for work in a bus.  It stays positioned solidly to provide charging all day.
5,All our devices accept fast charge from this plug.  Have one in the front and one in the back of my Silverado.  4 dedicated high speed charge ports that stay in vehicle.  Perfect! Super low profile too.
5,Have had for months now works perfectly and stays in.
5,It’s great quality I like it. It’s been rocking since 3months so far 👍
5,It charges my phone so quick in a 20 minute drive and starting with 10%. It’ll be about 25-30 after the drive.
5,When it stays seated in the socket it functions really nicely. The problem is it keeps popping out of the socket enough to lose connection and I have to keep pushing it back down.edit.was contacted about the issue and I was sent out a new charger that stays in place. there was no cost to me and they kept checking in with me to make sure I was satisfied. great customer service
5,Seems rock solid.  Using in my tacoma to charge iphone.  Can't really tell how quickly the charge works but doesn't seem crazy slow or crazy fast.  Really solid construction.  I've only had it for a month or so but feels indestructible.
2,This does not charge my iWatch. I’ve tried two different chargers plugged into it that I know work and it will not charge it.
5,Perfect
5,I had a problem with my charger and when I contacted customer service they took care of the issue in a very quick and helpful way which no longer happens today. I do recommend this product not only for being of very good quality but for the good customer service provided by this company it is good to know that they do support their product.
4,Doesnt charge as far as expectedI have a 35 minute ride to work and plug my phone in around 60 in those 35 minutes it only carges to around 94%.This is probably normal but i thought I would be able to get to 100% before I got to work. Yes my phone is 3.0 compatible
5,Charge my phone fast
4,Looks and does exactly what it says. I'm sure with the corrupt phone it will change very rapidly. With mine it is just a little faster than with other cheaper made chargers.
5,This charger feels high quality. None of that light plastic that has a tendency to break.Fast charge letters appeared as soon as I plug my Galaxy S10. I can't believe how affordable it is for the. quality
4,Love it! I can close my cigarette compartment now with no problem. will buy it again. I got IPAD and iPhone 12 and it charges great!!!
4,Not as short as I was hoping though I could close the cover on my port but a tad too long still and I ordered the silver and got the gunmetal but all good so far!
4,gave it 4 stars because it didn't include a cable but it charges a hi-power phone just fine.  It does get a bit warm but not much more than a usb 2.0 equivalent
5,This little thing is awesome.  The metal shell screams durability.  Yet it's small enough to not get in the way.
5,Small but powerful
4,Very nice and solid feel. Works as advertised.Only hang up is that it doesn’t not fit flush to the socket with an awkward 4mm of it sticking out of said socket
5,ordered and seemed very durable but had to return because I  purchased the wrong size! my fault for not realizing.
5,The quality of this charger became obvious the moment I removed it from it's box.  The parts are high quality and the construction is solid.  The charger fits snug in the car's 12v socket.  Charging my OnePlus 6 is fast with no excess heating of the phone's battery.  This charger is a solid high quality product that works as advertised for a fair price.
5,Works! Be sure to get a fast charging cord as well or it will not.
5,I like this products toughness. It is HEAVY and is made very sturdy and durably. It charges my 📱 fast WHEN PAIRED WITH A FAST CHARGING CORD. It is a great product I highly recommend.
5,01-08-2020 Update: The company supplied a NEW REVISED version of the AINOPE USB Car Charger at no expense to me and it is able to stay in the Car Port much better.  My Problem is now solved and I can now give this item a 5 Star rating.  Does not fit flush in the socket guess I do need a way to remove it as needed. Great customer service from AUTO-TECH.
5,Fast charges my wireless fast charger and my phone at the same time (2014 chevy  ruze
4,Arrived quickly and was packaged well. Only had a few days but seems well made and works great.
5,Built like a tank. Does NOT fall out of socket. Buying more.
5,El tamaño es perfecto calza exacto en el puerto de 12V por lo que no sobresale y parece que fuera parte del tablero original. Tiene una luz no muy brillante azul y funciona perfecto carga rápidamente los dispositivos. Recomendado.
5,I've grown to dislike 12V plugs because every one I've used slides out over time. But not this one! This charger fits very snugly into the 12V plug. I had to pull hard to get it out. I also like the low profile of this one. When fully inserted it only sticks out slightly.
5,Not as fast charging as some I have had but it holds up better than most I have purchased.
4,So far it seems ok I just don't see any difference between my old car charger and this. My wife has ons in her car and that thing is amazing but I can't find it anywhere to purchase another one
4,It works yes.  The heft of it is nice.  I just wish it had a better fit.  I doesn't fit flush like it looks like it should.  But it works.
4,I bought two of these chargers and they work great with the exception of not staying in place in the cigarette/12v socket and this is true on both vehicles I drive. I think a small piece of double side tape is going to be needed to keep them plugged in.
5,Works GREATTTTTTTT
4,Works well.
5,Works good as advertised. Used this on a long road trip and it was fast to charge the kids tablets and phone. Way faster than the on board USB outlet in the car. Would recommend.
5,I needed a new charger for my car. I purchased this one because it worked with my phone and said it was quick-charging.  I have only used it for a couple of days so I don't know how long it will last but it feels sturdy and appears to be charging quickly. So far I am very satisfied with this purchase.
5,Works so much better than my last one.  20 mins0-30%. Happy with that.  I bought 2
5,This is as advertised in my opinion would recommend.
5,I deliver merchandise and this helps to charge faster
4,Works good
5,Works great cool blue light.Very happy with my charger!
5,These are AMAZING fast charging and low profile so it doesn't get in the way of the cup holders. I've since ordered one for every port of our cars.
5,This product works great so far! I have a OnePlus 6T and well it won't show the dash charge animation it definitely charges it as if it were using the dash charge. And it brings two usb slots. Both the same! I recommend!
5,Using this along with quick charge usb c cable in my crv and keeps my Samsung galaxy 8 almost fully charged even while streaming video with bright display settings.  Highly recommended
5,I own the previous version as well and I love both. The metal case really makes it. There are a lot of chargers out there but I really like this one. It charges quickly and reliably. It feels solid and I will probably continue to own them in the future.
5,Great little charger for car. It charges my Samsung s10 quick. Went from 0% to 90% in 30 min. Highly recommend
5,Does what it says... Fast charge!! These days anything that does what it says it can do is rare... 5 stars on this one. 🌞
5,Update: after posting my review the seller contacted me about the problem I was having where the charger kept coming out.  They sent me a replacement charger which works well and doesn't come out.  Very positive experience with their customer support.Old review:Good charging but this keeps coming out of the port due to its tapered design.
5,I bought this to use in an older truck that didn't have a usb port.So far so good.If it fails I'll come back later and bust balz.ThanksAU//(~_~)\\
5,This charger is amazing the quality you get out of it is great. At first I was skeptical of the product but after receiving it and testing it out I can say I 100% recommend it.
5,This product appears to be of a higher quality construction than similar plastic-bodied units. Fits easily and cleanly into standard charging socket; takes up little space in console of car.
5,The product was delivered on time. I plugged it in and connected my S21 Ultra and it showed that it was fast charging. It also worked for my wife's S10.
5,This little baby just fits perfectly in my car and does not bulge outwardly like other brands I've purchased. Charges my phone super fast and works great!
5,Charges an iPhone 12 Pro Max quick.Pretty discreteCan close the small cover in my older f150 and no one would know it’s there.
1,Charger delivers significantly below its claimed maximum and what the quick charge standard supports.  Here is a Quick Charge 2.0 device that supports 18w receiving half that (less than 9w) from this charger.  That hardly seem to match with the 36w this vendor claims.
5,This a very well built charger. The design is sleek and very appealing.
5,I needed a USB charger for my car that would fit in a cigarette lighter port that would also allow for the ashtray to be closed. I saw that this one was short and would be sort of flushed. I put it in the car as soon as I got it this afternoon and it looks great. Perfect fit. The ashtray closes with no problem even with a charging cord attached to it.
5,I bought it for my Tenere 700 and my phone is a Samsung S10e and it works great.
5,Works as written. Fast charge a Galaxy S9.  Doesn't sit quite as flush as I hoped. Bright socket lights just a little distracting but worth it if trying to plug in when dark.
5,I like that it's all metal charges fast and doesn't protrude much from the lighter port
5,Works as expected charges quick glows blow 10/10 would buy again
2,Lo he probado con 2 marcas de teléfono diferentes y definitivamente no es carga rápida.
4,reliable and easy to use.  Charges your device fast and does its job.Just a bit hard to pull out  because it's small.
5,Happy with my purchase
5,I’ve been surprisingly pleased with this! I have an iPhone 8 and this charges my phone almost as quickly as a wall outlet. Doesn’t seem to handle two phones at the same time but that’s been fine with me. Hopefully it has a long life.
5,what more could you want?
5,Yupquick charges my Google Pixel 3a XL and my Moto G Power. Didn't get hot. Used in Tesla Model S 12V DC power port. Yes Tesla comes with 2 USB but they are older low-power USB (1.2?)
4,Good tight fit in my socket. No longer have tonreseat the adapter every so often to ensure charging.
5,Definitely fast charges my S10+Good and solid car charger 😎
3,Seems like a quality piece but its diameter is too large to fit in my socket in my car. It will work in a different car but thats not what I needed it for.
5,Its great charged fast
5,I like that the charger is small so when you connect it to your car it doesn't look bulky. Feels heavy and well made.
4,Very well constructed. Sturdy. The only complaint I have is that it is difficult to remove the charger from the cigarette lighter socket because it fits too tight.
5,I'm very pleased with the performance of this charger.  From 5% left of battery life to min. of 60% within 15-20 min.
4,Liked it a lot . I would highly recommend this product. It is lightening fast car charger Really
5,Works great no issues. Plugged my go pro and my cellphone charger into it and it gave them a decent charge in no time.
5,Works like a charm. Just as it should.
5,This thing charges all my phones awesome and FAST. I went back and ordered one for every car I ride in.
5,Very solid device for something as small. Super fast  charge on iPhones and Androids.
2,Charger was great for a few weeks then sporadically stopped fast charging and was SLOW...I kept getting the "please use original charger" message.  I reached out to customer service and they make you jump through a bunch of hoops many of which I understand but I did get a refund.  U could have gotten a replacement but was worried the same issue might happen.
5,I've had several lighter adapters all of them say "lightening fast" or some such selling nonsense. They all only reach "charging" status and my Galaxy S8 phone warns me whenever I plug in that "we're charging more slowly than usual."But with THIS Ainope USB car charger it actually fast charges my phone (it says "Fast charging". Yay!)I'm buying a second one for my other car.
5,Really love this charger it's slim low profile design lets me open and close my ashtray The dual 3.0 charging ports keep both my devices charge fast with constant use fast charging is essential. But it's tough metal design should last forever thank you
5,Good quality and fast charging. Great value.
5,Works great with new dash mounting cell phone holder.
1,Had to force adapter into 12 volt outlet. Cannot turn in 12 volt to align USB ports. Cannot remove from 12 volt outlet by hand afraid tool will be required which will no doubt damage adapter and possibly 12 volt outlet.
5,Excellent charger. Love the low profile and high amperage. Perfect. Great fast charger or my Samsung Galaxy S8+.
4,Maybe I read the detail wrong or assumed differently... This is not a rapid charger for any of those interested in that type of charger.
1,Seems like a well built charger but unfortunately it does not charge my pixel 6 at fast charging rates. It doesn't even reach 1ah of charging. So to my pixel 6 it is a really slow charger for my device. I am disappointed in this. I have tried a few different charging cables to rule out possible defective cables but both ports yield the same exact results.I may of possibly gotten a defective unit but it seems to work fine for other devices so i am quite disappointed. But will be keeping for the use of other devices.
5,This charger is well made and looks great. The short profile works very well in your car's cigarette lighter and it looks very nice because you hardly see it. And yet it is very easy to remove if you need to.  I would recommend this to a friend.
5,So far so good no issues at all so far. We will see how it holds up as time passes but I have no complaints. I would recommend this if you are looking for a quick charger for a Galaxy S10.
4,This charger looks beautiful but workings like other in the market. Don’t expect fast charging
5,This is a very sturdy and quality product.  I enjoy using this product and it fits well in my truck.  It also does not pop out like some of the chargers I had in the past.  It is great value for the charger.
4,The spring loaded contact points are not sturdy enough and do not extend enough to provide continuous continuity. The unit looses power at times while inside the 120V socket.
1,I ordered this as I wanted something that would fit flush with the outlets in my trucks dash so that the outlet covers could still close. However the devices does not fit flush with the outlet. And it sticks out much further then the photoshopped photos on the sales page lead you to believe. I can fit my pinky finger between the outlet and the underside of the chargers brim. I realize that it would have stuck out slightly to allow for removal but it sticks out to far.However the construction of this device is great. Probably the nicest charger I've bought for my truck. The all metal body is nice. And the thing charges two iPhones 11 (1 pro max one pro) super fast which is great. As I had issue with other charges not keeping my phone charged on long drives with Apple Maps open the whole time. Some chargers couldn't keep the battery charged others would put out just enough power that the phone was draining battery equally as fast as the charger was outputting power so the battery level basically stayed the same. However with this charger my phone charges full while having Apple Maps (CarPlay) open during 2+ hour road trips.Just wish it was a bit shorter and there were not any blue lights shining out from the ports)
5,Its small and doesn't protrude from the dash giving us more room.  Heavy and sturdy.  It occasionally slides out from the socket but it still has power and doesn't move too much.
5,This is everything it was said to be. I love that it flushes even with the car so it looks like a part of the vehicle. The actual charger is a wow factor. People that get in my car have pulled it out to examine it. Its looks so official! ❤❤
5,It's made really well. I love the metal design and the lower profile it has compared to other chargers out there. It shipped and arrived really quick.
5,One of the best little chargers I have tried. It has 2 quick charging ports and both work as intended.It's sturdy and materials use to built feel like a good quality.
3,Was great until my son broke it with his bicycle wheel. Plug was in 3rd seat area for their phones.
4,Very sturdy and charges great!
5,Having a charger that didn't stick out too far was important to me because my 4WD shifter sits in front of the plug. This was perfect nearly flush mounts in the socket. Great quality fast charging great price. No regrets on this purchase at all.
5,Product is very sturdy a nice heavy feel.  Works great as a fast charger.  Planning on buying another one for my wife's car.
5,So worth the extra few bucks for this fast charging unit. Works great in the campervan.
5,Heavy duty & quality feel. Secure and almost flush fit into cigarette lighter...Both USB ports support fast charging from the cord or wireless charging dock
5,Works as intended. Does a fine job of keeping my Pixel 3 XL charged while running Waze.
5,Solid metal connectors no laminated plastic heavy feel and fast charges my huawei tablet as quickly as the big wall charger. First car charger I've had that can do this.
1,False advertisement. Tested with car on when phone was 2%. 35min later phone was only charged 37% not 80% as advertised.
5,I wanted a car charger that would fast charge on both ports. This one is well made and has worked flawlessly for over a year. No complaints and would definitely purchase again.
5,The USB port in our Honda Odyssey was terrible  buying this fixed the problem.  Low profile and as soon as you plug the phone in it shows fast charge!
5,It works
5,It has a nice weight to it and it feels well made. It charges our devices as its expected too. I would recommend this over others I have bought at 3 times the price.
5,Its low profile design is ideal for my truck since my cup holders sit right in front of the ports and allows me to plug in without losing the ability to put a drink in the holders.
5,Definitely a fast charging port and a great change from those ports that protrude out. Works well on the Samsung Note 9.
5,Great solid USB adapter.  Heard  QUALCOMM makes excellent product and it seems to be true.
5,This isn't what you pick up at the local gas station. This is much higher quality heavy and sleek. Very happy with purchase.
5,So far an awesome charger! Love how fast it charges! Love the feel of it made of metal and feels indestructible! Bought 2 one for me and one for my wife! Definitely recommend!
5,Sturdy and fast charging
5,Great quality. Charges fast. Would recommend.
5,Nice little charger that works great to charge two devices quickly. The device doesn't sit flush and sticks out a quarter of inch in order to be able grip it.
3,Been a while since I purchased from Amazon. That being said the piece I bought must be a 2nd in production. One of the USB 2 ends rides high because the tang is not the same height as the other. Always seems to be something these days whether its a crap seller or crap product.
5,This is a great low profile car phone charger. It does really provide a fast charge to my Samsung Galaxy S10 plus phone.
5,As a non smoker this is perfect to leave in the cigarette port and it doesn't interfere with the closing of the console. Fast charges my galaxy note 8 on the drive with an extra charge port for a passenger. May order another one for the back seat
5,This is a great power supply. It works faster than the high power in home 110V unit.Now days I just put the phone on the charger contact charger in the Truck. Note: this unit powers the same high speed surface contact charger I use in home through the USB cable.
2,Use on long trips to run gps and audio works fine until I reach destination. The phone has no charge in it. Have to charge battery for use out of auto.
4,I liked the nicer quality of this one. Our audi and vw ports were a bit too shallow for this to fit flush.
5,Got it for the fast charging and it actually registered on my note 9 as fast charge seems like a great quality product
5,Was looking for something to charge my I Pad and my phone fast. This was it! Charges both things very fast and extremely durable! Completely metal! Have to get another for my second car!
5,Working as intended so far thought it was not fast charging at first but I replaced the cable and it worked fine..
5,A really well made compact Dual USB power adapter well worth the money.
5,This device works well and is convenient for charging two items simultaneously.
5,Quick charge & play and the body made with metal strong  and solid. I Recommended.
5,Fist right into the plug and does fast charging.. It doesnt stick out like others. I would get another one.
5,Great low profile adapter fits in the very shallow lighter port in the Ferrari California.  Looks great works well to power my phone and wireless charging pad in the car.  Highly recommend!
5,Solid build excellent software for charging.  If you're still using old chargers it's probably time to ditch them and upgrade to QC 3.0 chargers (wall or auto).
3,Does not fast charge period. Mfc claims 3.0 amps.  Tried both ports in multiple vehicles with multiple charge cords. Previously owned adapters for less money worked in all locations. Product is rugged being all metal. Nothing else good to say.
3,I love this charger when is works... problem is it keeps pushing out from the port. So I'm driving down the road thinking my phone is charging and find out it's not. There is a sweet spot where the charging is AWESOME but the device staying in that sweet spot is not likely to happen for long
5,Good quality... charges very quickly... would purchase again as needed
2,Charges just as fast (actually normal speed) as my regular $5 charger nothing special about this overpriced product. Maybe my iPhone XS is not compatible with this "fast charger"? I don't know. It feels heavy and good quality tho but that won't charge my phone faster it is just for the looks. Oh and also it doesn't sit flush
2,Fast mobile charging..
4,Maintains power to iPhone while using GPS. Would recommend to prospective buyers for this use.  Slim compact comparable with iPhone galaxy and other major phones.
5,Great product wish I would've bought this item sooner. Fast charging on the go for my galaxy s21.
5,Seems very sturdy.
5,Went for a cross country road trip over the holidays and this worked great for us liked having the dual ports.
5,This does what it advertises ... maybe even more. I have been shocked at how quickly my Samsung S8 is charged when plugged into this car charger. Super impressed.
5,Quick charges my Samsung S9 like the stock charger it came with!!!! Awesome product!!
5,This item works great foe charging mine and my wifes phone while riding. its small form factor is what I need to fit in the fairing of my bike as to not scratch my tank.
5,I got this for a wireless car charger that required a 3.0 charger.  It's nothing fancy but it works like it supposed to and appears to be made to last.
5,If you are irritated by those cheap wobbley slow cigarette chargers buy this one.  Absolutely great quality and fast charging.  Much faster than the vehicle's USB ports and this way you dont have the car manufacturer keeping tabs on you.
5,After buying cheep convienence store charger this one is a huge step up in quality. It charges much faster and is low profile
5,This is a life saver when on long road trips my phone can now quickly charge instead of taking forever with a regular charging port. 😊
5,This arrived on time in good condition and has been handy for the back seat of our auto.
5,First few days and already way better than my previous car charger. Double quick charge that charges samsung galaxy note 10 and note 20 ultra pretty quickly.
5,I like the LED since the charger is on the floor deep under the dash.
5,This thing is a surprisingly useful car upgrade
5,I haven't been using the charger for long but so far so good! It surely charged quickly better than other car chargers.
5,I wanted two USB ports from one outlet.  This USB car charger was exactly what I was looking for.
4,Charges very well but if you have a case on your phone the length of the charging end might not be long enough
5,This item arrived on time and was well packaged! The item was as described and of good quality.
5,It fits in outlets. USB cables fit in it. Electrons dance through the wires.
3,Unit was nice heavey all metal had a good well made feel to it. However it did not work on my Oneplus 6t. although it was charging it did not go into fast charging or as Oneplus would say  "Charging rapidly" so I returned it.
5,Excellent product all around.  It charges my iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 faster than any other car charger I have ever used.
5,Fast charges my LG G6. Just what I wanted. Would order again.
4,Going to use it for a bit before commenting
5,It fit perfect better than other charger that fit loose. It charge s10 galaxy 1hr20min ¹⁰⁰٪ .50٪ in 30min.
4,Well built product.  It performs quite well with two outputs that share the power.
5,Ultra fast charger and reasonable.
4,Seems to be doing it’s job
5,Love it it does fast charge on both cord plugins! Just as described fits perfectly not sticking out just enough to take it out.
4,Have to pull the cord half out to get it to work.
5,Works great.  Charges both our phones quickly.
5,Bought 2 of these for 2 of my vehicles love that they are not bulky.  Definitely worth the price.
5,My last adaptor died. This one has worked very well and I think it charges faster than my last one.
5,Metallic body small and fast charging. I can't ask for more.
4,Good price worked cheaper than most stores
5,Excelente. Un producto con materiales muy finos. La entrega en Colombia fue menor a la programada inicialmente.
5,The only non-motorola car charger that turbo charges my devices feels solid and fits snugly and will not fall out.
5,Does exactly what it says.  I got a nice usb-c cable and I'm getting almost 3 amps of charge to my galaxy s20.
4,It does what it's supposed to do.Difficult to see at night
5,I like how small these car chargers are. Perfect for my car goes with it perfectly.
5,Looks good in the car and has held up well.
4,Just a little too loose for my 2013 Ford Explorer so I added a small strip of duct tape.
5,Fast and affordable charger. I like it.
5,I previously had a cheap plastic car charger from the dollar store that didn't fit in the port and charged slowly.  I bought a Note 10+ and wanted accessories that provided fast charging and looked better. This doesn't disappoint.
5,It's slim and it works as a 3.0 each
5,I am so happy to have found this because I couldn't charge my phone with any charger cord & with this i can use my own charger.
5,Like the high quality all metal works great charges SOOOO FAST but BEWARE! YOU NEED TO USE A GOOD QUALITY CABLE LIKE YOUR ORIGINAL CABLRE IF NOT IT DOESNT WORK PROPERLY. Obviously not the chargers fault. GREAT PRODUCT!!!
5,Feels very well built I've been using this charger for 6 months now and it still charges everything super fast.
4,Works great on charging and feels solid. Only thing is. It is not really flushed just FYI. Other than that works great
5,It looks pretty good. I haven’t use it much. Once I know I will add more reviews!
5,It fits snugly in the socket and has power to spare 👍🏼  The ones from wal mart bit even close to this one!!!!
2,Bought for two to charge at one time after moving the charger I had to another car.  This charger kept one  iphone at 40% while using with GPS over a two hour period. Kept second phone only being used for occasional texting at 40%. Both phones started out around 40% charged. Brought my other charger back for another trip same parameters - charged both phones to 98% when trip over in just under 2 hours. Getting rid of the two I bought.
5,As described good for daily use 👌
5,The quality of this charger is great. It's exactly what I needed for my car and it also charges my phone fast.
5,It's a very clean sleek low-profile charging port could not be happier with the way it looks and handles.
5,This was just what i needed.  It’s flush with the outlet surface instead of sticking out!
5,Great item!Fats charge iPhone and Samsung phones. Totally worth the price.Thank you 😊
5,Well built and strong
5,I am very picky about electronic design and function and I love this product. I like that the lights are dim and that the case is strong and hold perfectly into a variety of different car outlets. Great job Ainope!
5,The plug in my explorer barely holds things like these inside. This one has stayed put and never backed out. Quick charge also works great.
5,Works great in my Tacoma. Doesn’t pop out on its own like some of my other car charger ports.
4,So far so good it's small but has some weight to it and feels like it's a good quality charger.
5,Well Made . Charges fast.  Great product and value.
5,I like it  I just needed a way to charge my phone in my work vehicle.
5,Works just like in the description. Currently using in my car and even better wireless fast charger. Must buy again and recommend.
5,get usb 3 in your vehicle
5,Does exactly what it says! Works great for my Note 9!
5,Charges my device very quickly. I also like that I can charge two at one time
3,Great quality item. Made well of sturdy material. The thing sticks out of my lighter socket 1/2 in. Pictures make it look more flush against the socket.  Oh well into the junk drawer it goes.
5,Great product charges my phone in the car wirelessly fast.
5,I use this in my car...works great. Am able to charge more than one thing at a time.
5,Definitely a quick charger that actually works
5,I think it's a great one and small in size
5,Does what I wanted  good purchase!
5,good product  will buy again if necessary
5,Great product that looked exactly like on the picture. It’s a good quality material! Worth the money.
5,Best car charger I've bought by far. Fits tight in receptacle and 2 FAST charge ports! Whats not to love.
5,I instantly liked the solid feel to the charger.  It fits snug and secure.  Other similar chargers tend to come loose and lose the connection but not this one. Very satisfied.  Thumbs up across the board.
5,Looks like it was factory when in place in my pre-USB Lexus Sports Coupe
5,Charges from dead to full in roughly 100 mins. Super fast
2,Bought this to charge my Note 9.  I got it because its small made with a metallic casing (aluminum I think) and because it advertises "fast charge".Well- it is NOT a fast charger. It takes 3x longer to charge my phone than my old charger and that's only if I don't use it while charging.I do NOT recommend purchasing this unless you have a low-powered phone.
5,Finally a true dual fast charger. Feel high quality.
5,Excellent car charger
4,It’s a little small for some car jack but it work
5,a real fast charge good build quality.
5,Works well
5,It is a nice piece of equipment
5,Close to car surface  and with the Ainope cable it is a fast charge. The light on charger openings helps you load up in the dark.
5,Works great! I checked it compared to my previous QC 2.1 charger. My phone charge time showed improvement by about 10 percent. Feels sturdy and fits nice and flush to look like it's almost factory.
5,Solidly built and great quality.
3,This seems like solid construction and it's small. It's heavy not lightweight plastic. Both ports charge my LG v10 at fast speed when it's properly seated. That's the problem though. It fits so loosely in the cigarette lighter of my Hyundai elantra that it is easily dislodged. I may have to do as another reviewer did and jam something in with it to make it stay in.
5,This car charger is great! I've used it with two phones and it does an amazing job with fast charging. It sits flush with the panel. I have not had any problems. Great buy!
4,Smaller then i thought but like
4,I loved the two device capability.
1,DOA does not work.  No damage to box or content but it was DOA.  One could say it was just bad luck to receive a DOA item but I call that QA issue.  I might update the review once replacement arrives.
4,Nice only concern it fit loose on car so you pull IT out too esely
5,Very good product
5,I like the fast charging compatibility.
5,Quality build with a low profile that allows me to close my ashtray.  Super fast charge with my S7 phone.
5,Works great heavy duty quick charge!
5,Works as expected no problems. Was a it pricy but so far worth the money.
1,Looks goodCool lights but I can literally watch my phone's lose their charge while it is pulsating like it is doing a super fast job don't even know how it is possible
4,Used for s8 plus
5,Works just how it’s supposed to. No complaints whatsoever. Would absolutely recommend it.
5,really awesome super fast charge time fits snug in cigarette lighter port not big and bulky stays out of the way ready good product
1,This is a hazard. I had connected to my truck and charging my Bluetooth headset. Stepped out for 10 minutes and came back to melted cables. This never happened with any of myOther charging heads. Would not buy again
5,Very compact plus 2 fast charging ports
5,It really said fast charging in my A51 galaxy.
5,Great quality the fast charging is really FAST.
5,This thing works amazingly! IT ACTUALLY DOES “FAST CHARGE”!!! It even says it on my cellphone! Otherdargers it would just say charging might get another
5,Love that this charger fits flush into the adapter.  Nothing sticking out.
5,I didn’t really think that if 2 devices were plugged into this charger that both would be equally fast but to my surprise both devices charged very fast pretty happy with this purchase for sure!
5,Heavy duty construction flush fit. Fast charges my galaxy s9. Extremely happy with my purchase.
5,Small sturdy works great.
4,It was exactly what I needed! My kids are happy therefore I’ll happy!
5,Solid fast charger
5,This car charger charges my phone fast! I like the metal housing and the blue light showing the power is on.
5,Charging faster than others.
5,As long as you use a one meter (or 3 foot) cord this unit charges like a beast!  The flush fit fits perfectly and has a clean and discrete look.
5,Very Durable an Quick charging"Also Great Qualify
5,So far it works perfectly. The only future concern I have is how well it deals with the desert heat I live in.
5,this has a fast charge feature as advertised. good product.
5,This is awesome. I thought my phone battery needed replacement but it was just my anemic old cheapo charger. I get a full battery in an hour drive. I can get 35% from 0% in about 15 minutes in my iPhone 8.
5,Nice low profile charger chargers my phone (Galaxy S8 Plus) with no errors nice subtle color charges pretty fast even when Waze is running  it charges just not as fast but then nothing does with GPS on.
5,Fast charging works great with samsung s21. Highly recommend
5,Fits my late model Honda nicely and Fast charges my Blackview 9900 through a Redbean wireless car mount.  Would buy again.
5,Deft worth every Penny amazing minimalistic  design and works amazingly
5,Simple product. It actually fast charges your phone.  Seems to be the same as plugging the phone into your wall at home
5,Bought 4 of these after I bought the first one put them in all my vehicles they charge my kids iPads faster than the house wall charger!
5,Bought this for a new second car.  Love the slim profile it almost looks like the old ligher outlet was instead a usb charger.  Works great
5,Fast charging! I have Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and it works great!
5,Works very well especially in such a small package.There isn't much I can say beyond that.  If you need QC3 in a vehicle especially 2 at once buy this.
5,Works great for my 2005 Outback. I needed a charger to fit inside the ash tray and close. This works really well.
5,The metal feels solid & well-made & the blue light makes it easy to find at night. Great product!
5,The company was amazing to deal with. They sent me an upgraded charger which works amazing. It seats veryvery well and charges fast.  Highly recommend it now after the "fix"
5,Item is exactly as described.  Works great when charging two devices at once and is very unobtrusive in a 12v outlet.  Would buy again in a heart beat.
5,So far this charger has been great! Works as advertised and no problems with overheating. Definitely recommend!
5,Works as expected
3,Charges phone great! If it would stay in the socket. I'm not aure if there isnt enough spring pressure on the grounding posts or if there is just overkill spring pressure on the positive post. It will not stay connected for very long. Spring pushes it to the max then if you hit a bump it disconnects.
5,Make sure that it is fully inserted and clicked into the socket. Of the 3 I have in my van one of the sockets did not work with the charger.This thing charges fast!!!!
5,Fast charges iPhone 11 Pro as described. The phone does heat up a bit but to be expected to a degree.
5,Works perfectly in my 2013 Ford Fusion sturdy built usb has a strong connection and charges my LG stylus 3 very fast
5,Small and compact. Charges fast.
2,Bought on the strength of reviews and that it claimed to be a fast charger. It is anything but fast. Just looked a the other 2 star reviews. They all pretty much agree. Off to buy an Anker - their stuff is sold.
5,Works good
2,I guess these things are listed rated like little amplifiers that are listed 2000 watts but seem to have dropped a decimal point and are really 20 watts.  This thing charged my phone forever...slow!Also it is so small that once you push it into the socket you will need a tool to get it out! It is Rolling around under my seat or I would toss it out the window....
5,very good it loads very fast super recommend
5,Very good construction and charges as fast as I had expected. Size is perfect for my Mercedes ML 350 socket I am able to close the ashtray and drink holder.
5,Really like how quick it charges my Motorola phone and anker speaker.
5,Looks nice and charges quickly
2,Dual USB ports for this item was the reason I bought this item however when you plug in your USB-A cable in one of the ports is actually higher then normal by about 2 mm which barely makes contact with your cable.  As this is for a car bumps on the road will loosen the cable enough so that the charge does not work.  Checked the second item and it is the same issue.  And now this item is not available.  As you can see in the photos look down the insides sides of the dual port where you see where the orange is located against the silver lining of the sidewall.  they are of different heights one picture for each side view if that helps
5,This is a very high quality item. I like that it's all metal very low profile and fast charging. I would buy another anytime.
5,I bought 4 of these chargers and they are a great charger charges quickly quality build and look great they dont stick out and stay in nice and snug
5,Using it for 40 days10 Hours Daily because I drive for Uber..Still working Pretty good with no complaints Quick Charge my Work Tablet and Cellphone at the same time.
5,Really quality piece and has a nice weight to it. Fits right in and very functional. Do recommend
5,I can charge two USB C devices at a time and it remains cool
5,Doesn't fit sung it cuts in an out when I hit bumps.I would imagine if my port was straight down instead of come out it would work better for me
5,Arrived on time great charger
5,Very well made and charges quickly
5,Charges quicker then most chargers I've used before
5,Love these compact chargers. Have one in all of my vehicles including RV and boat.
5,Would recommend.
5,Works flawlessly
5,solid charger both mechanically and electrically.  very good quality.
1,I was so excited from see iing the positive reviews and I was so confident that it is the best car charger but it can not even charge the small 2000mh battery of my phone. It shows 20 hours to fully charge from 0 to 100. The funniest thing is my phone had 17 percent of battery left and after I plugged it in it kept reducing the battery percentage and soon the phone shut down and I was using that for navigation. I have tried it with multiple phones like a Samsung galaxy s8+ & an iPhone 8 & an iPhone 6s. I request the seller to either send me a good replacement so I get my confidence back on them or refund me so that I can go and buy a better charger.
5,Very well made.  Designed to hold up over plastic models.  Durable and small enough that it conceals inside a vehicles ash tray.
1,Not a fast charger just a regular charger
5,Material de muy buena calidad y excelente para carga rápida
5,I like that this fits flush to the wall inside my console
5,it just works the low profile fit is good.
1,I have a device (Rfinder P2) that requires QC 3.0 to charge properly and I use it in two vehicles.  I bought this charger and an Anker to see if cheaping out was worth it.  Well its not.  The Anker works just fine and charges my device as expected and required.  This one does not.  Not much else I can say...
5,Needed a couple of these for my Audi Q5 which doesn't have USB ports.  Nice and solid metal design and so far they haven't stopped working!
5,Does not cause stereo to hum like cheaper products.  All metal so sturdy but does stick out further than I would have liked.
5,Thing works great and it looks like it’s built by nasa! High quality from what I can tell better then anything on the shelves at Walmart or Target
5,Very good.  Would buy again
5,Product works with two apple devices charging then completely and quickly.
3,Well it doesn't light up like it does in the picture so that was a disappointment. Also the directions tell you to not leave it plugged in when you're not in the vehicle so that is a pain. It charges up my phone so it's good for that.
5,I have only used this for a few days but so far so good. Charges very fast.  Low profile allows me to close the counsel on my GL450.
5,excellent
5,Flawless.  Quick charge as advertise.  Works with Samsung A50.  Sturdy and well built.
5,Good quality works great
5,Amazing. Fast charging. Fits nice and tight. Sleek looking.
5,Works perfectly no issues
5,Good power output. Good build quality.
5,First this does not include a cord not sure if that is in the description or not. Charges fast feels solid Ships quickly. Compact and works great.
5,Works well even with 2 devices plugged in has fast charging feature
5,Love it so far it works as intended.
5,Fits well in my car and is very conveniently sized customer support is also very easy to work with and helpful
5,very sturdy I had a plastic one similar still works. This thing looks heavy duty
5,It is all metal no plastic like some cheap chargers and it put out plenty of charging current.  Have used it on iPhone 8 and iphone Xs.
5,The product is great came on time price was great
5,This charger works great.  Charges our Galaxy phones super quick.
5,Works as Advertized
5,This is perfect for my Jeep!
5,Works great solid build fast charges my Samsung s9 plus and tablets with no problems.  Doesn't appear to be getting hot either.
5,Will produce a fast charge with a Galaxy S8+ even using a wireless charging base.
5,Great buy charging just like in the house fast.
5,Ok
5,Super fast charging. Fits almost perfectly flush.
5,This charger adapter works great! When paired with a fast charging cord it charges my phone very quickly while I'm driving. I love it!
5,useable and as advertised
5,Very compact. Work great in my XT4 console as I setup up my own wireless charger and saved me a lot of money from factory cost
5,it works fast
5,Works great and heavy duty
4,so far so good
2,Bought this based on the user reviews which were good. So it arrives and I plug it into my Jeep's 12v outlet. Lights up nice...but doesn't do anything else. Tried my GPS phone a digital camera and a tablet. It won't charge any of the electronics I own. It seems well made overall very solid with a bit of heft. Not sure if I received a dud but pretty disappointed overall. It's not even worth the trouble to do a return on something this cheap. Just have to look elsewhere.
5,I like the flush design and how fast it charges. I do know you can get cheaper in local stores but ... amazon prime.
5,Product worked as expected
5,This thing is really cool. Looks futuristic. Pretty heavy dusty feeling and charges 2 devices fast!
5,🤙🏼
5,Match description. Timely delivery
5,Very nice low profile charger.  Does the job it's supposed do ….. and so far it's dependable.  Not a budget buster.
5,Changing is fast
5,works great! not the fastest charge that I have noticed from my car but no issues at all and a great and quality build.
5,Works just as described.
5,They love it.
3,Feels very solid and well built lights look great. Not sure why but it would not charge 2 phones at once
5,Strong metal feel charges quickly and sits nearly flush.  Exactly what I was hoping for. I got 1 for my mom as well.
5,Actually does fast charge!!
5,Love this little guy. Works just as good as my original manufacturer fast charger but much smaller. High quality and heavy feel. Just what I needed
3,This is a good product the only problem is you cannot close the cover on it when it's in your car or in a truck.
5,Great buy and includes two fast charge ports. Works good so far.
5,Works fine
5,Finally!Actual quality!
3,Charges my phone very fast in my car  however you do have to make sure the device is in the port !
5,works for my moto g5s turbo charge and my wife's samsung quick charge and at the same time pretty great product.
5,Fit well mostly flush to the dash. Charges very quickly
5,Add more units been fast charged at same time happy with this purchase.
5,This charger is good quality and does not effect the radio when used in my truck
5,No problems so far
5,Pricey but I like it.
5,Heavy duty and great quality compared to all plastic
5,Great little charger. I purchased to be able to offer charging to my riders and it's worked great so far.
5,Works as promised.
5,very good
5,Very nice product. Charges much quicker than anything I had before. Highly recommend!
5,Metal heavy solid.  Very nice looking.  Best of any car charger plug I've seen.
5,Works well
1,Bought this for my car's wireless charging pad that recommended it if I wanted fast charging and it worked for about 5 seconds until it just goes back to regular wireless charging. Heats up A LOT even on regular charging.
5,I've been having this for a couple of weeks and this is a performer. The quick charging works well and i highly recommend it.
5,I haven't used it yet but if it works I will be happy to have 2 charging outlets to charge many different gadgets!
2,There is something wrong with these chargers. As time goes on the side prongs become too weak to hold the charger in to the correct depth such that the back prong stays connected. In both of my hondas these push themselves out of the socket enough to stop working and have to be held in in order to charge. I'm having to buy a new set after only a year. Have to say poor design or quality..
5,It IS a lightning charger just like it says. Very nice quality. All metal. Definitely recommend this product!
1,Let me say first that I purchased this charger because I like the idea that it should fit flush in the power port.  Not to the problems 1) It does not fit all the way into the power port not fitting flush as described.  It sticks out about 1/4 inch when all the way in.  2) It does not stand connected to the power port.  Within two blocks it has vibrated out enough to lose contact with the center contact in the power port.Please see both pictures. the first one shows the car charger pushed all the way in.  As far as it will go.  Notice the red/pink lights in the USB plugs it has power.  The second picture was taken after driving just two blocks less that 1 tenth of a mile and it has slowly come out enough to have lost power.  Notice the red/pink lights are out it has vibrated out enough to not be touching the power ports back/center connections.  Returning this charger for a better one.
4,Muy bueno
5,Good
5,charges really fast and want another.
5,Product was just what I needed.
5,Excellent car adapter.

1,This site can't be reachedaniope.com's DNS address could not be found. Diagnosing the problem.DNS_PROBE_POSSIBLE

5,Works great so far.
5,Fast charges my galaxy s7 edge. Doesn't stick out too far so I can close the ashtray door. I like it.
4,Like
5,Great product
5,Muy bueno
5,So far so good fast charges S8+.
5,Feels like a high quality product and it chargers faster than any charger I've ever had
1,It is not a fast charger at all takes for ever to charge my phone at least 20 mins just to charge a 5% of my iphone
3,I bought 4 of these for Xmas for family members. The only problem I have noticed is that it doesn't stay seated in my Maxima. It slowly slides out enough not to light and work.
5,Love this fast charger. Easy to see the glowing lights when plugging in my cable. Charges fast!
5,Works great. Does just what they advertised. My regular car charger wasn’t powerful enough for the automatic car phone mount.
5,Its compact and its made of good material metal through and through. I am very happy.
1,Bought it to charge things with usb. It won’t go all the way in because it is too big and now it is stuck. I’ll probably have to break the outlet or the charger removing it if I can.
5,I have Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ and this car charger works very FAST.  I am glad I bought it!!
5,Works great and charges fast :)
5,Nice low profile quick charge.  Nice to be able to charge most newer devices.
5,Does not fit my toyota tacoma
5,First one I got was defective. Although inconvenient it was redeemed by a replacement which worked as advertised.
5,It charges all our devices. It’s a great product
5,Sweet dual usb charger.  3.0 charges fast. Well made and nice looks. I  bought two!
5,I am able to use this in my Tesla Model 3's 12v outlet with the tray!
1,the light is annoying. otherwise its fine i guess but its really annoying.
2,Although the AINOPE USB car charger seems well made it does not fit in the power outlets in my 2014 Toyota Highlander; it's too fat! In the description for the product there is no mention of the circumference. I am returning it for a refund.
5,It works good. I would buy it again.
5,Seems to work
2,Not any faster than a regular 4 watt wall charger for iPhone. iPad wall charger charges iPhone A LOT faster bc of more wattage so that’s why I bought this. Takes hours to charge a phone and can’t handle charging iPad while using. It’s heavy feeling durable but beyond that no other benefit. Just get a usb c.
5,What can I say I plugged it in it worked and continues to work. No problems here.
3,Doesnt allow you to have 2 cables plugged in at the same time one sticks out further than the other
5,Works well even better than I expected.
5,Charges a lot faster than the standard plug in the wall.. Strong metal durability.
5,So flush! I love it.
5,This charger is amazing  works better than the samsung factory direct equipment  that comes with the phone
5,Great product
5,Great short car charger.  Fits almost flush but enough "stick up" to pull it out.
5,Great product
5,So far it works well.
2,It does charge well but it unfortunately just won't stay seated properly in our Mazda Cx-9. It does fit our Hyundai Veloster.
5,Nice for all vehicles and durable
3,Great. But I ordered red and got black color.
2,Had to return two of these as they would not stay connected in the 12v outlet in their respective vehicles. Almost as if the unit is a centimeter or two short to maintain a solid connection at the bottom of some 12v receptacles. This issue occurred in a 2014 Jeep Cherokee and a 2018 Chevy Impala. It did however fit perfectly in a 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The aluminum and finish looked good on the product but ultimately it's useless in some 12v sockets.
5,Sleek as shown in picture
1,I have a 2005 mazda 3 and it works like it should it fast charges and everything just fine. The kicker was that it got stuck in the outlet. It went in just fine and when I try to pull it out it wouldn't. It also didn't help that it was almost flush with the panel. So yeah it's nice and discrete but there's not enough clearance to grab behind it and pull it out. I had to get some pliers and once I had a nice firm hold on it with the pliers it was completely stuck and ended up pulling the entire section of my dash out because I went ape mode on it pulling.
5,Great product and charges really fast.
5,Really a fast charger im satisfied
1,Bought 3 of these. Plugged in to my car and worked fine until I unplugged it. Whole thing died. 2nd one I put in my big rig truck. Worked for 24 hrs b4 one side crapped out. At this rate probably won't get another day's use before the other half craps out. Haven't used #3 yet.
5,Charges smartphones/ phablet easily just what I needed in half the time as lower amp. Chargers.
5,GOOD
5,Dual charger for my car was very well worth it
5,Low profile and quick charge.
5,Very good! Fits a 2007 Mazda 5 perfectly and charges pretty well. Recommended.
5,Liked it so much that I bought three of them
5,Works great in my Toyota Corolla.  Use it for iPhone charging. Very fast charge.
5,Perfect to charge multiple devices in the same time.
5,Awesome little gadget! Good power supply to use with a USB cable or wireless charger!
5,I like it sturdy & solid
5,Absolutely perfect fit excellent look.
5,Perfect fit. Almost invisible.
5,Works as advertised. All metal construction on the outside.
5,Works as it should. Great customer service.
5,Charges phone FAST and RELIABLE. Second one i buy for my cars...
3,Great when charging direct with cable but my in car wireless charger would not work with this product.
1,I bought this charger hoping it would work well for my Pixel 2 XL  and my wife's pixel 3.  It did not.  We did find another from the same maker (USB C Car Charger 36W Super Mini AINOPE All Metal Fast USB Car Charger PD&QC 3.0 Dual Port Car Adapter Compatible with iPhone 12/12 Pro/Max/12 Mini/iPhone 11/Pro/Max/XR/XS/Max/8 Galaxy S21/20/10/9).  It does provide a rapid charge.  Happy with it not som much with the one I'm reviewing.  Returned it quickly.
5,Small. Seems good quality. Fits perfectly in a 2019 accord. Easy to take in/out
5,No complaints. Superb quality. Indeed a fast charger.
5,Just what I wanted good fast charging at a descent price
5,works well good quality
5,Very durable and efficient.
5,A very convenient charger that perfectly performs its functions!
5,Feels really solid.  But a second one because I liked them.
1,I ordered this item twice and both were detected and did not work.
5,I do not regret it a bit. Very great purchase
5,Actually charging my cell phone not just keeping it alive while using waze or other apps.
5,Love the dual USB ports.  Very handy!!
5,So far working great fast charge is great!
5,Good quality and construction. Provides the power needed for my Samsung Galaxy S8.
5,Works great. Looks nice in my car. Doesn't stick out.
1,It wont charge ! I used it fir my i phone 12.
5,Great product works great and having 2 quick charge ports makes it nice too
2,Stopped working a couple months outside of the return window. Otherwise it was a great charger while it worked.
1,The specs say it charges 3amps in each port.The instructions (see photo) tell the truth: only 1.5amps per port.Save your money and buy one of those fifty cent car chargers at the gas station.
5,It works great.
5,Charges super quick attach it to the right wire and OMG
1,I tried this and was expecting to get super fast charging out of it but I didnt. It does seem like decent quality but just didnt provide super fast charging only fast charging.
1,This is the second one I've been through. Same problem with both. They feel great and look great but both times one port has quit working all together.
5,Absolutely satisfied with this purchase I would definitely recommend this product!!
2,I gave an OVERALL rating of 2 ⭐️⭐️ stars because the charger I received fits EXTREMELY TIGHT into the 12V plug and It may cause damage to the socket when pulling it out.  Otherwise the size is great 👍 and I like that it is all metal.
5,As described. It is fast charging and feels like it was built very well.
5,this is great plenty of power! and a great fit too
3,This is a good product it does what it says but for the money I can get more.
5,Fast changing and works like a charm
5,A quality product solidly built. Fast charges a Note10+5G without heating up. Recommended.
5,Excellent Smart Charger. Very consistent. Highly Recommend!!!
5,It's low profile which is really nice
5,This looks sleek and compact!
5,Good Product
2,Like a lot of other users say: it works great when it stays in. Which it doesn't a lot of the time. The vendor says on the Answers section that it's a production defect but I was never offered a replacement. If I were you I wouldn't risk it.
5,The best USB charger you can find here
5,Love this charger.
5,Great product I highly recommend it to everyone !

5,Got here quick. Works great  stays cool like info says.
3,One side quit working already
5,love it
2,Tried in a new corvette. The same or less power than the built-in USB plugs. For a Google Pixel 4. Tried multiple USB cords and multiple charging outlets in the car.  Still medum-ish power at best.  See picture for max speed achieved.
5,It is a quality product and works very well.
5,Quality product but stock is rarely available.
5,Works like it should . Recommend it
5,Works fast make charging fast in an older vehicle
5,In my car it's fast charging. really good.
5,Just perfect for what I needed thank you so much
5,Very fast charge and capacity
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Bought the new one to upgrade and bought the wrong model I wanted the one with the Gauge. Very disappointed that it burned out on me.The lights aren't on and it refuses to charge.I use it daily for 2 or 3 Motorola Ace Phones.The older version gets hot but will pop up and cool itself off...Very disappointed I spent for the upgrade and it was inferior to their older model.I love that it's slimmer but doesn't seem to be better.
5,Just like it states fast charger really happy with the purchase.
5,Fast charging!  Looks great!  Happy with product.
5,Built tough and really does the job!
5,It does what is says! Amazing
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Perfect for my truck!
5,You can't beat it for the Price.
5,Does the job of fast charging

3,Does not sit flush in the socket.
5,Very fast charger

5,No cord but a nice charger.
5,Best dual port 3.0 charger.
5,Great fast charge unit
5,Fast charging and well built.
5,Works great for my s10+
5,Fast shipping  Works great.  As described.
5,Buen articulo. Corresponde con la compra
5,Fast shipping fast charging. Great product.
5,very low profile. seems durable. great charger.
5,I like the fast charging
1,I tested this charger at 1amp and 2 amp load and it dropped to about 4.78volts.  That is not a good sign and it not making the claimed charging output and ultimately speeds it claims.  I compared with a Crave dual output 2.4amp charger and it easily maintained 5.14 volts at both 1 amp and 2 amp load.  And costs less than half as much $6.45 versus $14.99. NOT recommended.  I'm returning mine and will buy more Craves
5,Great quality
5,QC 3.0 charger metal well built.
5,Nicely made.
5,Charges in less than an hr
5,So far so good.
5,Very good product I love
5,Heavy solid build. Charges really fast.
1,This is a sleek car charger but it doesn't fast charge. My phone tells me to get a better charger to charge the phone faster. I wouldn't recommend this product if you're buying it for fast charging.
1,At first I thought I have european lighter plug in my old mercedes but then I decided to buy cheapest adapter available on Amazon to give it another chance. The other charger fits and works perfectly. Be aware!
5,Slimsleek & fast charging! Great product!
5,Nice product
5,Great Charger!!Well made!!
5,Works very good. Fast charge
5,Great product low profile.
5,Works great.  Charges quickly.
5,Very well made. High recommend
5,Works perfectly
2,Very slow charging for iPhone. Returned it and bought an Anker car charger which works very well
5,Small and compact works great
5,So far so goid
5,It’s worth what you pay for.
5,Excelente cargador! Carga rápido.
5,Very Durable
5,excellent build qualityand functions great!
5,👍
5,Works great and looks grest
2,As others have noted only one of the two charger slots worked in both of the two chargers I bought at the same time.  Very disappointing because the build quality otherwise seemed good and the depth of these chargers allowed me to close the tray door in my E46 BMW.
5,Works great
5,Looks durable good quality
5,charges good
5,Fast charger!
5,The best choice ever.
5,Works as described.
5,Great charge socket.
5,Wonderful idea for gift.
5,Works great.
5,NA
5,Excellent
5,Well built and charges phones fast
5,Works perfect
1,Bought this for my wireless charger.  It appears to be defective.  I followed the link to there customer service site.  Opened chat and left 2 messages over 10 days and no reply.  I gave you a chance and you blew it.  Returning this.
2,Hardware is very sturdy but it fails at the mission it was purchased for.  It charges my phones no faster than the $2 plug I got at the gas station!
5,Works as advertised
5,perfect car charger
5,👌
5,Excellent ..Works well
5,Seems to work well
5,Works great.
5,Works fantastically well.
5,It works great
5,Great charger
5,Fits flush
1,I bought two of these five months apart. The first one failed like many other reviews stated where only one port worked. The second one I purchased failed within a month both ports did not charge. I reached out to customer service regarding the first order and was sent a replacement very quickly. That replacement also completely failed. That makes 3 failed units within 6 months. Seems like more than a fluke.
5,Compact and works as expected.
1,Product is discharging my phone instead. Either doesn't work for Samsung Note 20 ultra or I received a defective product.I left home on 95% charged. Plug my phone for an 1hr 10mins drive.  Opened my maps for navigation. Got to my destination on a 77% charge.Quality of material seems good. Just didn't work effectively.
5,Awesome
1,One charger didn't work at all. The other one only one port worked. Very poor quality.
5,Carga muy rápido
5,Good product
5,Nothing to dislike
5,Works great
5,Bad ass
2,Well okay while it lasted. Dead after 4 months of use and that is with minimal amounts of removing the unit and plugging in cables.
5,all good
1,This is nothing more than a charger.  It is not a fast charger.
5,Great!
5,Works well...
1,It is too big around. Maybe a defective unit.
1,This thing is relatively useless I have to push it back in every other time I drive because it just pops out of the charger port on its own.  I would not recommend it because it's annoying and sometimes you don't notice it is popped out and end up at the destination with an uncharged phone.  0/5.
5,Works
5,Working as expected
1,It takes over 5 hours to charge my phone. Samsung Galaxy S20 5g
2,As you can see from the pic one USB would not go all the way in and will not charge
5,Works great
5,Thanks
2,It will not stay in an extension socket and constantly stops powering my equipment. What is the use of an item that provides good power but will not stay connected. The tip is spring loaded so it just pushes out.
2,Doesn't work in my car as it is too short and won't make the connection. Should have returned it.
1,Just ordered this and was excited to try it out. I have devices that support fast charging and devices that don’t. My main device that i was planning to charge on this does not have fast charging and it does not work for it. Is this charger fast charging exclusive?
2,Works well but make sure you put it in a socket that is powered down when you shut the car off.
1,Don't waste your money. This charger is supposed to be sleek and streamlined it is. So sleek that it consistently gets pushed out the cigarette holder in the car by a little bump. Seriously this charger does  not fit snug & tight how it should. I have to constantly push it back down to charge but it pops right back out of the hole in seconds.Seriously sorry I didn't buy the Anker one!
2,Lo compre porque segun es ñara cargar rápido pero no sirvió como yo creía
1,10 months in stopped working. I checked the fuse and I tried plugging in into a different vehicle and still does not work anymore. I checked the cable and it’s ok. It turns out it’s charger :(
2,When the plug remains in place it charges quite fast.  My problem is with the spring loaded catches they aren't strong enough to keep it in the port.
1,The first month worked well. Its compact and fits almost flush in my 12v port. I first tried using both ports 2 months later only to find one port doesnt work. It says charging on the phone but does not actually charge at all. Now the "working" port charges at such a slow rate my phone (note  10+) takes 4 hours from 20%. This happened conveniently 1 day after the return window closed.
1,Does not provide fast charging for Galaxy S10+ as advertised
1,It took this charging device 1 hour and 15 minutes just to charge my phone to 26% from 0%. That is totally absurd. I sent it back.
5,This charges my phone fast. 15 minutes and it charges at least 30%
1,A lightning cable for the Iphone 11pro doesn't stay inserted in this charger.  The "in" socket seems too large for a lightning cable so the cable falls out.  Even when I hold the cable against the charger it doesn't charge my phone.  It's a low priced item so it's not worth it to spend my time or money to return it to get my money back which is unfortunate.  Don't buy this product.
2,Great accessory- super fast charging.... When it stays plugged in. Worked great for about 3 weeks. Now it gets loose with just the slightest tug and doesn't charge. Disappointing.
1,Bought this to charge my Android phone and  Galaxy phone. When I use it I get a notice of slow charge. From Philadelphia to York.it only got to 20%. Would not buy again. Would love money back
1,Not good.  No better than a cheap drugstore car charger.  In fact worse.  1). Barely stays in the socket.  Has just a tiny nub that does not hold well.  2). Marketed as rapid charging.  Once you get it read the fine print— rapid charges only with a special cable not with your iPhone cable or whatever regular cable you happen to have.
1,Dislike
2,Does not fit 2019 Honda Accord.Feels like quality item but it’s too big and doesn’t fit in any on the cigarette lighter sockets.
1,For the price paid the product should securely fit in the lighter socket of the vehicle. However unless you hold the charger in the lighter socket it pops out and does not charge your phone. This product is unfortunately unusable and I cannot recommend it to other buyers. Since I went on a trip right after buying it I am fairly certain I am outside the return window.
2,Had a great price....but didn't live more than 27 days.....bad investment
1,Stopped working in car on the road to a conference. GPS went dead. Missed appointment. I thought it was a good deal and then in completely stopped working.
2,Not tight enough everything have to check that indicate light is on. If not just plug your phone will just for nothing.
1,Can't get anything to charge on it.  Sigh.
1,The plug does not stay in the port you have to keep putting it back in and it continues to jiggle out. Also one of the charging ports has stopped working. I have “ maybe” charged my phone with this 10 times since getting it in February less than 3 months ago. Not happy with this product at all.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTAfter 1 month 1 of the outputs didn't work anymore. Today after I ordered it on May it didn't work at all anymore. And this is my second time I bought it because the same happened with the first one.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
2,Looks like an box or something. Not impressed. Not sure how the product is gonna be.
1,I bought this product solely for the purpose of being able to fast-charge my phone in my car just like I do at home; however it does NOT fast-charge only regular charge.
1,The "aluminum" housing arrived scratched and this may have previously been used. Didn't offer any quick charging or anything like that though it was advertised as such.
1,After 3 or 4 months is not charging anymore. Is working just the time of warranty. Really disappointed.
1,Wouldn't fast charge for me. Build feels nice but without fast charge it's useless.
2,yes it's charging your phone really fast but due to its mental cover this thing may get really hot.
1,30 day returns only. That is a bit short for an electronic item.
1,Not a fast charging adapter! I bought this product and a fast changing USB-C cable and I got slow charging message on my phone. So upset!!!!
1,Really liked the charger until the Quick Charge feature stopped. Guess it will go in the trash where it belongs
1,It charges at regular speed not at fast speed as specified
1,Didn't charge well slooooow and just stopped working in a very short time...save your money..this is NOT a good or durable charger
5,Best charger I have used to date
2,2 outlets🤥 only one works 😑
5,It was great to have both kinds of USB so I could charge my iPhone and iPad on our road trip. I like the size.  It is very compact.
1,I do not recommend the use of this item. When I used a cable after a while the cable stopped working. Replaced the cable and it worked for a few hours then that cable stopped working.
5,This charger came fast and shipping was excellent. The charger itself was very hefty and felt of good quality build. Wasn’t cheap plastic like other competitors. Overall it’s a charger and it charges my devices fast as advertised. Solid construction fast charging and looks good. Five stars.
1,It has a great design and a sleek profile but unfortunately it only has two little spring balls on the side and it will not stay in the power outlet of my car. I continually walked its way out of the outlet and disconnecting itself
1,Would probably be nice if the thing stayed in. Always works itself out of the port. Good thing my magnetic USB has a light on the end or I'd never notice that my phone isn't charging. Worthless get a different one.
1,I love the build quality as far as feel because it's heavy and Metal and has a low profile but after six or seven months is stopped working properly  only lasted 3 months this time
1,I have left and right angle adapters from same mfg maker trying to achieve low profile.... Seems like one port is higher than the other.. I guess no such thing as perfect engineering?Low profile ....? Disappointed.
1,I bought 3 does not fast charge any of our phones in any of our cars.
1,The spring on it is so tight that it pushes the charger out of any cigarette lighter port I plug into. I own 4 different vehicles and it does this on every single one of them.
1,I was looking for a fast charger for my Samsung Galaxy S8. The description states that in 30 minutes will charge 50% after an hour I was only at 36% charge that's as good as a dollar store USB adapter.
1,It won't fit in the my  Cigaret lighter it's too big. it is there 2 different sizes that I don't know about?  If I  press any harder I'm gonna break the plastic. ???
1,Keeps popping out does not stay in. I thought it would be nice and sleek but it does not stay put.  You have to hold it down to charge.  I will be returning this to get a normal longer stem charger.
5,This device works entirely as advertised just as long as you use the right kind of charging cable. Is definitely worth the money I paid for and I kept my previous charger as a backup.
1,Received one that did not work in any of my car ports. Poor quality.
1,They claim that it's a fast charger but it's not.  It takes forever to charge.
5,This is exactly what I'm looking for a compact FAST charge car adapter. I've purchased too many of these "fast charge" car adapter and none of them actually is FAST charge until I bought these. My phone FINALLY shows "FAST CHARGE" now when I'm charging in my car. This is a game changer for me and although I can't verify the durability of the product it feels premium and solidly made. Hopefully they'll last.
1,Received the unit and no USB cable plugged into it receives power. Testing against another charger that I have to confirm the cables work and the port works in the vehicle.Waste of money.  Not worth sending back.
1,It's suppose to be fast charge it not its suppose to be metal its plastic
1,Ok so for starters fresh out of the package the bottom port didn't function ans the only functioning port didn't fast change then soon after also didn't function.
1,Bought 5. Tried all in 3 different cara and used and tried different charging cables. None worked
1,This item has a design flaw. It stops charging and I have to continuously push the charger into the 12v cigarette lighter port. I ordered a charger by Hussell and it works great.
1,First one stopped working after about a week and the replacement only lasted about a 1 1/2 weeks
1,Hardy was used and inside became loose so it doesn't work. Still lights up but won't charge anything
1,It doesn't fit
1,After 2 months one of the 2 ports stopped working. It was way too expensive to last for such a short period. I would definitely not recommend this product.
1,It doesn't stay plugged in.  If you slightly pull on the cord that is attached it comes out slightly and stops charging.Not worth it.
1,This charge was about 1mm too wide.  Very disappointed.
1,Immediately fell apart
1,This does not fast charge like it says in the description. Huge disappointment.
1,I love the slim profile but this Qualcomm Quick Charge feature is either not working or just not compatible with my Samsung S10e. Very deceptive.
1,Had 2 of these have 1 port stop working.  I would not buy.
1,Dead on arrival. Returned no problems. Did not charge any device with any cord. Tried multiple cords and devices. Looked nice. Fit flush. Would have been 5* if it worked.
1,Charging time is same is your regular usb outport
1,This lasted about 1 month and has already stopped working! I am out of my return time so now I am stuck with junk!
1,stop working today and received it on August 7th. Feels heavy duty. Does charge fast. But its useless right now.
1,This thing doesn't fast charge.. But good quality.
1,Stopped working after less than 2 months. Looks great...but components are obviously sub par if they can't last 2 months
1,None
1,Didn't reach unless I I hold it in. Maybe in another car it will work better i have a range rover sport
1,Totally dead after 3 weeks of use. Only used 3 times a week. Disappointing. Recommended other brands bought at the same time.
1,Does not perform as advertised.
1,Product does not support quick charging
1,I’ve had this less than 5 months and it already isn’t working... don’t waste your money
1,HorribleDo not buy.Does not charge Fast at all!!!I went back to using my old charger
1,I consider this car charger unusable since I won't try it again. Once it's plugged in the charger fits flush leaving nothing to grip on to for removing it again. Rubber gloves and tweezers were eventually part of its extraction..  🚫
1,When plugging it into the car you need to spin it to the exact right spot or it wont work.
1,Wasn't fast charging my phone when I plugged it in. Samsung Galaxy.
1,Did use only one time and it died!! Now it’s too late to return
1,Only one of the USB ports worked. Must have gotten a dud.
1,Nonse queda en el Puerto de carga con las vibraciones del camino pierde contacto con el.puerto
1,Doesn’t fit in 12V port good keeps coming out It’s not worth one star
1,Stoped working about a month after we got it.
1,Piece of junk wont stay in cigarette lighter waste of money!
1,Charging slow
1,It only worked for 2 weeks  need my money back
1,it does not lay flash and will not hold in place
3,Too short.Tend to get stuck in the cigarette lighter socket.Not convenient when you use for a weekend car rental.
1,Intermittent power contact
1,Three months after purchase it burned my MOTO G Power cellphone charging port completely making it unable to charge anymore. Overheated so much that I burned my fingers when trying to unplug. Defective and unable to return now.
1,won't fast charge a Samsung phone.  very disappointed.
2,Doesn't really fast charge like it says it does . Charges normal . If you phone is 5% and you plug it and you keep using it . It will die . You have to stop using your phone
5,It has no problem charging our iPad. It's heavier than I expected. Very solid.
1,Works for several weeks then stop charging all together. iPhone would go unrecognized.
1,Not a fan of this product. Should have bought a more reliable company but hey for $6 you can’t beat to try. Womp.
5,This thing is awesome. It really does charge super fast I’ve never had a car charger that was so powerful fast and even felt like it was made with quality. I’ve had it for maybe six months so far no issues at all and  its surpassed my expectations. My iPhone 11 Pro Max charges almost as fast as the original charger in a wall if not just as fast. Which is pretty damn fast almost like one percentage per minute or two minutes. If you’re not sure which chargers gonna do the trick just go for this one. It’s made of nice metal frame has a nice light and is just a beast you can feel it get hit from how much electricity runs through  it
5,I like the fact that this adapter sticks out just about the perfect amount from the socket. The one it replaced protruded about 2 inches from the adapter and pushed the cord too far away from the dash. This one sticks out about 1/2 inch or so and the cord now hugs the dash going up to my phone and stays out of the way of the shift handle. It seems to be good quality and well made. Time will tell but I have had two phones plugged in at the same time charging and it didn't get hot at all...
4,It doesn't want to stay in the vehicle's cigatette lighter port. One pushes it in and it pops part way out on its own.
5,Metal body noticeable weight. Protrudes out a bit on my 2005 tacoma its fine from socket location cant tell also extra grip for easy remove. Blue light stays on when not in use wished it didnt. Dual simultaneous on both adaptive fast changing Samsung devices (not SUPER fast 25w note10 or s10 lite).
5,IT FAST CHARGES MY SAMSUNG S9!! Only had it for a week so I can't speak to the longevity of the product but it's all metal and feels like good quality. The little blue light also isn't too bright so it blends in with the rest if my instrument panel nicely. Very pleased!
5,Works as per design.My non qc 3 charger didn't work on my wireless charging pad but with this it works flawlessly.
5,Charging is an all time necessity and this things works great.  I get real fast charging in both ports which keeps everyone happy and the map on during long car rides.
5,It's a car charger but definitely the most significant feel to one I have ever used.  Not that I am touching it much but I do appreciate the quality.
5,Great "little" charger. Just what I was after a small unit both USB ports are fast charging. Perfect for my Suzuki Burgman 650.
5,Amazing fast charger.. i got thw note 10plus.. and chage to fast.. and its small.. fits on any luxury car.
5,High quality metal exterior and super low profile. Fast charging recognized by my Note 10+.
5,Excellent car charger. Capable of quick charging 2 phone at the same time!
5,This is the second one I have bought. Cool!
5,Exactly as described. No issues at all
5,the quality is very good
5,works great. Fast charging.
5,Fast charging!
5,Thank you. great product.
2,I bought this so I could fast charge my Note10+ phone while on the road.  It Does NOT fast charge.  Tried different cables and each port no go.  I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Does NOT stay plugged in keeps coming out. It was a gift I would turn it in ...
5,Don't be fooled by "fast charge" in product titles! "Fast Charge" may indicate more than 2.0a charging rate but doesn't mean you will actually see "fast charging" on a Samsung device or iPhone. Quickcharge is proprietary to Qualcomm but is also branded as "Adaptive charge" or something by Samsung. It's all the same thing but fact of the matter is that true quick charging must be supported by the charger USB cable and device. If any one of those things does not support quick charging then your device will not charge any faster than normal.This charger will provide true Quick charging capability to give a quick battery boost when you need it. It is also sleek and VERY well made! I was pleasantly surprised by its quality. No complaints at all.
5,Bought it for my fast charging wireless charger in my car.  Supports fast charging just fine no problems at all.  The material feels durable.  The build seems good quality.  Sits way more flush than any other cigarette charger I've had.  Doesn't ever get hot after long periods of use.  I thought the LED light would be annoying but it's actually not that bad.  It's only bright enough to be helpful when trying to plug in at night.  When plugged in I can't see the light anymore so that's nice.  I just don't like that the LED stays on when I turn my car off draining my battery (not by much at all but still).  I just slightly pop it out when I know it'll be parked for awhile and then push it back in when I turn the car back on.  Other than that I don't have any issues with it.  I love it.  Fast charges 2 devices at once
2,Not worth itYou save 25 minutes than a regular charger
5,All the marketing for this makes me feel good about the insides. Metal exterior is great and fits wonderfully all the way in the socket of the cigarette lighter in my vehicle.
5,This one actually charges my phone while I'm using it my other charger would only maintain the charge while I was on my phone.
5,Excellent build super fast charging bought me and my wife one
5,Works well bought it to fast charge my Samsung S9+ and did exactly that. Have used it for awhile now and no complaints with it.
5,I was in need of a car charger. I stumbled upon this 2 port fast charger. I ordered it immediately. No hesitation. So far I am loving it. Both ports are fast charging. I like the LED light on it so i always know where to plug it in when especially at night when my cell phone is low on battery. I would highly recommend this.
5,This little thing does what it says. It does get quite hot -- especially after your car sits in the hot sun and then you plug 2 phones in. The all metal construction does ensure that the unit itself does not melt and so far everything is  going well. I have a Galaxy S7 and my wife has an S9 -- it charges both devices simultaneously at the "fast charge" level. I can't speak to it's longevity as I have only had it for a bit.
5,I have a Note 8 running charging through a wireless holder in the car. My first impression was that this is very heavy.  It fit easily in the vehicle and sits really low which wasn't why I bought it but could be worth considering depending on the needs of your vehicle.  It has no issues running the wireless charger to charge my phone in the car and has two standard USB outlets so we could easily charge two devices in the car.  Would buy again.
5,I do a lot of driving in delivery trucks that have multiple 12v outlets but no USB outlets so this device comes in pretty handy. The only time I've been able to use it it helped to charge my phone an well as keep it charged so that I could use a GPS mapping app. However that's the last time I have used it. I have since lost it and had to order another one. Maybe these need a beacon so that I can find mine.
2,This worked great for awhile and I even bought a second one for one of my girls. One of the usb ports has now stopped charging though. Too bad because it was small and felt well made.
5,Charges fast. Works perfectly in my truck
5,This fits snug right into my front socket in my Prius and the blue lighting matches my interior trim for my wheel and other ports.
5,This item is durable ( metal body ) and powerful. I was able to fully charge both my phone as well as my Bluetooth headset ( at the same time ) within 25 - 30 minutes.I purchased this item to see if it was worth it... I should've purchased Two( 2 ) at the time. I have NO complaints about this product and would recommend it to anyone. 👍🏾
5,Works well so far and the value for the price is unbeatable. Far superior to the vehicle phone chargers sold by most wireless carriers.  Felt like I was having to replace those every year or so. This works extremely well for the wireless charging cell vehicle mount I purchased that needed an adapter for the quick charge cable. This was perfect for the job.
5,Has a lot of heft to such a small device.  Been working in our 4 runner for months going to order for our other truck.
5,Quick charging.  A little faster than the home charger blocks.
5,Has fast charging mode on my phone I'm happy
3,just soso not good .
5,All around great product and value.
5,This USB charger for the car is amazing.  It is made of heavy duty high quality material (it is not a plastic piece of junk like some other ones).  The best part is the dual QC3.0 fast charging ports - we can charge to fast charge capable phones at the same time and very fast.  I will be getting a couple more of these for my other vehicles.
3,Is not working after 2 weeks
5,amazing! i bought this for my 2000 four runner for charging multiple phones at once. works amazing!
5,Happy w purchase
4,actually charges both ports with fast charging  alot better than the other brands
5,I truly love that it is flat with the car.  It charges my iPhone 11 quickly and can use my ipad with it while I am a passenger on long trips…
5,Great unit with fast charging!  Love it.I was blowing fuses with an older RavPower 12V charger.  Dealer told me my charger was defective.Replaced it with this Ainope unit.  Charging is back and no troubles!
5,I’m using this to power my quad lock wireless charger. Charges my phone pretty fast and it’s convenient to have 2 ports and not just 1.
5,This doesn't stick out it's mostly flat and has two high speed charging ports. Love it!
5,Good quality thank you. *****
4,It's not quite as low of a profile as I had hoped but fits my application nicely. Power output is perfect for powering a Pixel3 and ipad Pro at the same time without issue.
5,thank you for everything.
5,It feels really good the quality of materials seems good it values for the money. I love it it looks pretty good on my Toyota Vitz 2012 doesn't take too much space
4,I would like to first mention that I love this it works really well but I must say that my 10watt charger charges the same speed as this it could be because of my phone or because of the plug but its still a fast charger thats great you must get it
5,My car charger port is by the cup holders and the pop out charger I had was in the way of me using em. With this flat charger I am able to use both cup holders now. IDK why I didn't get one of these sooner. Arrived fast also. I love it.
5,Between my wife and I we have 4 or 5 of these in our cars. They’ve worked well to charge our phones my wireless charger plus the kids’ iPads and other USB devices.  I love the low profile design and the soft blue lights match the interior lights of my Jaguar F-Pace.
5,My new phone didn't come with a car charger so I looked to see what was available now. This is made of metal instead of plastic and feels like it will last. It has two USB ports and is rated at 36W at 6 amps.  It is much faster than any of my previous car chargers.
5,Clean minimalist style. Haven’t had to charge anything yet but I love the sleek slim look of it.
5,The first one didn't work...but they contacted me & sent a new one very quickly. The replacement works very well :)
5,10/10 would buy again
1,For vehicles only! Not for human insertion!
5,Awesome charger it actual metal construction and fit flat on the cigarette port excellent product
5,Future proof durable those are two qualities I look for in a car product.  This charger fits that bill. I do extensive car camping and this dual QC3.0 Port 36W/6A charger guarantees phone and camera batteries are fresh
5,Great device. Slips into cigarette lighter and doesn't take up space.
5,Excellent device. I have 3 of these and had zero issues with them. Going on 7 months.
5,Charges my s10 and iPhone 8 fast!
5,It's nice looking and flush to the plug.  It works extremely well and was a good investment.
5,This thing was pretty solid and at a good price made a lot better then a lot of flimsy plastic chargers .. side note this probably could be used as a window breaker for emergencies... ohh and charges great too
1,BOUGHT 3 OF THESE.ONLY ONE PORT WORKS ON EACH OF THE CHARGERS.
5,I love it ...it did what it say it would
1,This does not fast charge my note 20!It takes longer than most chargers.
5,Streamline design!
5,Excellent  product. It has plenty of power and stays put in the cigarette lighter even on bumpy roads
5,I wasnt sure what to expect with this product but it ended up being exactly what I was looking for. So far it seems pretty durable.
5,This charger works really well but doesn't stay in the socket well.  You have to push it back in every couple of days but it charges fast off both ports.
5,I just love the build quality and also how fast charges.Highly recommended
5,Excellent 12v car charger for USB A cords.  2 ports with great power.  Low profile and doesn't stick out from the outlet.
5,This is not cheap. But you get what you paid for. Aluminun built and low profile. Worth every penny
5,Liked the compact size as well as its build. This little charger is perfect for any Minimalist.
5,I'm pleased with my purchase. Time will tell regarding reliability
5,Charges my iPad well.
5,Yay i can charge my phone in the car.  My usb port doesn't put out enough to charge my phone so I'm happy this works.
5,Dont rent an RV without bringing on of these along
5,Needed a fast charger for my car and it works great on my Pixel.
5,Met expectations and ontime delivery.
5,Looks nice and feels heavy works how it’s supposed to
5,Very well made and powerful charging power with 2 fast charge ports. Doesn't feel like you could break it even if you tried
5,I use this device to charge my phone in my vehicle.
5,Nice and thin.
5,Good
5,I like how flush it sits on my outlet.  My old plug took up too much room.
5,It's everything that it says it is. Good product for the value.
5,item as described looks and works great.
4,I've purchased various different blue tooth devices for my car. This is the one that works the best. I can hear everyone clearly. The only problem is I have to speak loudly for people to understand/hear me.
5,I bought this for my wife. It works perfectly and puts the phone into "fast charge" mode. Seems well made
5,Works as advertised
5,Good material heavy but works wonderful charges super fast.
5,Works well
5,I love that it's a flush  mount. Looks good and easy to use.
5,Exactly what I needed!! Great shopping experience!!
5,It’s nice and feels heavy. It’s a very snug fit and doesn’t fall when I’m on bumpy back roads
3,This is metal ... it gets really hot!
5,Heavy duty charger.Fast charging and looks great!
5,Great product
5,Charges my phone faster than any other chargers I bought previously. Sturdily built.
5,Fits nicely fast charge actually works.Great product
5,Nice double charger for the car! Charge well
5,I like everything about this fast charger no complaints here
5,Very well built and sturdy. Tight fit.
5,Needed a car charger and this one came in real handy you dont even know its there.
5,Acceptional material worth every penny and gonna get another. This thing is not delicate.
5,I'm using this to power a dash camera and Bluetooth receiver. Works great is a nice solid plug in was quite surprised tbh.
5,it works grate it is a grate product i would buy it agin
5,Product works well and feels sturdy and well built.
5,Let me tell you. This is the best charger EVER and when I say EVER I mean EEVVEERRRRR. this thing charges super fast. Blew my wife and I away. Best charger even hand's down
5,Works great and a good value too.
4,only 1 port charged but they sent me a new one!
5,Ordered one. Was sent 2. Billed for 2.  Hhhh.  Does charge at Qualcomm speed. A little tricky fitting in one vehicle. Had to jiggle....
5,No problems after a year of use so I got a second one for the used car I just bought.
5,Getting another one
4,This is definitely the nicest car charger I've come across it sits pretty much flush against the outlet and feels incredibly durable in your hand. Made of metal not plastic. Would recommend.
5,So far it’s fast charging for iPads tablets and mobile phones. Sturdy quality too.
5,I didn't know i needed this until i knew i needed this and boy this save me some trouble the quality is great and it charges fast out of both sides at the same time super fast and useful.
5,It's a car charger. Not much to say it works and has been for the few months I have been using it.
5,Holy moly this thing is TINY! And  both ports are QC 3.0 which is fantastic. I replaced 3 car charger unit with this after being soo impressed with my first one. It hardly sticks out of the 12v socket at all which is great of you have one in your center console with a coin tray above it. The USB cables were being bent over at a bad angle with my old ones when I closed the lid. I looked at getting 90 degree cables but it was cheaper to just buy a shorter profile 12v plug and reuse my existing cables. I use a dash mounted wireless charger and it will go into fast wireless charging with this adapter which iy wouldn't reliably with my last taller unit. Highly recccomended!
5,Small profile and provide sufficient charging current. If it works through this hot summer I will definitely buy a second one.
5,Muy buen cargador para vehiculos
5,This is a sturdy fast car charger.  I have had other ones but they don't charge as fast as this one.
5,Fast charging and very nice quality
5,Unlike other items I searched on Amazon this charger has two 3.0 charging ports meaning I can use one port for my wireless car charger and the other for charging cable for my passenger. I've tried charging with both ports and fast charging works like a charm!
5,this is my second purchase of this product it works quite well giving a fast charge to my electronic devicesand to note it's my second purchase due to adding another vehicle  not due to the product failing
5,Muy buen producto recomendable
4,It works good charges pretty quick but my little door on my Camaro doesn't close with it in.
5,Easily popped into my Jeep Patriot’s cigarette lighter and works perfectly!!
2,Got this to replace my OEM Samsung fast charger that broke because it stuck out of the socket. This thing fits nice and snug and won't have the same issue. Works great. Going strong months later.Update: just threw it out. Lasted 2019 to 2022
5,Looks very high-quality with a metallic finish and provides enough power for a car MagSafe charger.
5,Everybody needs this thing.
5,Bought this for my work truck. My coworker has a new iPhone and I have a galaxy s20 ultra with both phones charging this little plug quickly gave both phones a solid charge. First impression is great. As long as it doesn't break anytime soon I recommend this charger.
5,Awesome charger small form factor charges phone quickly.
5,My mom's KIA cigarette lighter charger died so I got her this one - she likes being able to charge two devices at once. She says it allows her iphone to use fast charging without any problems. She's happy - I'm happy!
5,it works.  no problems.
5,This feels like a solid block of metal.  Very sturdy charges fast and I love the dual USB ports to charge 2 phones at the same time.
5,This thing is heavy compared to any others on the market. But that is a good thing. Because it's actually metal and not plastic like everything else. It works well. It does do fast charging. I'm going to look for a different cable to see if it's capable of "ultra fast". Id definitely recommend this as a car charger.
5,These eliminate yuh our phone draining from using apps while you are driving like Waze or other GPS apps that are constantly on and using your phone battery these charge faster then any drain bbn of apps and keep your phone at 100 percent when you get out of car. Great to have in all your cars
5,Using this to charge 10 inch GPS tablet in my RZR for navigation.  Has worked past 2 years flawlessly.  Would buy again.
5,Powers up my Nalwort wireless iPhone mount perfectly.
5,While the price is on the expensive side I can say the quality matches. Very heavy and durable and works great. I love how I can charge two phones at once with the same power.
5,This charger is awesome!! But someone definitely stepped on it before it got to me..
4,Fast charging speed. But the lid can't be closed with this thing plugged on. There are other option out there that is flushed when plugged-in so that the lid can be closed but those model are a little more expensive than this one.
5,Bought these in Feb this year and I'm very happy with them
5,I love that it charges in half the timeit usually took.
5,What I needed
5,I just bought this a week ago but every time when i charge my phone when i didnt get to the night before it charges super fast! i went on a 20 min drive and my phone was at 16% but when we got to our destination it was at 54%! I would definitely recommend this product 👍
5,It fits right in the port and is flush with the dash board of my car.  I like that it does not stick out in the way of other things going on in the car.
5,Charges very fast. The piece is really solid. Appears very durable. Will tell with time. Debating on buying another one.
5,Charges very fast
5,Excellent Choice Bought 2
5,Muy buenon
5,Bought this to replace my old car charger that was not producing enough juice for my wireless charger.  This is a great value as it seem well built and output is as described.
5,As described love the low profile.
5,Great product! Heavy & durable and ridiculously fast charging. Ordering 2 more for our other vehicles!
5,Works as expected charges phones fast.
5,have had no issues with it.charges greatgreat feelquality product
5,Great at charging our Iphones when we are traveling. It is hard to insert into the car plug.
4,I bought this for my new electric charger nice combo
4,I have like 8 of these now. I have one for every port for every vehicle my girlfriend and I own. As I buy more vehicles I buy more of these. Haven't had one fail yet. Very strong fast charge. Make sure your cord can handle it.
5,works and looks great
5,Good product with very fast charging!
5,This hasn't heated up and charges pretty quick as well.
5,No disappointments here. Tight fit on the usb cables and made of very heavy metal.
3,The "bottom" charging port is NOT properly installed.  Meaning that the bottom cord sticks out further then the tip.  Tried multiple cords and even swapped cords.  Becuase of this the bottom port will not always charge and if the kids "charge play" on it you midas well consider this a single port charger.  Literally defeats the purpose of me buying this for road trips.
5,Works as expected
5,Charges quickly. Seems to be durable. I keep it in my vehicle.
5,It works as it should and does fast charge plus it's sleek and really sturdy
5,Really good product. Charges an iPad and my phone at the same time from 12% to 100% in 2 hrs. Heavy duty build.
5,Well made.. charges well.. Purchase 2 of them..
5,This charger does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It was a little difficult to get into the port the first time but I haven't given it a thought since.  The best items are ones that work so well you never think about them.
5,Extremely happy with this charger you can plug 2 phones and they both charge fast. 100%satisfied
5,This charger works quickly and then reduces power as the device becomes charged.
5,I have really been pleased with my car charger!  It works great charges quickly and is overall a great buy!!
1,Has a short in it somewhere
5,Excellent item excellent quality +++++
5,Bueno y carga rapida.
5,You can't beat this for the price I bought 2. Both outlets charge at quick charge speeds and with 2 devices connected.
5,Works well charges fast.  It is metal and has weight to it so I'm hoping that means it has a quality coil and internals.
5,I will replace my other chargers now with these.
5,I’m really into charging my phone fast & my chest pet peeve is when people have slow chargers so whenever I go into someone’s car I take this with me due to it charging my phone really fast!
5,This plug works great. Looks good in socket has lights. Great price
5,Excellent quality.
5,Liked that its small to fit in your purse or pencil case. All metal. Very durable and fast charger. Bought two.
5,he liked it
5,This is the 2nd time I ordered this from this seller. I was happy that I can look it up from my purchase history when I needed another one for my husband's car. Since the 1st one I ordered works great I don't need to try other brand or sellers. When you plug your phone to this charger your phone screen will show fast charging.
5,I had another one in my car but it was some timey. Sometimes it worked and most times it didn’t. Since I had this charger it has worked every time I used it. I no longer have to worry about my phone dying while traveling.
5,Thus seems to be well made and charged our phones well. One is a pixel so it needs PD and this did't sit as flush as I expected so ended up returning it. However it's a great well made low profile charger.
5,It is small works like a charm & has a purple led.
5,AINOPE USB Car Charger [Dual QC3.0 Port] 36W/6A [All Metal] Fast Car Charger Adapter Mini Cigarette Lighter UsbWorks for me - I like the small/thin form factor.  barely sticks out of socket.  Build quality seems fine.charges my S10+ quickly.  Phone display says quick charging activated.I recommend it.
1,It works same way as any other cheap car charger... you don't get fast charging... seller recommended that I have cheap car sig outlet... BMW 530e xDrive...Its overpriced charger is not fast charger.
5,good product good price good service
5,Small powerful flush... it's checking all the boxes for me! I use this to charge my phone and GoPro simultaneously on my motorcycle. It provides plenty of power all day long.
5,Works as advertised
5,Very goodFast delivery
5,I have a good working Anker unit but it sticks out pretty far from the cigarette lighter.So I searched and came across this short AINOPE which sounded promising and had good reviews.Product packaging was nice which makes me think they pay attention to detail.Well it works well so far.The units case is made out of metal and feels pretty solid.It is able to charge my Pixel 2XL Pixel 4A 5G or Pixel 6 Pro as well as power my 4K Dual Dash Cam A129 at the same time.It isn't quite as shallow as some of the other units but it works where others had failed.Overall I am happy with this.I will update as I have more information.2021-11-15Updated: Adapter still works and going strong.A good buy.
5,Charges fast stays in socket... what more could you ask for?!?
5,A really good product  I recommend
5,Fits great and small enough to allow for more space in the goldwing compartment.
5,I feel it is a good buy. Charges quickly and seems well built. Cheaper than other comparable items
5,I purchased this product because of its solid design and its super compact profile. But it really is a super fast charger. Well done!
5,Works good
5,excellent quality perfect size
5,This thing works great. It fast charges on both ports. Nice and sturdy and low profile.
5,This product does exactly what it says it will do which is not something you can take for granted these days. The device allows for fast charging via USB cable and wireless charging which has been a blessing for me on the road. No issues so far.
5,This is the best product for a low price
5,Like it so much I bought a second one.  Use them in an old Volvo 240 and and old Honda CR-V.  Both chargers can stay in place without draining the car battery.
5,Buena compra
5,I like it very nice product
5,Good quality and value. Charges everything.
5,Nice small form factor delivers high charge rate on both slots.
5,I bought this to replace a dual charger that only had one high-speed port after that port quit working recently. My passenger (usually my son) and I always squabbled over whose phone got plugged into the high-speed port. With this one everyone's happy and that doesn't happen anymore.It looks durable and well made and I like that it's more streamlined and doesn't stick out from the dash as far as the previous charger did. Very happy with it.
5,This charger is built like a tank and charges my phone with jet speed. Quality and durability. Something you dont see a lot of in car chargers. Leave the junk at the party store/gas stations and invest in these durable little fast chargers.
5,This little thing is super fast. Love it
5,This adapter charges my Samsung S22 Ultra from 20% to 100% charge in less than 45 minutes. Just be sure to buy a USB to Type C charging cable.
5,Seems like a well built product. It fit my need very well. It’s a little short so I can see if you had a deeper socket it may not make the connection. Not sure how shallow the socket needs to be. Maybe check dimensions before buying. Overall it seems to be working very well for me.
5,Good quality fast charger. A little downside most newer vehicles the plug where you insert the charger has a flip cover. While the charger is not in use you can not closed the cover with the charger in it. Otherwise it is a great charger 👌
5,There was nothing more annoying than plugging my phone into the charging port in my car driving 30 minutes and the battery charge only going up a few percent. This solves that! I can confirm this fast charges (see screenshot) the same as if I used the provided fast charger in a regular wall socket. Perfect solution!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It charges my phone so fast is safe for vapes tablets watches and every electronic. The material is very good all metal good stuff!
5,Great for the car so my wife and I can charge simultaneously. Well built. Recommended.
5,Well designed.  It has a shorter stem than others (which l like) The light is perfect. The over-all look heaver style and shorter more flush with the plugin make this product an excellent choice.
5,Very good
5,Charges fine very difficult to move from car to car though 😕
5,Got this and added a quick charge cable and my phone and Bluetooth a stuff charges quickly and seems to hold a charge better
5,Ok.
5,Works great. It's metal and not plastic. Good quality.
4,Good charger I can charge both my iPhone and iPad at the same time in the car. Charge speeds seem very fast which is always welcome. The charger itself doesn't sit completely flush and it fits slightly snug on some of my vehicles. Aside from that it does what it is supposed to do so I will give it 4 stars total.
5,Made well .
5,Perfect.  Didn't catch on fire.  Wish it had wifi.
5,Compact Design almost sit flush to the socket when installed. Metal casing is heavy for its size and looks very durable. Quickly charge iPhone X and Oneplus 7T. Fit very tight in the socket.Will buy this model again when I need more for family member.
4,Very convenient and out of the way due to low profile. I've ordered more than once to give to friends and family who are not tech savvy. Much better than most chargers bought in store.
5,Excellent product high style low profile excellent charging capability. These things are made very well out of aircraft grade aluminum in the LED light looks very nice at night
5,Works flush mounted and has a blue light the glows when it has power.  Pretty simple.
4,Doesn't seem to charge any faster than my previous one. I'm neither disappointed nor impressed.
5,I have it on my truck and although i do not have exact numbers on how fast it charges lets just say it does its job and its small so get it.
5,It's really fast charging.
5,Had a similar product to this which was made of plastic and it didnt last long. This is made of metal and is very sturdy and works well.
5,Great product I will recommend.
5,The size is perfect.  I just bought an older Toyota RAV-4 that did not have USB charge ports  There is limited space where the power outlet is so I needed a short adaptor.  This has the size and high output output I wanted.  This appears to meet all my requirements.
5,Excellent product
5,👍
5,Update to my original review: The seller contacted me and sent a new charger. This one fits great and still charges like a champ. It's great having a low profile charger that can fast charge my phone.Original review: I like having a higher powered charger in my car now. I can have maps running my podcasts and it still charges my phone quickly. My major complaint is that the charger is kind of loose in the socket and tends to pop out every few days. I haven't had this issue with any other charges in the same car. It sucks when I get home after a long commute to find that my phone want charging at all.
5,Is well designed sold metal case. Light is not distracting with a cord plugged in to it. Works well to fast charge with stock charging cable and Ainope branded charging cables. Very satisfied with purchase.
5,This charger feels much heavier than most chargers which tells me its not a cheaply made crappy product that fails to charge your phone.  I especially like that it is slim/flush with the 12v port so it can be hidden easily.  This is an amazing charger worth the money I even get the "fast charging" comment from my phone.  Works fantastic and I highly recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great charger that supports fast charging fits flush with plug. Using in a 2003 Honda Civic fits kinda tight but thats okay don't need to keep unplugging as no power goes to plug until the ignition is on. I like how bright the ports light up you'd be able to see where to plug something in the dark. Im not really using it to charge my phone but I wanted a dual USB that had a protection against surge or for over charging. Im using it for my dashcam and led lights but sure will come in hand if I needed my phone to be charged. Some say if something else is plugged in fast charge won't work I had the dash cam running on it and fast charge worked fine.
5,I needed something small as the port in my car is inside the armrest and this is PERFECT. Very well built and it gives me rapid charging on my Samsung S8+ which I have not gotten from any other car charger adaptor.
5,Unit weights more than expected likely due to metallic construction to act as heat sink to dissipate heat from the higher charging current.It protrudes more than the other low profile charger I have purchased in the past however this allows easy removal when required it also has funky lighting when powered up.The car I am using this for has constant power to the cigarette lighter socket ie the 12 volts power is always on even when ignition key is removed and car shut off I hope this “always on” does not create any issue or risk in the long term to require removal when the car is shut down.
5,I'm using them in the front cigar lighter slot on my BMW M2 near the cup holders. Charges quick for a car charger and as advertised they sit 90% flush into the slot. This way it doesn't get in the way when I'm reaching for my drinks in the cup holder and I won't accidently knock the charger loose. (as you know other car chargers can be finicky and sometimes comes loose without knowing but I haven't had any issue with this one yet)
5,If you're considering purchasing the BMW Dual USB Charger Charging Adaptor OEM Part #8410936332102 save your money and purchase this produce instead.I'm quite impressed with this adaptor.  Its low enough profile to allow the sliding console cover on our M2 to close (unlike the BMW alternative).  It fits snugly (unlike the BMW alternative) and both outlets are fast charging (unlike the BMW alternative).  Additionally the blue and red lights look great with the BMW interior (unlike the BMW alternative).
5,For use in vehicle where only slim profile “head” will work due to close proximity to side walls.  Most other chargers i had issues not being able to plug in due to the head size width or length( not able to close the bin cover.). This works perfect and quick charges my iphone during heavy use(GPS) Bonus us its metal construction.
5,Very high quality metal construction super slim fast charging. I was very impressed at the high quality build of this thing. Also its so slim that it sits almost perfectly flush against the cigarette lighter port. I can actually close my truck's cigarette lighter cover overtop of it when not in use.This is a BUY.
5,first thing I noticed unpacking was how solid this charger felt. The weight of the metal feels like quality.Charging works great on my iPhone8. My phone's battery got a good boost in it's battery after a 30min drive.I would recommend buying this charger
5,I don't write a lot of reviews even though I order over $1000 with of merchandise from Amazon but sometimes a product is so good I want to share my two cents. I drive as a courier part-time and use a lot of battery power on my route. This charger charges my phone fast. It is built sturdy. I like the light feature so you can see where to plug things in when it gets dark. Highly recommend this product
5,Perfect! I have an adapter for my oneplus that needs a legit q.c 3.0 in order to trigger the dash charge. I am happy!
5,Heavy feels really well builtLow profile doesn't stick out much at all which I really like about thisBoth ports fast charge which is what I wantedOnly con is it's a little pricey but then good things aren't cheap...
5,low profile solid and perfect fit
5,Charges fast and both the socket works perfectly fine
5,Needed something non invasive for my car and it works great and charges devices quickly.
4,The charger came quickly and in simple packaging without extra waste. It has a bit of weight to it (compared to cheap ones I've held in the past) and it works well with fast charging my phone! The only thing to be aware of is that it was quite a tight fit for our car (2000 Volkswagon Jetta). It would be a hassle to take it out so just be sure what angle you want to put it in!
2,Not satisfied.  It didn't work as a fast charger with LG Thinkq and Samsung S10. I had a regular cheap charger on my machine and needed a fast charger (sth that takes even twice the time of a wall charger would've made me so happy). The performance of this charger totally equals to that very old and cheap charger I had just with a newer look. I really like to know what was the benchmark when they were doing the testing with these?
5,Very well constructed and small.  Appears to charge well.  Too early to assess if any faster than previous chargers we have owned
5,I tested this one against another similar one but decided to return this one.  Although it worked great and felt durable I preferred the other as it had USB C power as well as normal USB and this one had both normal usb.
5,Feels v.solid it works  well. It is quite short good for some not so good for others. Pulling it out of a cigarette socket takes a bit more effort on a good side - it does not take much space sticking out.
5,This charge adapter works well. Seems to be very well built. It is much heavier then others I've used. Well worth the money.
1,Quality control lacking. Does not fast charge and one of the slots does not fit the cable properly
5,The blue light makes finding the USB ports easy in a dark car. The charger fits snugly in the car lighter socket with just a bit sticking out. Looks great in the car.
5,Was exactly what was expected. Wanted it to keep an iPad Air fully charged while using it as a chart plotter on a boat. iPad stayed at 100% along with my iPhone which was also plugged into it.
5,I use it to keep my cell GPS screen on at full intensity while riding my motorcycle. I does the job where my older charger did not. I really like the metal quality feel also and I suspect that being metalic it must dissipate heat better since it is more powerful than average.
2,It’s alright. Small and sleek but is not quick charging. I had a transmitter with a 3.0 quick charge on it and it charged my iPhone plus almost full in 30 minutes. Having my phone plugged in with this for 20 minutes gave me 20%. Good looks and good quality but does not quick charge as advertised.
5,Haven't tried both slot charging at same time but it sure does fast charge. Solid built and its not plastic ish. Very satisfied.
1,This product seems like a well-made unit but fast charge only lasted 2 weeks before it failed
5,This device charges very fast your mobile phone. Well worth the $$$. No issues.
5,Awesome product has a really good build feel. Does exactly wat it says.
5,Produit de qualité. Fonctionne parfaitement! Charge mon huawei p30 pro extrêmement vite. Agréablement surprise. Je vais le recommander à mes proches. 10/10 car on voit que c'est de la qualité.
4,have not use it yet but it looks nice and it lit up when I plugged into the lighter hole in my car.
5,Works great so far No complaints at all
5,Works perfectly and looks and built to last will buy again !!!
5,This is heavy and made of quality materials. Works great charges crazy fast.
5,This little gadget does exactly what it's supposed to. Perfect for recharging my phone in my 2007 car which doesn't have a USB port.Update - just got a 2nd one the 1st one is stil going strong! Very happy!
5,super chargement
5,Works freat
4,Like it..
5,Works great
5,Great product solid fits tight and flush to lighter opening
5,Great Product! Does what it says! 100%
5,I love this thing it charges your phone incredibly fast. It's also made out of metal and has a high quality feel to it.
5,Good product.
5,Both are fast charge. It fits perfectly and very discret.
5,This one is different than all the other chargers I bought in the past. Its a lot heavier and charges my cellphone real fast.
5,A++++
5,It’s compact and gets the job done - fast charging!
5,Buena calidad del producto. Recomendable
5,Charger is low profile.  Very difficult to pull out of the  cigarette port.
5,je l'utilise dans ma voiture fonctionne à merveille je recommande fortement ce produit
5,Very satisfactory product  love it 👍
5,Very nice low profile dual USB for your car
5,Quality was obvious when opening!
5,Looks good
5,Its real fast charging.
5,Fast charging and good quality
5,It is a great charger. Mobile devices charge quickly.
1,This car charger made my Accessory Fuse (20 V) blew TWO TIMES in a row given that this Charger input rated for 12V so it should not have caused such a thing.I have Honda Civic 2015 and used other chargers in past and never had such problem.After consulting Honda dealership while i was ordering new 20V fuses they advised charger have the issue which causing excess power surge that is blowing up car fuse.
5,Awesome!!
3,Samsung phones will not charge at the proper speed with this one. It seems samsung has some secret handshake that needs to happen to allow the phone to do it and this charger was not part of the club.Its very slim feels very good quality and i believe it can supply the rated wattage but on a samsung phone you won't get it. It still charges fairly fast but you get about 1.8A vs the 2.5-3A it should be able to do. The phone also won't report "Fast charging" but rather cable charging.
4,It charges my phone without a problem. It works
5,Work perfectly in my Hyundai Venue 2021 and perfectly quick charge my pixel 2
5,Very happy with this charger! I bought one for both my mom and I. It really does fast charging (I have a galaxy S10 and she has the S8).
1,Wouldn't recommend. Is supports fast charging at first but it's just a matter of time before it breaks and goes back to slow charging. Lasted about 3 months before it became useless and broke.
5,Le produit est en métal robuste et semble être de très bonne qualité. Charge rapidement mon cellulaire. Reste à voir la fiabilité à long terme.
5,good
5,Really good for when you're on the road.
5,Works exactly as description states. Worth the $
5,I use this in my work truck to charge my work iPhone and my own cell.  I take it in and out of the truck every day and it's never come apart or has shown any signs of wear and tear. Solid. Amazing value and quality.
5,This is the best adapter I’ve ever had. It’s no bulkier than necessary and solidly built. (No fears of it breaking like cheaper options do). It definitely charges much faster than my previous chargers. It seems overpriced for a car charger adapter of any quality but it really is better.
5,Well made! Way better then the cheap plastic ones.
5,Came as advertised highly recommend!
4,ALL GOOD
1,Tried it in both lighter ports on my Lexus did not work  no power to usb cable.  Plugged in my old cheap gas station counter model  and it worked  fine.  Seemed like a well built  item heavy and solid  just dosen't work right out of the box
4,ALL GOOD
5,Pretty handy
5,Works as advertised.
5,Very good I liked and recommend
5,Happy with charger
5,Excellent produit.
5,Charger arrived faster than expected was packaged well and not damaged. Haven’t had it for very long but I’m pleased with the quality of the make. Definitely on the heavier side but I’d prefer that than a cheap piece of plastic. Fits flush against the outlet and has a subtle blue light around the USB ports.
5,Its works amazing
3,Look and feel was good. But tested with a dashcam that required at least 15W to record with both front and rear cam. Both ports didn't support enough current.
4,The seller contacted me and offered a replacement free of charge. I’d support this seller again in the future.
5,Love it and fast charge on Samsung  s20 fit my 2017Nissan pathfinder  great
5,Works perfectly and both ports do fast charge. I did Not feel much temperature increase at all. Nice.
5,Lots of charging power. Like the low profile.
5,Very good quality and small enough that i can close the cover of my car.
1,Looks like a nice built but it stopped working after a few months and I barely use it.
5,Look great doesn't stick out like other ones.
5,Works as described
5,Works great on my phone - enables quick charging. Low profile makes it flush with the charger port so it doesn't protrude as much as other chargers.
5,Charges my phone at super speed. Amazing product.
4,Hope it works will find out next month
4,Hope it works will find out next month
5,none
5,Best charger on the market if u have a car and a smart phone u need this
5,I use an 8 inch tablet in my car primarily for waze.Keeps my tablet at a full charge while in use.
5,Great usb fast charger.It's metal so strong and sturdy. The device is really small which is a good thing for me it's taking close to no space at all in my car.I recommend it.
5,Bon produit fontionne tres bien il est lourd donc fait de bon materiaux  depasse presque pas donc le risque de l accrocher est nul donc recommande le produit a 100%👍
5,Ordered for my 2011 Santa Fe Limited and works great. Solid build and tight fit. Unfortunately doesn't fit flush but very close. Quick charge works as advertised as long as the right usb cables are used.
3,Purchased two same item but different internal bags skimpy packaging product is heavier than similar two USB ports have different coloured plastic doesn't feel good have returned as the height isn't lower than the existing one plugged it in my BMW X5 won't close the flap FYI.
5,Great quality and fast charging
5,The product is fine delivery not so much. I found it in front of my neighbours door 😳
5,Je l'utilise dans ma prise de briquet sur ma moto Harley comme ça je peux brancher mon téléphone cellulaire et d'autres articles comme mon lecteur MP3 il est très compact et solide je le recommande et je suis très satisfait.
1,I dislike the fact that it doesn't have fast charging capability with 12 v input
5,Parfaitement selon description
5,Nice
5,This is a good solid charger plug.  It charges two devices at a time continuously (some double plug chargers flip flop between the plugs). It charges nice and fast it gets warm because of this but not hot.  The device being charged gets warm but not hot.
5,A++++++
5,So far so goodGood quality
5,Love it...
5,Works exactly as advertised. Solid construction
1,Ne fonctionne pas !
5,I like it a lot. Compact and tidy. <3
5,This charger stick out of the car port just enough to be easy to remove but not so much that it is in the way of anything. It works to Fast Charge a Samsung S10 but I don't know about later model phones and the power requirements they have for Super Fast Charging or the like. The metal body feels durable and sturdy and it has a nice sleek aesthetic.
5,I bought this tiny device for my Mazda 3 vehicle 12v charger port. It provides a strong charge current around 800~900 mA to my OnePlus 9 mobile phone.
5,Its great quality is the first thing that attracted my attention way better than any other charger.
5,Great High quality materials . Its made out of some kinda metal which is strong and wont break easily. Very durable with good charging speeds.
4,...not sure if it's the product or our car but sometimes it has to be jiggled to start working.
5,Merci
5,Excellent for charging phones in the car
1,Beware!! This device takes 5+ hours to charge my phone. I tried to remove it and it is jammed in my car. This could cost me significant money to have removed at the garage. Terrible experience!
5,i would like to say ainope products are best in quality and price.i am using there car accessories products from last 2 years and always get full satisfactionprices are very reasonablequality and durable 100%price worth products and get disappointedthanks
2,kept using different devices and finally boht ports stopped charging. tried different phones and cables. worked ok at first.. fail
5,Nice device.
5,I drive truck and needed a good charger and this is the one!  It's a very fast charger too!
5,Fonctionne et charge très bien les nouveaux cellulaires
5,Only had it for 2 days but charges my phone quickly and half the price of Best Buy
5,I used this on my buddys truck lighter on a vacation couple weeks back in lovely northern Ontario Canada and used it a few times and all times it charged my cell phone nicely so I give it the thumbs up!!!
5,Répond à toutes mes attentes jusqu'à présent. Comme dans la description du produit
5,The charger works exactly as explained by the dealers in Amazon. Worth the money spent.
5,Worked as described and was designed nice
5,It’s heavy compared to the cheap gas station ones and gives off the right power
5,Works as intended and fast charges
5,Works perfectly on OnePlus
5,Looks good works well and doesn’t take up much room! Love this little charger. It also has a nice blue light it gives off which looks nice at night.
5,Finally I got charger shows Fast Charging on my Sam G10e
5,Does what it's meant to do.
5,Love this and glad I got it. I like the fact that there's colors coming up so it's easier to find when it gets dark outside.
5,Très utile et fonctionne bien!
5,Nice and small. Works great
5,Honestly excited my expectations for the price and actually fast changes
5,Good material sturdy solid.  High speed charging to my Samsung S10+ with a 1ft USB cable.  Just a bit pricy but I still give it a 5-star review.
5,Charge rapide je suis plus que satisfait merci
1,I have two other car chargers that when I plug them in I get the Super charging notification on my phone but with this one it's just your regular slow charging... Sent it back for one that's actually real in on top of that I don't trust them anyway because they say that their Qualcomm certified but then when you get the box it has nothing to do with Qualcomm on the box and if your license by them you're supposed to be able to use that word... Charlatans...
4,Il charge rapidement et n’est pas en plastic
5,I like this.It’s working very good.
5,Amazing fast charger. Highly recommended
5,Well built
5,This thing charges like crazy! Good Amp output!
5,Nice aesthetics and heavy
3,Nothing crazy special about this. Yes it does it’s job. I don’t think it’s worth the money. Could have come with a 3’ iphone cord or something else selected by an option. Overall good product just overpriced.
5,Charges fast and very nicely build. Has two charger both are 3.0
5,I bought this product because no other plugin car charger was providing enough output to fast charge my iphone wireless inside my car. Most chargers output 10 W I need atleast 15 W. This product works perfectly for my needs. Very happy with the purchase.
5,Finally a car charger that is not fake on advertisement of it being quick charge. I tested it on my Redmi Note 10 Pro and it worked since it showed the Quick Charge charging animation.  So definitely worth buying.
5,Perfect size for my vehicle as the cigarette lighter is close to the cup holder.  Smaller size doesn’t interfere with using the cup holder.  So far it seems to charge my phone faster too!
5,Alternative products were always longer and would block my cup holders when a cord was plugged in.  Good to see that this one is metal very low profile and good build quality.
5,bon adapter en métal a l'air très durable petit ne prend pas de place.
1,So I was driving for over an hour and my phone went from 30 to 87% in that time. It’s not even that it’s just not a fast charger that is legitimately slower than dollar store chargers I’ve bought before.
1,Doesn't work as a warp or dash charge will not fast charge one plus products does work on Samsung so there's that I suppose take a peice of advise from me of yoi need one plus anything get it from one plus that's the obly thing that works properly.. It's a decent charger it's just wish they could deliver what was promised in advertising...
5,Great product.
5,Works as expected. Fast delivery.
5,Solid metal flush mount and works as advertised
5,Great build quality. Haven't tried it on the iPad yet but it does a good android fast charge.
4,To those who are wondering it is coming up as fast charge for our phones! We like the feel of it!
5,Compatible fast charge with Samsung and Motorola phones. Compact durable and stays in place.
5,Good
5,Great looking charger. Works well. I like the illuminated usb ports and that there are 2 ports.I am ordering another for my second car😊
5,Excellent rapport qualité / prix
5,Not a bad deal. Small in size but very good. It's a fast charger
5,I received a USB charger that worked at first and then stopped working shortly after even though the light went on. When I did get it to charge it didn't fast charge my android. I tried an S8 and an S9... Finally I reached out to the manufacturer and we tried to troubleshoot the item however nothing worked.So they sent me a replacement to see if it was my android phones or the USB itself turns out it was the USB charger.My old one I keep around right now and keep trying it but it doesn't seem to work reliably... Such a nice item I wish I could fix the old one but overall I'm very happy with the purchase and the customer support. I would buy more items from this seller.
4,Work in my car for fast charge...
5,excellent
5,works as it should
4,Works fine
5,Works well.
5,The best charger I ever bought!Well built strong and fast charging
5,Not what I needed sent back.
5,Works perfectly to charge my phone in my car
5,I like this low profile usb charger
4,As my headline states great product would give it a 5 star but the package was opened when it was delivered!USB Car charger box was obviously opened prior to delivery inside the USB charger seemed like new no markings or scratched but did have me a bit worried. Installed it in the car and connected my Samsung phone fast charged right out of the box no different than using my Samsung fast charger that the cell phone originally came with.So product wise this thing is a 5 solid feel and a bit of weight to it which is great over those plastic bodies chargers. The blue LED's built in are a nice touch lets you know the charger is there and ready to do its job. Having two USB ports is great in the rare case you need to charge two devices and this thing is super small so when you are charging the one device it is good as the unit is not bulky.Other than the opened box can recommend could be the box was damaged in the warehouse rather than something intentional as it performs flawlessly.
