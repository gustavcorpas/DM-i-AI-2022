5,I was specifically looking for a sub-$300 projector to meet the budget for my basement. The projector had to be 1080p and have the ability to ceiling mount with an inverted view.  My main use is TV shows and the occasional movie.  I previously had a mid-level BenQ projector so my level of standards are fairly high but I kept my expectations in check.Shipping was fast and the projector arrived without damage.The packaging is simple yet protective. Unboxing the projector I found the projector itself the power cable a 3.5mm audio to RCA adapter remote (you’ll need two AAA batteries not included) and the user manual. I was able to find a copy of the manual in PDF format online so I familiarized myself with the operation before the projector got to me.  I found the power cable to be a bit short for my setup. The included power cable is around 6 feet long. I would have liked a 10-12 foot power cable.The build quality of the projector is good for the money. The design is simple and the controls and inputs are intuitive. I particularly like the remote. It is simple with no frills. It gets the job done without being overly complicated.Setup is super simple. Select your language and you’re good to go.The focus is set through the menu. Using the remote fine tuning the focus is very easy. This is where I fell in love with it. Even before sending a video to it. The menu images are sharp and crisp even without a proper screen.There are plenty of inputs available to meet all of the devices currently on the market. The projector also has the ability for screen mirroring which was also easy to setup.My basement is long and narrow. But at 8.5 feet I was able to get a very clear 75” screen on the opposite wall. Quite the improvement from my 43” 4K TV which was several years old and giving out.Compared to my previous BenQ projector which was in the $700 range this NexiGo PJ20 is a strong competitor. Without having them side by side there are few differences that I am picking up on. For under $300 I have zero complaints at all.The first night I watched a few episodes of the Big Bang Theory and Star Wars Rogue One. They looked fantastic with clear and crisp images. The colors are rich and bright!  The last few days my kids have watched several Disney movies. The Pixar films look great on this!Fan noise is reasonable for this price range. You wouldn’t want to sit directly next to it but few would have it set up that way. With my ceiling mount the fan noise is a non-issue.The speakers are okay in a pinch but I would recommend some sort of external speaker. Bluetooth speakers would do fine. I’m using an Apple TV with two HomePod Minis. Paired with the PJ20 I have the ultimate budget setup.If you’re looking for a budget projector you can stop here. I highly recommend the PJ20. You won’t be disappointed.The projector has a standard one year warranty. Registering gets you a second year for free.
5,The Nexigo PJ20 is an awesome product for the price range. Having never owned a projector before I was expecting a difficult set up process and to spend lots of time getting things focused. NOPE!  This one was super easy to setup. The focus controls on the remote mean no manual adjusting and takes a matter of seconds to help you find a clear picture while the keystone knob knob on the unit itself makes finding the right “tilt” a breeze. It comes with a small height adjuster under the front of the unit which I feel leaves a little bit to be desired. I think it would be better to have 2 adjustable legs one on each side to provide a bit more stability and the ability do any lateral adjusting as needed independent of each other.Fan: The fan noise is really quiet. I watched a full football game and never once noted hearing the unit at all.Brightness: I have found it’s definitely shines in a dark environment. With any lights on it seems to get washed out a bit but this could also be down to the quality of the screen as well. In the end I think if you’ve got a good screen and the right conditions the brightness is not an issue.Remote: the remote is incredibly intuitive if not basic. Doesn’t come with batteries so buy your own.Sound: this is probably the biggest weakness in the unit itself. Using the unit on its own is OK but is difficult to get full rich theater sounding feel so you’ll definitely want to connect it to some external speakers. It has Bluetooth but I found an incredible lag between the video I was watching and the sound I was hearing which makes it basically unbearable to watch anything so you’d probably be better off hardwiring to something.All in all this is a great unit. I would definitely recommend it’s purchase if you want something quick and easy to set up. Perfect for outdoor movie nights.  It’s really intuitive to use and easy to move. You can have it up and running in under 5 mins. The nexigo customer service is top notch as well. I had a small issue with my first unit reached out to the customer service folks and had a new one delivered in 2 days.
4,I was excited to try this projector.  I was looking for a way to show movies outside and this projector seemed to have all the right specs.I'll start with the best feature - picture quality.  It was bright (compared to other projectors) crisp and clear. The keystone adjustment and built in kickstands were useful and effective.  It showed well both inside my house during the day with the blinds closed and on the outside surface of my house at night.Hardwired connectivity worked well. I was able to connect the lightning port from my iPhone and iPad to the USB port on the projector.  There was a slight delay between the iPad screen and the projector but minor (less than half a second.)  The picture was crisp.  I then connected a laptop to the HDMI port on the projector.  In both cases the projector worked as designed.  It would serve well for a movie night with a hardwired source.Wireless connectivity was a challenge.  The setup was simple - from the settings menu select your wireless network and type in the password.  I did so then the remote stopped showing letters. Further exploration revealed that the projector allowed a maximum of 17 characters for the network password.  Mine is longer than 17 characters so I could not add it to my home network.  Disappointing but I had a work around.  I created a guest network with a shorter password.  My eero network app showed it was added to the new guest network I just created.  However when I went to the screen mirror settings on my iPhone (after connecting it to the new guest network) the projector did not appear in the list of devices. I tried changing the name of the guest network restarting the phones and the projector all to no avail.  I had the same results on my iPad.I did not change the password of my main network; I've got three teen-aged children using their devices on my network and my wife in grad school working on an assignment. I was not about to tell them to reconnect with a different password this afternoon.  All that said I could not test any network streaming functionality.Additionally there are two modifications that I would have preferred to see.  First the remote did not come with the two AAA batteries required.  It would have been nice to have those in the package.  Also it would be nice to have a white line on the keystone dial to show it in the neutral position at 0 degrees.So to sum up:- The projector has a nice bright crisp and clear picture- The USB and HDMI input sources worked well- The network connectivity was challenging.  Perhaps a firmware upgrade could allow for longer wireless network passwords.- I would recommend this projector if you are able to plug in the source directly via HDMI or USB.  Until a firmware upgrade is made available to allow for a wireless network password of approximately 30 characters I cannot recommend it due to issues with network connectivity.
5,The projector came well-packaged in foam with power cord remote and a few extras like cleaning cloth and cotton swabs and a basic composite cable to 3.5mm adapter if you happen to have a device that might work on. I don't but I only planned on using a Chromecast or Roku plugged into one of the HDMI ports anyway so I didn't need anything extra.Setup was easy enough. Just plug it in and push the power button on the back which doubles as a basic vertical keystone correction knob. There's no horizontal one so you'll have to just center the projector to the screen well enough that it won't matter. There's a small foot that raises and lowers with a button push that helps to give you a little bit of adjustment physically to the height though two would have been nice to keep it balanced and level it as needed. There doesn't seem to be a manual focus option either so you'll have to set it up at a distance that you can see what's on the screen clearly enough to use the menu initially. Focus is in digital increments but it's fine tuned enough that a few of the levels looked good to me. Once in the menu along with the focus you can set up things like selecting your inputs resolution picture controls and set up WiFi and Bluetooth connections as needed.I chose HDMI1 and plugged in a Chromecast also using one of the USB ports available on the back to power it up. It started right up and I was able to start streaming. The speakers sound good enough for my use on a patio though I'll probably end up connecting an external speaker to it anyway. You don't really buy a projector based on the audio quality so I wasn't expecting much anyway but it's nice to know it'll work just fine without an external one. Fan noise is low enough that I don't think anyone will notice it over the movie playing. The brightness and clarity on the screen in a fairly well-lit room on an off-white wall was really good for such a low priced projector and the 1080p definitely was welcome and needed vs a 720p one. I plan on using this outdoors for movie nights with the family and friends so the brightness in a lit up room was my test on how it might look outside at sunset. I'm excited to try it out on the back patio soon. After first use it seems like a great projector for the price overall.
5,I am very impressed with this projector!My wife gifted me a projector for backyard movie night but knows that I like to extensively research everything so the task over to me to select a unit.  I had never even thought about buying one of these so I went in with no experience.  I strongly considered going into the $600+ area to get a laser projector because I was very concerned about the brightness level from the sub-$250 tier of projectors.  Ultimately I decided to purchase a more budget priced unit like the PJ20 and then if I really use it a lot consider upgrading in the years to come.When I got the unit hooked up I was really blown away by the quality especially at this price!  I am truly amazed that you can get such an awesome viewing experience for relatively little money.  The picture is clear and colorful with NO visible pixels at all.  The brightness is GREAT in a very dark room.  Although I haven't tested I think it would do ok with minimal lighting.  This is not a unit made to be used in a lit room.I really like the focus being controlled with motors via the remote instead of a clunky on-unit knob that almost all projectors in this price range have.  The remote is well designed and the onboard OS is very snappy and cooperative.  I hooked up a bluetooth speaker with no problem.  I later decided to use a 3.5mm aux cable to connect the speaker which also worked great.  I purchased a ROKU which works great with this product.  The USB input powers the ROKU perfectly.I have been impressed with this screen that I purchased at the same time:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VFMKJ86/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1It comes with a folding stand and very nice case.My main criticism would be that I have a bit of trouble getting 100% of the screen in perfect focus (all corners & center).  This is barely noticeable.  I suggest that users experiment with the keystone AND focus controls at the same time to get the best picture quality.  They work together.Bottom line I am very surprised that such an amazing projector can be had in this price range. I do not see a time in my future that I will want/need to upgrade into the $600+ laser style projectors because this one is so capable.
5,Using the Nexigo PJ20 has been easy and fun for a quick entertaining movie night. The PJ20 has multiple connectivity options so you can decide the best way to project your video. Using a Roku streaming stick it is very helpful to have the HDMI and USB next to each other on the back so having to run multiple plugs for power was not necessary.We started watching shows outside at dusk and the projector was still bright enough to be seen as it got darker outside the clarity of the picture really came to focus. I have a 100inch screen and at that size the picture still looked sharp for a 1080 projector.The fan is quiet and the speakers put out a clear sound. Having a solid speaker built in is nice because I don't have to bring another sound device outside. But it is still nice to have the option to use the headphone out connection if needed.I only had one issue where there is a shadow in the center middle of the screen when the size was larger than 100 inch screen unfortunate but I had not noticed it until breaking down the screen at the end of the movie when I was up close.This projector has been great fun for the family and makes for a fun outdoor activity.
4,The NexiGo PJ20 Outdoor Projector was delivered on time and the packaged was secure with no damage to the projector. Inside the box includes: the projector an audio/video adaptor a power cable a remote control and the user manual.The projector has a matte black finish the touch controls are on top air vents on the side and all ports (HDMI USB headphone jacks power button and keystone adjustment) on the back. The lens and removable lens cover is located on the front and hard rubber feet with height adjuster on the bottom.The projector is easy to turn on/off and setup was just as easy using the QR code which leads to the company’s YouTube video. The home screen is easy to read with the simple user interface. Features include Wi-Fi connectivity screen mirroring Bluetooth connections to headphones and portable speakers and casting through MS Windows iOS and Android devices. Adjustments such as viewing settings language settings software updates lighting and focus and sleep timer can also be made.The HD Projection is crystal clear with the LED light source. Focus can be adjusted through the electronic Focus adjustment on the remote control. The sound is decent through the connected 5W speakers but with the addition of Bluetooth speakers the viewing experience can be enhanced. The built-in fan dissipates heat well and is very quiet.A star is deducted as the remote control does not have a backlight; and since the projector will be used in dark areas use of the remote control will be limited. A carrying case would also be helpful for transport and storage. Overall the NexiGo PJ20 Outdoor Projector has a great value to cost ratio.
4,So overall this is a great budget projector. For the money it produces a pretty good picture. For movies it performs great and surprisingly is even passable for doing PC stuff - web browsing text editing etc. It's also nice and bright!My only complaint would be that they need to release a firmware update which makes the "focus picture" optional. I would like to use whatever my computer has on the screen as the basis for checking focus uniformity but that's impossible since when you adjust the focus the projector automatically casts a blue focusing picture on the screen. That's nice if you want to use their picture to focus but for those of us who would prefer to use whatever is on the screen (web page photo etc) to check focus it just makes it impossible. Projectors of this price range are bound to have focus uniformity issues which means that the user will spend a few minutes each session adjusting the focus especially if you have to move the projector around often.
4,We got this projector recently and have been using it for two weeks now. It was easy to setup almost plug and play. We could quickly use the screencast and play movies for a good family time.Pro's:1. Easy to setup and configure2. Picture quality is great3. Easy to carry anywhere you go4. Quick pairing with mobile phone external speakers etc.Con's:1. The quality of the remote build could have been better. Almost feels it can crack if you press any of the buttons hard.2. The projector cant store and remember the last wifi and bluetooth settings. You will need to pair every time to your wifi3. I wish there was a mobile app to configure all the settings easily. The remote makes it hard to navigate thru the various settings and especially when you have to type a long wifi password.4. The sound quality and volume could have been a little better. We still use a small portable bluetooth speaker.Overall we are happy with the product for the price and we hope to use it with family and friends.
4,It's a $200-ish projector.As long as your expectations are in keeping with that price you probably won't be disappointed.I was able to get a pretty good picture with my pull-up projector screen and gaming even FPS is responsive enough to not ruin the game. Speaker is not loud enough to be sufficient particularly with the fan noise so plan on some sort of external speaker or headphones.Biggest downside of this projector for me is that it uses a hinged fresnel lens to handle keystone adjustment and the more adjustment you use the more difficult it becomes to keep the entire screen in focus (at more extreme keystone adjustments the top or bottom of the screen tends to go out of focus). In the end I settled for leaving some slight keystoning in the image in favor of better focus.Again given the price I don't really expect better but if you want a perfect picture you're going to need to look at something in a higher price range.Pros: - Nice picture (again for the price) - Bright enough for my needs (dark room / basement) - CheapCons: - Difficult to focus and nearly impossible to get all areas of the screen focused particularly if you're using the keystone adjustment - LOUD! - Gets washed out quickly by just about any ambient light - Remote is very basic and on-screen menus are usable but not great
4,I really enjoyed this projector overall. It was great for movies after dark although I would reccomend using a sound bar as the internal speakers weren't quite loud enough. They were fine for games on the ps4 though and streaming content through my phone. The picture quality was good for a roughly 100in screen I struggled to get perfect clarity but it may have been my set up or operator error. Using the miracast to do screen mirroring from my phone was pretty simple and I enjoyed that part immensely. This is a great projector if you can catch it on sale and I'm looking forward to more movie nights with the family which is where this projector shines the most (in my opinion).
4,The good: In a dark room the result is very good. The 1080p resolution is good enough the colors are acceptable. Overall good product for the price.The so-so: The interface looks very old and there are no updates available.The bad: The audio output sounds very slow (trying from many sources the same problem always occurs). Another annoying thing if the projector is installed with a slight inclination you only get a well-focused image right in the center but above and below the focus is quite lost.The sound problem has not allowed me to enjoy 100% of the product since it is likely that some intermediate amplification solution is needed to increase the volume.
5,The projector was delivered pretty fast. The Packaging was really good.The Setup process for the projector is very simple. We kept the projector on a small stool by raising the single leg at the front center. We wished it had adjustable legs on all four corners. Focussing was simple with the press of buttons on the remote. Keystone correction is also easy. Since we kept the projector at center not having a horizontal keystone didnt bother us. Throw distance is substantial - so plan to put the projector far from the screen to get a larger projected image. We found that the image size changes by 10 inches for every one foot we move the projector. The Projected image brightness is very good. We picked PJ20 over PJ10 just for the additional brightness. The PJ20 has 350 ANSI compared to the PJ10 at 220 ANSI. We thought the PJ10 might be more portable with a smaller device size. We tried connecting various sources - iPhone case wired HDMI from a laptop. It connected seamlessly. With the iPhone some content such as netflix prime videos cannot be played. However everything played when using the laptop. The sound from the projector is decent for normal use. But for movies we connected initially to Anker Soundcore Motion+ and then to a home theatre by bluetooth.
4,I bought this projector to replace a 720P projector for outdoor movie nights with my family and friends but I also wanted it for my home bedroom home theater and here's my review:I'll start with my general opinion: this is a very good product for this price range ($249.99 minus a $50 coupon) it does everything (movies games and mirroring of your mobile device)Unboxing and first impression: When you open the box I notice the missing of carrying bag this is a disadvantage compare with other projectors in the same price range inside is the projector  1 power cable  1 3-in-1 AV cable 1 remote control 1 user manual 1 projector lens cover 1 cleaning kit the projector looks and feels of good quality as well as all the accessories includedThe Body – this is a full size of the projector light weight and good lookingEase of use: this is a simple projector in my case I connect my fire stick to it using the only HDMI it has and one of its USB ports and thus you have all your streaming channel on a 90-100” screen. . the focus regulator in the remote is nice yet I have to say that I prefer a manual configurationFan and Speakers: The fan is quiet you barely hear it when you're 5-7 feet away. There speaker sound very nice yet I recommend to pair it with a sound bar for a better experience with yourImage: this for me is the most important point in a projector. The colors are good the focus is good I noticed the edges of the images are a littler out of focus compare to the center and I couldn’t fix this reason why I giving 4 stars to this product For cinema it's good. The brightness is a strong point for the projector I can even use it during the day with close blinds in my daughter’s bedroom (check at the pictures)As I say I recommend this projector if you are looking for budget friendly 1080P projector you can’t go wrong with the NexiGo PJ20.
4,The picture quality is fabulous! The sound quality is good but not loud enough on certain apps I ended up getting a sound bar to supplement. Bluetooth makes it easy to connect to the sound bar. Super easy set up my ten year old figured it out with no help from me. It’s been fun watching movies outdoors with the neighbor kids and watching UFC and football events! Such great picture quality. Highly recommend
5,Little bigger than the projector I replaced but the picture is much better and the brightness is amazing. I set it up just to get the positioning right for later in the day and was surprised at how well I could see it as bright as it was outside.  I have to turn the brightness to 50 % when its dark.  * I do have a solar shade above it that helps with the outside light a bit. Probably like 30% to 40% shade level
4,The projected image is clear and bright and the keystone adjustment works as intended. I find the fan quite loud and blows out a lot more heat than I expected actually more than my old incandescent projector. If you have the room to move the projector closer or farther away from your screen then this is a great projector. I have a large screen in a big room and have to mount the projector much closer to the screen than my old setup since it throws a large image quickly and I haven't found an adjustment to resize without moving the projector itself. It seems like a well made unit and will get good use but it does have some quirks to work around.
5,We’ve had an Onn projector for a long time that was due for a replacement. Originally it cost about $100 more than this model but I’ll have to say that this Nexigo projector blows it out of the water! It’s all about brightness and resolution with this one. It was easy to set up and have it perfectly focused on a 100 inch projector screen. If you are setting yours up as a ceiling mount front projection like we did make sure to remove the rubber feet on the bottom to uncover the mount screw holes (which this is outlined in the directions).
4,PROS:1. Casting to my phone is very simple.2. Picture resolution is good.3. Features to align the projector with the walls are good.CONS:1. Sound quality could be better. If using it in a wide space you need to connect to an external speaker.2. I had to clean the lens before using because there was an obstruction. This was a minor issue but still an inconvenience.3. I think the cord is too small. It's barely 5-6 feet. If installing it on the ceiling you need an external cord.4. Batteries weren't included in the remote. Again a minor issue but another inconvenience.
5,The projector came well-packaged within the foam. The setup was easy. You need to connect your wifi and after that it is easy to sync with your phone. It has both options for android and IOS. Also you can sync with windows as well. Just plug it in and push the power button on the back which doubles as a basic vertical keystone correction knob. Once in the menu along with the focus you can set up things like selecting your inputs resolution and picture controls and set up WiFi and Bluetooth connections as needed. The speakers sound good enough within the house. However I am planning to use a speaker with it. The 1080p provides good brightness and clarity. I wish its power cord is more longer. However it is not a big issue Also I wish they provided an HDMI cable as well. However most electronics do not come with one. If you are considering to use with phone mirroring like me it won't be an issue for you.
4,This is my second projector so I had a couple things I was looking for in a plugged in upgrade.- Picture Quality/ Brightness- Sound (fan)- interface usabilityThe picture & brightness is great high quality not pixelated even at large sizesCompared to my portable projector the fan sound is near negligibleThe interface & ability to use the remote is very user friendly although connection to the remote can be a little laggyTL:DR Easy to use sturdy high picture quality
5,Love this projector. Need to adjust the settings a bit to get the right balance of contrast sharpness etc. and the truest colors but it works like a dream and everything looks amazing and vibrant. Best addition to my home and one of the best investments I’ve made. Great projector especially for the price point.
5,Over all it is a great price now with the 50 dollar coupon that comes with it and despite its low price it’s a produces very high quality results of the projector.Details:Fan noises existed but they are not very loud the speaker in the projector drowns it out when in use.Clarity of images on screen is excellent for a  big room.AAA batteries will be needed for the remote that comes with it light weight and can feel cheap. Take that that as you will lighter=cheaper?Functional works well and comes with easy to find instructions. When it comes to using phones computer iPad to display on the projector it is all capable and easy.Set up is simple and it come with everything for  it will need.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Overall I really enjoy this projector especially for the price.Some things I noticed:- There is an issue with Google Pixel phones not playing nice with Miracast functionality which I only realized after almost 30 minutes of struggling to connect. There are other cast options for Android users like Chromecast or Roku (which I tested) but they are not equal. The picture quality when casting to Chromecast honestly wasn't very good. When connecting my Roku Ultra however the picture quality was great.- Audio quality is good through the projector but obviously can only be so good. When using Bluetooth to connect a speaker to the projector while using a Chromecast there was a delay from the video that was just enough to be irritating. When using the Roku Ultra though and there was no noticeable delay at all.- Video quality is very good and the video included in my review is an example just from the white painted wall in my garage.- Fan noise while watching is noticeable but not that bad.- There is an adjustment foot on the bottom front of the projector but it only extends about an inch. I guess you really shouldn't need much more than that but I was kind of expecting more.To sum everything up I really do like this projector and I hope it gives many good movies nights in its life.
5,This projector is great for the price. The picture is clear and bright. The projector is quality built lightweight doesn't get hot and has a host of connections; 2 HDMI 2 USB Bluetooth for connecting to soundbars or other wireless speakers WIFI for connecting all your Mac IOS or Mirror casting and DLNA too. Also there is an included cable that does all the old A/V connections you'd use for Blue-ray or DVD players. The instruction book is easy to follow as are the onscreen menus. I use it for educational purposes teaching languages and it works well for that with a very bright and clear picture.It kept the kids busy while we went swimming I just popped in a flash drive with movies on it and projected them against our wall outside. Speaking of the kids they found out they could use this for their PC games. Just make sure to use the HDMI connection for that because WIFI will have a delay.The projector has an array of controls on the top front which are easy to get to but the remote control works great inside because the signal will reflect off the walls and get to the sensor but the people who complained were obviously outdoors. If outdoors you have to be behind the unit for the remote to work because the receiver is in the back of the unit. Windows will cast to it no problem So all in all I'm happy with it.
5,Very pleased with this purchase! It has a great picture  one of the better pictures from a projector I have seen! Set up was very easy the machine itself is a tad bulky but it’s features are top of the line. The best component of the machine is it’s compatibility with various tech devices. Apple set up was easy to screen mirror and I haven’t yet had it not be able to connect to my phone. I would highly recommend this product for anyone shopping for a projector!
5,5 stars for a projector at this price point. Delivered and setup today picture quality and brightness is great. Very little noise from the fan. You will absolutely want to have or get a soundbar or other audio. The speaker on this is very quiet.  Comes with very short 5.5 inch aux to rca cable.
5,will never buy a tv again. only a projector. with a screen and the lights off its just like a tv screen. still cant believe it for the price. watched reviews of 20 amazon projectors before purchaseing. saw online the diff between this one and a $700 unit and it was not worth the extra money at all to me. works exactly as its description
4,This projector offers a nicely extensive range of connectivity options. I used my iPhone via USB and wireless mirroring as well as HDMI from my Mac Mini and they all performed as it is described. The limiting factor is not at the fault of the projector but at the fault of streaming services (HBO Max Apple TV Netflix Disney+ etc.). Videos using these services cannot be outputted via phone because of these services content piracy protection but have no problem via HDMI through my Mac. When I’m able to use cast via my phone through more open sources it works wonderfully.Speakers are a miss but for most sound enthusiasts shouldn’t be a problem because we use external ones. A convenience to have at least for presentations and such.As for noise it is very noticeable. I would say it is about as loud as my air purifier on medium. Do note this is advertised as an outdoor projector so maybe you won’t notice it in louder environments or just loud movie watching. But for the quieter film viewers this is something you will always notice.Lastly the image. Now I’m not one who knows a lot about projectors but the image is perhaps what it makes up for its faults. Clean and crisp even if it only outputs 1080p. Colors are vibrant and not oversaturated which I’m glad it is not as I prefer accuracy. 350 ANSI brightness shows to be accurate. Number may seem low but it is plenty bright in the dark. Focus adjustment is quick and simple via remote. I managed to maintain a relatively sharp 1080p image at 80 inches on my wall. I do wish these adjustment buttons were available on the projector. Adjusting with a remote has a slight lag. The aspect ratio selection is very thoughtful should you decide to choose between 16:9 or 4:3.In the world of competing projectors this one will suit you well if you are in a budget. It is feature rich and performs great if you don’t mind its noise.
5,I have been using this projector for a bit and I will say that it is very nice to have. I use it for my work teaching and I have loved its convenience. I don't have large amounts of experience with other projectors but I wasn't expecting some of the features that it had. My favorite part of the experience was how quickly and smoothly it would play videos off of my flash drive after plugging it in. My only wish is that it would have the ability to play more video types (mkv etc.) but other than that it passed my expectations!
5,We’d been looking for a reasonably-priced projector for a while now. Overall we’re pretty happy so far.High-level thoughts:- Picture is crisp and clear. The keystone adjustment is a simple rotary knob. Focus adjustment can be done from the front control panel or the included remote. I found it easier to dial in the focus with the control panel vs the remote.- There are no means to elevate or tilt the projector. You will have to MacGyver your own elevation and tilt system for your environment.- While you can use Bluetooth or a wired connection to a mobile device there are limitations as to what can be played back on-screen. There’s some sort of DRM issue using certain iOS apps (D+ Netflix etc) with a screen-mirroring connection. We found it best to move the Fire stick and plug it into the projector directly. Menu and picture setup were far better this way too.- The included power cord is short. Plan on an extension cord or use a longer power cord.- While it has built-in speakers you may want to bring a BT speaker for maximum sound output.All that being said the projector was very easy to set up and use. Haven’t spent more than a couple minutes focusing the projector regardless of distance to wall. Bluetooth audio works well. Very happy with the simple controls sharp picture connectivity options. There are two HDMI inputs and two USB inputs. You can directly connect an android/iOS device a usb stick with media on it or anything with an HDMI port. The 1080p resolution scales well for a backyard movie night with the kiddos.There’s not really a ton to say about it other than it functions well. Recommended.
4,We just tried this out last night and it was a hit.While we were waiting for sunset I threw some Hotel Transelvania on to keep the kids entertained and I was pretty surprised that the image was good enough to see in the "magic hour" light.Once the sun set we put on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and by the time his bike got stolen I was pretty chuffed at how bright and colorful the creapy mechanical clown looked.My only advice would be to get an external sound device. Most projectors do not have good sound and this is on the quieter side.I bought a Soundcore Motion Boom Plus and it synced up great with the projector's Bluetooth.I also used a 4k Fire Stick (overkill for this 1080p projector) to stream the movie and it worked great with the projector.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Pros: projector has a nice picture for this price range. The focus is digital I am able to mirror my laptop to the projector so no need for connecting all the time Hardwired. To USB and two HDMI ports. Bluetooth works well with my Bluetooth speaker and the sound is decent.Cons: Even though the focus is digital it would be nice to be able to do it just in case the remote is not available. The sound of the projector itself could be louder. I never could get the Miracast to work from my phone. There could have been a hole in the bottom to be able to attach a small stand to the projector.
4,The picture quality is very crisp.  It was easy to set up.  The remote control and UI are intuitive and responsive.  If the projector is pointed at an angle you can't get the whole thing in focus at the same time though honestly I don't notice while I'm watching.  It seems like the room needs to be fairly dark to be able to see it well; I'm not sure how this compares with other projectors.  The sound is kind of weak to me better use external speakers; not sure how this compares with other projectors either.
4,This NexiGo PJ20 LCD Projector provided just what I needed for three main reasons. It is portable works outside and provides my guests in the 3rd guest room with entertainment while visiting. The quick start info was easy but I preferred to set up myself. A couple items such as the multiple menus but the unit provides a good picture even when used on a slight grey wall rather than a white. My concerns sound is not loud enough fan noise is excessive and the remote seemed a little flimsy power cord too short. Overall I think this projector is great for a mid-priced multi-featured user friendly projector. Thank you. Mark
4,At the $200ish price point it's pretty good.Focus is not very granular so be ready to move the screen to fine tune.Also keystoning causes some out of focus/doubling effect at the top or bottom so placement is very important to avoid that.
4,My sample of the Nexigo PJ20 had the worst focus discrepancy ive ever seen. Either the center of the image or the corners could be in focus not even close to having both.Remote is the cheesiest thing. Felt like it was going to break with every button push. I returned it the same day i got it !Positive plug for Amazons return hub and speed of credit processing though. Great experience !Demonstrating exceptional customer relations the distributors sent me another sample to review. I accepted as i was pretty sure there was a fault in the lightpath with my first unit and i really thought this PJ20 could excel in the budget projector arena.My son and I put it through its paces and we both believe it to be an improvement in the area of focus control beyond that of my original sample. The four corners were not as out of control as long as minimal keystone correction is applied.Most of these budget units have a very simplistic approach to keystone correction and using it alters the focus on both the upper and lower areas of the screen. This is true with this projector also and as with all of them focus is greatly improved if shot directly at the screen with keystone centralized. An impractical scenario as you probably know but if it can be done as close as possible you will be rewarded with a very good picture. Even the remote felt more solid than i remember !Upgraded to 4 stars because as i have to keep reminding myself this projector is only a couple of hundred bucks and the second unit performed very well !
4,It’s a great projector. Need to add speakers to the projector but besides that the picture is great and it’s easy to use
5,This projector is great! I've worked with some projectors before and while all of them have their pros and cons this projector was better than any I've used before.I tested the projector out indoors in the middle of the afternoon with all the windows open and without a screen (just on a white textured wall) and it was still completely functional if not ideal. The lightest image shown is this first run with all the curtains open and we could see it easier than the picture even shows. After closing the curtains (which is obviously the better choice) I was amazed at how clear the picture was and our family had fun playing Mario for a couple hours on what was basically a 12 foot screen.We plugged in an Amazon Fire TV stick and watched a movie on it and that worked out great as well. In the future I plan to use it with a laptop as well so I tried the wireless pairing and it was much simpler than I expected it to be. The instructions for connecting it wirelessly were great and it took only a couple minutes. The picture was smooth and clear.I was most concerned about the speaker vs fan noise of the projector but that was also not a problem. The fan noise was about what I expected but the speaker was better than I had expected. While playing the Nintendo on it there wasn't a problem at all but with the movie we had to turn the volume almost all the way up and it was enough. I suppose a lot of it depends on the volume of the particular media you would be playing. I would recommend getting a speaker set up for sound on the projector if you're trying to do something with a bigger group but for my family of four the built in speaker worked fine.Overall I'm super happy with this projector and am looking forward to hosting people for a game or movie night.
5,Great projector for the cost. Bright and very good for use outdoors. Pretty quiet too unless you’re sitting right next to it. Can project very far with clear quality and also can adjust focus. Love it!
4,This projector does a good job. It is the first one I’ve ever tried so I don’t have a reference or comparison. I plugged in a Roku streaming stick and was able to connect to WiFi with ease to stream movies. We projected onto a wall about 10 feet away and the picture quality is pretty good. You can adjust the focus from the remote with ease. The only down side of the remote is you cannot pull up the menu while streaming you have to exit to access the menu. Other than that the remote contains all other buttons needed and you don’t have to point it at the device for it to work properly. I do wish the projector had adjustable feet. I used a book to prop it up a bit. Sound quality is good and the volume goes from 0-100. I did try multiple times to Bluetooth connect to my JBL speaker without success because it could not locate the device to connect to. I’ll try this again in hopes it does work. The projector itself is a little bit on the loud side but when you watch something it drowns out the noise a bit. I have not used the backside projector yet but read you have to use a screen for this. There is a piece on the right-hand under side of the unit that comes out but I don’t know what it is used for. I have yet to try and cast but will try it with my iPhone and see if I can also use it with an Oculus. Overall pretty good product and my kids love using it.
4,Nexigo's PJ20 Projector is a solid performer and great value for money. I have been testing it on a painted wall in our bonus room for the last 20 days and various input types. First the positives:1. Even in my limited testing (on a painted wall ) for Image quality and brightness I can tell that the projector is a solid performer. The Picture (at a diagonal of about 60 inches) is sharp enough for my typical use (that is: Slide shows or impromptu movie screenings).2. Input Connections - wired: I tested the USB port with a USB stock loaded with Photos Videos and Audio. The projector/remote + interface was easy enough to navigate through folders and the media types. Have not tested the HDMI inputs yet.3. Inputs - wireless: This is where I was impressed.  The projector supports all major Wireless connections (WiFi and Blue tooth); I was able to project from my iPhone XR a Samsung tablet and a Windows Laptop; Setting up the WiFi was easy enough; I was able to pipe music and other audio through a Bluetooth connected speaker.4. Remote: small and elegant (inspired by Apple devices)Now for the negatives (and these are only a few):1. Build quality is so-so; The Plastic Housing and body fees light but is to be expected at this price point.2. The On-Screen user Interface Menu tree (English) should have bigger and better font.All in all a solid value and very much suitable for my use cases
5,Can't say much about this projector aside from the fact that it works great! I was able to test all of it's features and they work flawlessly. More importantly the image is bright and the focus works well. The pics above are the projector casting my Macbook to my apartment wall. Pictures don't really do it justice since it looks a bit blurry but otherwise the image is sharp. These were also taken with the windows open in the middle of the day and the image is still really bright. Good stuff!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Mirroring Options:You can mirror with android IOS  and PC. Love the options and they are good enough for watching movies/videos. Wouldn't say it's good enough for gaming if your wireless casting. If your connected with a cable then you can game no problem.Speakers - are actually quite loud and do a good job!Image Quality - pretty good I believe it does up to 1080p which is HD. ALSO in the dark images look the best. During daytime use if light is leaking in the home expect it to look like the photos I attached. Still good enough for usage which is impressive with the lights on in the home.What Could Be Better:Settings options - found them tricky to play with. The UI is a bit funky but once you get the hang it works fine.Remote: works but also a bit funky to play around with.Overall I would recommend this projector for someone who wants an HD image and is looking to play movies primarily out of this. You can game on this device too but the Refresh Rate is not high enough for shooting games. However any sports game could be played on this as well.Visuals are king with this projector and it is a spectacular buy if your looking for a device to watch movies sports and other events. If gaming is your main reason for buying then I would look elsewhere.
5,This projector was exactly what we were looking for when searching for a projector. Amazing brightness and very clear picture! Super simple to set up as well
4,Overall this is great value for the cost. I have been looking into projectors for some time but I don't have the budget for higher end ones.  My criteria were wireless streaming brightness 1080P resolution and form factor and this projector met those with some limitations.  The remote lags a but and the menus are a bit cumbersome.  Connection via wifi is pretty straightforward and the picture quality overall is good or a sub-$300 projector.  I do like the speakers and they do an adequate job in producing sound.
5,This is a really good unit. No overheating problems great 1080P picture.PROS:- Comes well packaged and feels solid and well-made- Super sharp picture (1080P) even at a long distance (11ft = 100" screen size)- Can handle Front or Rear projection- 2 HDMI ports 2 USB ports and an old-timey A/V port for RCA cable- Wifi 5 GHz and Bluetooth 5.1- Wireless casting supports IOS Cast Windows Cast & Miracast- DLNA support and Dolby Sound supportCONS:- When I used a large Keystone adjustment (projector mounted much higher or lower than the screen) I had problems focusing the top and bottom of screen. The middle of the screen is perfectly focused but I was unable to get top and bottom focused at the same time. When the projector is mounted at a similar height to the center of the screen everything focuses perfectly. I suspect this plagues all projectors in this price range...- The onboard speaker is functional but at only 5 Watts it won't replace your home theater system.- Fan noise is present but it didn't distract me while watching videos. I only noticed it when pausing the video.Overall I love this projector and I find myself wanting to watch it more than my 55" smart TV!!
5,I returned 2 projects before i found this one! Love it!
5,This projector is AMAZING!  I am impressed with the quality of the picture & the ease of setup.  I will use additional speakers especially when outdoors but the built-in speakers put out decent sound as well (which is rare in a projector)!  I love the fact that I can connect in every possible way; HDMI USB A/V mirroring from my iPhone!!  This is the most versatile projector I have ever used.  I can't wait to take this camping and use it for an outdoor movie but also want one to put in my basement to create a theater room!
5,Love this projector! Great quality and has been a blast for my family! My daughter keeps asking to watch “the wall”! Connects to Roku so easily! A++
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I was really surprised to have a product in this price range that gave such good quality video and brightness.  It was very simple to connect to devices and cast my iPhone to as well.  The audio quality was surprising as well.  Very clear and great volume without the need for external speakers. I did notice that when using Apple Airplay on my iPhone the movie quality was a little grainy.  Things like spreadsheets or photos were crisp and clear.  Connected my Macbook with an HDMI cable and video was very clear and colors vivid.  I was able to connect to my home network download updates and connect devices without looking at a manual or instructions.  VERY simple to operate and the menus are goof proof!  You can invert your video if you need to hang it upside down and it also has a backlit mode to project from the rear of a screen if you have one. Of course it has keystone adjustments via the power knob on back and focus adjustments on the remote control.  Adjustments can also be made using the touch controls on the top of the projector without need for remote.PROS:1. Great price2. Easy to use right out of the box with no instructions3. Bright picture4. Clear sound without external speakers5. Multiple ways of connectingCONS:1.  Fan is noisier than I think it should be (would not be an issue outside or during a movie)2.  No VESA mounts on bottom to connect to mount (would need compression frame type)If you're looking for a simple projector that has some some great features of more expensive ones don't pass this one by.  I own several other Nexigo products and have always been impressed by the quality and features.  Support was awesome the one time I needed them on a webcam.
4,It's a bit loud so in quiet scenes you can probably hear it running. The picture quality is nice. I have it blown up to my 120 inch projector screen and it still looks good.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This projector is awesome! I’ve tried other brands in the past but this one is by far the best! The value is fantastic for the price! It was so easy to set up I feel like I didn’t even need the manual to use it! There were 0 issues with seeing the screen even with the sun out and shining into the room. The picture looks fantastic as well and it’s really easy to adjust the focus. Connecting my Iphone wirelessly was no problem at all as well as hooking my laptop up to it.Only negatives I see about this product is that the remote control is a little finicky as you have to aim it just right. The fan also blows a little loud but the projectors speakers make up for it so you won’t notice at all.Nexigo is always good with customer service as well they’re a good brand to trust!My cat absolutely loved playing cat games with the projector you’ve got to get this thing!
5,Great Projector that does a great jobPros:-Good picture quality-Great Ability to adjust the angle of the projection and the focus of the projection-Good Sound system-Multiple ways to play videos from casting to the projector to using any commonly used cables to connect to the projector-Very easy setup and very quick to set up-Remote is easy to use and straightforwardJust some things to keep in mind when buying the projector:-It does need some airspace around it for ventilation just to stop it from overheating
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 After buying a different projector and sending it back I started doing a little more research on projectors.  I came across the Nexigo reviews on YouTube and decided to purchase it.  Not only was it what I was looking for it exceeded my expectations.  It has a great picture and the digital focus is an extra bonus.  The speakers are good but like the fact that it has Bluetooth capability.  I highly recommend this projector if you are looking for a mid priced projector.
4,The projector was good. The manual helped us how to install. Good quality to show movies. the only thing was the product box was ripped and damage as if someone tried to open it. It caught us off guard. We expected a brand new box not a damaged box. Overall nice projector.
4,I researched a lot before buying this projector. The ones which are cheaper than this don't have good picture quality. This one definitely raises the standard. Brightness is good enough to see and enjoy in daylight as well (with blinds ON). I've been projecting on my yellow wall and i think I won't be needing a white projection screen. The only issue that i think is that it's fan makes noise a little more than it should. But except this puchta l picture quality Bluetooth connectivity wifi connectivity
4,It works as intended can’t complain much about the video quality for the price but this is a loud projector I can hear it from the other room when this is running.
4,The product has a good image and sound comparable to others of it's price rangeRemote seems cheap quality and would have been good to also have a manual screen adjustmentFan is noisy if you are close to it
4,Watched a YouTube video and knew NexiGo this brand. The video ranked this projector 2nd place with good brightness. However based on the actual feeling and comparison with another similar price projector (Ussunny) this lux is weak. Ussunny is better (not ads just truth).
5,I have always wanted one of these but the cost was more than I was willing to pay.  However like other products from NexiGo this product seemed to deliver a great value so I went ahead and bought it.  I couldn't be happier with this Projector.  This offers so many fun options and my children love having the ability to watch a movie outside at night with their friends!  The projector was easy to setup has great resolution is bright enough has great sound quality and a very intuitive remote control.  I would encourage anyone who is looking for a projector to give this one a try!
5,I really enjoyed this with my family on our camping trip is was very simple and easy to pair my phone and Bluetooth speakers with. Great way to end the night with a movie
4,At first glance the quality of the box itself was great including the helpful package details along the side of it. Secondly I saw the pieces were individually wrapped and stowed separately from the rest.  The overall set-up of the projector was super easy with its clear and understandable manual. I also like that it came with its own cleaning supplies for when it gets too dirty amongst the inside.  The quality of the projector itself was fantastic with the Volume when at max (100) sounds just like any normal handheld speaker where it's not overly obnoxious or annoying. The picture and color quality was really amazing and could conform to either 16:9 or 4:3 which I appreciate.
5,I purchased this projector for movie nights by the pool.  We used it for the first time and watched The Meg this past weekend.  It worked perfectly!  We front projected on the portable screen that I purchased and had dual waterproof speakers for sound.  We couldn’t be happier!  It has to be dark out but works perfect for what we wanted.
5,Quite impressed with this projector. I have tried the sub-$100 category and those are just terrible. This was twice the cost but completely adequate. Even with a bit of afternoon light the picture brightness was surprisingly watchable on my projector screen. At night the brightness is perfect and close to the same brightness as my main projector that is 3.5x the price.Focus in the center is good but the top 25% and bottom 25% are less than perfect. This is not too noticeable from a distance but text in those areas makes it very obvious. There is a little vertical keystoning and that shifts the blurred focus more in the direction you scroll.Disappointed that there are no mounting holes on the bottom not even for a tripod mount but there is a removable filter on the side though so you can easily clean the dust that accumulates. That is a nice feature.Noise is noticeable and it pumps a lot of heat out the back but this is common with any projector that is giving you a bright picture. Sound volume and quality is a positive surprise but if you are watching a movie then you definitely need your own speaker.
5,Day 1Pic 1 - Lights offPic 2 -  Ceiling fan lights onOverall picture quality and brightness is much better than I expected for the price.It definitely will not work in a bright room but it does surprisingly well in the evening with a lamp or two on.Focus uniformity is less than stellar and only gets worse the more you use keystone but it is only obvious with text.  Also  there is no zoom so you have to get the distance just right for your desired screen size.Colors are pretty saturated (in a good way).  I wouldn't call it accurate but again I remind you of the price.Bluetooth pairing works for my portable speakers but is a bit wonky.  I also get a pretty loud hum in my speakers once it pairs.  It is much less noticeable once the audio content is playing.  On-board speakers are pretty useless.  At full volume it seems about the same level as the fan noise.My biggest complaint is that the picture settings only seem available to adjust when in a menu (same with focus).  You cannot have a live picture going while trying to fine tune the image settings.Overall it sounds like I'm being pretty hard on the little guy but for the money this is a great projector.  It is only Day 1 for me but I will update if I run into any issues.
5,It had a great picture fan not to loud but the sound really weak even hooked up to my surround sound it was weak. The sound was my reason for the 3 stars. Maybe I just got a bad one.Update. The company sent me a new updated projector got to test it out for about 3 weeks and so far so good it has way better sound. So I'm giving it a 5 star. A few of my friends have bought this same projector after and they are very happy.
2,I really wanted to like this projector. On paper it seemed to have all the features I was looking for at a fair price. I own another entry level projector to which I needed a second for the upcoming holidays. As a source of comparison both projectors are native 1080P with similar features.  I read many reviews and watched videos of the same which are somewhat misleading as to this projector.Picture Quality: It is fair but even in a dark setting with no ambient light clarity and color is okay at best. There is color bleed and oversaturation even when turned down. Watchable but not enjoyable. Many details are lost in standard its too washed out in dynamic and custom setting do not provide a happy medium. The focus control via remote is cool and nice to see an image to calibrate. Keystone is okay as well with a manual knob on the power button. Phone casting worked well.Sound: The biggest let down in several ways.  This product markets itself as having great sound and Dolby  capability. It can decode a Dolby signal but that is useless when the sound quality better on my iPhone.  It has one speaker which is severely under powered and sounds rather weak.  I attempted to compensate for this with both wired and wireless speaker setups however there is severe input lag with audio with Bluetooth as well as a wired connections. I attempted to correct via audio calibration but it still continued to lag.  Also something in the projector seems to limits the audio output to about 50% of its normal capability in external devices.  I had completed a firmware upgrade to see if it would help but it did not resolve the problem.Design/Remote: Projector itself appears well built and it was easy to setup. Connectivity is good.  Menus are okay but somewhat dated. The remove is very small(does not come with batteries) and works fine but IR sensor lags on input.Sadly I had to return after a week as I couldn't get the sound to an acceptable level.
4,Read the negative reviews and was hesitant buying it. However it turned out a great buy for under $200. Used it for outdoor theater. Picture is clear color and brightness is good. It's best when total darkness but watchable with some lights. No issue with bluetooth connection.However the sound lag a bit when connecting to soundbar via bluetooth. So I used the hard wired. Fan is little loud but didn't bother us. We have used the projector for 5 hours per day and so far so good. Overall it's a great value.
3,Pros:- Decent Price- Simple Interface/Controls- Decent 1080p picture qualityCons:- Audio latency when using Bluetooth/airplay use a wired connection to fix this- Might be just me but some online video sources just won’t load when using this projector unsure why- Load fan & the sound could’ve been a bit louder(I would’ve provided pictures but for some reason Amazon won’t let me add them to my review)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This product is absolutely great and easy to use. The manual is also easy to understand. Right out of the box plug it in and it's practically ready. All you need to do is link it to you phone or use the HDMI port for a fire stick or similar device.This is also made in America and if you have any worries about craftsmanship or warranty you can register it and receive an extra year.Cons: lens is not attached (so possibility of loosing it) it does not come with adjustable feet to heighten the video so you will have to prop it up on something if the screen is higher than the platform being used and if using for an outside for a party the audio is not very loud for bigger group viewing and would suggest using a Bluetooth speaker in lieu of the audio it provides (but audio is just fine for inside use)Pros: easy to use (almost anyone who can operate a TV can use this great picture/ video (it really was just like watching my HDTV and can be used with the light on for business presentations) it has audio included which is great for office or business use and it has multiple ports for different type of devices
5,I use this in the back yard on a 150" screen. This is a replacement and even my neighbors (who come over to watch occasionally) remarked at the picture quality and brightness vs my two year old projector that thankfully the sound failed so I purchased this one! Quick ship I do wish this had a carry case for portability but I'll get a camera case and carve the foam out...
5,
5,If you are looking for an outdoor projector this is the one you need to buy! The two features that impressed me the most about this particular projector are 1.) the brightness and 2.) the interface. We regularly host outdoor movie nights for our kids and their friends. (It's the perfect Covid-friendly activity especially if you live in California where it doesn't get too cold at night!) We like to start the movie fairly early so that the little ones aren't staying up too late. This means starting the movie around 5pm before sunset. The brightness of this projector is perfect for that timeline! We own a similarly priced projector and could definitely not watch anything with that one until the sun was completely set. The interface is also very user-friendly with this NexiGo projector. We did not have to consult a user manual at all. We plugged in our Apple TV and were streaming Encanto in record time! The only con with the NexiGo projector I found is the inability to physically adjust the angle of the projector. Our other projector has a little screw at the bottom that you can adjust to tilt the front of the projector up. This one doesn't have anything. We had to experiment with a couple different stacked books to find the right angle for the projector and finally found one that positioned the projector just right for the screen. It's certainly not a deal breaker though. In short if you're looking for a bright and easy-to-use projector I highly recommend this one.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I took this video in our media room.  We mounted the projector from the ceiling ( took a little engineering ) but it gives a sharp picture. We notice that the more level you set the projector the better the picture.  This projector was tops in our research and has not disappointed.
3,While this projector did have a good image quality and brightness for its price point the out of focus top and bottom 15-20% made it a return for me.  It also didn't have a zoom function for the image size which isn't unexpected at this price point but is preferred for me because I use it as a traveling projector and that means I'd like to have additional adjustments for flexibility in setup/positioning.  There are better out there at this price point.  Specifically take a look at the Va*kyo V63* its very similar but with better focus and adjustments. See the attached photo for the bluriness at top and bottom.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Perfect Projector for Outdoor Movie night with my Grandkids.  Easy to setup and use.  Picture quality is phenomenal given the cost of the projector. One small gripe is that there are no mount/tripod holes on the unit.  Fan is a bit noisy.  Would definitely recommend this outdoor nighttime use.
4,it works great.  it is bright and does not  put out a lot of heat.The only reasons i did not give it 5 stars is i would have liked a Zoom lens.  and i use it at table top height and have to put things under it front to aim it up higher for the screen.  it would be nice if it had a foot that came down to adjust the height of the projection.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I was surprised it is lightweight. Excellent quality image with light (outdoors and indoors).  Good sound best if you connect it with home theater. I connect it with a fire tv stick and it is great option for movie nights.
5,Wanted a projector to use outside so the kids could have a movie night from time to time.  This fit the bill  for what I was looking for as I wanted something budget friendly and did not necessarily need all the features of the more expensive model.  Solid picture and we can easily set it up outside more movie nights.
3,The sound sucks
5,Purchased this based on reviews of previous buyers and online reviews. Totally satisfied with this projector. The picture is very clear the set up was very simple. I used the Bluetooth capability to sync with a JBL speaker to give that theater sound while watching movies. I use a fire stick to stream my apps to the unit. You won’t be disappointed with this unit.
5,The connection with my devices was very easy - I tried connecting my Android phone as well as my Surface Pro 4 with and without my cable and it was stupidly easy. The projector was very easy to install and with my blinds partially shut the brightness was very good and the audio also worked well.The packaging is compact and easy to carry (compared to the older projector that I had). The visual quality is what to be expected from a projector and there is noise but it's minimal. It says in the description but just to emphasise batteries have to be bought for the remote.I'm excited to use it to watch movies!
5,Picture quality seems decent.  Price point was also decent.  Mine had no remote in the box though so Im going to need to email the company to have one shipped... ugh... EDIT: I reached out to the company about the missing remote and the got back in touch with me and sent me a new remote very quickly.  Great customer service!
5,This product was so easy to set up and connected to the bluetooth on my phone so easily. The quality of the picture was great the sound was very good. It's portable and can be used anywhere you need to project anything. I've used it twice already to project presentations in rooms without computer monitors to run training classes at work. I also used it in the backyard to watch a movie under the stars. I would highly recommend it.
5,I've had this projector for about a week and I absolutely it. The picture quality and brightness are great. Plus it easy to set up and use. If you are look for a fun family movie nights I'd definitely recommend this product.
5,The picture quality looks washed out the brightness is low the remote requires careful positioning to work.It arrived with one of the bumpers broken off.The USB slots don't work with any of my modern thumb drives.All these things I think are fine it's a great value for  a $200 projectorThe easy connectivity to your phone is wonderful and it’s fast and responsive to use a nice cozy experience. But there's something wrong with the fan it's gratingly obnoxiously loud. 64.6 decibels.It could have been dropped in transit or a defect in manufacturing but I'm returning it.Update- The company replaced my product and the new one is 10 decibels quieter.It’s a big improvement I appreciate. Now I’m quite happy with this.This new box was missing the instructions but fortunately I remembered from the previous one.
5,Overall great. I wish it was a little louder.
5,Good build quality. Worked perfectly for outdoor movie.
5,I use the projector to teach students and it is important to me that I can connect both wired through HDMI cables and wirelessly with bluetooth and this device does a fine job. Some of my course work includes audio and the speakers built in and the ability to add additional ones is a big plus.  I was a little skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews and I personally have not experienced the issues they mentioned. I am happy with this projector and I am happy to recommend it for the cost. The quality of the picture is quite remarkable for me as well.
5,Worth every penny. Just shy of 1080p id say. But can play movies great. I personally wouldn’t invest $4k in a laser projector when this looks just fine for only $200
5,I had always wanted a projector but i am not very technical and dont know how to check out all the specs and features.  i have used several nexigo products so i gave this one a try as well.  NOT DISAPPOINTED at all.  My husband was able to set it up.  It a great fun to watch on this projector.  We are really enjoying movie night experience!!
4,The picture was great in a well lit room! It was easy to use. I like that I didn't need to buy an adapter to connect it with my iPad. My only complaint is that it runs loud.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The picture quality is amazing and it's up there with more expensive projector's The electronic focus work's like a charm and it makes the image sharp on all corner's of the screen.
5,I've worked with a few different projectors in the past and I have to say at this price point this one takes the cake! Let's start with some of the major pros:1) Setup was super easy! Literally just plugged it in and the picture adjustments went by quickly2) The picture was crisp and worked well with all the lights on3) The wireless connectivity was an amazing feature to have! I've struggled to get setup with others before (if they even have the feature). At this price point it was a really great additionCons:1) The power cord could be a little longer but easily fixable with an extension2) Very slight lag when connecting wirelessly but this is to be expected. Not a problem at all when watching videos but can be for games.Overall I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a projector!
2,Upon reading previous reviews I had high hopes for this new projector. As soon as I received the item I opened the box and began to test it to make sure it works. The projector appeared new until I turned it on. The "new" projector had a very dirty lens and the fan is very loud. I was impressed with the picture quality as it does appear to be very good. I would have loved to given this item 5 stars but expectations fell flat. I will probably be returning this projector in the near future.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The nexigon PJ20 projector comes with Full HD resolution which is 1920 *1080 which supports wireless mirroring for IOS Android Windows with 5GHz Wi-Fi technology. The projector inbuilt speaker comes with Dolby sound is good enough to watch videos on the go. It comes with Bluetooth 5.1 technology for immersive audio experience. It comes with 2 HDMI ports 2 USB ports AV and a 3.5mm audio jack. The screen of this projector ranges between 40” to 200” with electronic focus. It is packaged with a remote control and the batteries are nor included. Electronic focus made my work easy instead of manual focus. whatever i want to share from mobile i am able to mirror using the screen mirroring function. Even in regular light the image was extremely clear. Overall I believe that this product is well worth the price it is sold at. Please check below for the images and the product review video.
5,do not underestimate. works well just can't be to bright .
5,I compared this projector to the Epson VS260 and the BenQ MS536. For the money this one is perfect. Better picture quality sound and ease of use.
5,*update* Seller reached out and has sent me a remote control. Makes the projector much more useable.This is a great budget projector for games especially bc of response time compared to other projectors at this price point. But mine didn’t come with a controller so it’s a pain to adjust sources and focusing with the buttons on the projector
5,Very bright. You can see it even outside on a porch on daylight! But at night time its super bright. Its like watching a real tv on your wall! Just buy it!
5,I did not do my research and bought this and researched after the fact.  I have this hooked up by HDMI from my gaming rig.  Other reviews rightly call this one of the brightest projectors with the lowest latency (vital to a gamer) in this price range.  Glad I got it.
3,I really liked how easy this was to setup and how great it looked inside. Unfortunately I am looking for a projector to use outside which this is less then ideal for. The speakers are also not the best which is why between the two factors I gave this 3 stars. However pairing Bluetooth was insanely easy and made it sound way better. If you have Bluetooth speakers and want an indoor projector this is great for its price. If you are looking for outdoors maybe try one with a higher lumens count.
5,The quality of picture is just great for home family or friends movie night at home.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought  this project to use while camping. The project is very bright but it has very little adjustments when it comes to the picture. I had a very hard time getting the corners of the picture to focus in well. Over all not terrible for the price point probably wouldn’t buy again.
5,The projector is surprisingly very bright making the image legible even in dim daylight (last photo was made early in the morning the picture is even clearer at night). I was also glad for the seamless connection with my google chromecast. I didn't have to use the remote because all you need is to make the projector focus and take the input from HDMI but if you use in-built MirrorCast the remote might be handy.The only problem I noticed was the fan noise. However it is manageable with speakers playing sound and you get used to it. It is a problem with any kind of projectors since they get pretty hot.Overall good buy!
4,This projector is the sweet spot between indoor outdoor use big & small. Sound quality is adequate but of course a sound bar of some sort would be a great addition. Definitely recommend for those Netflix & Chill type nights… 👌👍
5,When the lights are off It looks like a regular massive screen!! I didn’t expect it to be so clear! Very impressed with this product!
3,It’s just not bright enough but it’s got all the right controls that would be a great product just needs to be a brighter LED
5,This is a great projector with lot of features and good picture quality. 1080 picture quality produces great viewing experience. Set up is straightforward. Viewing experience will be greatly enhanced with a  quality screen and surround sound set up.
5,- Very bright and good.- Sound is good for projector quality.- Fan is a little loud but can be masked by Turing volume up high.- easy set up and turns on quicklySatisfied.
3,Do not like the poor focusing
5,The picture quality on the big screen is so great! It's like we're in the movie theater. The other good thing is the built in speaker. The sound effect is good as well so that we don't need to add new speakers. Overall it serves us well as a personal movie theater. My children loves it very much! Now every night they ask us to have a movie night with this projector.
1,I watched a YouTube video “Best Projector under $200”  by The Hook Up channel. I had bought his recommendation on the best $100 projectors and was very happy with what a 720P could do and just had to take the next step.This however was doomed from the start as Amazon had sold out and did not no if or when they would get more.I held fast though because of the recommendation and in about 3 weeks it showed available. Bought it right away and could not wait for this 1080P to come in. Come in it did boxed nicely but not sealed or taped. The plastic bag on the projector was not sealed and the remote along with the cords were just in the box. 1st red light. I thought  was this used and returned?Plugged it in and the picture was upside down. That was the 2nd red flag.3rd red flag was the keystone knob turned approx 5-10% and the horrible keystone effect never changed 1 bit.It was useless. The keystone was so bad no matter how I positioned the projector stand there was no way to focus properly it was impossible to watch. 0 stars for the unit although it did seem very bright compared to my 720.5 stars for return on Amazon. It was my first return and Nichole was very helpful just had to get a QR code emailed to me and off to Whole Foods they scanned the code and I was off hopefully getting a refund in 3-5 business days.Just fyi as soon as I ordered this one the listing said not available not sure if or when they would get more.Watch out for this seller. I would like to know if anyone else had similar problems.
5,Where can I purchase another remote that works with this projector? My dog ate the first one!!!
5,The quality of the picture is good for the money that you are going to pay…but the fans are a bit too loud but an excellent purchase over all
5,Amazing projector for $200Easily hooks up to Bluetooth speakerAmazon fire stick works greatDef a good buy !!!
5,Love it  works great  I wish the speaker was a bit louder but other than that no complaints
5,I have a small finished basement that I use the projector in and it works great..great sound easy to connect to Wi-Fi and phone mirroring (iPhone). I use my wall as a screen and it’s perfect for me everyone is going to have a different preference but it works great..I will be adding external speakers to get more of a movie theater sound but the sound from the projector is pretty good in my opinion I even have to turn it down low certain times
2,Item arrived on time and packaging was intact and not damaged but when the projector was turned on the projection has a slash that when the focus is adjusted comes in and out of focus.  This leads me to believe the glass was damaged.
5,100% recomendado el mejor en su rango de precios
2,I had one and the fan was incredibly loud. I contacted the manufacturer and they said it must’ve been damaged. I was sent another unit and that was just as loud. Reviews online say that this has a quieter found in others but I disagree.
5,This unit is super bright  great focus and perfect fir home movie and consume Netflix contents using a TV stick. Great wifi and Bluetooth functions. Just go for it. You won't regret!!
5,We had movie night in the yard on Thanksgiving everyone was amazed on the quality and brightness of the projector. Even the nieghbors were watching. Amazing machine bluetooth connected to my stereo for theater sound. Cant wait to watch the fights. Best bang for your buck.
2,I liked everything about it. It just stopped working after two hours of play
2,Before you buy you should really think about saving your money up to get a better quality projector. The zoom is not information across the screen. Definitely not as bright as was described but the lack of lumens should of been a que for me before I purchased. We tried to use it but the I interface is difficult. It is literally just taking up space now. It's just worth it to spend more money to get a quality projector.
5,I was sent a replacement unit and it worked perfectly great picture  clear and focused perfectly easy to set ip and use can't wait for the superbowl. 👍😀
3,It’s quite noisy while running
1,As seen on YouTube and reviews on Amazon it appeared to be a pretty good projector I was very excited to set this up not to mention I already brought accessories to go with the projector very happy to receive it and set this up and realized I got a damaged one.WHY ME! What luck. I’m trying to get a projector for a movie night for my grandson’s birthday. I want to order another one  but I’m afraid I’ll end up in the same predicament.SMH ( I really believe that this brand projector is good but I just didn’t get a chance to experience it because I was sent a damaged one)
1,Got it the first day and it literally projected a green and won’t power back on. Now I literally have to go return it. I only used it for 20 minutes and it broke.
1,Picture quality was not as great as I had hoped. The lense came already scratched. You can never really get it into focus with the adjustments provided. Text is a a serious strain on the eyes so I would avoid if your planning on using this for gaming. Lastly the audio output (both Bluetooth and aux) cuts out frequently.
1,Besides of being larger than it appears on the pictures it just stopped working after 1 week I am returning it via amazon
2,Couldn't sync to phone
5,Home theater is a lot of fun but I also need a projector to take to meetings to give PowerPoint presentations and to show short instructional videos. Up to now I have been using my “old workhorse” the 4000-Lumen Epson VS400 and in this review I will include some comparisons between old and new projectors.Unpacking was simple and the manual has easy-to-read large type. I was up and running immediately.The PJ20 is a large projector. But it is also relatively lightweight. In my case I will be driving to meetings not flying so I am happy with the size which actually might deter someone from stealing it. I measured the weight at about 1.5 pounds compared to 6.5 pounds for my old VS400.I prefer a built-in lens cover because I won’t lose it but this is a minor inconvenience. The keystone knob at the rear is large and easy to use. Other controls and ports on the top and back panels are clearly marked. The remote control so easy to use that I would recommend to avoid using the on-device buttons.I was impressed with the clarity of the PJ20 images that I projected on a painted wall in a room with strong ambient light. The very large projection lens certainly helps. PowerPoint presentations look impressive. Videos play smoothly. Four picture samples are included in this report showing a TV image a nature scene and two PowerPoint slides. I felt that my older projector had comparable brightness but I think that was a side effect of the VS400’s lower contrast and long-throw lens. The important point is that the PJ20 holds its own impressively while drawing half as much wattage and its native 1080p resolution is state of the art. The PJ20’s lamp is supposedly rated for 50000 hours and should last for 5-10 years compared to spending more than $100 every 2500 hours to replace the VS400 lamp. Keep in mind that I deliberately kept the lights bright in the test room and the PJ20 images were perfectly acceptable when viewed 30 feet from the wall.There is a movable foot in the front to adjust the tilt. I found it to be too short when projecting 12 feet from a wall with the PJ20 sitting on a standard 29” hotel seminar table. Also there is no rear foot adjustment to account for an unlevel table. I would need to make some shims to take with me.I haven’t previously used the Windows Cast or Miracast features and I was extremely pleased to find they were easy to set up. I have a 3-screen desktop in my office and the shared projector quickly came online as a fourth screen for my PC.  Wireless connectivity makes meeting setups really simple and it’s a a great convenience to not depend on a cord between PC and projector. In order to make the connection you may need to expand your PC’s Windows Action Center options list – in my case the Connect button was hidden.The audio connected automatically along with the Windows Cast. The speakers have a bit of bass but they do sound like they are in a little plastic box which of course is exactly where they are. For home theater and professional presentations I will use external speakers. The fan noise was noticeable but not distracting.When I joined the PJ20 to my Wi-Fi network it immediately prompted to do a firmware update over the Internet. This was initially confusing and underscores the need to read the manual first as this was not a system firmware update. Following this over-the-air update my Wi-Fi settings had to be re-entered.The full system firmware update requires downloading files to a USB drive which is then inserted into the projector. My first attempt failed because the support page was password protected. However my correspondence convinced the company to remove the block and other buyers will download updates easily.In SummaryPros: Lightweight bright sharp display great color saturation lots of connectivity options nice remote control equally good for home and small business use removable/cleanable fan dust filter reasonably low power demand.Cons: On-device controls are not as easy as the remote lens cover will be easy to lose.At $249 the Nexigo is more than competitive for home and basic business use and it features state-of-the-art as well as legacy connectivity.  Within its design parameters price point and Amazon’s ranking scale I will give it a “5”.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This product came packaged in premium packaging. This projector is for those wanting to get into projector viewing at a great value (picture quality motion blurenergy efficiency inputs outputs etc/cost) without going broke. I have a screen I will be using this with but tested it on a wall with blemishes.It still showed an awesome picture. I streamed from a firestick and it synced on demand with the TV Netflix account indicating responsiveness.  This is a nice purchase that I feel thus far I can be satisfied with.
5,Projector works great. It is so much brighter than my old one (this one is larger). Bluetooth syncing worked great. No more having to run wires to my speakers. Audio seemed to sync with movies 100% accurately. Picture quality is spot on as well. Good contrast even on a whited out Hockey Ice. Would recommend 100%
5,I have purchased 2 different ones so far and this one I absolutely love. Definitely worth the money!
5,This is a really good projector the picture quality is extremely crisp and good the brightness is perfect and the remote control is very easy to use! Out of all the projectors that I have used this one is the best! It's a must have product.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I was no compensated in any way for this review. I want to be clear about that because shopping for a projector was difficult because almost all of the reviews were colored by people that got something for their review.Excellent projector for the price. We purchased an under $100 projector and it was dreadful. (The highest rated projector on Amazon) We watched some reviews online and settled on this one. The Hook Up on YouTube recommended it and we took the leap.We also grabbed a screen and a laptop stand and that greatly improved the quality of the experience. It is bright enough to use with moderate daylight. But definitely performs best in darkness. We hooked up a chrome cast and a mega boom speaker and it’s awesome. The internal speaker is good enough to use and we have used it when the mega boom is out of better without any issue.Pictures and videos from Netflix and YouTube.Overall very happy. I would repurchase this projector.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The NexiGo Native 1080P Projector is a business-like projector.  With 9500 Lux Brightness and your typical screen it should be sufficient for small to medium size conference rooms or home theaters.  The projector is relatively large at 12.5x9x4.3 inches (see photo) but is reasonably portable for moving from one room to another.  Due to its size I don’t consider this to be the type of unit you might take on the road.  However the unit size is primarily dictated by the very large lens (this is good as it maximizes light output) and LED bulb.  Initially I tried the unit with its HDMI input and like most projectors it operated without any issues.  Given its ability to connect to Wi-Fi I tested that capability with both my iPhone and iPad.  The projector successfully mirrored the displays on both the iPhone and iPad.  Video quality was excellent. Check out the short video I made of the iPad screen being projected on my wall.  Any "small ripples" you see are due to my projecting on a textured wall.  I found the color quality for things like faces to be good and the speaker can fill a small to medium conference room.  The contrast was excellent and black level good.  The projector does produce a moderate amount of heat (UL label shows it can consume up to 140 Watts) and as a result it must have a fan.  This is a fact of life with any bright projector.  Fan noise is typical for most projectors.  The remote is easy to use and it easy to figure out the menus for source selection and setup.For its price this is a great projector for the office or home theater.Lots of bits of information:• Keystone correction is easily done via a mechanical knob and associated mechanical movement inside of the projector.  Many other projectors have a digital correction via menu settings.  Mechanical correction is fast and easy does not reduce resolution and can provide some focus compensation for the differing distance of the projector to the top and bottom of the screen.  Digital correction results in a loss of resolution and can not compensate for differing distance; thus you are more likely to have either the top or bottom of the screen out of focus.  On the flip side some projectors with digital compensation can also correct for a projector not being horizontally centered with the screen.• The projector does not have a mechanical zoom.  However it does have the ability to scale-down an image via a setup menu.  Thus if you have to place the projector too far from the screen you can use the digital “zoom” to reduce the size of the image to fit the screen.  This is at the cost of resolution.• The projector has two USB inputs which can be used to source video files or slide shows.  You can do things like place a pre-recorded video on a USB stick and run the video in a loop mode for a continuously running show.  I tested this capability and it worked great.• The projector does have a foot for vertical height adjustment.  You will find the button to release the foot at the bottom center along the front edge of the unit• The top front panel has touch buttons for access to the menus.  However the remote is much easier to use so don't loose it.
5,This is a great projector for the price. (Be sure to check for coupons when it's available to save even more money!)I was easily able to set this up in my room and I can now watch TV easily from my bed with the wireles connection to my laptop. The audio output from the projector itself is very useful and more than adequate. Focusing the image is simple with the remote control. Image quality is excellent centrally but could be improved towards the corners.I am able to use the projector in daytime (with blinds) as well as night time.Unfortunately my Android phone is too old to cast onto the projector wirelessly. But I've tried both the wireless connections on each of the following products: an older iPad an older MacBook a Dell laptop and an iPhone 11. The only catch is that the devices and projector have to be on the same network.My favorite feature is the ability to connect iOS devices to the projector with the standard lightning to USB-A cable. (No HDMI converter needed).Overall I would highly recommend this projector for the wireless capabilities.
3,The operating system feels outdated. The projector blows out lots of heat not ideal for sitting next to my bed. Don't buy this unless you can line your projector up perfectly square. While it does have vertical keystoning it completely ruins the focus. You have to have no (or minimal) keystone and have it be perfectly parallel with the projected surface to keep it focused everywhere at once.The remote makes it easy to adjust focus on the fly. Bluetooth to my speaker worked well - good thing becaude the audio jack seemed completely loose and didn't work at all. Picture is pretty small at a distance of 5-8 feet so make sure you have a very large throw distance available. Brightness was acceptable watchable in low light environments. Not so much in daylight. Would not recommend using it outdoors it's not that bright.
5,i like to use projector to watch movies at homeI used to have a small portable projector but I figured it will be better to have a larger projectorthe brightness image quality are surprisingly goodworks great with wifi and compatible with my galaxy s20 ultraI can connect it to my computer to watch movies or to my phone for youtube or other videos.
5,This projector had 2 features that I really wanted which were:1) Any device that can mirror (IOS Android Windows) content can connect through the wifi and show a presentation or a movie or a video game without a problem2) The bulb of the projector is LED which not only consumes less energy but lasts longer and is (in my opinion) a better technology.However I discovered things that I did not expect:3) The projector has speakers! When my kids show themselves how they play in a videogame the actual sound comes from the projector. Now if you want to go the extra mile you can connect an external speaker through a 3.5 jack and you can hear it as loud as you want.4) The projector has a secret button that when press shows a leg that can allow to rise the level of the projector when placed on a flat surface.(neat)Now the only downside is that as stated by the manufacturer that you cannot see Netflix Disney+ You Tube TV Paramount+ Peacock Prime Video and not even Anywhere Movies which is a shame given that technically speaking I own my movies in that service (not streaming). As a ray of light I can tell you that you are able to see You Tube Pluto TV and any other "free" audiovisual service. No stars to be taken away as the manufacturer clearly states that in the description of the product.Overall a neat projector that has changed the dynamics at home and is a keeper per absolute majority as they LOVE to watch now movie night in the walls.....
5,I LOVE IT.Picture quality: 5/5Sound quality:  4/5 (without extra speakers)Connection:  5/5I use it for my own personal use. It's a little big but not too big. It's super easy to connect to. Works with all types of differen't devices and dosen't have too much latency. Very good for the price. Remote works pretty well. If looking for a projector this is the one to buy for the price quality latency and sound.
5,This seems like a very solid projector. It feels solid the brightness and picture are of good quality and it's reasonably light (so easy to carry around). It is not clear to me what makes this an "outdoor" projector as nothing on the box or in the instructions seems to say that this is water resistant or anything of the sort.I appreciate that it has a keystone correction but be warned that this is only vertical (to correct for an off-perfect pitch angle). It would be really nice to have a horizontal keystone correction (so that the projector can be at a slight angle from the wall and be able to correct so that it the picture looks okay) and the feature that some other high-end projectors have of image shifting adjustment would be nice. The remote is a really nice perk though. I haven't tried screencasting from my phone yet.Be warned that the Wi-Fi password bar shows the password as you type it in so make sure you set up wireless before you broadcast to an audience if you don't want them to see the Wi-Fi password.Overall very solid and well worth it.
5,I bought this projector for home theater in a bedroom after watching a detailed review on YouTube. The projector works great the picture is bright sharp and colorful. I love the remote control it's handy and feels high quality. The projector also looks better than on the pictures - the quality is great for the price. One thing to note - the ratio between the distance to the screen and the size of projected image is slightly less than our previous little Vankyo projector so we had to put it further from the wall to have the same size of the picture - this made the projector sit
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Bought it used to save money missing an HDMI cord… the name of the projector would not show up on my phone. Followed instructions but no luck. Succeed in the mirroring. Sound but no picture to watch the movie ..
5,I bought a different HD projector several year ago to use for outdoor movies.  I was very disappointed with it.  The first problem was I couldn't get the picture small enough for my 100 inch movie screen.  The second problem was it wasn't very bright.  This made movie watching subpar.I love this NexiGo projector.  The movie fits perfectly on on my 100 inch movie screen.  It is plenty bright at 9500 Lux.  I setup the projector on my movie screen in my basement.  I have all the lights on in the room and the picture still looks great.I verified the Miracast android app is able to cast directly to the projector.  I hooked my laptop to the projector I was impressed with the sound.  It sounds as good as the sound on my TV.The only thing I would like to see improved with this projector is make the adjustable leg longer.  I made it as long as it would go but I still had to put a couple DVD cases underneath to raise the image high enough to get all the way on my movie screen.
5,The projector displays a crisp and bright picture. In my usage I preferred a wired connection either with the iphone cable or hdmi to my laptop. Note that when using the screen mirror function there would always be a buffer. That is why wired is the way to go. The remote is responsive to the menu functionality. Overall pretty satisfied with the picture ease of use and number of ports.The built in speaker is decent but an external speaker is a must to enjoy your movie time!
5,I purchased this for our basement entertainment center. Overall I'm very happy with it.Pros:- The picture quality is nice.  I just have it displaying on the white wall and it looks great even with the wall texture and switch plates.- The picture displays well with the lights on.  Overhead lights obviously dulls the picture but it does not become completely washed out like I remember the projectors in school doing.- Built-in speaker is a nice feature I plan to hook up a sound system but the built in speaker makes it instantly usable for watching TV or playing video games.- Bluetooth connectivity is great and unexpected.  I can use my bluetooth headphones to listen to the playback.  I didn't know that feature was included and was pleasantly surprised.- Lots of options for media input and playback.  The projector supports MP4 playback directly off of a thumbdrive has a AV input adaptor included 2 HDMI ports and screen mirroring and casting.- Wifi connection was easy and seamless.Cons:- HDMI connections are too tight.  I struggled to get an HDMI cable plugged in.  I had to use a screwdriver to push up the locking pins on the ports to be able to get the cable to go in.  After I did that the connections worked fine.- cooling fan is a bit noisy.  Its noticeable while using the built-in speaker for sound playback.  I image that it should drown out with an appropriate sound system connected but it will always be noticeable during quite parts of a show.- Focusing when using the keystone feature is not perfect.  If the projector is not displaying straight on the entire view will not be perfectly in focus. I used the keystone feature to square the screen and the bottom corners of the image went out of focus a bit.  This is probably an unavoidable issue with all projectors simply because of the way a lens is focused. So It's not something I'm too worried about.Overall I'm really happy with the projector.  It does a really nice job and comes at a reasonable price. I'm hopeful it will remain functioning for many years. Time will tell.
5,For the price this is a good projector with a lot of useful features. I'm glad they ranked the brightness in ANSI. It seems like a lot of manufactures try to mask their real world brightness by just listing their brightness in lumens. I'd say this projector is very close to the 350ANSI rating. In my pictures I put the chair to show just how large of a picture I projected. It was a good 10 ft corner to corner. the Wi-Fi connection worked well as did the Bluetooth. If I had to pick a weakness I would say the sound of the built in speakers. I was connected to a Microsoft Surface which had better sound than the built in speakers. With this said I wouldn't say they sound any worse than other projector built in speakers. I have a total of 6 projectors from a $2000 short throw down to a $15 LED Halloween special and the sound of this projector is on par with the higher end projectors though again none of them sound great.  As for longevity only time will tell. I plan on bring this projector to use while RV camping so I'll update if I run into any issues over time.
5,love the way it projects onto my room wall very clear even without a projector screen. easy to use and works perfectly with my streaming devices. definitely worth the money!
5,This is a nice upgrade to the Nexigo PJ10 projector.  All the same features but brighter and more vivid colors.  The focus controls being electronic and built-in to the remote control was very handy!  The only downside is there is no mounting screw on the bottom to use on a tripod and this is probably due to the larger size and weight.  As I have more time to use this projector more I will share any additional feedback but so far it has been a great projector!
5,The projector is easy to set up and the picture quality is HD as advertised.  I was worried the picture would be a little blurry but that has not been the case.  The projector is very easy to pickup and move which I have taken advantage of and watched tv in every room of the house.  The speaker in the projector is a little quiet I'd recommend buying some speakers for it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Been using it for a month really good dorm choice. I used the IOS mirroring and the image color is very vivid the sound has no delay even when I was playing games and projected it on wall for my friends to watch.Remote control is smart and the focus is easy to adjust. The fan is a little bit loud but in an acceptable range. Overall it’s a great product.
5,Easy to setup and seems well build. The image is sharp with easy to use remote contract. Use IOS mirroring and it worked well. All the exposed parts are covered by a protective film.Cons:1) The focusing moves the lens out and I can't cover it without adjusting the focus2) Build in audio is not very good but at least there is a Audio out to a better sound system3) You'll need to prep your own AAA batteries for the remote (2x)Overall it's a great value!
5,I've been trying to find a projector for a while now and this one was a great pick. It's very easy to set up and use and has all your standard projector features. It's easy to adjust the picture angle or brightness and the included speakers are actually pretty good.My FAVORITE thing about this speaker is that I don't need to wire it into my computer. It can do wireless connections to my devices which saves me a TON of headache and really opens up my options.Honestly I don't have any complaints with this product. It's exactly what I was hoping it would be
4,In general very happy with the projector. The video quality is really good! The colors are great it works well even with some lights on. The fan noise is minimal. The focus is a little off on the edges you really need to play around with tilt and focusing to get it right but that doesn't have any serious ipmact if you're watching movies. Only if you'll be looking at texts in games on the edges. Still for the price the video quality is probably one of the best you can get.The only real downside is the audio connection. Can't use it with our Bluetooth speaker because because the audio lags a lot. And you can't even fix that by automatically making the sound olay sooner (for example in VLC) because the lag duration keeps changing. The only way around is to use AUX cable or connect audio to the speaker directly from laptop. This doesn't work from PS4 though as it can't connect to direcrly to the Bluethooth speaker. So we had to use AUX. Somehow the audio quality drops a little because of that (quite surprisingly) and using standard settings AUX volume was very low. I sent email to the company for support and they sent an update. It didn't fix the bluetooth issue but at least it fixed AUX volume so now the audio is loud enough. It didn't affect the quality.I recommend this projector a lot if you mostly care about video quality and don't wanna go much higher in your budget. Playing PS4 also works well with it. If you care a lot about sound then you might wanna look into higher priced projectors as I saw other in similar price range as this have the same issue with Bluetooth.
4,Hallo zusammen ich war auf der Suche nach einem neuen Beamer für mein zukünftiges heimkino Projekt. Durch die sehr guten Bewertungen habe ich mit mal den Beamer ein bisschen genauer angeschaut vorsllem da ich schon eine nexigo Webcam besitze.- Bild 9/10Die Bildqualität ist sehr gut für diese Preisklasse gedoch benötigt man einen sehr glatten weißen Hintergrund. In manche Filmen habe ich erst bemerkt wie viel Kontrast der Beamer hat und die Farben sehr detailgetreu wiedergeben kann.- Bedienung 7/10Sehe wenig einstellungsnöglichkeiten aber ausreichend sehr schlicht gehaltenes Menü das jeder bedienen kann.- Lautstärke 8/10Der Beamer ist nicht sonderlich laut aber auch nicht sonderlich leise jedoch verstehe ich teils die Bewertungen nicht das der Beamer ein düsenjet sei.- Preis Leistung 10/10Selten so einen guten Beamer gesehen für diesen Preis deswegen musste ich einfach die Review verfassen.Insgesamt 34 von 40Klare Kaufempfehlung vorallem mit dem momentanigen 50€ Gutschein auf Amazon!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought PJ20 Native 1080P Projector 350ANSI from Amazon. I am going to write my experience based on the usage in last few days. First look and the impression of the projector is amazing. There is a user manual available which is easy to follow and even if you don’t have any tech background this product is easy to setup at first. You can set this up on ceiling mount (no separate mount given) or as a desktop. Build quality is good nothing to complain about. The picture or image quality on the projection is amazing (better than I expected but this is my first projector). Excellent brightness even when you are watching the content with room not completely dark. When room is completely dark it feels amazing superb image clarity brightness and colours. Definitely a 1080p image. The fan in projector makes some annoying noise but when you use it with loud sound system then you don’t feel it. The remote and menu system on screen is easy to follow. I tried connecting the projector using USB Fire Stick Android & Windows MiraCast (Windows Wifi display) - all works well without any issues. For me the main utility of the product is to stream OTT media on projector and it works well with Amazon Fire stick on HDMI port. The only shortcoming is sound. The inbuilt speaker is good and clear but not loud enough and doesn’t give that cinematic experience. I connected my soundbar to the projector using Bluetooth but you feel some time lag where content on the screen vs sound does not sync sometimes (this is not a projector issue as it normally happens with any Bluetooth 5.0 or older connected device). The projector is Bluetooth 5.1 but my soundbar is BT 5.0. I tried connecting soundbar to projector using HDMI (ARC) but projector doesn’t support it. The only I option I have is to connect the soundbar via Aux cable which compromises on the quality of the sound (you don’t get that Dolby digital experience) but still projector connected with soundbar on Aux cable gives loud and crisp sound which I can adjust with. The projector also supports keystone correction to have side projection rectangle I did not experiment much with keystone correction feature does work. Overall I am happy with my purchase. The only thing I miss in the projector is separate HDMI ARC or Optical input for sound. Otherwise it’s a value for money projector easy to setup good build quality superb screen clarity colours and brightness. Picture quality 5 out of 5 and sound quality 4 out of 5. I will definitely recommend the projector based on my experience.
5,The brightness is amazing picture quality is of a much more expensive projector (I would say about £500-£600). It works well in Living room with large window with cheap black out curtains from B&Q.It works with my iPhone and laptop through WiFi. Over HDMI the lag is not noticeable when comparing to my premium TV from 2017 and slightly behind my 144hz gaming monitor but that's to be expected.Watching movies is amazing experience I have it connected to Apple TV 4k with two Homepods Mini and it works great. The only issue i have is that it doesn't turn on with Apple TV I wish that they would implement it. The solution I did is i bought universal remote programmed power and source button with it and use other buttons on universal remote to control the Apple TV. It's a hack but remote from original apple tv 4k is terrible anyway.I had small problem with mine but it was quickly resolved by NexiGo without need to contact Amazon the experience with their support was much better than what I had with other brands including few major ones.
4,super gut ok
5,I bought this projector because my bedroom isn't big enough for me to fit a tv in front of my bed. The features on this projector looked great so I decided to purchase it. I am glad I did because it looks great on my wall and is super high quality! Great purchase my favourite feature is the wifi connectivity meaning I can mirror my phone to it too! The photo may not do it justice as the blurry edges are caused by my phone camera.
3,Pros - premium design remote controlled focus easy setup for wifi and Bluetooth good color saturation decent speakers with low audio latency when connected over BluetoothCons - does not focus well in the four corners only vertical keystone (2d) - cannot project from the side limited color adjustment no carry case no HDMI cable limited characters for wifi password entry
1,Man könnte meinen dass die Lufthansa ihre aktuellen Streikproblematiken lösen möchte indem es ihre Flugzeuge direkt aus meinem Wohnzimmer heraus startet. Dieses Ding ist so laut dass jegliches Genießen von Filmen und Videos eine Qual ist. Preis ist top Bild ist gut Qualität ist zufriedenstellend Fernbedienung in Ordnung aber die Lautstärke ist ein KO Argument weswegen ich ihn leider zurückgeschickt und auf eine teurere und dafür weitaus bessere Alternative zurückgegriffen habe.
4,The most important for me was to have quietness of the fan and I got it. The rest is of good quality viewing.
