4,I really like this camera but the one thing is that the settings don‚Äôt go to 4K/60 if you are thinking about getting this camera for YouTube I suggest to keep looking ! When trying to convert the videos on my MacBook all of the content that I have made SKIPS !!! The audio is okay but I did purchase a mic to go on the camera for better quality!! The camera does not come with a tripod; only the camera 2 batteries batteries charger and charging port and a ‚Äúwide lens‚Äù.
4,This camera impresses me for the cost/quality of pictures.  I wanted a separate camera apart from my phone as I am planning on traveling through some National Parks later.  The only thing I would add is that the Amazon additions of a carrier case and the SD card are that they seem to not be right for this product.  I used the camera case for the additional lens but the SD card needs to be a micro to fit.
4,Still have some lenses to buy but so far the picture quality is amazing. Let's see if it last longer than the more expensive Minolta.
4,The picture quality is very good! It‚Äôs pretty easy to figure out too but if you‚Äôre using it for recording purposes be prepared to buy a mic. Without a microphone attached it sounds muffled and it‚Äôs hard to hear.
4,The Camera Was 87% Worth The Money But Other Than That I Recommend Y‚Äôall Should Buy !
3,If you are new to vlogging this will do but if you have had a camera this is extremely underwhelming
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I will update everyone in a few weeks have any questions concerns or comments please leave me a message. I missed up my word description at the beginning. üòÇGiving this camera 4 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êUpdate to follow.
5,~UPDATE~After taking with the company they are working on making extra batteries available down the line and that works for me and I now understand that it takes time to have the resources to do such a thing.The company also made my experience with this camera most enjoyable as I stated earlier this camera has Many Great Features and I highly recommend it not only for the beginner but also for the experienced photographer. Great Camera for a Great Price!~ old comment~ Why spend over a hundred dollars for a device like this camera and when the batteries go bad like All batteries do with time you have to throw it away because the company doesn't offer replacement batteries.I really like the camera and the features it has But without being able to get replacement batteries for it its useless.I contacted the company and they told me they do not and will not sell replacement batteries.Just received this camera and it looks like I'm sending it back.
3,Not clear at all. I tried to make a YouTube video and it wasn‚Äôt clear. The Mic sounds bad as well.
2,I want to start off by saying that I love that this camera has a flip out screen I love that feature. In the photos provided by myself these would have been better if I took them on my phone. I could get some clear pictures if I messed around with it for a good 30 minutes but even then they are not really that good. This camera also doesn't have a good auto focus/ you can't manually focus on a person or flower. The screen is not touch screen at all and you don't have a lot of options/settings to work with. I know this is not a super high tech one but for how much you are paying for I would not recommend this camera to anyone. If you are trying to vlog this camera doesn't have a good microphone at all I would rather buy a camera that has a microphone that is clear enough to understand what you are saying. This camera does have a port to plug in a different microphone. Why would you want to pay a good $130 for a camera that has bad video/picture quality and then go spend more money on a different microphone for that.Pros - Flip out screen - comes with a lens - Port to have a different microphoneCons - Bad Video/Picture Quality - bad microphone - Horrible auto focus - No Touch screen
3,the features and settings are poorly done
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I love this camera set it come with everything you need! You get the camera hard case lanyard TWO batteries charging dock lens charging block cord and even an SD card! this is a great beginner set. It is very easy to put the lens on and take it off. The battery lasts a good while and you get two! The hard case  have a inner pocket to hold battery and SD card. I love how this camera lets you flip out the viewing screen so you can get the perfect few. Now most importantly the quality... this quality is amazing. the picture come out crystal clear just as the same specs it sames. It is very easy to use the buttons ae in reach of your thumb and are all clearly labeled; very easy to use.
5,Great camera at a great price
5,I had to return the camera because it never worked. The on/off button didn't work. I really wish it did. I loved the color. The weight √†nd balance was perfect for my small hands.I also have arthritis and this camera would have been perfect. I haven't found another one yet . So I'm still shopping for one.
4,This is a great starter camera
5,I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and this camera basically has similar quality if not better! I love it n it‚Äôs great for the price tbh. I spent $300+ on another camera that I barley have used and it‚Äôs Canon and that quality wasn‚Äôt it for me . This camera also is very easy to use . I highly recommend for someone who wants to vlog but doesn‚Äôt have the money or doesn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money on a camera when you just need something simple .
2,I thought this was going to be good but the picture/video quality is bad and the audio is even worse. Don‚Äôt buy.
4,Wished for better quality photos BUT for the price the photos for amazing. So I guess I can't really complain.
4,User manual is very lacking . Only tells you how to use half of the features
5,good camera
5,Awesome camera
2,But it doesn't work unless it's connected to the charger
3,pictures are as good as my old cell phone and my old camera has 40x zoom this thing has a whopping 16!  I don't think it's 4k quality but yet it says it's 4k?  save your money and do better than this
5,very easy to set up and easy to use. love this camera
3,The camera is mediocre.The battery lasted less than two hours of taking pictures. The quality of the pictures is fine but anything that is in motion will blur.We are going to give it some more time but I don't think this is worth the money.
5,I love this camera! I got it to have for personal things (like trips) and it‚Äôs perfect! It‚Äôs small which makes it more travel size; super cute; easy to use (the instructions it comes with are very clear); and just amazing in general!
3,I got it because it was a lightning deal and the quality seemed worth it. But after getting it and playing with it the reality was that my phone took better photos and video unfortunately.
5,It's a little difficult for my 15yr old to operate when looking for a specific setting for certain types of pictures. Basic use is really easy and takes great pictures. She gets a lot of really close ups with it and it does great.
5,Great for beginners to be exposed to photography.
5,I am getting into being a content creator online and needed a nice camera to use as a webcam. I would like to get a $700+ Sony model all the established Youtube channels use but until I can justify that I believe this is a great substitute at much less cost. The pictures and video seem very nice. I'm very happy with this purchase and feel that the company stands behind its product if you have any questions. 5 stars!
