5,At first I thought these looked a bit ridiculously long. But I‚Äôve come to really appreciate the length. My original iPhone chargers have short cords. These long cords make it possible to use the phone while it is charging and to be able to charge it pretty much anywhere.
5,perfectly described
5,This charger is very good for ipone you want to charge through an outlet.  Very pleased with the purchase so far.  Do not know durability yet because I haven't had it long but the price is cheaper than the regular store.
5,it works
5,Love the long cords.
5,Compatible with the iPhone original charger no issues and charges the iPhone just as quickly. I normally don‚Äôt do reviews but let me tell you it‚Äôs worth investing your money with these charges instead of paying for more for one. Quality is 100% the same as the original one. I‚Äôve had mine for a while and no issues.
5,Was something I needed and it got shipped to me quickly.
5,I needed new plug in chargers and cords and these are exactly what I wanted!
5,Great cord
4,I bought these because they claim to be lightening charges but they are regular long time charges.
5,The length of the cord is so versatile that you never care about needing a recharge
5,Nothing
3,These cords have a difficult time staying in my iPhone. Multiple times I‚Äôve woken up to a dead phone since the charger slips out in the night.
5,Like the length
5,The items were exactly as depicted. The cord length gives me the flexibilty to be able to sit at my table and charge my device while being able to use my computer!
5,I liked the fact it was a perfect fit for my I-Phone
5,Love how far it reaches it doesn‚Äôt break easily I‚Äôve done a lot that I thought would break it and it didn‚Äôt
4,It‚Äôs what I need.
5,Best Charger and cord I have used
5,long and strong
2,I thought I was ordering the Fast Charger that is Apple MFi Certified. When searching for Apple iPhone Fast Charger this particular one popped up within a group. Apparently I was not diligently strategic in reviewing the product. Not only is it NOT the charger I was seeking and searching for  (Fast Charger/Rapid Charger and Apple Product) the cord and charger is a precious dated model but worst of all the charger itself gets very hot after being plugged in for a very very short time.I‚Äôll may use the cord with the old charger I wanted to replace but I sure wish I hadn‚Äôt purchased the item at all. I ordered cords just a short time ago and still have 3 left!!!
5,The cords are really long. Great value.  Better than Apple.
5,I like it when is fast and easy
5,Minimal packaging (great for the environment); sturdy; great addition to increasing the number of places my phone and iPad can be charged in my home without having to move the charger to different locations.
5,Perfect length
5,Cord is long enough to charge my phone.
5,El tama√±o
5,I have a charger in every room now.
5,Good price easy to store good quality
5,Great length and value
5,I liked the length of the cord and it charges really faast
5,Ised by a patient in a rehabilitation center.  The extra long cord was a blessing.
5,I have placed one in several locations. We have multiple items to charge each night.
5,They were as advertised
3,I like the length of this charger however it charges my phone very slowly. I guess if you use this as an overnight charger it isn‚Äôt bad but if you‚Äôre looking for a fast charger this isn‚Äôt it
5,To charge iPhone
5,Very very useful
5,Built with excellent durable materials
5,Like the extra length. It is just the size I need.
3,Doesn‚Äôt stay plugged into iPhone
5,Cord length works well. Haven't broke yet. My kids have been using them for awhile.
5,Good product
5,Great value
5,Charges fast & so much easier to use  w/extra cord length
5,I am happy with this charger.  The longer cord is wonderful and the price wa
5,These chargers are as described. They seem to be rugged and durable.
5,Just what I needed so that cord stayed in the socket and out of the way.
3,You have to turn the plug into the iphone back and forth to get it to come on.
5,I like the length of the cord and durability also it charges super fast. Very satisfied.
5,üëç
5,This works great.
2,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a lightning charger- very often get a message that it‚Äôs going to take 5 or 6 hours to charge. It‚Äôs definitely not like the really fast charger that comes with newer iPhones.
5,Nothing
5,10 ft length helping me a lot
5,it‚Äôs charges fast and great length too
5,I use to charge my iPad and my iPhone
2,One broke already only had a few days. Not sure it‚Äôs worth returning.
2,Cord length is great but they are unreliable. Overnight charging often fails.
3,The cord length is awesome but it doesn‚Äôt charge very fast!!!
5,Longer cord reason for buying
3,Slow charger doesn‚Äôt increase just stays the same
5,I love it is quite long
3,Cords are long but charger itself is slooow!
5,Works great
5,No
5,Greatcharger
2,only one of the two cords i got didn‚Äôt work. you would have to move it around and wiggle it to connect enough to charge then it stopped all together
2,The charger is rather flimsy and delicate. It worked okay initially but the tip that inserts into the iPad broke off after a few uses. Luckily I was able to pull the piece out of my device. Not a good value.
1,Save your money. The two chargers stopped working after 1 month. Pieces of crap probably made in China.They should send me replacements if they are a ligit company.
2,Product poor one cord and one cube has failed already and had to be tossed.
2,After a short time it didn't charge the phone anymore
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Just moved into my new apartment. Ordered these for each night stand this is what I saw when I moved my night stand after a few hours. Have to have the fire dept come and check this out now. Been here for 8 hours. SMH
1,Never worked
1,I just bought these two weeks ago. I have only used one set. The wall charger (i.e. cube) overheats in a matter of several minutes. This brings up the question about its safety durability and the possible damage/effect this could have on my iPhones‚Äôs battery life. I will be returning both chargers.
1,Doesn‚Äôt work!
1,After reading all the good reviews I ordered these cords. Well they barely charge and when they do I have to use their adaptor and i am unable to get a full charge on my phone overnight. So I will definitely be returning because these cords are flat out unacceptable.
1,Disappointed in your wall plugins.  They get really hot.  Makes me wonder if they wouldn't start a fire.
1,Junk ..don‚Äôt even charge
1,Doesn‚Äôt work from the beginning.  Both cords in the order with the same result.
1,The first charger worked for one week only. The second charger is currently working.
1,Battery percentage goes down while it‚Äôs plugged in after a month
1,Loved the length of cords but it only worked for one day extremely dissatisfied
1,I ordered the set of 2 but only one came in the package.
5,These charge SO FAST. My iPhone XR went from 3% to 100% in one hour. My daughter‚Äôs iPhone 6S Plus went from 50% to 100% in 15 minutes. Literally telling everyone about these. Will be back to buy more as well. I like having a charger in every room of the house in my car and at work. lol I also love giving them as gifts so at this price (especially since you get two) then I can easily use them as stocking stuffers or add to gift baskets.Also I must add that the company is incredible. I had a few questions and they are very responsive and helpful. It‚Äôs hard to find such kind customer support anymore!
5,These shipped quickly and seem to be of good quality.
5,Needs swivel where phone plugs into charger
5,Wonderful
5,Received this product and was delighted. Practical and reasonably priced.
5,pretty good quality 10 foot charger

5,Charging power and cord length
1,Not a fast charger at all. 20 mins to gain 2% and wasn‚Äôt on phone
5,I wanted a long charger to use while I‚Äôm in bed. And this was perfect. It charges very fast and looks of great quality. Would definitely buy again.
5,Very long reaches devices even when sitting on floor
5,So far so good
1,Only one cord worked
5,The connections are firm and secure and the are a great length for charging and using  charging quickly and feel well-made; sturdy and flexible with a woven cord. I like that there is one to use and other for back up.I highly recommend this charging cord it is absolutely amazing. It doesn't fray at the area where you insert it into your phone and it doesn't get twisted or anything like that.
5,This is an excellent product. Efficient and quick shipping. The order also includes the charging adapters which makes this a much better option if you need iPhone charging cables.
5,Like the longer cord.
5,So excited to get these. I bought them because I needed chargers in the living room and bedroom so I didn‚Äôt have to keep plugging and unplugging them wherever I went. AND they are greatI will be buying them again
5,This charger works great!  I love how long the cord is too and to top it off you get two of these.  Great buy!!!!!
5,No complaints about this great product. The length of the cord is great and the price is perfect. Really a great value
5,The long cord is durable Charges well I have re-ordered this already because I like it so well.
5,Product works well and fulfilled my expectations.
