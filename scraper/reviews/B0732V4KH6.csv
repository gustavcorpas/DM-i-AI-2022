5,I wish I had gotten this camera and plate with the radio I bought! This is perfect! And the picture is so clear and even at night I get a great picture on the radio! This was so easy to plug and play as I took out the other camera and installed this one! The quality is good and all I had to do was put a dab of RainX on the lens to help it be clear in the rainy weather. I would recommend this to anyone!
4,I love the idea of integrating the camera into a sturdy license plate frame.  Having said that I had to make some modifications to install it on my Ford Mustang.  The holes for the license plate mounting screws are deep and hexagonal shaped.  I had to file the heads of my license plate screws to accommodate the holes.  Also there was no notch in the frame to route the camera cable so I had to file a notch.  I'm replacing an existing camera so I did not need the long cable to route through the car.  The camera angle is easily adjustable.  I have a high degree of confidence in the durability of the camera.  Image quality looks good.
5,Replaced my old camera that never really worked well.  This one is high quality.  Hope it lasts.
5,Very easy to install very happy with
5,Awesome
4,I purchased the same one on August 2019 and couple of weeks ago on July 2022 stopped working. The reason I ordered the same one I didn’t want to rewire everything so disconnected only the old one and contact the new camera.
5,The video is clear
4,It works and you can see well but the picture quality isn't great.
4,I really like the pictures quality and backup
5,Installed it on my 4RUNNER very easy.Pic quality is impressive night or day . Like the parking guide lines and the way it fits over vehicle license plate (sleek and slim). Don’t worry about  knocking the camera off or out of adjustment.
5,This camera works as well as I would expect it to for use on my 2011 dodge nitro. Picture is clear.
3,Gave 1 star. Had issue with video signal. Worked on it for a whole day and still couldn’t get it to have a signal not enough wiring to go from front to back to be able to tuck everything underneath. I really need a backup camera and this wasted my time and money
4,No complaints picture is decent parking guidelines are helpful.
5,This is the second one I’ve installed on different trucks. The camera has a nice view and clear picture the night vision is great. The only con I can find is the installation instructions are very poorly written. It took a bit of trial and error but once I figured it out I  happy with the final product.
4,The I stall and quality is superb however not even 3 days later the right LED light next to the camera just stopped working. It is still functional but I wish is still worked.Only reason I gave 4/5 stars
4,Camera quality is really clear in the daytime but just a little grainy at night. It's perfect for my really big 2010 Toyota Tundra double cab and the RCA was long enough to come fome my stereo to under my 2010 Toyota Tundra double cab all the way back to the license plate camera. Night time lights are white seem to give off plenty of light. I noticed in the rain water will get on the lense and I thought the camera was shot on the second day it definitely distorted the picture but upon wiping the rain off the lense camera was fine. Very happy with purchase. I hooks up the black and red wires to my reverse lights and made sure to attach the red wire from the yellow RCA cable to the same power wire going to my reverse lights it serves as the remote cable at the other end of the yellow RCA when it gets to your stereo you connect the yellow RCA to camera in on the back of the stereo and attach that red wire to the reverse wire on back of the stereo so the screen turns on when you put it in reverse.. One thing that made it easier is to run the yellow RCA with red wire attached from your stereo first down to the floor board out through rubber grommet under passenger seat. cover wire with plastic heat shield once under thevehicle to protect from heat and any debris. Pictures show how I put both power wires together for camera power and remotely have the stereo automatically go into reverse
5,I thought I'd try this before going name brand and spending more money but I got to say this camera is better quality than factory bought.Definitely a happy customer!Buy it!
5,Facil de instalar y se ve muy bien ahhh y quisiera trabajar en amazon
4,When I hooked it all up it looks good quality wise but the picture was backwards maybe a fluke on my part. Also the first couple rains there is  water damage and I can barely see out of it now. And the picture is backwards but that also could be because of my lack of knowledge of wiring. Otherwise it’s solid metal design.
4,This camera works great and installing it or rather wiring it is pretty straight-forward.  However I have one huge complaint and that is that in order to get the camera and power connectors into your car’s chassis you’re going to have to drill a rather large hole.  That’s because the end of those wires come with non-removable ends.  One is a ¼ inch power-plug and the other is an RCA video connector.  So instead of just having to drill a small hole to get a 16 or 18 gauge wire into the car’s body you have to drill a much larger opening to get those two plugs through.  I wasn’t willing to compromise on that one so I cut the wires and re-attached them once behind the license plate panel.  I also used a small rubber grommet where I drilled the hole.  That serves two purposes… 1) reduces the amount of water that can get in and 2) prevents the wires from getting damaged by the sharp sheet-metal.Function-wise it great.  The most attractive feature is the ability to change the angle of the camera.  I would suggest you find the angle that works best for you and then decide if you’re going to mount it with the camera on top or on the bottom.  I was able to hook it up to an existing rear-view mirror screen on my wife’s car and since the connections were already there I had no extra wiring to do for the monitor.  However I do want to point something out.  The description on this camera clearly states the resolution as 795*596 which is what you would expect from an RCA cable which is technology designed in the 50s.  However at one point the description says that it has HD night vision so please don’t confuse that with HD resolution which would be much higher.  For the price and its simplicity this is a really good backup-camera option.
5,Loves these cameras!They are super clear and the LED light is so bright! This is my second time purchasing and I'll be purchasing again in the future.
4,I replaced my car stereo with one that had the option for a backup camera. I purchased this one and it works as advertised. Is was an easy install. Fits perfect as a license plate holder and is very unintrusive. No one will ever notice that the license plate holder is also a backup camera. The only thing that I would have preferred are the lines are not quite as nicely laid out and the factory backup camera on my wife's new vehicle. Not sure if this is the fault of the camera or the car stereo. In any case I have no complaints and would feel ok recommending it to anyone.
4,The backup lights are so bright you can see clearly if there is a chrome hitch in your vehicle or are backing up the a white object
4,It hooks up pretty easily and works as intended so far haven't had really any issues with it. My only complaint keeping it from 5 stars is the video is pretty grainy at times and sometimes when you put the car in reverse too quickly the camera freezes my head unit and I gotta restart it. But other than that it's perfectly fine. That problem I hardly ever have.
3,El tiempo que no duró la cámara no me gustó
5,I had different camera during my history of vehicles. This was my first license plate cover camera and I must say .. it was impressive. The first camera I installed was crap and burned out. The picture quality on my monitor was fuzzy so I took a chance on this one. And it was actually clear... im truly impressed by this.
4,I was looking to upgrade the stereo in a 2007 Kia Sportage so I purchased a touchscreen aftermarket stereo and installed it.  While I was at it I also purchased this back-up camera to add to the system.  The camera fits over the rear license plate which centers it in the back of the car.  The camera itself pivots up and down so that you can align the view to your preference.  Plug and play design.  I did have to drill a hole in the tailgate for the camera wire but I positioned the hole behind the license plate so it is not noticeable.  The only draw back was that the included camera wire was about 2 feet too short for my vehicle (you have to run the wire from the camera all the way to the front and plug it into the back of your stereo).  I was able to order a longer cord from Amazon for about $8.  Overall a great way to upgrade your car's safety system with minimal $ and effort.
5,I had previously wired in a backup camera that ended up being defective.  As this used the same connectors installation was very easy as I had already run the wiring so it only come on when in reverse.  The thin black frame looks good & does not block any parts of my plate that would be an issue with law enforcement.This provides a good wide field of view.  You can adjust the camera angle up & down & then set it in place (my previous one would move on it's own).  I have this angled so it just barely shows my bumper on an 04 GMC Yukon (I have an aftermarket stereo that this is connected to the Video IN port). I can also see my hitch when in place so I could use this as a guide for that.The LED's work ok at night by providing visible light not IR as some do.  Not as much light as the reverse lights but good enough for what is right behind you.  The built in green/yellow/red guides work well when backing.  As this is not integrated as an OEM one would be the guides won't turn with your steering wheel.
3,Easy to set up but horrible picture quality.
5,It was easy to install and works great
4,Love these units however they do have 2 downsides1.  There must be only one company in the world making the wiring harnesses for this item however there too short I got lucky this time but the other I've been stalled this on 3 different vehicles and I almost always have to splice new wires into it in with the RCA Jack I have to buy a female the female adapter to hook 2 of them together2.  They always leak water into the lens and you end up looking through a fog doesn't matter if you had silicone to the back so he do get this by a second one it will fog up at some point in the next year I always keep a extra of these at home have to on my drag 1 front 1 bag 1 of my Mustang in one of my wife escape I love under the best type seen this nice heavy frame I think you'll enjoy it
4,Overall the picture and ease of installation is very good. I starting to notice the exterior is starting to fade.
5,The frame is metal and quality. If you don’t want it running 24/7 I’d suggest spicing the red wire (with black to ground) to the reverse light wire. Keep in mind this is 12v. I ran the video cable underneath everything and under my middle console and hooked it into the head unit. Make sure to also connect the red wire attached to the reverse wire on the back of the unit so it automatically turns on when you put your car in reverse (a lot of times Purple and grey wire). Now at the camera end you can attach the red wire into the other red wire that you hooked up to your reverse light.
5,Now I can hook up my trailer without any help
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The product works with my 2006 Toyota 4runner.Installed on my Kenwood DDX770.I had to just replace the old camera that my rear window and cut. Luckily it cut the Video and power cable side of the camera. I would have been more annoyed having to re-run a new cable in the panels and trunk rubber hose.Product works and looks as my old $25 camera I bought years ago.Shipping was extremely fast!
5,Great quality for the price!
4,Construction feels very solid! Picture quality is definitely not the best pretty blurry (black "blob" in 3rd pic is a chicken). I have checked all my connections and they are nice and tight so I know that's not the the reason for picture quality. I did add a little bling to the frame and am overall fairly happy with this backup camera.
3,The picture quality is excellent.  The Distance Scale Lines appear to show my car width well but they do NOT show distance at all for my car.  I have a bike rack on the back and the Distance Scale line's furthest out indication is just to my bike rack and tilted way upwards.  Actually less distance than that.  If I lower the camera at all the view is mostly the road not objects behind me.  The Distance Scale lines are the main reason that I bought this Backup camera.
5,Replaced a camera that was of a low quality .(came with a backup camera kit) Replaced it with this license plate frame and I was very impressed. Picture is brighter clearer and has a lot more resolution.
3,Comes with enough wire but you will need about 4ft more for the trigger wire to reach the tail lights the picture personally for me I don't care for. It's not clear enough on bright days in darker areas it seems to be fine the install is extremely easy the frame it's self is really nice! Heavy and feels well built but does not come with hardware to mount it over all its fine but  Would just want better camera resolution
4,Camera fogs up in humid and cold conditions.
5,Works well the integrated LED lights give plenty of light at night for the camera to provide a good video.
2,Camera works great.. quality is very good.. only issue was I had to cut out a notch in the center of the license plate to fit the camera in place. The design on the license plate frame needs to modified so the camera can mounted on top of the license plate.
5,Very nice and easy to install.
5,Easy to install ..... Love the fact you can angle to your liking (have a 4" lift) and the fact that this is solid metal piece ..... No complaints 😉
5,So far so good...
4,old camera broke after 9 month. This camera works for a year now so it is better in this respect. The picture quality is not the same but it is back-up camera and I do not need to see wrinkles on your face with it.YES i would buy it again.
4,The camera picture is extremely clear the night vision lights work very well too the only thing I wish it did is the parking lines don’t move so you just have to turn to get them lined up straight but that is a small thing overall I would recommend this product and give it 4 out of 5 stars
4,Cons: Flimsy and easily breakable wire not so strong to fish through the vehicle was lucky enough to splice again. Make sure to get a wire extension if using for a truck.Pros: License plate itself is very hefty strong and durable. LEDS are bright enough to light up a good area.
4,So it's not the best camera. But then again you're paying a fraction of what a decent camera costs. The license plate portion is nice and well made. You can tell it is not cheap of flimsy. I have put this in 2 cars now and never had a problem. I can back up my truck to my trailer without the help of anyone and I'm usually spot on. So it is well worth the price.Installation is the same as every other back-up camera that uses wires. This one has a nice cable that contains the power wire so you only really have to run the yellow cable (camera input) that's about it.
5,Product stop working within 1 yearsecond time
5,The back up camera came in the mail quickly and was all the components were packaged precisely so that nothing would be broken on arrival. The camera itself is very clear. I tried it out before installing it as the direction recommend trying it out using a regular monitor. The LED lights are very bright and illuminate well. Installing it myself was a challenge but with no reflection of the product itself. You must be sure that you are running a Double Din that has the capability to use the same RCA wires or it won't work. I like that it directly installs into your stereo rather than having a separate monitor cluttering up your vehicle with gadgets. I am still getting used to using it. So far really only used during the day and early evening. So far it has kept me from running over several toys my kiddos have left on the driveway as well as allowing a quicker reaction time backing out of a parking spot when someone was backing out at the same time.  As summer comes to a close and it begins to get dark early I will add to this post. Overall I am really happy with this purchase.
4,Camera works as expected with surprisingly good quality. The adjustable head is nice because I can point it down at my tow hitch and then back up for normal driving. Only sad party was that the cable wasn't long enough for my full size SUV. Would recommend either buying an extension or a longer video cable.
5,Works perfectly fine no issues what so ever with installation or camera feedback
3,It’s been over 12 months since I’ve purchased it. Camera quality is very good.The only thing it has led back up lights that have started to flash on and off. The led light seem to be going out. But the video is very clear.
5,Added a clean look to adding a cameraNo need to screw in a camera anywhere on your bumper since this one is built around a thin frame! Looks clean and works great
5,Works great. Set it up to turn the lights on when the reverse lights are triggered. I do wish it was a wider angle. This is on a extended cab f150 and it’s quite a narrow view compared to my Chevy Sonics backup camera. Also I’d like to mention that the yellow cable that it comes with was long enough to reach from my back bumper all the way to the back of my radio. I found that very surprising. My only concern is how long it will last. The way the cables come out of it causes them to be pinched. I plan to remove the frames and did small holes where the cable will sit in the bumper to avoid this.
5,Para mi trica ford f150
5,I purchased a new double din stereo for my daughter's car.  When I bought the stereo I bought a more expensive backup camera too.  The Camera worked fine at first but after everything was installed and I put everything back together the camera stopped working.  I spend 2 hours troubleshooting and was at a loss as to how/why it stopped working.  Finally I figured I'd try a different camera that had a the same power and video feed setup.Once this camera arrived I plugged it into the cords I had already ran and it was up and working fine!  I'm guessing the other camera just stopped functioning.
4,Blocks license lights partially.
5,I would highly recommend this camera as a replacement for a factory camera that is damaged or for installing a camera in an older vehicle.  This camera has worked extremely well for my '99 F350 Power stroke.  I had to install a double din with input for the reverse camera run the video wire along the frame and hook the power line into the reverse light power so install is heavily dependant on your skill level (especially if you never had a reverse camera before) but the camera itself is extremely easy to install has great night time illumination and a great picture.  Never have to worry about not seeing something run behind me when backing up and makes coupling horse trailers extremely easy.  Just a great camera at a good price point.
4,Love the quality and ease of install
3,I bought this and when I installed it the lights worked when I would put it in reverse but the camera would never come up. I rechecked everything the wire is connected to the video out on my headunit just like the instructions show and but I still don't get any video showing idk maybe I'm missing something but I guess the lights are bright and work.
5,If you are looking for a cheaper working back up camera this works well. Have had it for like a month and I am loving it. Looks grainy at night but everything is still visible. I like the way you can adjust viewing angle.
4,Works good just hav to adjust from time to time will not titan in place.
5,Works great overall night viewing is not as good as some new OEM systems but plenty good enough.  Clear picture.  Beefy looking might look best on trucks.  On my lifted Tahoe the guide lines are closer in than the wheels of the truck so lines can't be fully trusted but I can still use them once that is accounted for.  Otherwise no complaints.
5,I love it
5,Works well. Good picture quality.
5,I did not install it yet but it seems to be a great back up camera
4,Would have given 5 Stars but the include installation instructions wasn’t very clear on how t connect the Pigtails at each end of the RCA video cable. Also the Red and Black 12v power wire was way to Short I just order a spool of 100ft and finish the connection.Besides the above issues the Installation was easy. The Camera’s image is very clear not HD but very clear for both daytime and night time parking. I recommend you still use your side mirrors when backup on any camera but for Reverse verification that everything is all clear before you put your vehicle in reverse this camera is more than efficient. I just purchased a 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited w/ Reverse Camera and the this camera image and resolution is just slight under.Long store short you will not be disappointed with this purchase I recommend this product. Create better Installation instructions and make the wires longer after those updates this product can be a top rate item.
4,It’s a nice set up it. The license plate did not fit where my plate is so I had to cut it off. The camera quality is pretty good the night vision is ok. I don’t like that there are LED lights that come on when you go into reverse. So I replaced my old camera with this and I had it wired to be alway on so I can watch check my trailer from time to time. Can’t do this with this camera because the super bright LED light stay on too. Anyways for a awesome low budget reverse camera it’s perfect.
4,I replaced a different camera with this one. It has better picture quality and has a wider angle. For my install I needed a camera that i could adjust up and down and flip orientation.  The release for the hatch of my car is directly above the license plate so I needed to be able to install this camera on the bottom of the plate. If I wasn't able to take the camera off the mount and flip it rightside up the image would be upside down. This worked perfect. I was able to flip it and adjust it to see the bumper in the view which is what I wanted.
4,Pretty good for the price. A HUGE upgrade from my old add on camera I bought from Amazon a few years ago. Not the best video quality but definitely good enough for backing up. I tried it at night at can actually see (unlike my old one). It does a pretty good job lighting up behind you enough anyway.
2,The light in the back is extremely bright….blinding the driver behind you and your can’t turn it off. You could potentially get pulled over for the bright white light shining. I shaded the lights red with some paint. I wouldn’t buy this.
3,I do like this  it really helps to see if someone walks right behind you or cars etc BUT unable to adjust to the correct closeness.
4,Camera works well but there is no instruction as to what o do with red wire. A simple google search helped but slowed the process.
5,I installed this with a new head unit. The RCA video cable was about 3' short for the run I needed to have for a Subaru Forester. The red wire needs to be connected to the head units pink wire labeled as rear camera + which is a signal wire to enable the touch screen to show the rear camera image. Overall the images are clear. Daytime images are very clear and night time images are soft in focus. I used round #14 stainless steel security screws to secure the camera to the hatch. I painted the security screws with black spray paint prior to using them.
5,Excelente producto se lo recomiendo buena visiónY de calidad
5,Great product!! I was looking for a frame mounted back-up cam that the camera was on the bottom. This one is only pictured on top but it is very easy to flip it around. It’s not just as easy as to turn it upside down for all you who think I’m an idiot. If you flip it upside down then your picture on the monitor will also be upside down. However it is as simple as removing 4 small screws and flipping the camera upside down in the frame and viola it works flawlessly.
5,I love this camera.  it is very stealthy. Great Quality picture and very clear.
5,Quality built frame.  Camera could be a little better.  A great purchase for the price.
4,Not bad not great either. I had to notch the frame so as not to pinch the wire when you bolt it down. The videos cable is 20 feet long which is about 3 - 5 feet short for my application (GMC Sierra crew cab long bed). The frame is set up for metric fasteners (10mm hexagons in the casting) but doesn’t provide the hardware.
5,When I got a new radio I didn't want one that came with a backup camera as those were usually the cheapest add-ons. So I found this setup for a reasonable price (under $50) and installed it yesterday. It's got a fairly good camera great wide-view and reasonable vertical field of vision. Haven't tried night vision yet but I am impressed so far. Very sturdy cast-metal license plate camera.The fish-eye effect of the camera will take a little getting used to. (The secomd photo on this review my hitch is touching the wall.)
5,Buena visión nocturna calidad de imagen y calidad de camara
5,I really liked this problem the only problem is that the instructions aren’t really that helpful. But overall you get what you pay for.
2,Had the camera for just over 7 months. Switched from a lower quality back up camera. All was good until the cold came. Had a cold week (-5 to -20degrees) and camera stopped working. Had this happen before so I was going to wait out a little. A week after the cold was done the camera had glitchy photo and just started working again. However the image is now flipped up. Instead of showing the ground at the ground it’s picture is flipped upside down. Did not mess with wiring at all or anything. Camera picture just flipped.
1,I liked the fact that these were mounted in a frame so I ordered 2 one for a car and one for a truck. I went to install the one for the truck. Had one already that was old and picture lousy from age. It flashed no signal and went blank. I ran new wire and checked power supply before swapping out the unit with the second one and that one worked fine.We’ll see how long it lasts.
5,Great little camera and the led reverse lights are pretty cool. Only thing is the camera only adjust up and down it doesn’t not adjust left to right but once you learn your vehicles boundaries you get use to it. It has survived some pretty strong weather conditions also. Would definitely recommend
5,License plate was easy to install.  Camera looks good during day and night time.  Has good view.  Installed to Sony Airplay stereo.  Took a couple times to figure out which wire to hook to reverse lights.  It automatically comes on the screen when the car is put in reverse now!!! Looks great
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             😄After I got a camera for my car my brother loved the safety side of having a camera so I got this one for his mini van.💪🏻This is really heavy it does not feel cheap! I was afraid it will cover some important parts of the license plate but it does not it fits like a  tailored suit!💪🏻📺You will need an stereo that has the screen this is the camera wit the plate holder only.💡💡💡💡I has 4 LED on each side of the cam which gives you images even at night💡💡💡💡It is obviously water proof and shock proof 🌩❄🌨 I just read that they have 24 hours help that is cool however you will not need it this is very easy to install as you can see on my video
5,I love everything about this back up cam.
5,I purchased a 2008 Ford F350 that did not have a back up camera.  I had a new head unit installed and while doing that also had this nice back up camera placed and wired in to the head unit.  It is perfect and has helped me a lot.
3,Descent image. The lines dont line up with my one ton truck. But it’s good for gauging how far back i need to go. Still have to use the mirrors which i do anyway. But i seek to park pretty crooked if i use the camera to line myself up. Think it’s slightly off center. The bracket was almost too tall for the bumper cut out on my F350. But i made it work so that could be part of the crookedness.  Better than nothing.
5,Great
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Worth the money you paid for. Not bad for the price just took more than 3 hours to install lol.Cons:-instruction manual is basic. Had to watch different videos on a 2012 camry installation guides.-having problem that when i turn the Reverse gear after Toyota logo is gone from the radio the backup camera wouldn't work. So after turning the engine on i have 5 seconds to change gear to Reverse so that the camera would work.-READ CAREFULLY you need to get extra harness connector with the yellow plug for a 2012 Camry radio lcd screen.-I read that it's illegal to cover the state name on the plate so i had to drill extra holes to mount it correctly...
5,For the price this is a great product! It was my first time installing anything like this and it took me about 2 hours total. For someone experienced probably in less than an hour. The picture quality is great and it came with everything I needed. The only thing I can say is I wish the power cord had a longer wire to connect. Other than that I have no complaints at all.
4,it is ok for what it is ...... but  at night it is not really clear  it is a beautiful picture in the day time
4,Install directions that came with the unit were a bit vague but I figured it out and it's working great.
4,It’s a really nice camera. I was surprised that it was such a strong metal frame. Installation instructions suck though. If you’ve never worked on cars before it may be difficult. Viewing angle isn’t the best either but is enough to get the job done. All around pretty great camera.
5,Exente
4,Really good quality and easy to install. Only complaint is it’s a little glitchy sometimes and has a small delay on load up
3,Wires were way too short for Sequoia had to buy extensions so more money spent. Picture quality is okay. Frame is solid for license plate.
2,Built with poor quality wiring. If your license plate is stationary you might be ok. They are too weak to get bent moved stressed in a hatchback setup. 2 years 3 problems.
5,I added an adaptor to 4pin (make sure you get the right one it's directional inputs or outputs) to use with my existing 2 channel wired ZeroXClub system. I have it on full time because I can't see through my Utility body of my work van.. The picture is beautiful and weirdly peaceful seeing the world through it is like watching National Geographic Channel in HD
4,hello i would have given this a full star due to its difficulties that i have have faced during DIY installation  it was pretty-much time taking the given directions was not very helpful!  I did give it a four star only because the night-vision. I only purchased this for it's night vision. Which has worked perfectly well during my driving parking and reverse functions.I would highly recommend you to get this installed professionally and use a third party monitor since it might interfere with OEM car dvd/navigation system like i had
5,I bought this backup camera for my newly licensed son.  Installed in a 2006 Mustang with an aftermarket Pioneer stereo.  Only two wire connections needed (including grounding wire) both made in the trunk.  And both easily accessible.  Super painless install.  And son loves the camera.  Now if I can just get him to stop driving backwards!Update 11/24/2021Camera still working as it should.  Very happy with it.
5,Lil expensive over all
3,Replaced another camera that kept getting bumped and moved.  I like that it's part of the license plate frame and can be locked in place once adjusted.  Picture looks good.Took a bit but finally figured out it must have a light sensor that tells it when to use the LEDs.  After installing two of them (figured the first one had an issue) the LEDs aren't bright at all.  They glow just enough so you can tell they are on.  If my SUV didn't have such bright backup lights doubt you'd see anything at night.
3,First off I want to say that I don’t regret buying this camera. It has solid construction and looks more discrete compared to other cameras. BUT for some reason mine does not turn on 100% of the time at night. I don’t know if the sensor is not picking up any light and that’s the reason it doesn’t want to turn on but it works in almost every other situation. So I don’t know if mine has a problem. I will probably contact customer support and see what they say. If there is something wrong with mine and they are able to replace it and it works I would for sure gives this 5 stars.
4,Number 2 for me.  Bought my first assembly about 4 years ago. The camera shorted out. The weather in the midwest is not forgiven to items as such. This new assembly seems to be a little better modified but the same frame. Generic instructions that could use improving. Clear and crisp view.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Issue with camera. It is not my stereo it works fine and great quality and good detail.
5,Not the best quality but for what you pay it's a good value. Works fine at night too. My biggest gripe is that this is by no means a wide angle lens. It could be wider to match that of OEM backup cameras which could make it even safer. Reliable still if you don't depend heavily on that wide angle view
5,I have used a few of these cameras over the years and they are great. Good video quality and very affordable. I was even rear ended by a truck and my jeep was totaled but the camera worked for another year after that on my next car. Great product in my book.
5,This works very well. I would be all 5 stars if it did not flicker from time to time. It is ok to install but someone needs to be ok with running wires under the car to the front and running them into the stereo.  They give you more than enough wire to get this job done.
5,Better than the original
1,Does not function. Double checked the wiring and the monitor and both work fine. The old camera works and receives power the lens is damaged thus the need for a new one.
4,Received the license plate in good condition. Installation was simple since I was replacing my old camera and the wires and connectors were in place. Also because I was replacing my old camera i had the usual star shaped screws already. It would have been helpful if screws came with the plate as the shape of the holes probably would not fit the screws you would be using with a regular plate. After the camera was connected and adjustment made to where I wanted the camera to face it has been working just fine. Image and viewing angle are great as well
4,Love this back up camera fabulous night vision and clear camera.  The wire from the back of the deck to the license plate camera was about 3 feet too short so I had to go buy a cord and make it work I wish the cord was longer. otherwise this would have been 5 stars .
5,The product is made of steel and looks very elegant.  Nice display and very clear.
5,Mounted and worked well.  My hatchback has the release handle right above the license plate which interferes with this camera if mounted as received.  However you can remove the camera flip it upside down and then mount the frame upside down so that the camera is at the bottom and it eliminates the interference and works well.  I wouldn't say the picture is high definition but it works fine for a backup camera.  Works surprisingly well at night.  I like the fact that the video cable comes with an extra wire which allows you to make one connection at the rear backup light to turn on the camera and trigger your car stereo.  I used one of these several years ago and it didn't have that feature.
2,La visión es muy estrecha  es difícil la reversa cuando las medidas no son similares a la visión
4,This camera works great.  After installation I noticed that the guidelines are crooked or offset and not straight.  I believe that this is from the angle of the plate on my 2004 Dodge Ram.  I wish I can just delete these guidelines as my Pioneer 8200 has guidelines built in.  With every technology there might be a littler imperfection.  These were just $34.00 each.  Yes I did also put a camera on the front of my truck.  Why?  Because the stereo allowed dual cameras.  I recommend this camera.
4,These work well for a few years but eventually degrade to the point where you can't see anything and need to replace them. I'm on my second one.
2,No instruction for installation
1,Installed this on my 07 Escalade ext last fall(21).  By June (22) it was dead.  Ground is good power is good Video cable is good. It is just dead....
5,This camera is much heavier and sturdier than I thought it would be. The lights are plenty bright enough to see behind your vehicle. The image quality is great especially for the price. I don't know about durability but it feels quality. If I needed another I would by this one again.
2,Wire that runs from the stereo to the back where the camara is located is to short i need to add more wire for it to reach. Maybe for smallers cars will work.I installed in a santa fe 2007
5,This product is top class easy install even for a 66year old man very good quality and fantastic price again awesome
5,This product works exactly as described in product description. Fits all standard license plates and provides a very clear and defined picture when vehicle is in reverse. Camera is adjustable so it can be lowered or raised based on vehicle license plate mounting height.
5,Installed this on my 2001 suburban. I did the install myself. I was surprised that the video cable was long enough to run from behind the dash under the carpet and to the back bumper! No need for cable extension.  My only complaint is the video quality is a little grainy. Not sure if that’s the camera or the monitor to be fair. Still id buy it again if needed.
3,The camera did not work I need to return it for a new one or get a refund
4,It works and looks good. Just wish they sent a better cable with these things. This is my second camera of different brand. The first one I had was a bundled offer with a JVC stereo. Stereo was great camera was junk and didn't work. So I ordered this as a replacement. This one came with the same junk cable though. Very thin and flimsy. It picks up electrical noise causing some static in the picture. I would recommend looking for a tougher and better shielded cable.
5,Perfect fit on my Jeep Patriot and connection to my Pioneer DVD unit. Much easier hooking up to my boat and enclosed trailer!!! Nice metal frame and bright leds. Definitely recommend!!Easy installation mount camera ground and hook trigger to reverse light positive.
5,The product worked as advertised. The frame was of a heavy quality feeling metal.  The picture is very clear on my new Pumpkin Radio.  FYI the infrared lights are actually RED when the unit is turned on.  They look white when the unit is off and I therefore thought they were LEDs and would light up bright white announcing the existing of the camera at night.  I was pleased to see the red light is not very noticeable at night (as compared to a white LED).  I would recommend the product.  It is great being able to see whats behind my new (new to me 1997 Land Cruiser) truck when I am in reverse.
4,Camera still working and haven't had any issues except the led lights stopped working I can still see the image at night with my LED backup lights thought.
5,Got it on time
5,This works well. I didn't know what to expect but it impressed me with the picture quality. Except when it rains of course. I ould recommend it. I may just buy one for my son who knows?
1,Had product for a week and RCA cable end broke.It took many hours troubleshooting wire connections and found one end of the RCA cable broke on the radio end.Spliced new end to make it work but extremely dissapointed in the quality of the wires.
4,Camera looks brighter than it looks. Very sharp quality.
2,Initially a great product…Bought June/2021 and had a nice finish nice color picture etc. Failed in Feb/2022. Moisture is behind the lens causing the picture to be useless and the black finish is starting to fade.
5,To my surprise The quality of this camera is amazing I must admit it exceeded my expectation. Don’t let the price fool you it is a great deal and the camera is just as great!
5,Does its job sadly picture quality is horrible easy to install.Update besides not the best quality I like it . Recommend it just needs to improvement on pictures quality
1,After about a month camera quit working properly. Terrible picture quality for the money. Spoke to costumer service a couple of times filled out the return documents. Never heard from anyone. And it just so happened that my return date just expired. Not happy at all with this product or costumer service.
5,I bought this a while ago and I finally had time to install it and when i went to install it it didn’t work at all it looks really nice and good quality material but i wish it would’ve worked
5,Easy install.  Clear picture even at night.  Works great.  Used extra wire in video cable to run go from backup lights to the stereo so that stereo automatically switches to backup input when car in reverse.
5,This was a replacement which was sent to me under warranty.  The seller handled it very quickly and I got it in a few days.  Just installed it yesterday and so far so good.
5,Excelente imagen
5,Added this camera as my receiver had the option. Of the 3 vehicles I use regularly this has a superior image quality. Hope it lasts as long as my satisfaction with the picture quality.
5,Gave my car a nice new look
5,Glad I found out about this product. Backup cameras are so affordable nowadays. I bought two different models to compare. Stuck with this one. It’s a well constructed product made out of premium materials. Installation was easy and I don’t have any problems using it at night. Huge upgrade to my 2012 Nissan Frontier.
4,Once you figure out how to install it is well worth the cost. Not expensive but install can be a bit tricky.
5,I liked the metal frame and the sturdiness of the camera installation was fairly straight forward. The instructions were not as clear as they could have bee however.
5,I bought this cut up the frame and modified it to fit an also-modified bracket on the back of my vintage Airstream. I tried other cameras but the quality was nowhere near this one. Have been very happy with it.
2,Didn’t work on our BMW X3
5,The picture is fantastic  for the price I paid for it there's other products that cost more that isn't as good as this product
5,Picture quality is great I love the extra lights for backing. It has a lot of adjustment for up and down so it can be dialed in specifically depending on the vehicle and drivers desired viewing angle.
3,The night vision works great and also the picture is amazing. The only Install  process not so much but every vehicle is different. I have an Expedition so my install has to go up the lift gate thru the wire insulator at the top of the door and then down to the reverse light but all in all it’s a good product
5,The first one I got didnt work but the 2nd one was good. Great quality and picture plus the white lights that come on when you go in reverse is a nice touch
1,Worked after I ran a separate signal wireCurrent wire was broke or something
5,It has worked perfectly over the last 6 months in all weather. Picture is crystal clear.  I am delighted and its all metal too
5,I called the local Audio shop n they wanted 150$ . I went on amazon and found this backup camera for 28$!!! Thank you AMAZON!Plugged right in an works better than the one I had👍😎😀😀😀
3,Looks great especially when the lights come on but it don’t always work some glitch issues plus the video quality is not good.
4,Good product. Install not so straight forward
5,Works great day or night.  Night vision works well.  The frame doesn't block or hinder the state license tag stickers in the left or right upper corners.
3,I guess I didn't read far enough into this before buying it as a gift. it does not come with a monitor. I returned this and ordered a different brand that came with the monitor as well.
4,Its a good fit and looks very nice as a frame for the license plate on the rear of the car while also discretely features the camera however the camera lens is non adjustable and cannot aim it any further up or down. its stationary but works great as visual aid for seeing behind your vehical while in reverse
5,White lights on drivers side are burned out already...Now a month ago the other side went out.Now just last night the camera stop working.
5,This is a great camera for the price! The picture is very clear! It arrived on time and was packaged with care!
2,I wired correctly but no picture
3,Works 60% of the time on my Ram 1500. It’s blurry and it has flickering lines across it . Sometimes it doesn’t even give me any picture . Too expensive for the quality .
5,Easy setup and the pictures quality is fantastic in fact it’s better than most stock cameras I’ve seen.
5,I bough this item for my brother he is so happy about it easy install and picture  is very clear and the flame is good guilty specially at night time it very helpful. he ask me where to get it I give him the site he is going to order two of them to give to his friend for x'mas present.
4,I like the clarity of the picture
1,A black dialog box reminding me to check my surroundings pops up when I put the car in reverse and does not go away so I can't see the top half of the display. Haven't figured out how to turn off the dialog box. Makes the camera totally useless.
5,El producto  es muy bueno
4,Almost perfect for my use. No option that I'm aware of to turn off the guide lines. Night vision is somewhat grainy. Nice metal finish.
5,Love how easy it was to install
5,Easy to install and set up. Love that the frame is metal and the camera is adjustable.
5,Fits perfectly( 2001 lexus ES300)..camera quality is great!!.. definitely buy if looking for a rear view camera!
5,Study design and frame.  Easy to install.  Great picture and wide viewing areas
5,If you have experience this is an easy install. Looks great too.
3,I installed this unit on a 2005 car that did not have a backup camera and tied it to a new Pioneer radio. I had difficulty getting the camera to work initially. I could see that the camera was getting power (Infrared LEDs shine dimly) but no picture was getting to the display. By troubleshooting I determined that both the camera and the display were fine but the provided cable RCA connector was providing only intermittent contact. Once I replaced the cable with a decent cable (available at Autozone) the unit worked well.
5,Easy set up and install good quality camera and LEDs make it even better good product
3,Wire to the radio was extremely short!
1,First in order to install this you will need to drill a hole through your license plate.  The cord comes out of the back of the camera and directly into the license plate.  You might be able to bend the cord around the license plate pinching the wires but that's sketchy and there are actually no instructions concerning this.Second the one I received was junk.  I checked which of the backup wires was positive by using a multimeter to ground and then spend all the time it takes to remove trim glove box stereo and install the run.  My stereo does not have or need a separate wire to use the video however the unit itself didn't even light up.  It literally did nothing.  The camera was powered but I got absolutely nothing no LED lights no nothing.  I checked the connections to make sure the unit was powered but it was just a dead unit.Hope you do better.
5,The item is same as described in the advertise. Arrived before the delivery date.
5,I needed this so bad  .  Makes it a lot easier to  back up.
5,Heavy duty camera product works as described!  Will recommend!
5,Shows a clear picture and easy to wire in
5,I had taken my truck to a reputable business to have 2 cameras installed with one monitor.  I got the two cameras but the installation was awful.  Took it back and my hubby ordered me something else that the second camera would not work for the bumper installation.  I ordered this and had it installed.  Works better than the company installed one by far!!!!
3,Camera works great after I replaced the RCA cable with a better one.  The one it came with had issues and a weak connection and created interference.
5,Exactly what I needed.
2,Hooked up by professional just because we are lazy! It does not have to be hooked up by a proit is pretty self explanatory .  Didn't last long. Started lagging in between reverse being engaged and it actually turning on. Then glitched out on the screen. Now it doesn't work at all. Was awesome when it actually did work.
5,I had a local stereo shop install and I am not disappointed. It has a very clear picture and fit my 2013 Mazda 3.
5,Works Great! I really can’t say how easy it was to install as I had it installed with a new radio by others.
5,I have installed dozens and this is the best looking and operating of them all. The night vision is fantastic.
5,Works great so far on my 2013 Dodge ram regular cab. The only issue I have is that I purchased thinking that it was black since all the pictures showed black.. Received a chrome one instead.. Works fine.. Just not what I thought I was orderingThe seller contacted me and was eager to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. Exceptional customer service and very much appreciated in today's world
3,Put this backup camera on my work truck the only thing I didnt like is the lines on the camera dont line up with the tires on your car so you cant use it properly for parking in reverse.
5,Esta bien pero solo anuncian la cámara pero no el monitor
5,Great backup Camara for the priceBut I have to wait for a second unit first oneDidn't work it have something loos2 days later got the replacement great CamaraEasy install works great
4,Great cam the only reason for only four stars is because I had to trim the bottom of the plate holder about 1/8 inch to get it to fit in the recessed license area on my Trailblazer. The bottom would not allow the holes to line up.
3,Good clear image on the camera night vision worked one night and will not come back on. The frame is well made I installed mine on a 2016 jeep wrangler unlimited Rubicon I relocated license plate to center of the back door and used this instead of the factory camera that was installed on factory spare tire carrier.
5,I was very surprised with the weight of the package it was heavier than I had anticipated. which is a good thing. I only just received it nut so far it seems to be a promising product. the camera is water proof. It came with all the necessary plugs and cables to hook up.I am pretty pleased with it. Only time will tell how it holds up.
5,Great product and simple to instal camera a little zoomed in but easy to getting used to. Would recommend
4,Love it.
5,A well built unit at a great price. Wish I had installed one a long time ago.
5,Great bang for your buck easy to install
5,Simple instructions.
1,Since I don’t make a habit of driving behind my own car I did not realize my backup camera lights stay on. I went back to the professional installers to confirm there were no errors. Everything is and was installed correctly. The back up lights stay on any time the car is running. I received a citation because it is illegal to have LED lights on all of the time where they’re visible to other drivers. STAY AWAY
2,The tiniest set screws are used to lock in the cameras tilt function and they are already stripped with one cycle of tightening. Video quality is okay figured it would be better but it isn't the worst.
4,haven't used it yet. I thought it came wiyh a monitor.
5,Picture is a little grainy at night works great in fog and during the day overall best camera so far I've found
5,I love it. Very clear picture at night and day
5,Well worth it best one I have ever purchased. East to install and have zero cons.
5,I received a defective camera.The seller issued me a refund and sent a replacement unit.This is a good camera and an excellent seller.I did not expect this type of customer service but am very glad I did.The camera is spot on perfect for backing into any space as well as a very attractive and superb picture quality.Many thanks.
1,Camera is upside down
3,video cable was not long enough to reach stereo
5,I love style  but night visionQuality poor
5,Replace the same exact one i installed on a car 5 years ago.  Outside winters and rain I felt it lasted a long time to the elements.
5,Excellent picture. Bright lights. Wish the connections were water proof though
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Night vision work really great all work great
5,Installed into a 98 Grand Marquis. Works great and can finally see how close the bumper is to other cars!
5,Great product
1,died in less than a year! The prior one I had at least lasted years before it died on me... it was a different brand i might add though.
5,Me gustó el producto y llego antes de tiempo
3,Sounded like a paper dragon.... figured save a few hundred and do this to the car....nope not compatible with a Dodge Charger... bummer
5,Easy to install works great wired to activate when shifting into reverse
1,I’ve brought several different back up cameras and they all worked for about five minutes then died out… this one never cut on at all
5,Amazing video quality at all times of the day.
5,articulo segun descrito buena construccion y imagenes claras
5,Great little backup camera for the price
5,Very good quality for the price you can’t beet it and it’s worth it
5,Installed this on my 2004 Explorer. Picture looks great  very easy to install.
5,Bought this to replace non-working camera that came with the Pioneer 2330 unit. Thankfully the power and RCA hook ups were the same so didn't have re-run those. Not as clear as wife's 18 Honda but nice upgrade to my 04 Ram. Only driven truck a handful of times since installing. So far I am satisfied with its performance.
1,Although the camera has a high quality picture I was disappointed with the viewing angle. I purchased this camera based on the advertisement of a 170 degree viewing angle. As you can see in the picture it is maybe 100 degrees. I would not recommend this camera if you want a 170 degree view. I am not fan of false advertising. For that I give it one 🌟Bob B.
1,Had this installed and it started malfunction about 2 weeks later. It completely stopped working 2 months ago.
5,I have installed the Camera on my own.It has not time taking effort - you have to watch some videos of installation of the Reverse Camera.You will get better Idea on this.Pros : Camera Quality is so good. Easy Installation. Value for Money.
5,This camera zooms in a lot so I can park up to objects and stop short of that object being out of frame and still be confident that I won't hit anything.
5,Muy buena nada me encanta
5,View so nice
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Wow! This fit for my Toyota Yaris 2008 hatchback.  The quality of image is HD! And the best part of this product is I can adjust or roating the camera by loading screw for a better angle. This product is what I expected.
5,Great value pic seems blurry at night though
4,I would of like the radio to play while backing up.
5,The video quality is fantastic.  A must have for anyone looking to hook up a trailer.  First time every time.
5,Very nice I love it
5,This camera installs easily. The view is very impressive!
5,Simple install
5,No complaints!
5,Its a great product
5,Exceptional value and the picture is great even at night. It was easy to install. Love it.
5,clear picture and easy to install night vie is clear and crisp
3,The problems the product had been returned since 3 weeks ago and I need to refund to original credit card.
5,I connected this via the tow hitch receptacle wiring and ran it to a Pioneer head Unit. Looks nice and clean on the 6.2 inch screen and switches on when I go to reverse. Have to wire to head unit to make it work as intended.
4,Very clear the best
5,Super  nice frame 👌 👍
2,Get what you pay for  it’s pretty blurry and it’s not switching out of night vision for some reason.
4,It’s ok. You get what you pay for
5,Gift for my husband and he says it works good. Compatible with Chevy Impala 2010
5,Easy to install!! IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS AND MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED
5,Works well for me   I got tired of trying to get a wireless one to work . Wired is the way to go
5,Camera installs easily.  The hardest part is routing the wires and making the connections to the car's display.  Good picture quality and night vision.
5,Excellent quality frame and camera.
4,I like coz its nice and clear but the wire doesn’t not long enough for my suv
1,Installed it work for an hour and stop working .
5,Works great with my aftermarket Kenwood head unit.
3,NA
2,company policy on any issue you might have..its not easy for me to get the customer back to just take a photo of image being backwards..and then hard for me to summit the photo..
3,The instructions made no sense. I was very disappointed in the field of you. Advertises 170° but I don’t believe it. Only sees what’s directly behind you
5,Gratr
5,Had this installed on my 2008 4Runner. Picture is clear. Great addition for safety.
5,Liked everything great product highly recommend
5,Pretty good view
3,The rear view camera works.  The picture is not as bright as I would like it.  The lines to indicate distance point up not straight out or down.  All in all it is good for the price.
5,Excellent
4,Seems very good for the price static when the motor is running that could be in the RCA cable.
2,The frame is nice and strmurdy. The picture is subpar compared to other models that are cheaper.  I would buy again due to it being on the plate cover. But the picture is like watching the world in 8bit nes game
4,Camera works good very good at night easy install but the lines are useless at least for my f150
5,Awesome just as advertised live it
5,Works well.
5,Works exactly as promised simply fallow the diagram. High quality and great picture. You really must have a decent understanding of automotive wiring to install this would be tricky otherwise
5,this good
2,Image is extremely poor. After a fairly straight forward install of what seemed like a product of reasonable quality the video is horrible. Image is washed out during the day and barely usable at night. LEDs illuminate brightly but cam has a very poor dynamic range either completely washed out or nearly black. Skip this unit if you care about usability in the least.
3,I like the frame and design but camera is not so great.
3,Works well when it works. The feed doesn't always show on monitor but reverse lights built into it always come on.
1,Camera clouded up was all but unusable after three months then decided it didn't want to work anymore doesn't even detect. Very frustrating..
5,The quality of this camera is great
1,Video quality poor had lines running through it
1,I have had this since June of last year and the video image is too dark to be useful.  It borders on being dangerous if you rely on it.  I don't drive that much but finally decided to order another product.
5,Perfecto
5,Easy insulation picture very clear and fast delivery
5,Good
5,Just like description fast delivery all parts I needed were included great quality for the price
5,Very good quality. Work great.
5,I have not install it yet by the look of it it appears sturdy and nice and the box came with all its cable. I will add more feed back once it is being installed on my day off.
2,It's not obvious in the sales information that this product does not come with a monitor.  Didn't find this out until the product arrived.  What good is a camera if you don't have a monitor to attach it to?
5,Its everything it was advertised to be! Its built tough for sure. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
5,just what I needed  thanks a lot
5,Ez to install  great camera. Love it !!!
4,camera view is about a foot off center
2,Worked great for a couple of weeks but now the picture goes 1/2 & 1/2 where the top is on the bottom& vice-versa.I sure wish this would have worked...
1,On a positive side the frame is very sturdy but its thick wraps around the entire plate and actually interfered with the bumper at the bottom ( step bumper on pickup truck).  You might want to fact that in if the bottom is not open.  I  am getting a different brand hoping for better luck.  It could not have been  sealed well and the LED should last longer than 40 days.I noticed the picture was very spotty ( I assume its moisture it doesn't wipe off) and in testing it I realized the LEDs on one side no longer illuminate.  I called Amazon and worked through the "troubleshooting process"??  Anyway Amazon will refund the purchase despite it being out of the 30 day window.
4,Great product for the price.
5,Have someone who knows how to install the camera. You will need yo order a longer cable.
2,I have installed this camera on one of my customers everything seems to be ok until he told me that he almost hits somebody couple times while he tried to backup. I brought the car back and double check it and find out that the camera's angle not 170 degrees its like 90 degrees. To be sure I bought another camera and find out others work perfect but this one. This camera angle is bad and even the guideline is not accurate enough
5,Gave item a second chance because of its looks and was happy I did. I love the whole look and no need for drilling into anything for it to mount. Picture looks great on my radio as well.
5,Easy install
1,I have looked at the other reviews and I have no idea how anyone can give this more than one star. I received one with a broken camera Amazon sent another and the second one worked for about 4 minutes then that camera died too. Stay away. The instructions are terrible the product is cheap 2 of the screws that hold the camera broke off right away. I only give it one star because there isn't a a minus star on here.
5,Little wire running but easy to install
5,sturdy construction
5,Thanks
5,Excellent video quality with easy to mount frame.
5,Very good product put in my Nissan Titan truck amazing result very easy to install
2,Quality is not good nite picture is poor day time is very foggy led lights quit working after only three months not as advertised
1,I had my vehicle interior torn apart and thought why not install a back up camera and be able to hide all my wires since the interior is apart.  Worked great for the first week or two.  It is installed in a car I drive once in a while in the summer.  Worked  then the next time I drove it it no longer worked.
1,The camera worked fine for the first year that I owned it. Once I used my truck backing my boat into the river using this camera the camera cannot adjust to your surroundings day or night.  The camera will give me an all white screen and possibly adjust after a minute or more.  I wouldn’t waste your time on this one. It seems like there are less expensive options offering the same results.
1,Worked great for 2 months.  Stopped working all together. Now the picture is just black and white static. Customer service sucks.
1,It did work great I installed it and it was connected to my Alpine head unit. Everything was working fine for about 4 months. Then the trouble started the left bank of leds only the left side start flashing on and off constantly. Also this caused some weird problems with my head unit and the reverse sense input. Amazon will not return it because it is more that 3 months old.
5,Easy to Install Great Picture Quality
5,I like how it looks on my car. It looks like it came with the car. The clarity color and the wide angle view made it spectacular. Not to mention how bright it is during night time.
5,Perfect
2,I have had this backup  camera for almost  year. It worked great for a while  but in the last 3 months the lens has become cloudy inside  and the picture it displays looks like I am in a fog. Very poor quality somewhere. I tried cleaning the lens but I can see the problem is inside. Would not buy this produce again.
5,Had this installed on an older model Lexus GX470.  It linked up to the navigation screen and automatically turns on when the car is in reverse.  It's fantastic.
3,Installation was easy but the video quality is not that great. Day time flickering lines on screen and night time with lots of noises
1,The picture is good but the LED lights already went out after a month. Poorly made lights
1,I would have given them a 0 for customer service the unit would not work and everything was installed correctly I have installed these before and was putting in a new one. I sent a question and the response was Generic and exactly what the directions said so they really didn’t read the question. I cant really rate the product because it never worked but the customer service was not satisfactory. So if you do run into a problem you might not get the answer you need for all I know it might not be compatible with my vehicle but I will never know.
1,There is no way to contact the seller of this product for a refund or exchange. License plate back up camera worked fine for 6 months then the camera became very cloudy. It's advertised as 100% waterproof. Right ?Don't waste your time or money on this.
5,Very nice 👍
5,Nice view and good lighting at night.
5,Easy to install. Image is grainy not HD. Ok at night.
5,No dislike very much satisfied with the product trying it out on my truck but it's for my car.
5,Clean and clear picture!
5,Cannot believe the quality for the price!! Definitely recommend!
5,Love it was easy to install I will buy it again
5,Works great easy to install
5,The resolution was a huge improvement over the one that came with car.
1,
1,I had my camera installed it is not a great camera keep cutting in and out we had the camera on one of the old trucks it was doing the same thing a lot of times it won't even turn on I had to rewire it multiple times and still not working right will not recommend this camera or buy the camera again
4,Need to provide Self tapping screws.
1,I was hoping to return it for another one but it was to late.
4,Good
1,I installed this Dec 2020. After 2 months of very cold Chicago weather the video feed stopped working. The little LED lights on both sides of the camera turn on. My brand new Alpine digital head unit is triggered to show rearview camera when my truck is in reverse. But no camera feed. This was a pain to install; the wire is run underneath inside of a wire loom. Not looking forward to pulling this out. Very frustrated.
5,Works good; doesnt fit my car; but the person that has intalled it; cut the plate frame And adecuate it
5,Using the provide cables worked great good picture and the 10$ bypass I bought worked perfect with it. I tried a wireless kit that did not work.
2,Came in broke but fixed it still didn't like the quality of the camera
5,Great product now my neighbor wants to order the same one easy install work great with my Pioneer head unit
1,
2,The lights stay on when the car starts...on my landcruiser it blinds anyone behind me...poor design had to tape over lights so I could use....lights should only come on when in reverse....
1,The camera works great and is very clear  however less than a week the led lights began to flash then later went completely out (within a week) without led camera appears grainy in low light areas
5,Great camera
4,Bueno
5,does as advertised- Thanks
5,Easy installation..cristal clear imagen..bright lights..
4,Awesome
1,I thought I was buying a product which was advertised as wireless. I opened the box all set to have my backup camera license plate all ready to go  but I saw two types of wires with the instructions. The instructions were so small that my daughter came over to help.She finally had to give up because not only was it not wireless the instructions indicated that a non included wire was necessary to properly install the product.
5,The view from this night vision camera is very good. I can see everything around me. It is like daylight when backing up.
1,No funciona me llego defectuosa no se ve seven solo líneas
5,Overall great camera! And an easy installation!
1,Had another rear camera that was similar to this.  Honestly wasnt as impressed as this as the image isnt as sharp.  Video quality has alot of noise in it and has alot of granularity.  I'd honestly look for a better camera later down the road.  Maybe when I upgrade my sony radio to a pioneer one.
3,Decent value for the price image is not as clear at night.
5,Easy to install highly recommended
1,Not worth money led lights stop working second day so no night vision
5,I love the night vision backup camera.  Works great nice and clear at night or day.  Easy to install
1,It breaks way to easy.
5,Finally got around to installing this. It’s a great setup for the money.
5,Working great for over a year and still working great
5,Very good product. Makes hooking up the trailer so much easier
5,This was very easy to install and works very well.  You won't be disappointed.
5,Fantastic product and Crazy Car Stereo in Fountain Valley area sold my girlfriend one for $120.00 the pigs!!
5,It is a solid frame it is mounted in the camera has a great picture.
5,Muy bueno
1,Easy install good picture night vision good. After 90 days unit failed to produce video only the warning  "Check Your Surroundings" appears on the video screen no camera image appears on screen. All connections checked for conductivity and power all good. I will assume a board in the back up camera unit has failed since I installed a video test unit and image appears fine. And of course it is out of warrantee and return by a few weeks.
5,Had to send this back because we changed car stereos but the quality of the product is clearly visible.
5,Funciona perfecto fácil de instalar
1,Sucks! Product comes with no instructions what so ever to tell you how to hook it up. It comes with a wire with  RC input with a red pig tail at both ends and then a black and red wire that plugs at the camera end and no idea where to hook it up at. I tied all combinations into my back up lights and never got a picture after fooling with it 2 hours i finally gave up and said screw it. Don’t waste your money like I did
1,I was replacing the same looking product that had the voltage converter burned up. Pulled the old one out  and installed all new and when I was finished it only kinda worked. If I pulled the rca connector off the tester the video would not come back up until the power was reset. Even then the video was very weak. Wasted hours trying to figure out what was wrong with the video.
1,This is my second attempt at finding a night vision enabled rear camera.  I was fooled into buying another option because it had "night vision" in the title which was a misuse of the phrase as it only had visible LEDs.  This unit clearly states it has infrared LEDs but it does not.  It also only has visible LEDs.  This is false advertisement it does not have night vision.
5,Showed up was perfect view is great will buy another for my other truck
1,Quality looks great but at first testing it out before install picture looked great and what not but after 2 days it basically stopped working. I checked the wiring all good the led lights turn on when i put it in reverse but camera has no signal...
1,Ive had two of these and both quit after less than 6 months. Professionally installed and still crapped out on me. Definitely go with a different brand.
5,Camera excellent very happy
1,Bought this item and it arrived not working blue screen only- do not buy
5,This license frame camera works great clear field of view and includes distance markers.
5,looks awesome picture is great
1,Order two of them. Very disappointed !!!!!!!!!!!. One was missing parts and did no work at all. The second one the back-up lighting worked but the camera did not.
1,The picture was mediocre at best but for the first 6 months it was usable.  However after that it's blurry and spotty and in the morning completely fogged out.  Wiping is doesn't help so the condensation is inside.  I would strongly recommend that you DO NOT waste money on this
2,really good quality for a rear view camera. probably top 5 for under $40.  but you cant install in front or remove the parking guidance lines.-=Mathew
5,Great product beautiful picture
5,it did a great job the installer said it was great
2,I bought this about 10.5 months ago. Night vision at first is great. Then about a month ago the night vision is absolutely horrendous. I don’t recommend this product.
1,Cannot use until I get a monitor. Very basic instructions with no troubleshooting.
1,Okay.. so it had a fantastic image upon installation which quickly started showing signs of blurriness about 2 weeks after I had finally gotten it installed.  I have now discovered the inside of the lens has clouded up. It looks like smoke or residue and does not show signs of moisture. There doesn't seem to be a way to open it up to try to correct the issue. 😕
1,Took about a week for the video to get dimmer and dimmer until it was basically unusable.
2,Have no idea how this works since the ward no place for the cord to come out behind the plate rim and in the process of filling one ruined the cord
5,Really like it
1,Won't work with my system maybe not at all don't waste your money.
5,The Seller informed me that it that it couldn't be used as a front camera. I found this helpful information.Can you wire a backup camera to be on all the time?Expert Reply: In order to wire a backup camera to be on all of the time you would have to wire it into the running light circuit instead of the reverse light circuit. This way when you wanted it on you would just turn the running lights on.It also being a HD camera with led lights it will be acceptable.  It's not a LPR CAM but as long as your expectations are realisticyou'll be happy with this License plate frame!
1,Horrible picture quality. It’s definitely not HD. More like 480 p. I don’t even use it it’s so bad.
1,Did not even make it 6 months the light comes on the video camera has ceased to function. Would not reccomend this item
5,Good value for item
2,Flimsy materials and LEDs are to bright. No lateral adjustment.
5,good camera thanks
5,Very nice license plate camera
5,Love it
1,Camera shows my opposite side
5,I love it.
1,I purchased this for my coworkers toyota sienna with a aftermarket headunit installed. read the instructions and did not work at all would not recommend for toyota sienna 2011.
5,Works perfect. Took me a long time to wire it up.
5,Works good great price
5,Camera works great- Heavy duty metal frame
5,Bueno
5,Amazing
1,Garbage
1,Requires extensive and technical installation. Do not buy as a casual car person.
1,My husband was very disappointed in that the package did not contain an essential part for him to connect it to his phone. He thought he ordered a wireless package. It was not.
5,Installed on a 2006 dodge ram 2500
1,Did not use item do to selling vehicle that did not have backup camera.
1,Stopped working after 6 months. Checked all my wires cleaned connections with CRC still nothing.... Camera just died.
5,Good
1,I’m not to use my the true words to describe how big of a piece of garbage this is. Excellent if you like a scrolling screen or not working at all
1,Dislike
1,I thought there was a monitor with it
5,Perfect
5,Works good decent night vision.
1,Item worked a few times then stopped working.
1,Video quality lasted less than 4 months. I purchased this in April 2019. These two pictures are as of August 2019. Maybe it's a defective product...? Maybe not.
1,Dang thing don't work.
5,Great quality and fast shipping.
5,best cam
1,This camera will not work on my 2000 Toyota Tacoma. Looks like I have to rewire my backup system.
5,works great
1,This was an excellent product for 6 months. Spontaneously quit working today one month out of support. I'll try something different hopefully with a little longer life.
5,nice and sturdy.
5,Very good
1,Muy mala ya no funciona
1,Looked good but two lights on the frame did not come on I requested a new replacement
1,This Rear View Camera Did Not Work At All.
5,good
1,Did not hold up in ca rain. I can't c out of it from water inside lense.  Bummer.
1,First time it rained water stayed on the camera and made it unable for me to see with.
1,Sent back. Credit was quick.
2,Major problem with this is policeman will stop you stating is blocked part of the license plate thus they now have a reason to search the entire car and run your ID insurance etc
5,There.  Is just.  One issue. Or problem.  I see. With. The one. I have  Ok.  Led brite. Light.  Affecte.I have.  Led. Tag. Lights. When.  They are.  On. It’s toMuch.  Light.  To. View. The camera.

1,Camera clouded up and is all but unusable after three months.
1,No good
1,After snow storm came and went camera went south!
1,DOA
1,The worst ...
1,Ordered 2 and both had screes missing
4,The picture was ok. But setup is easy if you have knowledge of cars. Arrived fast.
3,Unit has to be hard wired into your cars electrical system so if your not handy in that way explore other options. I got this never installed it and donated it to a local charity done.
5,I don't have this product...BUT it would be super nice if they added sports teams on it. That would be very cool.
5,I have to be honest reverse parking is not my strongest skill. Especially when getting out of a parking with little space to work with just stresses me out.The night vision is very great. I was surprised because it made me see more than I can see with the back lights. The camera is clear enough to see that you aren't going to hit anything. Installing took a while for me but it was my first time so I guess its normal.What I did was run the video line through the side of my car lean down the back seat to reach my license plate. Then connected the power to my back lights.
5,Can't review yet; this was a gift.  Package arrived and product was not damaged.
5,Video quality Night Vision quality and Unit build quality is great. Ordered and installed it in May and its working great till today.
1,The camera burned up charging it and the company has done nothing but give me the run around
5,Works as it should. Very happy with it.
5,Just got it installed yesterday and it works perfectly. The quality is really good. It also rained last night and it still work perfectly as it was raining and this morning. Image is fine for backing up guide lines are clear.I was very impressed with the build quality of the camera and frame. You'd almost spend this much money on an anodized cast frame without the camera! The holes in the frame are countersunk to take a bolt head that fits flush with the frame rather than a sheet metal screw which makes the install very professional.It comes with extension wires to connect with a monitor.  Every car should have one of this to check back of the car cause little kids cannot be seen through rear mirrors. Recommend it!
5,With winter times coming up and it gets dark early for someone who lives in a city and needs to parallel park often this backup camera is just what I need! I have a car made in 04 so it doesn't come with a backup cam. I'm not too handy with installing electronic stuff on my car but this cam is pretty easy to hook up and it works perfectly! The best thing about it is that it has the lines on the screen to show you where your car might go. So far it's been amazing to use at night!
5,I have had many rear view camera's AND I MEAN MANY. This by far is the best in terms of visibility and angle. There is a screw on the frame that keeps the camera permanently at the angle you want it to be and none of the competitors i've use have that. Very sturdy license place and camera. I intend to install 2 more of these on my Dad and Brothers car.
3,I haven't installed it. I am 73 and this is all new to me. Maybe I read to many back up camera reviews from a few manufacturers and picked the wrong one.  What is used for a monitor? I thought a smart phone or bluetooth device can be used. It is not the case with this one.
5,I have to say that my expectations were low. Especially for the price. This is a GREAT value. Picture quality is better than most but not quite as good as a factory setup. The lighting works great. The guide lines are accurate enough. Install was VERY simple. I am ordering a second one for my sons car.
5,I was a little skeptical about how well a 20+ dollar backup camera would work but so far it's working great.  It hasn't really gone through the weather yet but I am happy to have a nice backup camera on my F250.  Running the wire took a little planning but not too bad.  So far I recommend this camera.
2,LED lights worked correctly for about 20 seconds. Now they VERY dimly light up. Install wasn’t bad except it came with 2 sets of directions that contradict one another. Also had to buy an RCA extension as the provided RCA cable was approximately 3’ too short.
4,The wiring wasn't an easy install but it's doable. Tapping into the taillight was the hardest part. But I love how bright the lights are when I back out. The product itself is good just the task of installing it isn't as simple once you get started.
5,This camera works great. High quality materials. Couldn’t be more satisfied. Highly recommended. The exact same one retailers like cartoys will sell you at a ridiculous price.
5,Great device  easy to install and easy to manipulate the camera especially if you want to move the camera to the bottom part of the holder
3,Nothing special...camera quality is just ok...pain in the rear to install.  Price is ok
5,I really like this camera super nice in daylight night time is good but not like morning Am not saying is bad I just like everything to be more than perfect I do love it and I recommend it to everyone Come on this is a great price for backup camera Highly recommended yes 👍
5,It looks better than my backup camera that came with my new car.  I highly recommend well worth the money.
5,Worked great with my existing system
3,Camera eye is not centered I had to take it all apart recenter and put new epoxy in - or I could have followed the original lines and parked in the neighbors yard - lacking quality control
5,Easy install great picture quality
5,works good and shipped out fast!
5,MUY BUENA RESOLUCIÓN EXCELENTE GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS.
5,Muy buena calidad y fácil de instalar
1,Absolutely junk! Will be sending back number 2 . Don’t buy these.
5,Works great and feels great!
4,Works great for the price.
5,It’s proper up and  running
5,Great
5,Good quality. Metal look strong.
5,Great picture and led lights help at night
4,I like the nice solid metal construction and the ability to position the camera. It works well with my new touch screen reciever. Picture quality is good. "Night vision" seems to just be super bright LEDS (see pic.) The cable was slightly too short for my tiny minivan (mazda 5) so I doubt it would work at all for a large SUV or bigger sized van. Installation wasn't too bad.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Sharp image and very accurate. Good buy!
5,La cálida de imagen es excelente se lo coloque a una pantalla de 9 pulgadas y se ve bienContento quedó bien mi tacoma 2009
5,This is the best reverse camera purchase for a clear high resolution get a lot of compliments when I’m in reverse and people sitting in the car and See the high resolution
5,Genial 👍
5,Love the camera after I figured out how to hook it up to my radio I had no issue with the installation. It does take finding the reverse wires and the camera's wires into these wires so if you are not comfortable with this or do not know how to do this I would recommend going on youtube or looking up how to install and see if it is something you can do. The quality of license plate holder is very nice and sturdy. The camera has good quality and looks very nice
5,I had to rewire to fit my vehicle
5,Reviews helped me make sure it would work on husband’s truck and he was able to install. In bright sunlit it’s hard to see anything but maybe just need adjustments on the picture.
5,Great price
5,Great fit and quality. Clear picture
5,Good back-up camera easy to install and does the job. I'd purchase again.
5,muy practica
5,Was a nice add on to my Suburban
1,Stopped working after 2 months.
5,buen articulo
1,Wasn't what I expected it was a little misleading
5,excelente mercancia y servicio gracias
4,This camera would work well with smaller resolution screens. It’s build pretty well and solid. Instructions were pretty clear and everything was packaged well. Looks great and clean. Only downside is I wish it were higher resolution. Not expecting 4K with RCA connections but even 720p would be fantastic.
5,This is exactly what i needed to bring my car into the 21st century.
1,The picture is not clear
5,The frame is sturdy and the camera works great.
5,This is a replacement backup cam for one I had installed several years ago for my F150 pickup backup cam. Originally had it installed by some Geeks who did not do a perfect job so after a few years it died an early death due to that poor install. This time around I did the install and treated the project as if quality installations make a difference. It was easy to install (since some of the cabling to the front of the truck was already done). Backup camera wise this unit improved past performance x4 - better resolution clearly a much better picture perfect aiming first try great low light performance great quality all metal license plate frame with integral camera. I am most pleased!
5,This is very high quality product. Easy to install and has a very good picture day and night time.
5,I used this on a 2001 Chevy Silverado 1500HD crew cab and the wiring was way too short to reach the cab. I almost expected this from a generic camera so no biggie. In the end I spliced the wire and routed it into the cab from under the hood... drilled a hole near the throttle cable and used a grommet to protect the wire. The license plate frame is sturdy cast metal and wouldn’t fit my truck so I had to cut off the bottom part with a hacksaw. I figured I would have to do this anyhow. Seems to hold the camera steady and secure. Picture quality is fine. I snipped the green loop to turn off the guide lines because my stereo has its own guide lines.
5,Just got it installed through BestBuy. Surprisingly its really good quality. Will update the review if something negative comes up in next few days
5,Gives the clearest picture quality.The 170 degree view is a plus.
5,I'm loving everything  about it .happy  that I bought it
1,Easy to install but the video quality sucks. No matter what I did could not get rid of the lines in the screen. Then it only lasted about 1.5 months and now won't send any video. Also the image was reversed
5,Prefect view in rear back
5,MUCH better quality than I expected! It's so clear on my radio. The only "issue" is the cord was too short for my crew cab short bed duramax but I just added more to it.
5,I like it I wish I would have got it a long time ago
4,For being an aftermarket camera from a random brand off Amazon it works as it should and looks decent! Had plenty of wiring for my full sized truck. Happy with it currently!
5,Great quality as t a good price
5,Installed on a buddies 07 Civic. Very nice picture quality. Very very little feedback delay.I was impressed at how fast the camera matched my hand speed. Usually there is a bit of a delay with these things. Installation was about as simple as it gets.
4,The camera is easy to install and quality is good. However the RCA is cable is short for an SUV. I have 4Runner and I had buy RCA cable to extend it. This works with pioneer entertainment system. Other than the cable it’s great camera.
5,This camera is amazing. The picture is clear and perfect. The set-up was an easy install too.We're able to see clearly while backing-up.
3,Easy not install just the picture that the camera gets is not great
5,The older camera I had was having issues with weather wet conditions static blanking out and at night not very good. Went to a car audio shop and they wanted $150 for new replacement and $90 to install. Bought this replacement and it was excellent replacement. Have a very clear color picture during the day or night. I had installed LED license plate lights (from Amazon) and with my old camera they would flood it out and could not see anything but light from them at night with this camera they have no effect on it at night clear color view. It is very easy too adjust and install.
5,I had one of these before and used it until it fell apart bought this one and will do the same.
5,Installed on a 2008 Tundra with a Kenwood head unit. Works great as of now. Heads up on the wiring it comes with. On a crewmax it was just barely long enough.
5,Great little star projector. I keep mine on a table on top of a stack of books so that it sits a little closer to the ceiling. Stars get fuzzy if you keep it too low or too far from the walls.
4,Es una cámara de reversa de muy buena visión amplia y nítida al meter la reversa se activa inmediatamente aun estando apagado el monitor.Estoy satisfecho con la compra la recomiendo
1,i received a defective product! seller should always check quality before shipping! it wasted my time from installing through returning this product!
5,I bought this for my G37x sedan without nav or back up cam. Works greatfairly easy to install if you know your vehicle. I already had a cam on the lights that lights up the license plate. So I just plugged the new cam into the wiring I already did before. Now the guide lines are more centred on my screen. I also like being able to adjust the camera angles. Would recommend to anyone who needs good back up camera.
5,J’aime que ce soit avec la plaque et une très bonne visibilité
