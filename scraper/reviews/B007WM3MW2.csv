3,It works.  No cords as pictured
5,I use this every time I have my Algebra homework. It has been since I was in high school with my TI-83 from then. But this calculator works just the same but looks better.
5,Does what needs to do -for college aid son
5,This is a must haves. Can not graduate before you buy one.  College is soon. It will get lots of use
4,I bought this for college and I only need it for one course. I wish it didn't cost so much just to use for 3 months. In my opinion it would have been better to look around for a rental than outright buying it. Despite the high price for this model it was the most reasonably priced.
5,My calculator came in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected/what it was listed as! I had a little trouble locating my package for a couple days and the sellers were great about communicating with me and helping me how they can! Appreciate the service
5,I got this calculator for a statistics class I'm taking and it's great. I was upgraded as a surprise and it was awesome! The buttons are easy to use and the screen is easy to read. Very happy with this calculator so far.
5,Just what my son needed for his Algebra2 class. Easy to use.Good quality good value.
5,Works great and has many features. This calculator is a classic and will serve you well.
5,If you need a graphing calculator for your child then this is the one you want. Don't bother with the alternative. No issues with this product.
4,A more detailed instruction manual would be cool
4,4 stars instead of 5 because the package came completely mangled. It was already open and even though the calculator hadn’t been used It was embarrassing to give to my boyfriend as a gift with it looking like that.
5,I’m majoring in math so it’s really recommended for us to use this calculator and let me tell you best choice ever! I like the color and everything it works just fine and I’ve had it for a while now it came with the batteries and the wire.  Would definitely recommend this product it’s such a great price compared to price that they sell them at my university!
3,Funciona muy bien. Pero el empaque llegó muy dañado y la calculadora parece usada por los rayazos.
5,My daughter uses this calculator for school and it’s easy to navigate
5,Amazing works well no glitch. I would definitely recommend.
5,Came in black with its charger and batteries. It has worked ever since I bought it and it still work for my math class.
5,Doesn’t look much different from the TI-85 I used in algebra/Trig 20 years ago.  I guess if it ain’t broke don’t fix it!  I bought our daughter one of the fancier new color display models that was approved for use at their school that was probably 30% more expensive but apparently not a single other student had one and the teacher didn’t know how to use it either... Lesson learned just buy the cheapest one approved because that’s what everyone else is getting and what the teacher is going to know how to use... 😉 This old venerable unit is that calculator!
2,Pros:- Basic functionality on basic calculator useage- Turns on/off- so far battery life is "ok"Cons:- Even though I purchased it "used" but for the price I paid for the TI-84 calculator I received was dirty with dust and some dirt in the groves on the both sides on the screen the cover where Texas Instrument writing and in the top plugs for the cords.  I had to sanitize it and wipe it down.  Not cool!- After having this calculator for over a week now and into my Math class the top and down arrows button doesn't even work!  Now I don't even know if they sent me a "used defective" product!!!!  I have 2 more weeks before I can return it for a full refund!  This is ridiculous!  Why Amazon allow these kind of sellers???
5,We bought this as part of our son's school supply list.  It was inexpensive compared to other outlets we looked at.  It was exactly what he was required to have.  It arrived in new condition and in a timely manner.
5,Bought this for my HS daughter because she needed it. Works fine can't say she loves it because she hates school but at least the calculator works fine
5,My granddaughter needed this for her 7th grade class at school school. It's really coming handy for her
5,Excellent customer service and was delivered in very good condition.
3,Calculator came filthy with gunk in all the keys and smelled awful. Also did not come with a charger and a dead battery.
5,Great calculator. Pretty easy to use.  Aced my math class !
5,Great product and price
4,Calculator it works. For the money would have been nice to have an included cover.
5,Sometimes the screen freeze
3,It's an overpriced calculator built by a company that has a monopoly on calculators in education that works well and does what it was supposed to do made slightly cheaper second-hand yet still is somewhat overpriced. Not really the seller's fault being TI's manufactured necessity though it would've been nice if it arrived in the black color that was listed instead of bright yellow or if it arrived without looking like it was thrown in molten candy but who really cares? Again it works. Three stars for sending a functional product minus two for dishonest advertisement. Seriously though; why use a packaged black brand new TI-84 Plus as an image for the listing if that's not what's being sold?
4,Good purchase
5,Was hesitant to go with a refurbished ti-84 but we've had no issues and I was grateful for the savings.
4,Was a little more worn than expected but overall good condition and works well
5,I bought this calculator in the "very good" used condition for $75.99. There were some white marks on the back and everything works perfectly - so far - on the calculator. I thought this was a great deal since the new ones cost over $100! I would also recommend that you buy a guide for the calculator which can also be found on Amazon if you do not have any experience because there is so many functions available to use.
5,Bought this for my daughter for school and to take the ACT.  I saw on other reviews on other calculators that they were knockoffs.  This is why I made sure I did my research and bought directly from the Texas instrument Store.  This is worth the money.  Great!
5,What I like is my son is taking statistical reasoning and needed this calculator for that subject.  It does what he needs so that makes me happy as his parent
3,I was disappointed in the calculator. It is not user friendly.
5,I bought this for my sister for school. She says it works fine. She hasn't had any issues
5,Works as expected!
4,I got it for my son.
5,I bought this for my teenage son who needs it for homeschool. He loves it. They really have improved since I was in college.
5,Any other product and kid I probably would have been mad that this product came in a different color than the product photo. However it so happened that yellow is my kids FAVORITE color and he was flipping out happy he got a yellow one! So you all win. ;-) thanks for sending the random yellow one :-)
5,My son loves it for his College Algebra.
2,I haven’t used the calculator yet.  I needed it for school but when it came it only had 2 of the 4 batteries I needed to make it work.  IfYou order this make sure you have batteries at home because they don’t actually send you what you need.
4,I use this product for school and is great for all graghing and other calculations.
5,Best calculator!
5,It's the same one we used in highschool so I bought the same one for college. Works well. Battery powered.
5,Exactly what I needed for class. Works perfectly.
1,Paid $80 for a $13 calculator from goodwill. Arrived covered in dirt and dust and the goodwill sticker still on.
5,I’m just going to leave it here this came in a WAY WORSE condition then described as
1,Don't buy from this seller.  If the product you receive does not work you are dead to them.  I ordered this for my son who needed a graphing calculator.  He used it on and off and we noticed it had power issues but thought it was related to batteries.  Bought new batteries (rechargable and not) even bought a battery tester to make sure the batteries we were putting in were good.  We contacted the seller after it turned off and wouldn't turn back on during an SAT practice test requesting a replacement.  On 2/1 he wrote back and said  "you need to stick a screwdriver in a small one and move the two terminals on the inside a little.  The 2 holes below the batteries.  Look inside with a light and can see the touch gold terminals  move them over a little to one side and try that first."  We tried this which did not work as it turned off again as my son was working with his math tutor (who has the same calculator btw the difference being his works).  I wrote Franklin Electronics again asking for a replacement and have heard nothing.
1,Seller did not provide parts as pictured or listed. Item filthy. No cord so will have to check to see if it works. Likely return
5,good
4,Purchased for my granddaughter. Needed for school.
4,Nothing to complain about. It works great!
5,It is great for students!
5,My daughter is getting a lot of heavy use out of this for her college science and math courses No complaints so far from her.
5,This calculator is very easy to use good quality great for graphing mathematical equations and very accurate!
5,I gotta say that the price of the calculator is not budget friendly but it gets your job done. Totally worth it and useful. It’s a part of requirement for standard mathematical subjects like College Algebra Trigonometry Pre Calculus Calculus 12 and 3 and much more so you know exactly the worth of your investment.
5,Easy to use!
3,I just unwrapped this TI graphing calculator for my kid’s first day of school and was quite disappointed in what I saw:  corroded AAA batteries included with this calculator.  The outside packing looked very old too.  Not quite sure what to make of this...the calculator better work or else I’m going to scream for a refund...I’ll keep you posted!
5,Description said it was used but it came like new! Came with batteries and cable and all. No scratches or markings. Definitely satisfied
4,Used for high school math class
5,I purchased this for my son to use for math class
5,Great calculator...hard to find but not on Amazon 😉
5,Perfect for a precalculus class.
5,Great calculator for my child’s AP classes. Good price
5,I had a TI 84 for 5 years. It broke God knows why and i didn’t want to spend money on a new one. I found this product that was used and was practically brand new. Best purchase I’ve done in 2019
5,Functions as advertised
5,I bought 3 to have for students who cannot afford to pay for one. They are reliable. I have only used this model for years.
5,What can you say about these that hasn't already been said. They have been around for quite awhile and still hold up. My oldest still has his TI-83 and it works perfectly after 11 years. My youngest needed the newer version for his class and I expect this one to last equally as long as the first.
4,Great price
5,As a graphing calculator it did it's job wonderfully. Unfortunately it failed horribly at predicting the future mowing the grass or even just turning off the lights when it left for the day.
5,No complaints! I really like this calculator. I used it in calculus 1 2 3 (multivariable calculus) and differential equations classes. Works as advertised. Does have limitations so it became less useful in differential equations but worked quite well for the calculus classes.
5,Great
5,The product worked great! It really helped with my statistics class and held up wonderfully all year.  Definitely worth the money.
5,Good product
5,The TI-84 is the workhorse of graphing calculators. Tough reliable and dependable. Worth the expense to know that it will consistently work.
4,Pretty scratched for a very good open box buy but works ok
1,These devices do not have any cords and no batteries only the calculator
5,Bought a used one and it’s better then I expected !
3,SUPER old and used. Wasn’t even cleaned. Sharpee on back and no batteries no instructions nothing. Have returned item and no sign of a refund in sight. Super disappointed.
4,Good stuff. Clean packaging. Need a semester to master the calculator but that’s my issue ;)
3,overpriced but as expected it works.
5,I just ordered it last night and got today. Still in it's  orginal package as said. Thank you
5,Really cheap and it can help me save money!
4,Extremely pricey but my son had to have it for college.  Works fine.
5,I bought this for my daughter and she said it is great and it's kinda like having a cheat sheet. I will be buying 2 more next year when my 2 boys take trig
5,Worth the buy.
5,It's a TI-84 Plus as advertised. No issues.
5,Bought for our 14 year old granddaughter who needed it for school. She says it’s perfect!
5,Works great
4,grandchild still using in college seems to work as expected
5,Bought it so i can kill myself in my math classes i always used this model so when my previous one died after a decade i bought it agian
5,Helped me with my math homework
5,I could use it to my physics exam and was easy to manage
2,No cord or batteries came with this calculator which was disappointing as they were said to be included.
5,This worked out well for my son. Great unit and no issiues.
5,Came on time - works exactly as expected Ted
5,I have not personally used this item but it will help my son through a number of math hurtles in the next few years and possibly beyond.
5,Highly suggested
4,Good product but shipping was originally suppose to be 7-9 days and ended up 15 days which was dissappointing.
5,Just as expected. Hassle free fast service quality product. As new.
2,I was super excited to get my calculator for my college classes. When it finally came in I noticed the the batteries and a weird white dried up coating that was covering them and the plastic that the batteries came in. IT WAS ACID. Those batteries must have been sitting around for a long time to have acid coming out of them. Please be aware of that if you choose to purchase this.
5,Good
5,Had to have it and it is working fine.
5,As expected.
5,My son needed it so I found it here works greatgood priceshipping on time

5,Great Product
5,Great shopping experience. The item arrived as described & on time.
5,It was a good decision to buy it
5,Was the brand my daughters high school recommend.
2,I have to remove the batteries to extend the battery life.  I have purchased multiple sets of batteries since purchasing this calculator a couple of months ago.
4,Came quickly as advertised.  Wish these things weren't so expensive!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 No battery cover? Not as described I will be returning

4,Got this for granddaughter in high school.  She says it works great and does everything she needs.  Would buy it again.
5,Item as described.
4,It does the job but overpriced.
5,It's a good calculator
5,Helped perfectly for a statistics class
5,Perfect for my son in highschool
3,Calculator did not come with USB cord! Will be returning.
5,I ordered this for one of my grand daughter. She says it works great
5,Daughter needed or for school great calculator
5,works in the geometery and chemistry class just ducky
5,It was the product recommended by the teacher
5,As described. Meets all math needs.
2,TI has a monopoly on calculators needed for standardized tests. In addition the "plus" provides no added value for high school math curriculum.  After spending all this money I also found out that my child's teachers Were able to use the TI-83 for class instruction and tests.  Save your money buu a used TI-83. Or even better lobby your lawmaker to overturn the TI monopoly on permissible graphing calculators.
5,Awesome
5,Got me through with an A+ no issues.
5,My Daughter loves it for here math class
5,I loved it.
5,Just what we needed

5,The price was a high
5,Great stuff
5,Great works
5,My daughter loves it!! Shipping was great!
5,Awesome
5,Great
2,The price is overpriced.  You can do ANYTHING on this calculator for free on your computer.  BBUT can’t use computer  for sat testing. Cmon TI- how about supporting STEM education a bit better!!!
1,The item says 2 in package but you only acually get one it says rechargeable but it’s not plus the batteries that came with it are 4 different brands. WTHAlso says comes with cable but it doesn’t.The description is misleading and false
5,School
4,good......
5,I bought this for my high school algebra YEARS ago and I still find it useful to this day. There's not much you can't use this for and it makes all forms of math that much easier. You can type in and save formulas write scripts through its Linux and have them auto run you can program apps and games or follow a tutorial online for it. It has so many hidden features that you need not but ask online how to do this or that on a ti-84 and chances are there will be a tutorial on how to do it. An amazing calculator for an amazing price. (For reference when bought it was $110.) And yes you can download a primitive version of doom so you know it's good.
5,great buy
5,Pretty good
5,ok
5,good
5,Very efficient.
5,Great Refurbished calculator! You just need to update it well refurbished and half the price of a new one. Love it
5,Easy to use.
5,Excelente
5,Good
5,Very good. Looks brand new.
5,I like that it’s a perfect calculator.
5,Works just like it should.
5,Nice calculator for my son who just started college. I highly recommend it.
5,As listed. Adds great
5,Good product just what we expected
2,up button does not go up to previous answers so yeah that was very unfortunate. but it does calculate so hopefully that will be enough for my future math/science classes.
5,Works great in all my Finance and Accounting classes.
2,The Calculator seems cool but I can't use it because the charging cord that accompanied the calculator is broken. Love spending hundreds of dollars on stuff I need for it to show up broken. "amazon inspected"? Yeah right!
5,Great product
5,I used it for school
5,Smooth transaction!  Very nice product.
3,Old type calculator
1,I dislike it about graphing.  I can’t solve question about graphing with it.
5,Just as described fast shipping
5,My daughter loves it!
5,It's perfect I am satisfied
5,It was very helpful
5,Great
5,wish it came with instructions though
5,School
5,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
5,Great calculator helpful for stats
5,Great calculator. I am using it in college.
5,Great product. Work as expected.
5,Works.
1,Product arrived blatantly previously opened. There was also a scuff mark near the buttons on the right side. As long as it works for my son's school then that's fine but potential buyers beware you are not getting a "New" product.
1,so many inconvenient features. Just one example; there is no y^x button so if you wish to raise a number by a power greater than 2 you have to key in 8 additional steps.
1,I ordered this just before school started for my 7th grader. It was missing accessories that was stated as being included so I had to call amazon and they did take care of that. I put batteries in when it arrived and it did turn on. Of course a week after the returnabity expired is when it was first used in school and the calculator would not turn on.
5,Does so many things
5,Calculator arrived as described. Works good with new batteries.
1,Would power on but none of the buttons worked
5,Just what I needed.
1,When I opened the box the calculator was very dirty and some of the key symbols were rubbed off.  When I finally used it the keys “9” “8” “7” “x” and one other didn’t work.
5,GreT calculators
1,I purchased a brand new item but was sent an item that was already open and the packaged ripped. I am so disappointed. I returned it.
5,It works pretty good.
5,Good.
1,purchased this devise and it shut off on me in the middle of midterms with a black screen . I've only had it 2 mos
1,Often closes on me even with new and replaced battery. Takes a while to turn on the calculator. Much just rather buy a new one instead. Nearly failed a calculus test from this dumb calculator that won’t turn on at all.
5,very good
1,I was looking for a deal but got a lemon. It only lasted a few months. I should have just bought a brand new one instead of buying this one and having to buy a replacement after.
1,I believe this calculator to be stolen. Has “school property” on the bottom of the calculator. Doesn’t even look like the one pictured when purchased.
5,Great price works good
1,I cannot use it. Something is wrong with the calculator and I regret buying it. If possible to return it I want to return it and get a good one. Which I can do fraction equation in the calculator. I don't know how to explain that the problems of calculator. So many problems in the calculator. I don't even used it.
1,Do not buy this calculator
2,Old batterieslook like got wet before
1,El paquete no me llego. Nose por que ponen que lo entregaron y esta en un lugar seguro. A mi no me ha llegado mi pedido
1,No cable
1,Don't waste ur money. Came locked I wasted all that money and it was locked therefore it was worthless .
1,The calculator does not work. 80 bucks for something I can't even use as a paperweight.
1,Paid for a full priced new calculator and the AAA batteries inside were all corroded.
1,Not sure how to use it does not have instruction
1,no
1,Never arrivec
1,When I purchased a used calculator (good condition) it was terrible and would turn on and off by itself.
1,The keys were too stiff.
1,It was dirty and broken.
3,Bought this from my college and it's great it does its job pretty well except if you need to use logarithms to a base OTHER than 10 it's pretty much useless. Otherwise it's good as far as calculators go. But the lack of a basic function counts it off a couple stars for me.
1,What in the world is this? WHAT IS THIS??? It's 90's technology being manufactured in the 21st century! Seriously you could time travel to the 90's and show this to someone and they would think it's from their own era and it costs 100 stinking dollars! That's half the price of a Nintendo switch lite but less than half of the power. You can buy a much more powerful tablet and emulate a TI Calculator for a much cheaper price than this garbage! Where would Texas Instruments be without the stinking education system? Nowhere I say! Absolutely nowhere!
2,I have been using their product when I was a middle school kid and bought this one for my son. For some reason the screen will keep shutting down by itself. I was thinking it is the battery issue so I have replaced it a few times then finally found out it is the screen or machine self-issue. Everything else is worming well and of course who doesn’t like their product. Maybe I just got a bad one this time will continue using their product in the future.
5,Easy to use and compact for bookbag storage
5,Works as designed
5,Use for my class getting an A
5,Fast shipping
5,Exactly as described
5,Excellent 👍
5,Works great!
5,It was great!
2,overpriced because its the only one on the market not easy to use at all.
5,I'm taking math for the next couple of years so I'm going to sell this to my son (he's also taking this class later this year) then I'm going to buy the color version.
5,My daughter loves it when you go to high dchool you need this becaysebuts required the battery and stuff comes with it and you can charge it also.
5,does exactly what it’s supposed to no complaints.
5,school.... my kid love it
5,Perfect for school work
4,Expensive but very good quality
4,Nice
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This guy is a life saver. Save you time pen and paper if you are dealing with heavy math problems like me.
4,Exact same one they use at school.  Teacher recommended.  My daughter says is good.  Satisfied.
5,My Daughter needed this for high school It’s easy to use and will travel with her all the way to college.
5,The delivery time was well time. It arrived in time for school.
5,Using for calculus class has everything needed.
5,Very good
4,Good product. The only thing I’d suggest is to bring down the price just a tad. Beside that it is a really good product
5,Muy buena corresponde al precio !
