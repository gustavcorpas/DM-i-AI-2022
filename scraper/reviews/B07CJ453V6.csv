5,I had to learn the hard way from a previous magnet that it works best on the outside of the case. I didn't want to have something sticking out on the outside cause I was afraid it would feel weird or the adhesive would pick up all manner of dust. This product however does not have this issue. It has stayed on the magnet real firm while driving. Does not have adhesive on the sides so it's not picking up debris. And it does not feel any different on the case than without it. Like sure I notice it but it does not interfere in such a way that it impedes my phone holding experience. The best part is there is no logo on it!
5,We used the rectangular magnets for the backs of our phones. The adhesive held well and the magnets' strength are powerful when we use them in our vehicles. These magnets are great quality!
5,Thank you for providing these matter of plates. They were fantastic for what I needed and for the value would recommend it if you just need the plates and nothing else five stars for sure.
4,Good for price.  I use these in my clear phone case to attach to my magnet phone holder while driving so I can see the screen without having to hold my phone.  They work well.
5,I use these as back up plates to stick my phone to a magnetic mount in my car. They stick very well. Actually too well if you love your phone then stick it to the outside of a phone case instead of the actual phone.
5,I personally don't use the adhesion I just put it between my phone and phone case and it works perfect.
5,La calidad es la mejor
5,Soporta el celular bien
5,Super strong and useful. Perfect size if you need a magnet for your phone to attach to a base in your car.
5,Exactly as described!
5,Just perfect
5,Works on it just needs a little more adhesion
5,I have it stocked on the back of my phone case so I can just use it for my car magnetic stand and it works GREATT my phone doesn’t fall and it stays in place. Through out the whole ride. I feel like the magnet is very strong especially for the price. It’s great. JUST GET IT.
5,No he tenido ningún problema
5,These are so had to find.  Perfect magnets
5,There are so many magnets that you can put one on every phone case you have (if you are like my best friend and have a case for every holiday or season). Very good for the money.
5,I use this on the back of my cell phone as well as the back of my Garmin to mount on magnet mounts in the car.  Works great and a good value since you get a good selection of sizes in the package.
3,Did not work for me.  I got a new phone so I bought these to replace the metal plate that I couldn't pull off my old phone.  I tried putting these new metal plates on the inside of my case didn't hold onto car vent magnet.  Then I tried putting it on the outside of my case as ugly as that is still doesn't hold to car vent magnet.  I used to have a very strong hold with the original metal plate that came with my car vent magnet so I guess I have to replace the whole thing.
5,Always switching phones or cases and this assorted pack is great to have on standby if needed.
5,It works for what I need it to. Sticks on fairly easy and hasn’t fallen off yet.
5,Come in handy and lasts awhile
4,Good size strong easy to use
5,Me encanto el producto se adhiere súper fuerte. Lo recomiendo al 100% y lo compraría mil veces más excelente producto
5,Works great!
5,I changed my phone in case I needed a metal plate replacement. All the other options available at the time seamed too pricey. It has worked very well for a few months now.
5,I’ve bought various magnetic disk for my iPhone over the years.  These were by far the best for adhesion and durability.  Plus you get extras if you change cases or phones
5,I wrote a scathing review thinking this was a magnet. I found out later it's just metal for your magnetic cell phone holder. I edited my review after finding out. Great product after all.
5,loved it
5,Thin enough to put under the hard back case of my phone and still use the cover for my popsockets. Strong enough to keep my phone where is supposed to be.
4,I like it
5,I bought it last year but still it works perfectly.I'll get again if I have to change my phone case.
5,Best value I have found
5,These are totally awesome and i legit think they may be better than the original ones that came with my magnetic fone holder.
4,Good product
4,Worth the money if you need them not bad
5,N/A
5,My son who almost has his drivers license HAD to get this... I have a magnet on my dash for my phone but I can't use it in the summer heat. NOT only are they as described BUT I have to say I'm impressed! My phone stays put in the heat there's a variety of sizes & easy to cut if you need to trim. A+
5,Great product. Recommend it.
3,These did not stick well to the mount but wouldn't come off of your phone. I didn't really like this product
5,Excelente Material
5,No complaints works very well
5,works great
5,Works great
5,Title says it all.
5,New phone required new case.Needed a magnetic replacement disc for my car.Got 8 pack for $5.Great deal
4,The adhesion doesn't work.Had to super glue it to the phone caseThe good thing about it it doesn't scratch easily and it's durable
5,I wanted something to put on the inside of my phone case not the outside or directly on my phone. I did had to put two on the same spot so it could be strong enough to attach to my phone holder and it did the trick.I also want to note that even though I had two metal stack together in the inside of my case my case doesn’t feel bulky and still fit my phone perfectlyIt came with four Square and four circle which is a lot for the price. I will totally buy this again if I needed too.
5,I just wanted to let you know I love these they last a long time and adhere well back of phone  phone case .  I used for an older tablet too!! Delivery was smooth and fast enough!  Thank you for your service!! And I will buy again if you still make them.
4,Adhesive good only thing is that the metal used for this material isn't too good for the magnet vent clip I'm using. It's a pretty strong magnet perhaps it's the thickness of my case but great product for price
5,It was all said in the title these are a money saver vs having to buy the entire holder again
5,Item came as promised packed OK and was simple to install.
4,I had to use to metal plates one inside case and one outside to get it to stay on car mount. Some reviews stated used one for their hard case but that wasn't so for me.
5,Works as advertised.
5,It was easy to use and was nice and strong.
5,Easy to install
5,Worked well as a replacement for car mount
5,Nice
5,Adheres well.  Works with my magnetic mounts.
5,When I got a new phone and phone cover the metal plate I needed to use my phone holder in my car needed to be replaced.  This was exactly what I needed so I didn’t have to buy a whole new phone holder for the car.  And having several extra discs means if I change cases or if something happens to the disc I won’t need to buy again anytime soon.  The disc adheres easily and seems to be a solid grip and the price was right.
5,I love these inwill day they work better on the case than the actual phone itself. The magnets work so well that on one phone it didnhave a hard time sticking to the actual phone but after buying a case which I have tonhave one or I'll break the phone anyways. It jas worked great!! I love these and would recommend them for any phone
5,Seems to do what it's supposed to. I live in a very hot climate and still stuck to my phone and it gets real hot on the dash of my car.
5,It is exactly what it's supposed to be. It does what it's supposed to do. Good buy
3,I originally bought these when I switched phone cases and my old metal plates could not be removed from my old phone case.  However as others have said these are just way to thin to be of any use.  It simply could not stand up to the weight of my phone.  Since I had several left over and I lost my left eye in an unfortunate accident during a game of chess several years ago I decided to try these out to replace my eye patch.  To my surprise they worked pretty well.  I just had to put another hole in them which wasn't hard since the metal is so thin.  They are a little uncomfortable after a few hours but for a night out on the town they're pretty great!
4,Wish the platform was bigger so it could hold my phone more stable
5,These are just like the ones that came with my magnetic phone holder.
5,They do what they're supposed to do. It'd be harder to mess this up than do it right.
5,Great
4,Nothing to dislike really like how they come in big small round & square.
3,The metal plates are not the problem.  The adhesive claims to be strong but not so.  I had to put some super glue on the plate to get them to stay on my phone case. Once I did that everything worked as it supposed to.  If you have to use glue make sure you put the metal plate in the right place if your phone has wireless charging capabilities.  At the bottom is the best place.  Use either the circle or rectangle in a horizontal position at the bottom of the case if your phone has wireless charging.  I would recommend this product.  The adhesive will work by itself if you're putting the plate on a flat surface.  But some of the rugged cases seem to have some protrusions in their design so a little amount of super glue is required on top of the adhesive to get the metal plate to stay after taking phone off of magnetic holder.
5,These are great no complaints.
5,I was so glad to find out that I could order these magnets. I love them. I immediately put one on the back of my phone & was able to put it right on the holder. The magnets are really strong & hold my phone on the holder great.!  I had gotten a new phone & don't know what happened to the magnet that was on the old one. My new phone is a Samsung A20. It is bigger the the phone that I had but there is still no problem with it holding my phone. I live in a campground & we have roads that are full of potholes but even with the bumpy ride my phone does not fall off the dash. I would recommend this holder a lot. My daughter saw how easy it was & she was going to order one for her phone. I guess the 1st order was damaged somehow & I was really disappointed thinking I wasn't going to get my magnets but I got on line with Amazon & received the new order the very next day. Amazon has always been great at handling any problems that I have had. So thanks a lot Amazon for a job well done.!
5,Cellphones are updated cases have to be changed at least car attachments can be reused. This little magnet is easy to attach and it is strong enough to hold my phone to the vent magnet (which I didn’t have to replace).
5,I put this inside the phone case and it is really strong. Phone stays put.
5,Works with Mercury car phone holder and does not slip
5,Cheaper than most and work just fine
5,Im a big fan of magnetic phone mounts.  I use them in my car and all over my sailboat (that I live on).  I like them because I dont have to precisely position the phone for it to be held securly by the mount.The availability of this assortment of metal plates provides a very inexpensive way to avoid buying new mounts when I get a new phone or tablet.  The variety of sizes is nice because I also use magnetic phone mounts for things like TV remote controls.If none of the plates fill fit the flat surfaces on a TV remote I just take a pair of sissors and cut it to size.The 3m adhesive on these plates works very well but I have always been able to get the plats off of phones without damaging the finish on the phone.
5,Plates work great! Great addition to the dash on our motorhome!
5,I purchased this because I lost the original magnets to phone holder in my car.  I have a double layer phone case so I placed it on the the outer layer on the inside just in case I ever decide to do wireless charging I can easily take the case off.  The magnet itself is pretty strong and has stayed on its holder when I have gone over bumps and potholes I used the rectangle one. It fits well on my case.  Just make sure you place it exactly where you want it cause its extremely hard to get off to adjust it.  I like that it comes with multiple ones and sizes so if I ever change out cases I don't have to worry about attempting to remove the one I have on my current case.
5,Fits great into the back of my otterbox case and holds very well to my magnetic mount in the car.
5,It holds up the phone perfectly
5,These work great for phones and GPS devices to stick to automobile dashboard mounts.
5,No complaints works great you can’t really readjust it once laid down on the surface so be careful with the positioning
2,I have a Carmount hone mount in my car that I love. What I do NOT love is the price for Carmount's metal plates. Got a new phone and saw these as a good option.They're not.First I put it on inside my case and it would not hold to the mount at all. NOT sure whose fault that one is so I'll give them a pass. SO I decided to just take the phone out of the case to attach it. It stuck! And when I took my phone off the plate STAYED THERE!Is the Carmount magnet too strong? Or is the adhesive on the back of these too weak? Dunno - but I'm not attaching this thing to my phone with super glue. Guess I know why Carmount's stuff is so dang expensive.
5,My phone case have gems on the back which caused this not to stick properly. I then placed the piece between my case and phone which works perfectly without it sticking to my phone. No problem attaching to car magnet when driving.
5,it sticks very well to my phone and works very well.  No complain here.
4,Good
5,Works well
5,Fit my phone well. Sturdy.
5,I am happy with the product
5,It's a basic piece for an excellent price. It performs the function it was ment to perform well.
5,These work great I was even able to put it under my phone case and it still held the phone up on the charger in my car
5,plates to fit every phone and every application
4,My camper shell is a aluminum.  I used these for my magnetic curtain rods and for magnetic hooks to hang things!!  Perfect!  👍. As for the adhesive tape it worked for a little bit but would end up falling off later.  Had to apply a heavy duty adhesive silicone and that took care of the problem!
5,Muy practico
5,Does what they’re supposed to
5,I am using these on my personal phone and tablet for my work van. They are strong and hold up against bumps and other movement. And allow me to set my device on any magnetized surface for hands free viewing while I work.
5,Magnetic it amazing for my phone case
5,I use these with a magnet in my patrol vehicle. Very sturdy and they easily attach.
5,Great magnets keeps my phone attached to my dash phone holder even on the bumpiest of roads
5,Great value for the money.
5,The replacement packet is well priced and gave me options for several phones. Super convenient that worked beautifully! Also the adhesive is form and smooth. Lastly it’s super easy to install.
5,They do what supposed to do! Affordable and easy to apply. The adhesion is great best I have experienced for the category of product.
5,Everything except quality of adhesive.  Magnet slide to a different angle when applied to back of phone casing under plastic cover.
3,These plates attach great to my magnetic mount.  The problem is that the adhesive is not strong enough to hold my device.  The device ways less than my iPhone 11.  So it's not that it's very heavy.  I would certainly be leery about using it on a device that I don't want to fall off all the time and possibly get broken.I will try to remove the existing adhesive and use something better.
5,Works well with my phone. Added glue for adhesive strength.
5,They work great. I doubled them up and now my phone will stay on my magnetic dash phone holder. No more wildly launching phone while driving. Yay!
5,I love that there are multiples
5,Holds in place very well. Low profile (thin). And so it doesn't catch or drag on clothing like taking in and out of pockets. Matches up well with my magnetic cell phone car holder.
5,Perfect
5,It was easy to order easy toInstall
5,I can’t really be begin believe that actually works and they’re awesome product
5,Works great!
5,Great price for selection of magnets
5,Easy to use. Just what I was looking for. Also great price. Thank you!
5,I use these on all my cases. They are very strong. Phone doesn't fall off even when breaking hard.
2,My phone is not very stable on the holder with these plates.
5,Works good. I drive down rough bumpy roads all day. Stays in place. Good product.
5,These are metal pieces w great adhesive.
5,They are big enough
5,GREAT FOR INSTALLING ON A NEW PHONE
5,Works great! Will buy more when I run out!
4,Bought these because i accidently threw out the metal plate that came with my mount.Let me tell you this thing is stuck on my phone case tighter than the trapped souls of the 7th layer of the under world. Accidently put  it on crooked tried to pry it off to straighten it but that adhesive is stuck to my phone better than my attachment to emotionally unavailable guys. Kudos to you adhesive makers finally something that'll be with me for the rest of my life. And i have an extra 7 to use later on. Worth it.
4,When it's hot outside and the car hasn't cooled off yet the adhesive moves the magnet on the case leaving sticky residue marks averywhere
5,These are awesome little products that love using especially for when I'm driving I don't have to worry about using the phone for the magnet and they're perfect size or a big or smaller phone and it goes right on which is very nice and if it's perfectly if you have a case can put it inside the case instead of being on your phone the other thing I love about it is that you have a good portion of them six of them so if you lose one you have spare or if someone else you know he's one you can give one
5,These worked great for what I wanted them for! I would totally buy again!
5,Bought a used car that had the magnetic post to attach a cellphone but had no metal plate for my phone to attach it to the post. So glad Amazon had a package of the metal plates! Adhesion is great and works well!I couldn't find a brick & mortar store that sells the metal plates alone. Would have to buy the whole set of magnetic post & plate. And this price was right.
5,These metal plates are better than the originals I was going to by a new base for my car when i cam across these  i have an old LG V20 and with the case makes it heavy and bulky. With the original that came with the base it would not even hold it up. The new ones are great it holds it steady i use the LG for music in the car took a road trip up to Sacramento up I-80 all the bumps dips and twist did not make it fall off the base. And it takes no effort to romove from the base and i used the smallest plat that came in the pack.
5,A+
5,Easy to apply and it holding strength is great
5,It’s a piece of metal with adhesive on it pretty idiot proof…maybe not so here’s a lame review. Works as expected peel off the label and stick it to whatever you want to use a magnet to hold it. It’s amazing rewrites reality the laws of physics no longer exist in this version of the multi-verse.
5,I like these magnets I put one on my phone and in my car they're very sturdy
5,Needed more plate since my wife and I both use the vehicle. These works great!
5,when it gets hot outside it will make the small ones lose its stickiness the bigger ones have a better stick on the the back of the phone
4,The magnetic sticks onto the magnet on my car great but it didn’t adhere onto my silicon phone protector well. So I super glued it which has done the trick.
3,The magnet works as intended however now I can't use my cordless charger for the phone because of it.
5,Great for using on cell phones and car magnetic products.
5,Product is great works wonders… but I have a word of advice…IF YOU STLL WANT WIRELESS CHARGING USE THE SMALL CIRCLE PADS NOT THE LARGER SQUARE ONES.The product blocks any form of wireless charging. So before buying think of where you are going to put the metal strips so it doesn’t block the charging coils for wireless charging!Other then my mistake great product! 10/10 Would recommend!!!
5,I bought these for a magnetic phone mount I have they dont damage the phone or cause interference but I'd recommend you apply it to your phone directly then use a case!
5,None
5,Love how many come in a pack! Good price
5,Worked great
4,Bought these for phone case. Magnetic connection works great in my car an Semi holders !
3,Wouldn’t buy again. I tried them on two separate phones and each time the adhesive didn’t hold and the plate slowly slid down my phone over the course of a few days. Had to use goo gone to remove the adhesive.
5,They attach to my phone case as they should.My phone is sturdy and does not fall ever
5,I have been using these for a few years now and they do seem to work well no issues at all. I got a new case so I needed a new magnetic plate. My only complaint would be the ugly hole punch in every plate. Regardless for the cost these are a good value.
3,Apparently the thickness of the plates matters. These seem to be particularly thin. Even when I double-plated the magnet couldn't hold my phone in place.I'll be trying a thicker plate.
5,I put a couple on the inside of my smartphone case and it stays on my magnetic phone holder in my car. Hasn't fallen once.
5,Quality and pricing.
4,Only downside is its impossible to take off. DON'T ATTACH IT TO ANYTHING YOU PLAN ON REMOVING. I attached it to my phone and regret it but I can't remove it. I was hoping to re-attach it to my phone case but no luck removing.I use it every day though and it serves its purpose really well. The magnet is the perfect snap click.
5,I'm always changing phone cases so I needed a supply of these since all I use are magnetic holders. These have great adhesion and will not come off easily so make sure you are happy with the pacing. Install is super simple clean the areas where you will adhere peel and stick. My only issue is the thickness of the metal. It will easily bend and if you attempt to remove it after it's adhered it will bend and deform.
4,I have to replace my pad every summer.  These are great for your phone to mount on your magnetic dash holder.  My only complaint is that during the summer when it gets rather hot the glue gives out and the phone goes  tumbling to the car floor.  So I have to replace it every summer.  In extreme heat it does not hold. The glue melts.
5,Para el teléfono muy bueno
5,A couple years ago I bought the car magnet setup for my phone GPS use. When I switched phones I removed the metal plate from my old  phone case and tried to reapply to my new one. Never could get it to stay on after that and tried using various kinds of super glue but to no avail. I ended up putting the metal plate inside my phone case loosely and it would hold on the magnet but would always slide off.I bought the replacement metal pieces and each metal plate has it's own 3M double-sided sticky tape which will be great if/when I get a different phone case so I don't have to worry about trying to reuse the old plate. For me it's about convenience. I have the iphone XR and it holds very securely! On top of that it even delivered on a Sunday after ordering on Friday... Very satisfied!
5,Pleased with the adhesion made well & just what I needed!
5,I use a magnetic holder in the car that came with a single metal connection plate. When I bought a new phone I had to get a new case to match and the old plate couldn't be removed with ruining it. My wife suggested that replacement plates were available and my search yield this kit. I was very surpised at the number and quality of plates at this price. I was able to put plates on 2 cases (one for everyday and a heavy duty case for outdoors) and still have some if I need to make a future case change. I would highly recommend.
5,Got this for my galaxy s10+ to use in conjunction with a magnetic car mount. The magnets are very easy to apply and have strong adhesion. I have rhe magnet on the back of the phone and Otterbox case on top of the magnet & the magnet sticks to the mount without any issues. Be careful putting it on...it won't come off easily. It never falls off the phone mount. Love this!
5,Works exactly like it's supported to. I wasn't sure of how well it was going to work but it worked wonderfully. Everything stuck very well. My wireless charger doesn't work any longer while the metal plate is there. I have no idea if my wireless charger is weak so that's why it doesn't work. Or if all wireless charger don't work with this product.
5,Sturdy and looks great
5,Easy to use. The adhesion is great. (I put one on the back of my phone case to magnetize it to car mount.)I definitely have plenty left over for other uses and spent a lot less than had I bought just one.
5,Magnifico product
5,Great product works as it should holding my phone on the mount in my car with no issues.
4,worked great
5,Works great!
5,Omg this works better than I thought!!!!!!! It’s really good and sturdy I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it. I’m not even joking I thought they weren’t going to be as good as they are
4,Perform the job as desired. Easy to use
4,There was nothing wrong with them beside being shorted one. Received only 3 rectangle pieces instead of the 4.
5,Easy to install.  Works well.  Multiple magnets provided to choose precisely what you need.  Great value.
5,It's light thin and stick well.  I'm using on on my phone to stick to magnetic stick in my car so I can see my GPS.  I also am using it to hold a magnetic dry erase marker to my calendar board.  It's clean and hold the marker well so I don't drop and lose it.Great purchase!
5,Just as described.  Would recommend.  By with confidence.
5,Should have bought these to begin with. Works excellent
5,These came in a simple plastic bag and all items were there and damage free.I bought these because I had misplaced the magnet that I stick to my phone for my magnetized car phone holder and these were a perfect replacement. I'm sure I will find use for the other magnets that come with it eventually to.5 stars across the board.
2,The sticky didn't last very long at all.
5,Perfect adhesion for my phone. Only needed one piece but the others may come in handy in the future.
4,I use for back of cell phone for magic mounts. I have them all over and find that only with the larger mounts can I be comfortable with vibration and bumping. Rough road in my truck as an instance. I also use where I can counter mount to a Neodymium magnet on the other side for the mounting surface. Office  desk tool bench  and on
4,Good variety. Works well enough. The hole doesn't make sense.
5,I needed them once I got a new phone. It work perfectly!
5,This product is amazing! I was super supised! The adhesive is super strong. Idk why they give you so many bc the one that I used has not budge & I don't think it will but I guess it's handy to have the others just in case. Highly highly recommend!!!
5,Good value. The only thing I can mention is that the first plate fell off after a month. To be fair though I don't know if it was the adhesive or that the person who's phone it's attached to is rough on his phone. Could go either way. I'll update if the 2nd one falls off quickly.
3,This did not stick well and did not good my phone even on just turns on my car. Disappointed in this product.
5,These work great on my mount.
5,I needed something for my phone to attach to my magnetic phone mount in my car. The magnets are relatively strong even through the back of my phone with the case on it. My phone is the Samsung Galaxy A30 with a softshell TPU case. When attached to my mount it does not move around or slide off so I'm very happy with that. I'm not sure how it fares with other material types other than TPU but it works for me. I would buy again.
5,These are really great on all my phone cases and hold up great on every type of rd that I am on
3,I have a Samsung 21 Ultra and the magnet is not strong enough to hold the weight of the phone.  It slides off slowly.
4,I got 4 square magnets and three round ones. Other than that I'm very satisfied with the product.
5,I bought these because I have magnetic phone holder in my car. I just slide the metal piece behind my phone case so the adhesive doesn’t ruin my phone or case incase I would want to take it off someday. They are super thin and don’t make my case bulge at all. A lot of pieces for the price too. Can’t go wrong!
4,Very niceee
4,I wish the magnet was just a pinch stronger.  It did the trick.  I needed a magnet to add to my pop socket to stick to the car phone holder on my dash.
5,Super nice
5,The magnet works very well. I’m so grateful that it has such a strong attraction to my dash magnet. It makes using my GPS a pleasure. It is also very convenient for when I am choosing music to play from my phone to not have to hold the phone while I am driving.
5,These were in with another order on the bottom of the boxalmost missed it. They are strong and easy to put on. Gave a couple to my daughter. She likes it as well. Holds good on my car holder without it falling off. And we have some real bumpy roads. Very happy with them.
5,So far I like how they're working. Very secure.
5,Great
5,Works great
5,The adhesion is not enough for me but with epoxy these are a dream.  So easy and convenient to get directions while driving now
3,What can you say they need a little super glue or they're not going to really stay on the back of a phone or phone case. Put them inside the case doesn't work so you have to glue them to the outside where it actually makes contact with the mounting magnet. Get a little super glue and your good to go.
4,They work fine. I bought phone cases for my wife and I that had a cut out to fit a metal plate so that I didn't have to stick this onto the outside of the case. Therefore I can't really speak to the adhesion. The magnet that I use in the car sticks to this plate perfectly through the case though.
4,Sticks good
5,They are metal. They have a super strong adhesion. Be absolutely sure you know where you want to place it before you do since they are damn near impossible to remove without adhesive remover and fishing wire. I cannot pry them off with my fingers or with a flathead screwdriver. Overall not bad. I mounted them on the case around my 2020 iPad Pro and they are hold up perfectly fine.
5,Really good quality
5,Purchased these because we needed more adhesive stickers for the cell phone vent mounts in our cars. Every time you change your phone cover you need to replace the sticker - so something to keep in mind & great idea to keep a few extra on hand.
5,Love love love!!!!
5,Love these replacement metal plates for phone cases to attach to magnetic phone holders in your vehicle!!You get 8 of them with 3M adhesive stickers...4 large rectangles and 4 circles so you have plenty to use on multiple devices. Easy to use!
5,Used these on all my family’s phones. Works well
3,Perfect
5,Great gifts
2,Used to hold phone to magnetic window mount. Only held for a week and then started falling off the back of the phone. Very thin. I will go back to better quality that have lasted for more than a year and throw these away!
5,Sometimes you need more plates for a secondary phone case a secondary phone or maybe a different way of holding the device so you can use other features. This inexpensive set of plates gives you the ability to have option for a very low price.
5,Liked product very much.  Used for mounting IPhone.
3,Seems like a good value but overtime the stickyNess allows the metal plate to slowly slide exposing the stickiness which gets all over everything. It’s weird because another brand I use doesn’t do it but it’s the same 3M sticky. Or at least it’s labeled as such. I may have had a bad batch. I’m not worried about it just sharing my experience.
5,AMAZING! Make sure you place it where you want THE FIRST TIME because the adhesive is GREAT! Once put on its next to impossible to get off (I had to use tweezers to get under it and then a knife to get it off so I could move it to another spot on my phone...hot water on a paper towel with A LOT of scrubbing got the adhesive residue off after about 5-10 minutes). However it is an awesome product and I highly recommend it to everyone looking for a way to use your phone hand’s free in the car!
5,Added the magnetic circles and squares to various cases works just fine! Reasonably priced great stick.
5,Because there were different sizes I could use these magnet backs for my cell phone  & my gps.  Whe I change cell phone cases I have backups now to change the magnets.  I only got 1 magnet with a cell phone holder for my car so I needed these extra.  I also used them on my daughter's phones so they can also use the phone holder in my car.
3,Was not strong enough to work inside my case then would not adhere well enough to the outside of my phone.  It kept getting stuck on magnet part and letting go of my phone. I cleaned with rubbing alcohol and tried with the larger rectangle again on the outside of my phone waited over an hour to make sure it would stick then continued to do the same stick to the magnet/ let go of my phone.
2,I got a used OnePlus 7 PRO for both my wife and I...with Armor-X cases. The case has an option for a magnet and it works great when I hang my phone on the metal monitor stand post. When I tried it on the metal plates in the Universal Metal Plate set it is no way for it to stick to the metal. It is just too thin. I first gave it a three-star but thought a two-star was more appropriate..
5,Works good
5,My phone died so I neede new one. I had to replace the plate. Works great.
5,This work great and cost great 👍
2,The adhesion is horrible. Just the heat from the sun would soften up the adhesive and my phone would fall to the floor. Also half of the magnets I received were bent so they weren't able to be used.
5,I have it just sitting inside my phone case without the adhesive back peeled and it holds in place just fine.
1,They advertise these as magnets. They aren’t! It’s just a metal plate that won’t even stick to the back of my phone. Crappy product and even crappier seller.
5,It works with magnetic GPS holder
5,Stuck it to the back of my iPhone case and it works really well on the car mount magnet that we got from iHome. I would recommend this for sure. Easy to install and is stuck on pretty well.
5,Easy to use on and car install magnet
5,Have it inside my phone case which is thin Spigen and holding on my car mount just fine
5,these things are so damn strong (adhesion wise) so you dont need to worry about it coming off! i use it for magnetizing my phone to my phone holder in my car works great and doesnt fall off even when i hit bumps.
5,works great
5,It worked perfectly on the back of my cell phone!
5,These are a great idea and are the perfect size for the space I have on my dash dedicated for a phone. The problem lies with fluctuations in temperatures cause the adhesive to unstick after a short period of time.i solved the problem by bonding the magnetic strip to my phone case with permanent glue as not to harm my phone and it sticks to a mount attached to the air vent.
4,I bought to put in between my case for a snap on magnet to keep my phone on my dashboard. Works well for me but I didn’t use the adhesive so I can’t speak to that.
5,8 metal plates (4 round 4 rectangle) with adhesive for sticking to phone
5,i purchase this once before and gave some to my coworkers and when I purchase a new cellphone it was hard to remove the old one to place it in the new one. the adhesive was so strong. so instead I purchased more. I will continue to purchase more it needed because it works extremely strong to hold my iphone 7 plus. thank you
5,Love them they are so easy to install..I put them on the inside of my phone case...so I can take of my case so I can use my wireless charger..cuz I won't with the metal plates.
2,Se dobla y se despega con facilidad. Cumple su función pero no es un producto duradero
5,My concern was that they would be too thick to use with my phone case.  Fortunately they fit just fine in my phone case for my phone and my spouse's phone.  Sticks well too.  Just remember to clean the phone well in the place you put it.
4,Works well for cell phone adhesion to car mount.
3,At first the product met expectations. However as time went on it seemed to lose its adhesion. I’m not sure if this was due to the weight of the phone or glue on plate lost it’s adhesion but the plate started to slip up my phone case leaving behind a sticky mess. I used one of the circle plates and now will try a larger square plate.
5,They are exactly as described in the listing. They arrived quickly and easily installed on the inside of my phone case. I chose one of the rectangular plates for my phone. It's more secure now than when it had the original plate installed.
5,Came fast and worked great!
5,i’ve brought multiple phone cases and add a magnet on each case to fit on my car mount. it says on the phone forever. i’ve had one on a phone case for approximately 10 months. i highly recommend it!
5,Keeps my phone completely secure
5,I honestly love it my only thing is I wouldn’t recommend sticking it directly on your phone as it doesn’t quite seem to hold up well. But if you stick it on your case like I have it holds up!! It’s been 2 months now and it has not moved or fallen off from my plastic case.
5,Got these to replace old ones I had previously applied on my phone. Worked perfectly with my existing magnetized car mounts. Very strong and very easy application. Thanks! Great value for 8 of them!
3,Only gave it three starts because I feel like the plate makes my phone really hot. Otherwise nice product. Get price for several magnets.
5,East to stick onto the phone case  doesn’t fall off.
5,Super easy install and work like a charm!! 100% recommend this product!!
2,I had bought this to hold my phone on my car's dash (at about a 30-45 degree angle) and it simply wasn't enough for my iPhone 11 and a thin clear case. I even tried doubling up the magnets on the phone side and it would still slide off after ~30 seconds.
3,They are convenient however I’ve had many fall off
4,It’s good
4,Works as described
4,These have worked well on smooth surfaces but my backup camera monitor has ribs on the back and they did not hold well.
2,The small plastic bag they came was opened I got 4 ONLY and I believe they fell out of the box packed in I was disappointed because I needed all of the ones I ordered
5,I have several devices I use in cars and this allows me easy and quick placement on a magnetic holder! it's non-intrusive and I forget they are even on the back of my devices until I need them! The durability is top notch I don't even think i could pry it off if I wanted too! I will always have one of these on the back of my phone!
5,Glue on back is super strong has never fallen. I change phone cases a lot so this is fantastic!
5,Thanks love it....
5,Good adhesive. Scared it will damage my Samsung case that has microbial defenses built in.  Strong magnet area to adhere too round and rectangular
4,Very strong magnetic
4,For the price I was very happy with it. I feel as though that it doesn't stick to my magnet for car mount as well. It may be because it's thinner than the one my car mount came with. But overall great product!
5,Worked well with the magnet mount in my car great adhesion and thin enough to fit on the inside of my phone case. Forewarning: these will not come off of whatever you stick it on easily.
5,Need a bigger magnet and I found it.Good for the many. Good adhesion. Easy to install.
5,nice
5,as advertised
5,Several different size plates with adhesive backing. Easy to attach anywhere. Great for magnetic lights or other items.
5,The adhesive back did not stick good on a phone case.
5,Great size and very durable. So easy to use. Would highly recomend this product.
3,The adhesive these have on them does not stick very well. Stayed put for a couple weeks then began slowly sliding away from where it was originally stuck. I wound up scraping off the tape and using E6000 glue instead and has held great for a month with no issue.
5,Works just good as the one that came with the original
5,Really sticks to phone great size great quality and I have some for all my phone cases and to share with others.
5,Love them.
3,These were not as strongly attracted to my magnetic mount as the plates that came with it. So my phone slips around a bit and doesnt stay fixed where I placed it.
3,Purchased to hold my phone to the phone holder in the car.Disappointed because it didn’t stay attached to my phone long magnet was strong enough the phone would slip off.
5,These things do not stick very well. Disappointed in them. My phone falls all the time. Too bad.
4,Use for attaching to a metal surface or inside of the car dashboard.
5,So easy to use! Extremely strong adhesion keeps my humongous LG Stylo phone secure on its magnetic perch in the car.
2,Since the outerbrubber around of the Otter defender cases becomes loose over time I have to replace these cases every 6 months or so just to obtain a new outer rubber part of the cas.  I needed a new magnet so I can continue to use my cars phone holder & this item is very economically priced .  The magnet is not as strong as the original magnet that came with the car phone holder kit but it still does the job.  I'll update if anything changes..UPDATE  after using this for a few days I've found that the magnet is very weak & my phone is Falling constantly...look elsewhere..not the strongest magnet
5,Super easy and works well
5,These are great I buy them now for all my phone cases. They stick strong easy to remove with a piece of dental floss. Work with any magnet receiver for the car/wall/ etc.
5,Thank you! Received quickly and a great product
5,It’s perfect and super strong!!!
5,THIS LITTLE THING WORK FOR ME VERY WELL ... I HAVE TWO PHONE AND NEED TO USE THIS ALL TIME AT THE CAR MOUNT... I BUY THIS ALL TIMES WHEN I REPLACE MY PHONE... DANG..BUT GOOD THING YOU GUYS HAVE ITTHANKS
5,Great adhesion. They stick so well you have to just use another one if you put it on the wrong thing or put it on in the wrong place. They never lose their stick and work with any car magnet holder.
5,This product is surely worth it.
5,They work great
5,Good size selection.
5,The adhesion is great and yes it was easy to install and it is not too thick. Case to the phone fits just fine.
5,Fácil de instalar. Bien producto
4,Reused for car magnet to hold cell
5,I’ve only used a few but they do the job!
1,The magnetic was bigger than expected and the adhesive on the sticky pads is not strong.
5,New phone.  Works perfect withScosche Magnetic Dash Mount
5,Good product and fast service
5,They worked as intended. They were not to thin and they fit on my phone just fine almost permanently.
5,Works great
5,The magnet that came with my dash mount would not hold my phone securely. I have a galaxy S9 and I put the magnet between a thin case and the phone. These plates solved that problem for me with the same mount. Been going strong for 6 months. My phone fell once after a series of bad pot holes but otherwise these have been solid.
5,2 sizes and shapes. Round and rectangular. Works great. Used as a replacement to the original magnetic holder.
5,Works very well. Different sizes as needed. Use on my phone with case to magnetic phone holder for truck.
5,Strong and easy to apply!! I have never had an issue with these.
5,Works well with my cell phone case and car mount.
3,It's a thin piece of metal with adhesive. Wireless charging won't work with this product.
4,the rectangular ones work well. But the circular ones fell off even when I put 2 next to each other for more surface areas.
3,Nice
5,works for my needs
5,It was very easy to install and connects very well to the magnetic holder I have to my car.
5,Easy to install you get a lot of pieces for the money - great value. Works perfectly!
5,They work great.
5,It sticks and holds
5,The adhesive on the back on the magnet didn't want to stay on my phone.. Within minutes of me putting my phone to the mount my phone would fall..
5,Works as expected
1,There is no magnet in any of these stick ons  I understood they were magnets but not.  BE AWARE of this.
4,4 of us use the same car we all have different phones and none stay on they especially fall in floor boards when you turn
3,Thanks
5,Strong and stick well
4,Like the product  they should let customers who have wireless charging the exact location of where to position the disc or plate on the phone to avoid disruption of charging.  That is why smaller plates and circles are needed.  Otherwise great value.
4,👍🏼
4,Lots of great magnets
5,Cheap and gets the job done. No need to say more!
5,This is a great add-on for any device you attaching to another surface.The magnets are thin and extremely strong.
3,Phone will fall off magnet adaptor if its placed on phone case
5,I have a magnetic phone holder that clips to  my vent. Eventually the glue on the metal plates fail and the plate falls off the phone. It was nice to be able to buy replacements without having to pay for a new vent piece.
4,great for my phone and mounted it to my car dash
5,The phone nows does not slip in its Nato mount
5,Got a new phone case these worked perfect and now I have backups. Makes it easy to pop your phone on to magnetic surfaces
3,Nice disk size but the adhesive is horrible
5,Excellent
3,Not only was the adhesive not strong enough to stay on for long but the magnet is not anywhere as strong as the one that came with my dashboard phone holder.
5,Happy
4,They work just fine.
5,Work as expected
5,They stay on strong and good.
4,These are just thin steel sheets with a thin adhesive on the back they work well and are thinner than others I have used.  They have a hole in them because they are actually a re-purposed product (its a steel tag) but it works well so I don't really care.
5,I enjoy these products but I also do not stick them to my phone.
5,This is very thin piece of metal. I used the square one. It sticks to the magnet already install in my truck. Works very well.
5,Works great put one on the inside and outside of my otterbox for Galaxy S20+ with a VAVA mount on the dash. Never fallen off
5,Was exactly what we needed. Bought a new magnetic cell phone holder and it only came with one plate and we have several cell phones we use. This came with many different sizes of plates to make finding the right one easier
5,Comes with multiple magnets. Perfect adhesion. Gets the job done. I don’t ever for see needing to buy another package because it comes with many but If i lost them i would buy more.
5,Easy to applyGood
5,Works great
5,Works well. I needed new metal inserts since I replace my iPhone 8 case and the old one didn't stick as well. These adhere very well and get the job done. I'm currently using one of the round inserts and doesn't interfere with my rapid wireless charger. Good product.
5,I had a smaller magnet and a larger one. The small one wouldn't hold the phone in place and the large one interfered so I couldn't wireless charge my phone. I got these for the circular one and it's perfect. Holds to magnet and I can still wireless charge my Samsung phone. I have a silicone phone case and I have the magnet between the phone and case (inside). Nothing sticking to the outside of my case.
5,Great product easy to use highly recommend.
5,Needed a new magnet for a case I purchased then this will do. Very strong
5,This metal plates are very handy for anything magnetic.  I use not only for my cell phone but also to attached magnetic smart buttons on the wall to control lights that have inconvenient switch locations.
5,Happy to find these on Amazon! Needed  due to new phones. Very easy to apply and adhesive really sticks. Highly recommend!
5,Comes in a couple of sizes  Even holds a heavier Samsung with the case
5,Justo como se ve en la foto y muy de instalar
5,This item works great with my phone and magnet phone holder
5,they do what there in tended for didnt have to add any other a adhesive or anything so great for the moneyget it if you need your phone to stick to one of the magnetic car things.
5,These little magnets are awesome. They stick extremely well .
5,Well packaged got here fast. I put the magnet inside my phone case. The magnet sticks very well. It sticks exactly like the original. Thank you. Will order from this seller again in the future.
5,Perfect for what I needed it for.
5,All good
5,muyyy bueno
5,Needed new magnets for my phone due to an upgrade and these did the job and price was good.
5,Works as described
3,Glue is no good metal plate falls off all the time
5,Good product has worked great in my vehicle
5,Needed new plates when switched cases.  These work well.  Adhesive holds great.  different sizes are great for different size cases.  No issues.
5,Works perfect and provides a strong mount for phone.
5,Works perfectly
5,Became a "must have" when I got a new phone and realized I need things streaming when I drive.
5,Won’t have to worry about changing mg phone case again.
5,Love it thank you!!!!!
5,Loved the product like usual you guys took it to the next level.Thank You
5,I already had the mount but had attached its original plates to a previous phone case. It holds tight to the magnet and the adhesive works well.
5,It works tried it once
5,I was looking only for the magnetic stickers and these are really good for their price. Sticks good and holds my phone the same as the one for 10$.
5,If you need a magnet for the back of your phone then this is what you need.  I can also use my Wireless Charger with one of these magnets attached to the back of my phone.
5,Very easy to use great price!
5,Works exactly as described holds my phone to the mount. only downside is I have to take the case off to charge my phone wirelessly since the metal plate messed with the charging
5,Different sizes are perfect because I have an iPhone X and my husband has an XR with an otter box case so his phone is much larger than mine.
5,Had one for many years needed a replacement when I changed phones. Work exactly like you'd expect. Some people seemed upset that it's not an actual magnet just a self adhesive sheet of metal
4,The plates all had 3m adhesive on them except for one that arrived without any adhesive and that is what took the star away.
4,5 stars if they didn't have that hole in them.
5,Works great! Needed a replacement magnet for my new phone case.
5,Real good.  Replaced a plate I got with a car magnet set that was attached to my old case (got a different phone).  The multi-choice in this group is nice.  Sticks to new case perfectly.
5,Used rectangular one Works much better than my original circle one.
5,They do what they are supposed to do.
5,I use these magnets on my phone case so I can put it on my magnetic holder in my car.  Very secure.
5,Great quality and works like a charm! Easy to use.
3,Not as strong a magnet as I thought
5,Great price. Great product. Point blank period.
4,goodgoodgoodgoodgood
5,Comes with a good number of pieces in multiple sizes
3,The adhesive is terrible fell off my phone after a day
5,Great
5,Highly recommend. I bought these to use on my new phone so I could still use my magnetic mount in the car. The plates were easy to put on and the adhesive is strong. They are super thin so it doesn't interfere with my phone case at all.
5,Works great easy to use
5,very good
5,And so many options.  The great thing is that 2 people could use each type.  It works great with the phone mount in my car.
5,nothing wrong
5,Just what I needed to make my phone stick to a magnet.
5,None
5,Bought new phone. Needed these for the phone mount in my car. Works great
5,Works even better than thought for this price. Id purchase again
5,It fit perfect and there's a lot in a pack.
5,What can I say about adhesive backed metal plates? They attach well to magnetic gimmicks. Good stuff.
5,Applied top protective case of phone. magnetic grip is great. Eau to apply.
5,exactly what it says worked perfect
5,It was sent. I found it
5,As described. Thin and durable. Placed inside case for a Samsung Galaxy S20
5,Great adhesion even with a textured case.
3,The package was to have 8 pieces but only had 7.  That was disappointing to say the least.  That’s why the overall rating is 3 stars. The ones I did receive seem to be as advertised.
2,The two main problems I have with these are 1) the adhesive and 2) the thickness. First the adhesive on the back doesn't hold up at all. It came off on the first use. I ended up removing the adhesive and using gorilla glue. Problem solved. The second issue was the thickness of the metal. While the magnet works with these plates the metal is just too thin. I ended up having to put a second one on top of the first. Unfortunately the adhesive didn't hold this one on either so I had to glue it myself. All seems to be working now but I recommend going with a different product since there are a ton of different options on Amazon.
5,Love this works well with my NiteIze mount. Stuck on my otterbox without issue.
5,right size for using magnetic car dash post; holds securely without failure; great purchase
5,It’s very good I use it for phone
5,I use these backing plates with my work and personal phones. The bigger plates seem to get the thicker cases to stick to the magnet mount better.
5,No complaints good and works as intended.
5,Not thick but the magnet is still strong.
5,Fast shipping well packed exactly as advertised.
5,I love it
5,Works as stated.
5,I bought these to adhere to an item that had been transferred from one place to another. They attached well and now item is usable again. Just like new!
4,works as advertised!
5,Sticks well
5,Great item!
5,love it
1,Not very good quality comes with zero positive magnet. So I'm still with a phone that can't magnetize
5,Easy to use great magnet
5,Very durable product. The adhesive is strong and does not give way. I'm a construction worker so durability and great quality are 2 things I demand. Plus there's plenty in the package. It's still winter so those summer heat waves will provide a true test on the adhesive. I intend to update.
5,Item is exactly as described and is better then original. Only issue was Amazon delivering a day late.
5,Perfect sizes
5,Great product
5,I have used these in three different phones. All of them work great! Can't complain at all!
5,I really like this product the adhesion is strong and won’t come of when detaching phone from mount. I bought these as replacements for the ones that came with the magnet mount as I switched phones and the previous ones wouldn’t re-attach to my new phone case
5,Works great fast delivery.  Thank you!!!
5,Perfect! I had tried gluing the original piece to no avail  This worked perfectly! I can now use my phone as a gps again with several pieces to spare
5,the strongest magnet so slim that you will ever own.....buy them
5,They work great
5,These metal plates do as they should and the tape is 3M brand so they should stay stuck.
5,Ok
5,It did the job
5,order these so that wife and I could use them with my phone mount no matter who was in the car
5,Easy to adhere to my phone.  Works well!
5,Item as described
5,On back of phone case to use in car air vent phone holder!
5,A drop of super glue works wonders for adhesion long term
5,I was looking for big and strong magnets and this is definitely good for mealso so many magnets in the set
5,Stuck it on the back of my spigen iphone 7 case.  3M tape holds well and I'm pretty sure it won't ever fall off .
5,I Have been Using these Magnets ..For over 5 years...Very Reliable
5,Love how thin and strong these magnets are !
2,These plates are very thin and require a very strong magnet to hold anything of any weight. I have a small flashlight and round metal spice capsules that both slipped off.
5,Easy to install
5,Easy to install. Perfect fit.
5,So these magnets are super strong and great for multiple phones and devices. They stay on and have good magnetic force Also a great price.
5,Goes on easily and holds strong.
5,Exactly what we needed to use multiple phones with existing mount.
5,They work great
5,So so good! It’s perfect for my phone mount. My phone stays in place and doesn’t move. 10/10 recommend.
3,good
5,Exactly as advertised
5,Good quality product .. good value for the money
5,Works great on my phone case...
5,Great phone magnets. Easy to apply and actually stays to my car mount.
5,Worked like it should. Good grip.
5,Slim and strong good variety of sizes.
5,Just what I needed so I can have one on each phone case.
5,Great product
4,It works great
5,These are exactly as described! I love them they work perfectly for what you would think. I put mine in the inside of my iPhone case and I use the with the magnet in my car every day they are durable and they last forever!
5,it works
5,As described exactly what I was looking for!
4,Worked good and strong adhesion.
5,Me encanto
5,Perfect what i wanted
4,Good amount but would have liked a few smaller and a few larger in the pack.
5,a+++ super
5,Perfect for my needs
3,The round one's are great.  The others do not have enough glue on them the keep coming off the whole thing needs glue on it not just a circle of glue.
1,I used all the magnets in the pack over the course of a week. Every single one came off my phone in a matter of day(s). I cleaned the phone first too and nothing seems to help them stick. Horrible and a waste of money
4,This magnet is super strong and holds my phone up to the car magnet I have never well. 10/10 recommend
5,Strong glue and good quality!
5,These work great. I do find the rectangular ones to be a tad large and take up alot of space on your case. They do stick well and the magnetic function works very well.
5,Worked well  Reasonable price
5,So happy to have found these on the websiteI thought i would need to buy the whole new phone vent holder
5,I like the rectangle shape.  Covers more space and is perfect for keeping my phone secure on the magnetic base.
5,Works awesome
3,Thickness is almost paper thin. 5 of the 8 plate got bent almost 90 degree.
1,1 star is for it's compatibility with other mounts but the actual magnet doesn't stick to my phone. I had it on for less than 24 hours and my phone fell off while the magnet stayed on the mount.
5,Works as intended. Although that may vary by what type of magnetic mount one has
5,As described and fast shipping
1,Bought this to go on a new phone case to work with a magnetic car mount and the glue does not hold the magnet in place under even the smallest amount of weight or stress. Seemed good the first time I used it but after only about a day the magnet started sliding up the phone. Basically it was snailing it up my phone case leaving a nasty trail of glue behind. Kept getting worse and worse until finally after a couple more days I just took the thing off and had to scrub the case with goo gone for a while to get all the adhesive off. Waste of money wouldn't recommend.
5,Easy to install!! And you get allot of them for the price!!
5,It works
5,N/A
5,Product was as described and shipped without a hassle. Would highly recommend!
2,Adhesion is horrible to my speck case. I’ve had issues with stuff sticking in the past but I’m surprised it takes less than a week for these ones to be slowly sliding up my case and leaving behind glue. I am unsure if these stick to other cases but they didnt for mine.
5,Worked for my phone even through the case
5,Good
5,Easy to install.
5,I liked the size and the strong magnet.
5,Goid produ t. Good deal
5,Everything. Worked perfectly!
5,Works well for the most part it serves its purpose
5,Works & sticks really well! I have a phone case that makes it hard for metal plates to stick but this one stays stuck perfectly!Would definitely purchase again
5,Work great
5,Work great and are the perfect dimensions.I personally have commitment issues so I don't stick these to anything but they fit just fine in the space between my phone and case and don't move.
2,They are strong magnets but dont stick to back of phone. After a few days magnets fall off .
5,great product
5,😃😃😃
5,Work.
1,I ordered these for my husband & I after getting a new phones and cases. The old magnets that came with our car mount were awesome....they lasted for years. My husbands magnet wouldn’t even stick to his case and mine lasted maybe 2 weeks before sliding off and practically ruining my phone case. I am so disappointed as I cannot get the residual glue off and my case is perpetually sticky. My husband put his inside his case and it works ok but he also is left with a sticky phone case. The adhesive stinks and will leave an impossibility sticky residue....not recommend!
5,good product.
5,very powerful and holds great
5,I put one inside my phone case and it works great with the magnet mount in my car. Now I have more of these than I'll ever need
5,It got robbed.
5,This product works as describe.  However my phone case is shinny and I had to super glue the medal to my phone case.  The original sticky on the back was not strong enough.
5,Used for phone mount in car. Works good. Many sizes to choose from.
5,This is the first set that actually do what they say!  They hold up and work perfectly for my phone!
3,I’ve bought some before but these easily bend and the adhesive alone won’t stick even if it’s clean and left unbothered for the amount recommended it’s not great but works
5,Works as advertised
5,Thin enough to put under the hard back case of my phone and still use the cover for my popsockets. Strong enough to keep my phone where is supposed to be.
5,Works as described.  Only issue I have is the the bigger plates keep me from using google pay as they block the NFC chip.
5,Easy to cut into smaller pieces as needed.
5,I use these all the time. Really handy.
1,Doesn't hold up my lightweight SNES controller i used for a magnetic wall mount for a display and just peeled off and fell after a few hours
5,Stick very well
3,it's really easy to install but puts more weight on your cellphone so i wouldn't use it.
5,Loved this product
5,Muy buenos productos los recomiendo
5,Funciona bien
1,Not sticking
5,Awesome very strong
5,Its exactly what i was looking for. No complaints.
5,Haven't adhered it to my phone or case it just sits in between my phone and my case but works just like a magnet should lol.
4,Ok. Good quality
5,The players work well. The magnet attracts easily and the plates are strong.
5,I think once I get a van with a magenetic holder this metal adhesive plate is really going to pay off! Until that happens I can only dream...🤩
2,Glue release on two different plates on my phone. The adhesive isn't strong enough to hold a phone as advertised.
5,Cool
5,Worked perfect and has a very strong adhesion.
5,So far they work. I used them to hang a curtain rod. Strong enough to hold. So far they are still up it’s been 2 week.
5,Super quick shipping and was exactly what I wanted!
5,Yea
5,They adhere well. They are magnetic enough. They do just what you need them to do.
5,Exactly as described.
5,Works perfectly
1,Very weak magnets. I even put the rest of the two bigger magnets and on my phone and still my phone wouldn't stay still on the mount. Compared to the previous magnets I had on my older phone these magnets are very crappy.
5,Nice product
5,Works very well.
5,Arrived super fast and works great thank you
5,Strong adhesive scratch pretty easily. But they stick to whatever you them on.
5,Great magnets!
5,Great product
5,Had mine for years and ended up getting a new phone and needed new one. Works great.
3,To thin don’t stick very well
5,Unlike the adhesive that came with a  iOttie CD Car Mount this plate sticks and holds well.
5,Just what it is metal plates for attaching your device to a magnetic holder.You can use the attached sticket or just stick it between phone and case.
5,Worked as advertised. Love the fact that the package comes with various sized options.
5,These work great for what I needed them for. I bought a pack so I'd have extras. Now if I could just remember where I put them.
1,These things are terrible. They don't hold at all phone slides down. They are too thin. I even tried 2 at a time. I would not recommend.
5,Strong and works nicely with car mount
5,Don’t stick as good as I thought they would but it works what in needed for
5,Not bad for the money you spend. Adheres very good! Good quality great purchase!
5,Good product
5,I bought these to add to my phone case for extra support for my vent phone holder and it worked great.
4,I can't take off.
5,Me encantó
5,Wish I had more things to stick them to but it was perfect for my new phone case
5,Very good  do the job....That's all I need
5,They are ok
5,Works as described
5,good adhesive on the plates. Put one on a life proof case and it has been wet and still holds strong
5,Thanks
5,These were as good as the ones the thing came with.
5,Great value needed metal plates
5,Just as advertised
4,Great
5,My husband has these on each of our phones so anytime we are driving We can easily throw the phone up on the magnetic clip and it doesn’t move.
5,Product and how fast I got and how easy were the instructions to read
5,keeps me safe on the road while i am driving as i use my phone google maps to get me around. would recommend this product
5,Useful
5,Very helpful I would buy it again.
5,Very strong
5,Great product
5,Great replacement and price when swapping out phones/cases.
2,A year or two ago I purchased this same item and they were twice as thick: better magnetic attraction.Now they are only as thick as the cheaper seller's product.  I'm doubling up to simulate thicker product:Yet to be seen if they stick to magnet as well.....
5,perfect for the job
4,Nice and I saved some $$$!
5,Great for my I phone in the car
5,Great value! Exactly what I was looking for.
5,sticky plates work well 3m double sided so it's a good adhesive.
5,Great plates
5,Thin! light! Stable!
5,Worked as expected.
5,Larger plates with 3m adhesive. Works for my application in a phone case
5,They are metal plates. You can't really mess that up. Unless you tried to make them out of clay... Or wood...
4,Does it job for a good price.
5,They work well and the magnets are strong
5,So far so good! Had these on for a few weeks now and they feel very sturdy and attached.
5,Firm adhesion to phone and works fine as replacements with the magnets I bought previously.
5,Everything about this product was great but it gets scratched easily. Good buy and worth the money.
3,Good product sticks greatBut i only received 2 circle magnets not 4 as shown means 2 are missing
5,Love them do what i need them for
5,Great value! Easy to use good price and good quality!
3,The product does it job for holding the phone. But any little heat the adhesion unsticks. Definitely needs stronger glue.
5,Like the color and the different styles rectangle vs circle. Probably wont need to buy any more for the next 8 phones probably.
5,Strong and legit. Does not bend or feel flimsy you will not be upset with this purchase.
5,Good adhesion. Fits the back of my phone quite well.Fast delivery....fair pricing including shipping
5,I had a  mount in the car I bought just needed the metal plate  works great.
5,These magnets are pretty strong for the price. Really happy with the product.
4,It gets the job done
4,They stick on pretty good
5,It works
4,Ok
5,No complaints
5,Just as described!!! Fast shipper! Work well with phone and holder!
5,Works great.
5,Works great! Stay adhered to the phone while maintaining a strong hold to the mount. Definitely recommended.
5,Great glue. Very slim design. Fantastic adhesion.
5,Great
1,Product works great for magnetic car mounts...... However the plates block the signal for the wireless chargers to charge the phone....... Very disappointed in this product I just wasted $5
5,Holds the phone perfectly on my magnet holder
5,Needed to replace for new phones. Thesemagnets gave us lots of option which was most appreciated.
5,Muy buenos la pega no pega mucho
5,Work great to hold my phone with cover pouch and 3 credit cards onto the magnetic base in my car.
5,Put in a magnetic phone case to stick but it interfered with the phone signal.
5,Perfect!
5,Liked everything
1,The adhesive backing fails in mere days. Going with a different brand.
2,Only received  rectangle no circular
1,The incoming phone volume is  very low. The user manual is not helpful. There is no customer service number to call. The only communication is email which responded to my specific question with robotic general answer and requested my to provide photos to a low volume issue.After several emails I gave up!
5,They stuck nicely on the back of my phone
5,These are great--easy to install and great when traveling
1,Paper that you peel off sticks and leaves a residue and then doesn't stick well to the surface.  Magnet barely works if you can get it to stick at all.
5,it comes with 4 squares and 4 circles 3m adhesive works like a charm no issues
5,I like them .Thank you !
5,Nothing I didnt like
4,fine
5,Muy buena calidad viene con su Tape 3 M lo recomiendo ampliamente.
5,These are metal plates. Attaches well to the phone case I needed it for.
5,Love these- use them on all phones in household
1,Nit magnetic  returned item.
5,These are perfect. They are pretty thick not flimsy metal but not too thick that it’s bulky in your phone
1,I have bought these twice and now I am done.  Regardless of size these have broken off into my ear and gone into my ear canal - the final time requiring needing to see a Doctor.  I gave this several chances as I thought it had to do with the size I was using - but after trying all and all of them breaking - I would not recommend this.
5,Got my package fits just fine and all pieces came with it (8 pc.)
5,The adhesive came off.
2,Stronger adherence and flexibility
5,Works with my iPad mini and iPhone 8 plus for when I walk-and-study in conjunction with this:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CK9JXW2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
5,Great buy.  High quality.  Quick shipment  Highly recommended.
5,Good quality. Exactly what you expect
5,Work like a charm
5,This is what I needed with no gas and without looking for it.
1,The magnet isnt strong enough to use inside my case. I went thru 2 large ones. When i pull my phone to use it the magnet comes off. Yes I used cell phone cleaning wipes before hand.
5,Definitely come in handy...
5,Great to replace my lost phone plate
5,These are great!
5,Great does the job perfectly
5,They work well and you get plenty for the cost!  What else is there to say?!
5,Work great and inexpensive.
5,Just as advertised
5,Love these replacement plates. Strong and they give you a lot for your money.
5,Works great! The adhesive on the back of the metal plate holds very strong
1,Doesn't work
5,When changing phone cases these are a must have
5,Good value
5,Exactly what I needed. Sticks tight to my new case and the car mount.
5,My phone.
1,Wish I could give it zero stars... It was supposed to be magnetic. What I received was not even close to magnetic. I tried them out with the magnets on the refrigerator to see if they would stick (thinking maybe it was something wrong with my the brand new ring hold) but that didn't work either... These didn't magnetize to the case ring holder magnets on the fridge or anything... Waste of my money but I was refunded.. Maybe you'll have better luck... I clearly got something defective or wrong item all together... Either way I don't recommend it
5,Exactly what I wanted
5,Worked great!!!
5,Great for larger phones
5,Nice strong adhesive. Works great with my dash mounted magnet.
5,Great metal pieces for magnetic holders.
5,It works just fine
5,They are quality products
5,Muy buen producto
5,Easy to apply; adheres well to phone case
5,Very helpful. Great quality!!
5,Good
5,Very good price for the amount you get
5,Nothing to say here they're metal plates with adhesive on the back.
5,Great used
5,Works great!
1,Just got the product in the mail and discovered  that I received only the 4 rectangular plates. The plastic baggy says "...angle and 4 round" on the sticker but no round plates were included. As far as the quality of the rectangular plates goes they seem as expected considering the price.
5,Work great
5,Allows multiple devices on single mount.
5,Very bad glue does not stick to phone or case
5,These worked great for my phone in the car
5,It worked perfectly exactly what i needed
5,Love it!
2,It did stick good to my phone case. Kept sliding and moving around
5,Great purchase
5,Works perfectly
5,Good quality
5,Buy this because they are good and cheap
1,Don’t work for me
5,This was exactly what I was looking for.
5,Perfect for vehicle holds well and safe..
1,The adhesion are melting.. i only applied this for 2 days.. wether is only 70 degrees so its not even that hot.. not sure whats going on but it leaking and making my hand sticky all the time for just holding my phone..not sure why i am npt able to share photo but i have some pictures
5,Works great will order more when needed
5,Great for the price
5,Perfect
5,:)
5,Happy Happy Happy great adhesion.
1,It is literally not a magnet; it is just a piece of plastic with a sticker on it. Do not waste your money. The worst thing is it's so small it's not worth the environmental harm to return it - so I guess I'm just out a few dollars when I really don't have money to burn. Do not buy if you want a magnet.
5,Everything as expected
1,
5,Excellent
5,It holds very well on my iPad...
2,I hate giving bad reviews but I really wasn't impressed with these. They didn't have enough pull for my personal liking. Theyre too bendable and they feel like plastic. Unfortunately I would definitely look elsewhere before purchasing these.
5,Good
5,Works great! Highly recommend. Easy to install.
5,The rectangular disk holds my phone very well.
5,Perfect strong easy to apply.
5,Excellent
1,I didn't like them at all can't use them they don't work or stay stuck to my phone when I mount it in my vehicle I'm very frustrated waste of money
5,Loved it.
5,Dose the job
1,Having issues with these I used two and they are not strong what so ever. While driving on a flat smooth road my phone has fallen off the base multiple times.
5,It leaves my hair nice and silky beautiful
5,Thin and stable
5,Impressed with quality and value
5,Good
5,Great price for the amount of items
5,Nice set and works with numerous things
3,Keep charge
2,Adhesive is not as good as expected
2,Thin doesnt stay stick on my phone..

5,Great product!
5,As advertised.  Sticks well
5,They work as described!
5,Would recommend
5,Thank u !!?
5,Great
5,Work well
5,Product as described affordable and fast shipping.
5,Does exactly what it is supposed to.
5,works perfectly no issues applying stronghold to magnet
1,THESE ARE NOT MAGNETS- Do not be deceived. Purchased these in hopes to have a few magnetic mounts around the house- these are literally metal plates with adhesive. Not sure why anyone would want/need this product but it’s a complete waste for me. Will be asking for a refund.
2,After about two weeks the phone falls right off of the magnet
5,Excellent product!
5,Great
5,Really good
2,The magnets were not strong enough to hold up phone even covering the back of my case with multiple magnets
5,Great and cheap.
5,Works better than any other
5,Exactly what I needed
5,Works well
5,Good variety and great adhesive backs.
3,Deleted
1,Put it on and let it set overnight with the weight of the phone on it the the next day when I went to the store and the first small bump it sperated tried another one but same thing.
5,Stays firm
1,Adhesive is garbage. They keep popping off my phone.
5,It is a metallic piece of metal
5,Works perfect
5,It works
5,Works great.
5,Great product
5,I have a Samsung 10s Plus with glass back/housing.  It charges my phone perfectly.  I've seen a lot of complaints but mine charges with no problems.  I'm using the round one. Possibly makes a difference?
5,These magnets work really good
5,As described
5,Just what I needed
5,Great
5,No issues!
3,No good quality
5,No issues
5,Works very well!
5,Ok
1,Connection errors one after-an-other.. call them wont help if you don't have a subscription.. WORST AMAZON PRODUCTION EVER!!!I'd love my money back and get something that's true to word
1,Weak magnetism weak adhesive not very compatible with any of the magnetic phone mountings i've come into contact with at least in comparison to the magnets that come with the mounting kit. These aren't replacements worthy of the name. If you have some other use for them.. maybe.
5,👍😍
5,Love it
5,Very nice!
1,The magnets weren’t magnetic they didn’t adhere to anything.
5,Item as described
1,Not good
5,Worked out for us.
5,Awesome
5,Worked perfectly.
5,I found these magnets quite attractive.
5,Works like a charm
1,Offered as an 8 piece package. I received one round piece.Ridiculous. Poor adhesion to boot. Hardly worth the annoyance and aggravation.Don’t buy this crap
5,Good
2,If the adhesive gets warm it will lose sticky hold and the weight of your magnetic item may pull the disk off the survace. (Mine was attached to smooth gelcoat fiberglass)
1,They don't work they are just little metal plates. They don't stick to anything. I expected magnetic plates and that isn't what I got.
5,Backup!
1,These were the worst ever. I put one on my iPhone inside my life-roof case and it did not stick for even 1 day ... causing my phone to fall off its magnetic plate holder in the care breaking the knob off my car radio and landing in my cup of coffee. These are the worst product ever made. Do not but if you actually need something that works.
5,Good trade
5,Very durable!
5,Worked out perfectly
5,Love these
1,These literally doesnt stick so i dont know how it has good reviews.. its so thin it doesnt even look like it will stick to anything so this was a waste of money and my time
5,Good quality.
5,Great
5,Excellent
5,Perfect. Thank you
5,Exactly as described.
5,Very good product!!
5,Love these
2,Magnet but strong enoughto hold my phone on car charger
5,Fantastix
5,Great pack great price
5,Nice
5,Great item
5,Exactly as advertised
5,Loved it
5,worked great
1,This is fine if you already have the metal side. Not so great if you also need the other half.
2,Garbage I couldn't get them to stick to anything. These things are not strong look for Alternatives elsewhere
1,It keeps sliding off from the phone. Super weak adhesive. It’s painful to keep on removing the exposed glue all the time.
1,I bought this to put on my iPhone 8. Simply it doesn't stick. I tried 3 times cleaning the back with alcohol and acetone to make sure it was clean and warm. All three stuck to the magnet holder and pulled off the phone on the first try.  Disappointing.
1,Only received 2 of the round plates. Paid for 4!
1,I stuck it on the back of my cell phone then attempted to put it on my cell phone holder and the phone fell and left the magnet attached to the cell phone holder. Worthless
1,The adhesive is really bad. My phone keys felling of the car mount leaving the magnet stuck to the mount.
1,This product have a problem of adhesion.  When I turn on the heat. It separates immediately.  The strength of the sticker is very weak for high temperature.  It's a ridiculous product.
1,Product is useless the adhesive does not stick. The very first time I used it with my iPhone XS Max the phone slipped off the magnet and came crashing down after about 15 minutes.  Fortunately the phone was not damaged but adhesive on these magnets does not work.
1,Magnet not strong enough
1,Adhesive does not work. I have tried three of the circular plates in the pack that I received and they have all come off after a couple of days. The original plate I had on my phone case stayed in place for two years!!
1,Out of the pack only one held. All others came off in less than a day. Horrible 'product'. Adhesive is trash.
2,This was a joke!! You need the entire pack just to get it to hold
1,These things are very thin and not strong enough.  My phone kept slipping and falling off the mount.  Don't waste your money.
1,Decent products. But won't order again because the delivery drivers are the worst. I don't appreciate my stuff being left on the sidewalk or even in bushes when explicit instructions were provided to use the door buzzer. Do your job or find a new one!
2,For some reason these aren’t as strong as the ones that came with my phone holder 🤷🏻‍♀️
1,Barely sticks together not to mention hold anything together. Don't waste your money/time buying these.
1,Used to hold cellphone in car on magnet
1,Not magnetic don’t bother!
1,They don’t hold long it’s horrible
1,Metal plate slides down. The plates adhesive melted and my mobile fell off the bracket.
1,I ordered this product with the understanding that I would receive 8 when in reality I only got 4.Three circular and one rectangle.It's only 5 dollars but still none the less I paid for 8.
1,Don't like these  they don't stick
1,works fine on some material but for some reason its horrible on plastic
2,It’s light but the adherence is poor
1,The adhesive didn't do the job as anticipated. Won't purchase again!
1,My phone falls off with the slightest bump they are awful
1,Received the item but was not magnetic it would not stick to anything sent them back received another order and the same thing the magnets were not magnetic
1,
1,Si funcionan pero tienes que agrerar pegamento por que el adhesivo que trae es muy devil
1,The "magnets" are not even magnetic.  They just slide off the plate. Total waste of money and time.I do not recommend!
1,Wasn't good and was never offered a replacement
1,These keep getting pulled off my phone they do not stick as well as the originals..
1,Magnet does not work at all. Very disappointed it’s not a magnet.
1,Waste of money the adesive part just don't work
1,I gave this product no stars. The adhesive popped loose from my phone causing the phone to fall from the dashboard cracking my screen.
1,Theses do not stick well
1,Absolute Garbage!Applied 1 onto back of my phone case lasted 1 day. Second disk 1 day of use. Phone on car floor.JUNK!
1,Not magnetic enough my phone slides right off.
1,Doesn’t stay on at all. They need use the 3M tape in the back. Won’t buy again.
1,Do not stick well. Used alcohol to clean surface. Very thin adhesive. Try something else. Returned.
1,Cheap thin metal and crummy glue. Won’t stay on my phone case.. ended up throwing them all away
1,Fell off at any thing close to a rise in temperature.
1,Item was not in box
1,These magnets didn’t work. The adhesion worked fine but the magnet side did not. Waste of money
1,Missing parts received only 4  rectangle plate missing 4 more circle shape plate....
1,Did not stick well at all.. Needed to use Gorilla Glue!
1,I only received the 4 rectangle magnets and not the 4 circular ones....
1,Everything was fine but it advertised 8 plates. I only got 4
1,I did not like this product because it was not what i wanted
1,The plates doesn't stick and stay in my phone.
1,it’s will fell off after 3 days.
1,What a joke!!
1,Just fell right off! Terrible
1,Didnt stick on wasnt worth it in my case.
1,Terrible
1,Followed directions still came off. Not a good item
1,It was bend defactive
1,Comes off 5 minutes after application don’t buy.
1,My package arrived empty
1,All that arrived was an empty envelope
1,Not working very good
1,Nada porque no lo recibí nunca llegóNunca nunca lo recibí
1,Was not good
1,Meh
5,Great price for an 8 pack. Others cost more with fewer pieces just to have some stupid name on them. Remember this is just a metal plate. It is NOT magnetic. It relies on something else to be magnetic like your car phone mount holder.
2,Very poor adhesive it slips no matter whete you put it either inside or outside the case or on the device itself you'll end up with glue smeared all over
1,Would Not buy ...!  One of The main reason for the purchase is to have its adhesion to the phone itself ! But is very weak!  Came off the back of the phone 3 days after putting it on.  So before trying another one I wiped the back of phone with alcohol. After a few days same results. Did not stick. Says 3M on the peal sticker ! Don’t think it’s 3M!  Hope this helps future buyers .
5,I like that the metal plates are thin and simple to install. I placed the plate between my phone case and phone and it works great!
5,Nothing to dislike great value and all my cases has them on now.
5,I put the product on my case & let it sit for 36 hours before I used it. It worked for about 2-3 hours before the magnet started to slip off. The sticky part stayed on my case but the magnet didn't stay on the sticky part. I have a note 9 and it's not that heavy. The sticky part stayed on my phone and I had to spend hour wiping it off with alcohol soaking it. I tried returning and accidentally closed the window before completing it and it didn't allow me to return it after.
5,Love these! I needed some magnet for my phone to attach to a stand I have in my car and these are perfect. As soon as I change a case cause the one I have is messed up the one I buy really has no magnet and I like to have hand free will driving. So this worked great.
5,I was able to slip one of the big plates between my phone and phone skin protector.  The magnet is still strong enough to keep my phone gripped on tightly while hitting NYC potholes.
5,I have a magnetic cell phone car mount but the magnet that came with the phone was weak.  I put 2 of these inside my cell phone case. I don't remove the stickers and it holds great now in the car.
5,Secure where other products fall off easily after a short time.  Lasts in both hot and cold temperatures.  Had on phone for over a year until I had changed phones.  Unfortunately they don’t stick well once removed and placed on another phone.
5,I've used these in the past. Bought a new phone case so I needed a new magnet. They are SUPER strong and hold on well.
2,The metal did not stick to my magnetic car mount when placed between my case and phone. I even have one of those inexpensive clear ones and it wouldn’t hold up my iPhone XR. I am not sure if this is because of the weight  of the phone. I didn’t adhere it to the back. I was hoping to hide it under a picture in my clear case but it wouldn’t even work without the picture in the way. I would not recommend this product or trust it with my phone while I am driving. That could be a hazard.
5,I love the magnets. I have one in both my cars. I bought them for my kids too!
5,I had one of these flat metal pieces in a older phone and lost it. I loved it cuz it worked so well with the magnet in the car to hold the phone.  My new phone has no metal so I knew I needed this ASAP cuz my phone kept falling over while using the maps and it was distracting to try and pick it up. I have a clear cover around my phone so I chose the black so its not noticed. Works even better than the original one I had. Sooooo glad I ordered these.
3,Everything was just as it says but I wish I had the option to get only one no where on Amazon only sells one of these lol
5,Looks perfect adhesive sticks perfectly. Size and quality is good.
5,Working great and really stick great no problems
5,It's strong
5,I placed one in my phone case so I can leave my phone on a magnet. This is the best effortless idea. Easier than trying to hook my phone using claws.
5,works good
5,Great for my needs
5,This is a Must have amazon item! Just place them inside your phone case.
5,Easy to install and use fits well
5,👍
5,Ok
5,3M adhesives in a variety of shapes and sizes. Good to keep a few for back ups for my phone mounting situation!
5,It's good
5,Exactly what I needed for work when their phones die on me I can use mine. Thanks.
5,Very good they stik Very well
5,Was good
5,Perfect!!!
5,It works great for my phone mount in the car. Hasn't falling off at all. Just have to take my phone out of the case because it doesn't go thru strong but it can attach thru the case but I feel more secure if I take my case off and attach to the mount with these metal pieces
5,I have a swivel magnet thing mounted on my car dashboard to hold my phone. Needed a replacement plate for the back of my new phone case. Good adhesion to the case. Works great.
4,These are only one part of the equation. You need a strong magnet to hold them. Wasn't very clear to me when purchased them. Tried them in my other car with a phone magnet mount on on my dashboard and they worked fine.
5,Exactly what I was looking for…
5,Great product!
3,These are nice to have but the adhesion isn't is good as I expected.
5,They work. Not much more I can say it’s a sticky magnet..
5,Stuck to my otter box case just fine and works with the magnet.Not really sure why everyone sells so many in a pack as you will never ever use them all. Tossed the rest...
5,functional enough to hold large samsung galaxy phone on a magnetic phone holder on car dash. very pleased. no complaints.
5,Nice magnetic sticks perfect
4,It’s awesome. Works great. Sticks easily to my phone and doesn’t come off in fact it’s very difficult to get it off which I’d say is a pro. Immediately latches on to the magnet and keeps my phone from slipping off.
5,Fits perfect on the phone. Good quality.
5,They are thin but very good for adhesion.
5,No complains this is very useful
3,These peel right off in the heat so every one I've used has peeled off of its respective phone case in the hot car. I used some of my own adhesive and the magnets work great.
5,Nice thin plates with 3M adhesive. worked well for my application.several in the pack so you can use multiple phones.
5,Got these as a replacement for existing car mount they work perfect. Much thinner and just as strong. I place mine inside my case so I can take off the case and still be able to wireless charge. Great price for the item!
5,Great magnets for the price.
3,Description says 8 pack but I only received a 4 pack. Kind of feel ripped off. However the product does work as expected.
5,I used this product to attach my iPhone to a magnetic dash mount.
5,Excelente
5,These are perfect! Have had for several months now with no adhesion issues. As a matter of fact sometimes they stick so well that the whole vent clip magnet comes off instead of the just the phone!
5,I put this on the inside of my cover and it worked really well
5,works well with my magnet phone stand i had bought at tjmaxx
5,Good
5,Does the job. 2 sizes strong adhesive.
5,It sticks
5,Exactly as expected
5,Good adhesion and the magnetic is excellent
5,No complaints. Thin enough that I barely notice its there under my phone case.
5,Execelente producto y buen precio
5,Easy-to-intall
5,Works GREAT with the dash mount magnets.  Plenty for when I buy a new phone/cover
5,Great product 8 metal plate pack for only 6 bucks from amazing quality.. thanks
5,This plates have very strong adhesion.
5,Good
5,They do what they're supposed to 👍
5,Adheres easily. I just needed the large rectangle plate for the back of my phone case.  Went on quick and easy and works great with my magnetic holder.
5,Exactly as described
5,Haven’t use yet thinner than I expected
5,Peel stick and be done with it.
5,Awesome.
5,It’s working well!
5,Simple and practical I recommend.

5,Good quality
5,see headline
5,Exactly what we expected
5,Super strong and easy to apply. Can’t go wrong with this
5,It was easy to stick and it stuck fast. Very durable I have a Note 20 Ultra and is on the heavy side but it stuck! Highly recommended and an excellent price!
5,For car and very perfect.
5,Good sticks well
5,These plates worked well with our two different magnetic holders
5,Thank you for a very useful item
5,Affordable
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Sticks well and works well with my magnetic phone holder in my car. And you can't beat the price.
5,These items are great. Depending on your phone case. The small ones might not work but the big one's will stick.
5,This plus a strong magnet is the best car/phone setup hands down.
5,These are great. Strong magnet to mount my phone in the car. Does not fall off. I use a couple drops of superglue to mount to my Lifeproof case
5,Adhesion is great on my phone case. I was worried it might not stick but am very pleased. Snaps right into place with my magnetic phone holder.
5,These are perfect. Super strong and easy to install. I will warn you that it was a big task to remove the magnet if you wish to do so but to be fair is a good thing. Also stops wireless charging from working if you rely on that a lot
2,Thought I would try them since they were cheap and no big loss if they didn’t work. They didn’t. Fell off even without having anything attached.
5,Needed these because of the phone mount in my car and needed to change the case to my phone.  Great for the price.
4,Suppose to come with 8 pieces. I received 7. Not a big deal but where could it have gone? Snatched missing mishandled?
5,If you have a car Mount for your phone that’s magnetic buy these right now !! They have a range of sizes and have a great hold !! I would highly recommend to anyone with a magnetic phone Mount
1,It doesn’t stick well
1,Easy to use and easy to install yes but adhesive didn't last more than a day.
4,I like it 👌
5,
5,It didn't stick to well. I had to purchase epoxy.
5,justo lo que buscaba
5,They worked great on my phone case
5,I was unable to use this and returned it since I sent back the case I bought that I was going to use the magnetic plates for. The amount sent and price was great. In the future will definitely order when I am in need of a new case.
5,100%
5,Works as expected
4,Great product
5,It's easy to install and does t come off when I pull it from a magnetic mount
5,Has great adhesion & easy to use
5,Works great. Does what it is intended to do.
5,It's perfect for my cell phone case on my holder in the car
5,Worked great
5,These are  gorilla magnets strong  and heavy duty. Buy them today
5,really easy and great to use.
5,Good product . Worth the price
5,The best adhesion I’ve seen yet no need for crazy glue on them!
5,Works great
5,I looked everywhere for these ans found them easily here on Amazon. They're exactly what I needed and work thru my case to stick to my vent clip magnetic phone holder. Yay!
5,So I do some DoorDashing and a LOT of traveling from Michigan to Florida and Ohio and so on. Needless to say I use my phone's GPS more than the usual person so I use a stick on the dash area device to hold my phone so I can easily see it. However the plate that came with it couldn't handle it anymore lol and became unsticky and so my phone went and fell off due to it in the middle of a DoorDash. Luckily it was shortly after I got done. So I got these to replace it and I must say a year later and these are still doing what they're supposed to. I actually believe these are superior to the ones that came with the device. So I decided to double up on my phone. One circular plate on the phone directly and then the long rectangle plate on the outside of the phone via sticking it on the phone case. With this method I have double magnetic pull which yes I can feel. Which I do believe has also contributed to making these plates last longer as well.
5,Fit right into the pocket of my phone cover and holds on strongly to my phone holder magnet.
5,It's great
5,Perfect for replacing the "Nato Mount"magnet for my new phone. Plus there's quite a few extras for when I upgrade my phone again. With Prime I got my shipment the next day. Thank you
5,Moved easily to adjust when it was applied crooked.
5,These metal plates are as sturdy and perfect size as they come. Can't get a better deal or product.
5,Easy to use and great
5,Multiple magnets and sizes great prices
5,Great little magnet to put on the back of an iPhone to keep it on the magnetic holder on the dash. I used 2 large ones. No worries about my phone falling onto the floor while driving. Totally hands free
5,Great quality and fast shipping
5,Muy buenos
5,Good
5,You can never have too many plates for your magnetic phone holder. Easy to install. They adhere great to my case.
5,They came in different shapes and size and works well
5,Adhesive is very good much better than other magnets I've purchased on amazon!
2,Weak adhesive. THey fell off after a couple weeks.
5,I love this product ! Good thing for my iPhone12 !
5,Great
5,We have had a hard time finding magnets that hold up our phones in the car. These are the only ones we have found that work. We will continue to buy these and recommend them!!!
5,Looks exactly like the pictures. Very good quality.
5,Works great for my phone and ipod for the car can see what is going on with calls and directions.
5,Sticks forever 😁
5,This is my first time buying a flower pot made of fabric and the effect is unexpectedly good. I originally thought that this soft-looking material would not help plants but it turned out I was wrong. Although the holes are invisible in fact they are everywhere and I don't have to worry about the accumulation of water at the bottom of it. The quality of the handles is very good. I have carried them many times and they are still very strong.
5,I already had a holder installed in my car for myself. I bought these for my nephew who just started driving alone to encourage him not to drive with his phone in his hands. He loved the gift.
5,Works really well and I wasn’t expecting it to fit this well. I have the adhesive side holding into the inside of the case and I haven’t seen any marking or scratches on the back of my phone. Even with the case it holds onto my car mount very well and hasn’t given me any issues.
5,I bought a new phone case and needed a metal plate to use with it to take advantage of my car vent mounted magnet holder. It was easy to install and it totally met my needs + I have plenty of extras to share with friends who find themselves in the same situation.
5,Bang for your buck.
2,I would just rebuy the whole unit and will next time. These are are thin and not strong
5,Best adhesive magnets. We had to replace because of new phone. You won't go wrong.
5,These little magnets are very strong. The adhesive  sticks very well. I can’t believe how many I get for such a small price. Love these.
5,Easy to use
5,Strong magnet
5,This is cheap. very good value for money. 8 pieces in pack. You will find those with mucb higher price in other places
2,The adhesive ness of the magnets is no good. It always ends up coming off. If your device is even a little bit heavy the magnet won’t be able to hold it up. It’ll eventually detach and stick to the magnet base.
5,Lost phone needed replacement. Perfect magnet
2,Two days went down a very bumpy road and my phone fell in the process (Keep in mind I put a rectangular and circle piece on the back) and nope didn't stick lol. Very let down not gonna bother using the rest.
5,These metal plates function as advertised and do what I bought them for. My wife and I didn't stick them to our phones but just put them between the phone and the case and they work fine with our car mount. I certainly didn't need eight of them but at the price they were still worth it.
5,Product as described.Value for money.
5,Strong
5,It does a great job holding a phone still but be sure to have the magnetic dashboard for phones. I drive a semi and it holds over lots of bumps and steady
5,Cheap and great!! Comes with real 3M tape!!
5,Perfect and very strong
5,The metal plates are of good quality and it fixes easily. Worth the buy. Recommended.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Esto me encanta es la segunda vez que lo compro lo utilizo para sujetar mi teléfono en mi carro el paquete trae varios  son muy fuertes siempre lo instalo en el cover de mi teléfono estoy satisfecha y 💯 recomendado 👏
5,Will definitely buy more.
5,Looks good
5,They are easy to use stick very well and the variety pack is perfect for all of my households phones tablets and pretty much anything else you want to attach to metal.
5,8 magnetic for 4$. It is good deal you can change your phone cases as much you want with 8 pieces of magnetic.
5,Easy to use value for money
5,Very good quality
1,The magnet is strong and of good size but idk if it was just one product that was bad but my magnets didn’t stick to my phone cover properly. Didn’t meet my expectations.
5,I used the magnet for my phone it was perfect! Different sizes.
5,Seems to stick well and works through a thin case like I wanted.
5,Slow delivery but no problem.  The pieces adhere immediately and are strong.  I have used them before. I have an add on backup camera that would not configure to be useable so rather than mess with the dash mount I used a magnet to put it on my dash and thieve pieces work great.
5,Ease to use. Good product with sticking power
5,doesn't push cover out lays flat
5,Phone magnet in my car
5,Working awesome as expected. Had the metal plate stuck directly on old phone which I just sold and misplaced the other plates. Had a useless phone holder basically. Found these gem's and now I'm back in business. This time I stuck on (new) phone case instead of actual phone. Use common sense and wipe area with alcohol before applying the metal plate.
5,Love it
5,Needed a replacement magnet and this package was well worth the $$
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Loved the price and works just like the more expensive ones.
4,Nice slim designgood price. Wish magnet was a little stronger
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Need these
5,Sticks well to my phone case and good magnet. Never had my phone fall when attached to the dash.
5,Works great even with a slim case. Good magnetic grab. No issues keeping my phone on the magnetic holder in the car with the thin case.
5,I have repurchased this item several times! I do recommend using the bigger rectangular magnet instead of the circle because the rectangle covers more area and is therefore sturdier. When I used the circle I did find it didn’t work as well and I needed to put two on.I recommend putting these on the inside of your case so no one can see it!
5,I've had it for a few days and it's been working as intended.  Attached to my phone case with no issues and has been functioning as expected.
5,Okay it’s just a piece of metal but it serves a purpose. Super easy to install. Just clean off the surface your applying it to peel off the tapes cover and place it on your phone or phones case.I have an Otterbox cover and it’s kind of thick. One piece of metal wasn’t enough for a good hold to the magnetic mount. I just added another piece on top of the other and that did the trick. Just be careful if you charge wirelessly. Don’t place the metal piece to high on your phone or case or you won’t be charging wirelessly anymore. Other than that you’re good to go.It’s metal so it’ll last forever. Most likely longer than your phone or case will. It worked for me and it’ll work for you too.
5,Easy! Holds iPhone 13 Pro Max very well! 10/10
5,Great
5,After trading my phone in the magnet was still on my phone case which didn’t fit with my new phone. It was going to cost $25.00 for a new holder. I was able to get these 6 magnets for less then $5.00. What a buy.
5,Good
5,Thought I needed a new device to hold my phone since I gave my old iPhone 8 to my granddaughter and the magnet backing was on the phone!  Then I found these backings and perfect and now I have enough to change phone cases.
5,Holds well to phone.
5,Perfect. Just what I wanted to affix to my cell phone for allowing it be attached to my phone holder (magnetic) in my truck.
5,Perfect for my iPhone
5,Highly reccomend when you only need thw magnet not the whole kit.
5,No complaints about quality these are the thinnest plates you will find. Never had an issue with adhesion and they stick just fine to magnets. Anyone rating less than 1 star I would have to assume is only rating poorly for a bad experience but they aren't actually reviewing the product itself. Unless you some how find this cheaper some where else which I doubt this is hands down bar none the best value you will get anywhere. Don't bother shopping around for other ones you did it. This is the best.
5,These work AMAZING with the product bestrix. Love being able to put my phone on this mount
5,Used for my multiple iPhone 11 cases. Excellent product (the CD insert mount). Keeps my phone up front with no effort and prevents GPSing/Mapping while driving
5,Great deal
5,Great
5,Just what I needed for the magnetic phone holder. These are great.
5,Works as expected
5,Easy to stick and works with my car magnet
5,Second time I have bought this case good value.
5,After trying various vent phone mounts I am happiest with this solution!
