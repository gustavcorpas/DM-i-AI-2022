5,Went glamping in a remote spot last year and couldn't get cell coverage. We visited a few other places where signal was weak. I researched all antennas out there and it was between this and the more expensive brand. I settled on this because there was an equal amount of negative reviews with both brands saying they didn't work. My logic was I'd be out less money.I bought 2-10' pieces of conduit and coupled them together for a 20' pole to mount the outdoor antenna (I pounded the first piece into the ground so I didn't have an ungrounded lightning rod). I used an android app "network cell info lite" (free) which both told me where the closet tower was and gave me signal readings.This past weekend we returned to the remote spot with no/spotty signal we went to last year. To me this was going to be the big test. Standing on the roof of our travel trailer I was getting -110db a pretty weak signal. Inside the camper we got no internet on our phones. For those with teenagers you understand what a crisis this was. I put the outdoor antenna on the pole and pointed to the closest tower. Gain was all the way up on the indoor unit (per instructions). After testing several locations and directions I settled on indoor antenna placement. Consistent -85db to -90db and everyone had internet on their phone. Crisis averted.Of note - indoor antenna placement seems to really matter. Too close and it kills your signal like nothing. Although it says the indoor antenna is omni-directional I found it works best when you are essentially in a straight line with it. Because of that I placed it as close to the center (left to right not front to back) as I could. I put it near the front of the camper so signal was beaming back through. I also placed it halfway between floor and ceiling. This to say if you get this expect to tinker with indoor antenna placement a bit. I suspect that would be true with either brand as it's a function of physics not manufacturer.In summary I'm very happy with the results.
5,I typically get 1-2 bars of usable service outside. The nearest cell tower isn’t actually that far. About 2 miles up the hill. I lacked better service due to a hill thick foliage and being in a valley. Along with that I have a metal roof and block walls. I mounted the Yagi directional antenna as high as possible and aimed it towards the tower. Found a cell mapper site that helped me really dial in the towers location. Moved the antenna in small increments to find the best dB possible (using the settings in my iPhone to get the readings). I also have good separation between the yagi and the indoor amplifier which is crucial to good performance. With all that being said. Not only have I brought my outside service inside the house but actually get better service inside now with 2-4 bars instead of 1-2 outside. With a db reading of around -83db at best so far!!!! Definitely worth the money if you take your time and install correctly and fine tune it.
5,I don’t post a lot of reviews and usually don’t get too excited when a product does what it is supposed to do but if you take the time to properly aim the antenna this thing works!  Our 2 story summer cabin in the Appalachian foothills sits in a river valley has stone walls and no bars with Verizon iPhone anywhere inside the building.  Outside in the yard we might get a bar on a good day.  Nearest cell tower is roughly 6 miles as the crow flies.  After taking the time to mount and aim the antenna and checking the signal strength a few times we went to a steady  three bars upstairs and downstairs.  I will gladly give it five stars once I see how long the hardware lasts.  Take the time to install it correctly and it will work well.
5,My signal was hit-or-miss before I set up this booster. I was frustrated very often about half the time due to poor signal -- 4G would come and then it would go without anything to indicate why it was good one minute then lousy for the next couple hours. My office/home is about 5 miles from the nearest tower. The property has sharply inclined hills on both sides so I assumed that I was not likely to get any help from any type of antenna regardless....but I was desperate. Cable internet is not in the budget if I could help it especially since I am hardly at the property except perhaps half the time of the year. So I figured that I will give this antenna a try in spite of my doubts and pessimism.I mounted the outdoor Yagi on top of a metal roof garage the highest point of my property. The structures of the property using https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001V6QZR4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1. I mounted it straight to the roof about a foot back from the edge of roof wondering if the close proximity of the metal would diminish the ability of this antenna. I pointed the yagi in the approximate location of the nearest tower using Network Cell Info Lite app (which I highly recommend along with the Speecheck Pro app. Both are the proofs that I needed to verify if this antenna was effective or not.....and I have about a hundred results so far of tangible numbers that I can understand).Then I ran the coax (which comes with the kit) down into the garage where I have never ever been able to have broadband and occasionally drop calls about 80% of the time if I go too far into the garage. So I mounted the booster in the furthest and darkest corner of the garage turned it on watched the lights flashing on it for about a minute (the booklet states that the lights indicate that it is tuning itself during this time). And withing thirty seconds I watched my celluar bars go from 0 to 3. I tried the internet; and was able to get pages to load. My skepticism was weakened a little. But this garage is not where I wanted to booster. So I relocated the booster to the adjacent garage which has the office/apartment attached. The booster worked worked well in that garage too (where I also had the hardest of times getting calls or internet before). That was as far as the 50 foot coax would stretch; and my desk was on the other side of an interior wall approximately 40 feet further. The booster did not put-out or receive that far it seemed. So I placed an additional 50 foot of coax on the yagi side drilled a hole through the wall ran the coax through the wall and placed the booster on my desk. My phone sets beside it almost all the time even right now as I type this review.The "tests". I have run many many tests by using Network Cell Info Lite app and the Speedcheck Pro app The first app shows me real numbers that my phone has better signal (sometimes much better signal) when the booster is on and nearby; and the second app Speedcheck Pro give me the real numbers of how "fast" the internet that I have -- how fast or slow it is operating. And so far I have many many positive results of how effective this booster is according to my situation. I have tried many times to unprove the results turning it on and off removing the whip antenna etc.....and almost every time my signal is stronger with the booster rather than without.The whip antenna on the booster seems to have a coverage of only approximately 50 square feet but i have not tested that very much yet I purchased the Sure Call dome antenna but it was less effective by the tests I ran. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076CH4B8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1All in all I am very impressed with the effectiveness of this antenna. I tested it and I tested it....and so far (I've had it for a week) I am super-exhilarated that it seems to work very well except when it rains. Last night was the first time that it rained during these tests; and the tests were not positive during the rain storm. Other than that this booster has outperformed no-booster about 95% of the time of all the controlled tests that I performed.
4,Installation very straight forward but good install required digging in the coaxial cable attaching it to house where it came out of the ground into the attic then into room where the amplifier was placed. A separate app was required to determine best antennae location and direction to point the antennae. In a rural property it took time to install and we are still working to find a long-term pointing location for indoors cell coverage.
5,I started my home booster adventure with a WeBoost Connect 4G and ended up returning it because it couldn't handle the fact that in my area we have Verizon and AT&T both operating LTE in the 700Mhz band where they are right next to each other in the frequency spectrum. The AT&T signal comes in a bit stringer than Verizon and I need Verizon but for the WeBoost these are indistinguishable. The result was that the WeBoost didn't amplify the Verizon LTE signal enough causing my phone to stick to 3G (which is in a different band).I purchased the SureCall unit because of the manual gain adjustments which I expected would let me tune down the 3G signal so my phone would actually hop to 4G giving me decent data transfer rates. The short of the story is that (a) the per-band tunig does work and help (b) the LED indicators are much more informative allowing me to understand what is happening much better and (c) this booster provides some degree of distinction between the two adjacent LTE carriers. This unit is also much better built being all-aluminum and the exterior Yagi has higher gain. I have had several email exchanges with the SureCall support and got great responses. The only downside is that I got the version with the little indoor omni instead of the panel antenna and the panel is better. But I am now buying a ceiling dome which I hope to be better than either of the other two.In summary if you're hesitating between the WeBoost Connect 4G and the SureCall Fusion4Home I would recommend the SureCall.One thing that is somewhat confusing is what the various LED flash patterns really mean. There is a yellow insert sheet that describes them but it's a bit incomplete. Here are a few more notes:- If an LED is OFF it means that the booster is operating in that band at the gain set by the dial i.e. it's doing great (this state is completely missing from the docs).- If an LED is flashing YELLOW it means that automatic gain control (AGC) is reducing the gain (amplification)  in that band below what is set because of feedback between the indoor and outdoor antennas. If you want a stronger indoor signal you need to increase separation.- If an LED is flashing RED it means that AGC is reducing the gain in that band below what is set because the signal from the tower is too strong (I suspect the reduction is primarily on the transmit-to-tower side).In my configuration I'm having insufficient antenna separation for maximum amplification and I'm not that far from towers so what I observe is the following. If I turn the gain for a band all the way down the LED becomes red indicating that the band is off. As I turn up the gain the LED goes to blinking red indicating that the tower signal is strong and AGC is limiting the gain (I presume in the transmit to tower direction). As I turn the gain up further the LED switches to blinking yellow indicating that AGC is also limiting the gain transmitting indoors due to feedback between the two antennas. All this has allowed me to learn much more about what is really happening and I have been able to tune the bands so everything works OK for me. The next step will be to purchase a ceiling dome antenna for indoors because it radiates much less upwards to where the outdoor antenna is. The alternative would be to relocate or raise the outdoor antenna which is more difficult for me.Update may 2017: the booster is still working well for me. I ended up purchasing an indoor dome antenna in order to increase the separation between the outdoor antenna on my roof and the indoor antenna. I selected a "DomeAnt-Alpha Omnidirectional Ceiling Antenna for Boosters Amplifiers Repeaters" after contacting WirEng and getting confirmation that this antenna has the least upwards radiation i.e. interferes the least with the outside antenna above my roof. This antenna made a big difference for me.
5,I will start off this review by saying I rarely write them for Amazon.  I do a lot of research up front and typically buy the best and move on with my day.  In this case I was skeptical if this thing would work for $300 considering there are much more expensive alternatives.  After doing extensive research I decided to get the upgraded  flare unit with the bi-directional antenna because of how poor my cell service was and the fact all the cell towers were equal distance from my location.I unpackaged the unit skipped over the instructions (I watched a lot of youtube videos) and decided I would "cheat" by mounting the antenna to my deck and run the wire through the front of my house to the antenna in my study where I barely got 1 bar (most of the time no service at all).  I hooked everything up in about 20 min and.. Oscillation between the antenna and the booster.  I was hoping I could move it into a corner and get around the issue but it wasn't happening and the overall signal did boost but not enough to make it worth $300.  I unmounted the antenna from the deck and put it in the front of my house with the booster in my living room same situation.  Determined to get this to work I left the antenna in the front of the house mounted to my porch banister and moved the antenna upstairs (luckily I bought 100ft of coxial cable) where it would have more vertical distance between the two.  Plugged in the booster and bam no conflicts and 5 bars of glorious cell service.  Upstairs in my house I was getting 1-2 bars on a good day and would be 4G I was shocked when I saw I was now receiving 5Ge.I decided I could get a little bit better of a signal if I mounted the antenna more direct in-line with the cell tower so I ended up placing the thing in a tree in my front hard and used the supplied hardware to bolt it to a strong branch.  Does it look good?  No.  Does it work?  Absolutely.  It is hidden well enough to where nobody should complain and I am getting max service.Moral of the story do the installation right and you won't have problems.  People complaining probably did not take the time to move the antenna around or the booster and assumed that was the best they could get.  I am living in a rental home a little over 3000sqft and not only does the entire house get 3-5 bars of service now while I was cooking lunch I was watching a youtube video in 1080p and it dawned on me I never re-enabled wifi from the setup of the antenna!  I could not believe I went from not being able to text or receive phone calls to watching youtube.If you are even remotely interested in this product buy it and spend the time to do the install right.  It is worth your time you don't have to suffer with poor service!
4,I have very small 740 sf house surounded by tall houses and trees. I could barely get cell service in house. After installing this unit I am able to finally use data on my phone. Booster blinks to show too close to antenna no matter how far you get the components apart. I just ignore the blinking light because I am getting enough signal now to access data. So it must be doing something to bring signal into the house even if booster is not boosting because blinking light means boost is shut down. All in all I am satisfied.
5,Having recently come to a very remote area of Northern Wisconsin from the "big city" I was losing my mind with no cable or internet and only spotty cellular data access.  My Verizon coverage was zilch in the house and between slim and none outdoors unless I was standing in just the right spot on one leg with the planets aligned (even then slim was VERY slim if any).  My mom's AT&T service was solid outdoors decent at one end of our big old 2-story farmhouse and spotty at the other end.  So I decided to try a booster.  After reading reviews and learning more about "gain" and what the "dB" measures really mean than I thought I'd ever need or want to know I purchased the SureCall Flare 3.0.First you need to know that my Verizon coverage remains abysmal.  When they say this product boosts a signal but cannot create signal from nothing they were just being 100% honest.  Make sure you run a signal test on your phone or can at least make a phone call with your particular carrier outside before investing in this or any product.  I did get the Yagi directional antenna (not the omni) but aside from Verizon installing a tower right in my backyard I don't think any product would get me out of this dead zone.So why did I give this product 5 stars?  It did just what it was supposed to for my mom's AT&T coverage and was quite easy to install even for a person with minimal tech savvy .  We now have a robust AT&T signal throughout the house texts are sent and received quickly websites load in a blink and we've said goodbye to interrupted streaming and the dreaded buffering.  This also means mom can launch a stronger hotspot which has made my life better too.Other tips:  If you only receive a one or two-page manual in the box I suggest you read through the full PDF manual on SureCall's website.  They offer a much better explanation of the LED lights on the booster and what they really mean.  Just the green light is optimal / best function yellow flashing lights on either side mean it is working and working ok just introducing some additional system checks.  Any red lights are the ones that require further action.  This was confusing in the short-form manual I received in the box.  SureCall also has useful videos.For mounting the outside antenna - think about where you're most likely to install this and order or get a mounting pole that is not included.  Yes you do get two u-bolt clamps and a bracket in the box but if I hadn't repurposed an old satellite dish pole mount I would have had to order or get a pole.  I also had success mounting the antenna roughly 12 feet off the ground on the side of the house as I didn't have a safe way of getting up on our steep two-story roof on my own.
3,DO NOT BUY the version with the indoor WHIP antenna!The WHIP antenna is totally worthless -Six feet away and signal goes down!DO NOT BUY the version with the indoor WHIP antenna!The WHIP indoor antenna is useless - I almost sent the whole package back but thought I would try the Directional Indoor Panel Antenna. What a difference (BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SPECIAL CABLE FOR THE INDOOR PANEL CONNECTION! Be sure to order that too!)  Signal inside from -108 db to -80 db throughout the single story house. Mounted the indoor panel on the ceiling and not the wall. Tuned the outdoor Yagi antenna using LTE Discovery and Network Cell Info Lite for highest gain. In my area I am Verizon only no other signals - they are using band 13 and band 66. I tuned for band 13 as I am far away (7 miles) from tower. Band 66 close to the tower is great download speeds but diminishes quickly with distance and obstacles and low spots.Using the top 2 dials for LTE for band 13. Second from top is band 13 and I have it set to full boost. Top dial (according to tech support) is for automotive LTE - but it does increase signal for band 13 when used in conjunction with the second dial. Download speeds are increased and upload speeds are greatly increased on this band 13 tuning.The bottom 3 dials are off on my setup.The bottom dial AWS is for band 66. I can boost that but cannot hold steady signal and eventually shuts down and requires booster reboot. So I have this off as well. Boosts for download speed but upload speed less than optimum. DO NOT BUY the version with the indoor WHIP antenna!I am pleased with my signal in my home now - lots of experimenting screaming at the antenna adjusting person lots of testing of signal strength and download speeds. I added longer coax cable.Yes it works but you must have a signal to start with and tune from there.OH and Did I Mention DO NOT BUY the version with the indoor WHIP antenna! DO NOT BUY the version with the indoor WHIP antenna! DO NOT BUY the version with the indoor WHIP antenna! DO NOT BUY the version with the indoor WHIP antenna! DO NOT BUY the version with the indoor WHIP antenna!Maybe I can get reimbursement from the seller who sold me something that doesn't work. Hopefully this will help you get started with the proper equipment and save you some grief.
4,I bought and installed this for my folks to enhance their service at the house because they were getting a lot of dropped calls.  Enhances both AT&T and Verizon confirmed.  While they are in the area of the device they no longer get dropped calls.NOTES:- Enhances the signal in about a 15 foot radius (30 foot range) around the booster using  providing 2-3x bars out of 5 (coming from 0-2 max before booster).- Booster should not generally be between the cell phone tower and the Antenna.  If it is it will have many sync issues.- If you have poor cell reception in general of 0-1 bars.  This device will help you some but my recommendation would be to get a stronger Yagi Antenna and point it towards the tower to potentially get a stronger signal (This however will only work generally for the specific carriers tower). (Example we would lose reception to the ATT tower if we instead faced an Yagi antenna to Verizon tower) (NOTE THAT YAGI ANTENNAS ARE EXTREMELY FOCUSED AND THE PROVIDED ANTENNA IS WIDE ARRAY MEANING THE DIRECTION AND FREQUENCY REALLY DOESNT MATTER A WHOLE LOT).**  Boosts signal respectively ** - if you have 0-1 bars you can expect 1-3 bars.  If you have 2-3 bars you can expect 3-5 bars.  if you have 3-4 bars expect... not to need it? (5 bars).  HOWEVER it also acts like a tower itself the further you get away from it the weaker the signal.  If you currently have only 0-1 bars I would consider a more expensive model because it will broadcast the weak signal respectively over 15ish feet.  Meaning you will get 1 bar at 15 feet away instead of the 2 bars at 4 feet.  You can expect that 3rd bar at 2 feet.  A stronger booster that covers a larger range would give you better signal at 15 feet if say is range was 30 feet.Our Setup:- Outside Antenna is mounted outside above roofline on PVC Pipe at least 25 feet above ground.- Booster mounted in kitchen/living room area where most people use their devices.  I installed the device using RG-6 wire.Pros:- No more dropped calls when using nearby device.- Works with multiple carriers.- works as advertisedCons:- If you have 0-1 bars currently the devices working range is very limited.  It would work better in an area where you are getting a solid 1-2 bars.  For that reason the Kit really should provide a Yagi antenna (with the downside that you dont get multiple cell providers like you do with the current antenna that is provided.- Range is very limited for people with already poor reception.- the listing for square footage is very misleading.  It enhances a strong signal in potentially the same coverage areaOverall I wouldn't buy this specific product again OR... If I did I would want a Yagi Antenna instead or I would buy a version with at least 1.5X and above coverage.  I would recommend this type of product in general though.
4,This is product is not a simple plug it in and it works type of product.  You have to understand what you are doing and spend the time configuring it.  When I initially hooked everything up it didn't really increase my signal at all but after performing some tests and fine tuning the configuration it work great!  I went from having 1 signal or less (-117 DB or less) and dropping calls to 3 bars of signal (-99 dbm or higher) and no dropped calls or interference.1. You must know where the closest cell tower is and find the direction of the strongest signal.  I was able to put the receiving antenna in my attic.  After testing several locations using the LTE Discovery app on my phone I found a spot and direction in my attic that had -94 dbm. -94 dbm was much better than the - 117 dbm in my office and the - 127 dbm in my basement.  I setup my "external" antenna there pointed at the nearest cell tower.  Luckily I already have an RG6 cable running from the attic to the basement.2.  You must find an ideal location for your internal antenna.  It needs to face a different direction than the external antenna.  Also consider the strength of your source signal when determining the sqft coverage required.  I bought the 4000 sqft model but because my source signal is so weak I am only getting about 1000 sqft of coverage. I ended up putting my internal antenna in my basement fairly close to my office upstairs and pointed it horizontally in the floor joists.3. Verify your signal strength before and after using the LTE Discovery app.  My office started with - 117 dbm and ended with - 99 dbm.  My basement started with - 127 dbm (couldn't even make or receive calls) and ended with - 87 dbm.  I no longer have any dropped calls or interruptions anywhere in my house.  I'm sure if my source signal was even stronger like 3 bars outside then my boosted signal inside would be even better.
4,This review is for the SureCall Fusion4Home Yagi/Whip model. I found the booster took me from 1 bar to 2 using an iPhone 6 and an iPhone 7. It seems to have improved the reliability of calls and gotten rid of dead spots in our 1200 sq ft house. It is important to follow the directions regarding status LEDs. Since our tower is about 7 miles away overloaded (red) bands were not a problem. SureCalls antenna aiming directions are pretty lame so I did some research and ended up with the following procedure:1. Using the OpenSignal App on an iPhone I located the direction of the cell tower from our house and mounted the antenna up on the roof with line of sight to that location. The app is pretty good and as it turns out got me to within 4 degrees of dead on. This will probably work for most people but I decided to go further in my quest to accurately aim the yagi antenna.2. Using Cellmapper.net on a PC I located the tower on their map. You need to use OpenSignal first because because some mapped towers might be much closer but their antennas not pointed toward you. In my case all the 3 mile away towers were the wrong ones and the 7 mile distant tower was the one my phone was using.3. To fine tune the compass bearing I went to the route mapping site acscdg.com on my PC and drew a line from my house to the cell tower. The data box field labeled "Azimuth" is the compass bearing for that line. Neither Google Maps nor Google Earth will let you do this. I really had to dig to find acscdg.com.4. I then used the Compass app on my iPhone to aim the antenna. Be sure to go into settings and enable location services and true north for the app. Be sure to level the compass (screen 2) or it will be wrong. Final aiming should be very close to what OpenSignal alone gives you.One final note. The SureCall seems to go to sleep overnight with no phone activity. All band LEDs go amber. I sometimes have to wake it up by calling a number several times (I use the US Naval Observatory Time number) to reactivate the bands. Not sure if the WeBoost does this too but if it does not it might be worth the extra money. I took off one star for this "feature".
4,I have no problem installing this but I have been in electronics for 40 years. I like that the inside antenna has VHF connectors on the cable. It is also long enough to put the indoor antenna a good distance from the amplifier. Some of these units only have about six feet or less of cable for the internal antenna or it is connected directly to the amplifier. This unit has a YAGI UDA antenna. I don't have a lot of signal in my area so I wanted a higher gain antenna. I mounted the antenna on a tower about 36' above the ground.  I used a phone program to determine the direction to point the antenna. Pointing the antenna correctly can have a significant impact on the received signal.  I reset my phone turned off the power for two minutes and then turned it back on while on the tower to get the best signal information available and pointed the antenna as indicated. This could have been done better if I had someone inside to monitor signal strength but I was working alone. Inside The signal inside increased from about -120 to -85. My Samsung Galaxy 6 Active only shows 2 bars LTE signal. My Mom's phone on 3G sent from 0 bars to 4 bars.Bottom line is it went from not working to working. This is inside a steel building and the phone signal just does not exist in there.I was expecting a better response on the LTE signal. I selected this unit specifically to work with our ATT service. I also selected the YAGI UDA as it is the best antenna offered. This is not the most expensive product available but certainly not the least either.I will attempt to improve the signal later when I work on the tower. I will be able to raise the antenna and have a helper to dynamically point the antenna for maximum signal.I have another unit by this manufacturer. I also get low LTE bars on that unit but the phones do work. That one has an omnidirectional antenna at 15 to 20 feet above ground. I don't expect as much from it at that level and without a directional antenna. With unit turned off the phones do not work so we know it does help. My wife's older phone Galaxy S3 gets full strength indications. I am not sure how the S6 is calculating signal or manages the bands but it is obviously different from the S3 and my Mom's LG.I have used amplifiers from another major brand and I picked this one because it had specifications specifically for ATT LTE.
4,Picked this up for my 5th wheel.  In my current location/campground I get about 1-2 bars 4G with Verizon.  This does work don't get me wrong it just doesn't work as well as I hoped.The main issue seems to be distance between the two antennas.  Apparently I can't get the exterior antenna far enough away from the interior antenna to remove interference.  I am constantly unplugging the base unit to reset it and get at least 5 minutes where it doesn't think there is interference.  Still increased my download speed by at least 2x though.  Maybe I'll call tech support and ask someday.Not hard to set up you just need to buy (or already have) a mount for the exterior antenna.  I used a piece of 1" PVC zip tied it to my AM/FM/HDTV antenna on the top of my 5th wheel and went from there.  Not hard to do at all.
4,Used this setup while camping we have Verizon phones.  It did boost the cell tower signal from 2 to 3 bars and my laptop websites loaded a little faster.  The closer your phone is to the base unit the better the cell tower reception.  I turned on my Hotspot plugged it into a charger and laid it directly on the base unit and got the best reception.
4,I swear that as I ageI spend more money than I ever didand as I look around90% of my purchases were not REALLY needed...and all bought at Amazon. Amazon..a Huge Company that works well and for out in the Sticks folksolder and less driving to shopa fix. I AM getting to this reviewthe aforementioned a help to understand why I am giving a Great review to this product. I purchased i4t because Verizon have up on us older non city Folk and our reception has been saddropped callsstanding on one old wobbly Leg with phone held high just to get a hotspotthe ONLY web access available out here.So I spent almost three times more than the purchase price to get this device installed on my roof. It didn't work. For the 1st time in 40 years my Wife considered moving to "The City" I felt more stupid than normal. Then I called supportfiguring a long waitand folks I couldn't understand who obviously didn't own or know anything about thier product.What a great suprise! THE SUPPORT WAS ON THE LINE IN MINUTESWITH A CLEAR VOICED WELL INFORMED ENGINEER! HE confirmed what I hoped was the problem...the only Antenna choice upon purchase is an Omini typewhich is probably the right one for the seller because it cuts down on install time if the owner lives near civilization. Support suggested I try a Yaggi type that can be directed at the signal source as opposed to a 360° omni style which apparently doesn't have a bunch of little Yagi's inside and is a comprimize of sortsagain...probably all most folks need. WOW! It works! If there is even a slight signalthe antenna picks it upmagnifies it and transmits a clean usable signal broadcast through a nice looking transmitter.( One factor in choice when looking on Amazon site (there are manymost cost moresome much morehowever they have to use similar tech so I chose with my Wife's approval)The bottom line is IT WORKS and if it doesn'tthe seller has GREAT informed SUPPORT that is easy to work with over the phone! I do not give a lot of reviews and have not been paid never even been offered $ for any reviews but some barter help only if u promise a good review and this company only helped...as all sellers should and all sellers used to.5g isn't coming to us Old Country dwellers so it's a rush to find a new merchandiser with old respectedexpected help.
5,We have a family cabin in a fairly rural area in the Uinta Mountains in northern Utah. Up until around April 2020 we used to be able to get moderately usable signals from the Verizon cell towers about 23 miles away in Evanston Wyoming. On good days we could get 12-15mbps data speeds even at that distance but usually only when standing outside the cabin and it wasn't reliable.Unfortunately the signal quickly degraded this year to the point where our phones (sometimes) still said that they had an LTE connection in some locations but never had any data or phone service of any kind any more. And frequently went into offline mode with no signal at all. Multiple calls to Verizon did not produce any improvement so I shopped around for a signal booster and decided on this one because it advertises better rural reception than some other options and it is certified to be compatible with 5G in the future (not important right now but a nice feature).I installed the outdoor antenna about 25 feet above ground on a pole attached to the cabin's fireplace chimney. I pointed it in the exact compass direction of the Evanston cell towers and ran the cable into the cabin hooked it up to the amp and then set up the indoor booster antenna. We immediately got better results in that we were able to get a usable signal some of the time. But it was only a small improvement and somewhat disappointing considering the cost of the kit.I decided to do some experimenting and started turning the antenna a few degrees at a time in both directions away from the "correct" orientation. One direction made the signal worse but the other actually gave an improvement. I spent about two hours carefully and slowly adjusting the antenna to get the best signal. I ended up settling on having it pointing about 30 degrees east of Evanston instead of directly at Evanston and now we get nearly perfect signals almost all of the time. I suspect this worked because of the way the hills and valleys are laid out in the area so the signal is bouncing around a bit instead of being a direct transmission.We still do lose the signal once in a while particularly during the hottest afternoon hours but when it works the signal is just as strong and fast as if we were standing in the middle of a busy city with excellent coverage.I strongly recommend that you take the time to get the outdoor antenna aimed properly. The results are surprisingly good once it is set up properly!
5,When I initially approached this project as an IT guy I was hoping that the devices would be relatively simple and I could get something under $100.  I was looking to get my sister's family a viable internet option as they're in the country off a dirt road and there's little chance anything reliable will come their way anytime soon.I knew from testing that I could get a decent signal with my phone outside in their yard but in the house there was nothing.  I also knew that the signal was sporadic at best even when I could get it.  I wasn't sure what could be the issue and that's when I did my homework.In the 4G spectrum when buying an antenna you have to be concerned with the carrier that is closest.  To my surprise AT&T (normally not very prolific in the area) has an antenna closer than the Verizon antenna (our carrier).  Had I bought a cheaper antenna it would have latched on to the AT&T signal and that would have been end of story.I bought this because it has several 'dials' that allow you to turn up and down (or off) the signal from certain providers.  Once I installed the antenna at a good height (on a light pole in the yard giving us almost above roof height).  I turned all signals off except the Verizon 4G.  We started to get service in the house off the base antenna.After that it was simply a question of positioning the Yagi antenna (directional) in a way that we felt was best.  We were surprised to learn the Verizon signal was coming from a completely different direction then we assumed it would.This is the nature of these types of installs.  I bought an additional 50' of Coax and a male-to-male connector (barrel) to extend the length of the external antenna to base.  Then we opened a window and simply put the base unit in the house (you want to keep the two far apart because the base unit will broadcast a signal that the yagi picks up and that'll give you a loop) and then before attaching anything we spent a good few hours moving the antenna around and messing with the dials.  I had a good idea of what was going to be the best dial setting (that was correct) but I really would have messed up the external antenna install up without some testing.Results:Went from a few bar 3G signal in house to almost full bar 4G.  My sister and her family are now able to use their data to its limits my nephew has access to internet for school work and as long as they keep devices down they can stream netflix/amazon prime.  It has been a complete game changer for them.
3,The cell signal in my house is terrible one bar on a good day when the wind blows in the right direction. No signal at all in my office in my basement where I spend my days. I bought this based on good reviews hoping it would solve the problem. I saw the bad reviews but hoped I'd be one of the lucky ones. Has it worked? Well sort of sometimes but overall not really and I'm not sure it ever will and it's a royal pain to mess with.This thing is a major pain to install and get working. In principle it is simple in reality it's almost impossible. The directions said to find the best signal. OK I did the research found the closest tower and aimed the antenna at it. Then the "oh no the signal is too strong!" red light flashed. So I turned the antenna and turned it and turned it until it pointed directly away from the closest antenna before it stopped flashing red. Then there is the "oh no you're too close to the antenna" flashing yellow light. I've moved it away then farther then farther until I am certainly way way farther away than the 25 feet away from the antenna they require by a lot I moved it until I couldn't position it any father away and be in my house then it finally stopped flashing. Or so I thought. Then the yellow flashing started again because--why? How could I suddenly be closer than I was? The wind blowing from that direction? Give me a break. I unplug it let it sit then plug it back in and the flashing stops. Why is that? This thing is flaky as all get-out. It sort of works sometimes so I know it's not defective and I've read similar complaints by others and I probably should have taken them more seriously. I've put too many hours into trying to make it work I can't face climbing back up on the roof taking it all down packing it up and sending it back. I'm really disgusted with it. I honestly cannot recommend this product. Others have had good luck with it and I'm happy for them. You might be one of the lucky ones who knows? I just don't think it really works very well from my perspective.
3,We have a ranch east of Mt. Hamilton California.  We could not receive or make any calls leaving alone using Internet or receiving emails. If we had to make a call we had to drive to the top of the hill or out of the ranch.I bought SureCall Fusion4Home in early July and solved the problem. We could make calls and use Internet though very slow internet. Unfortunately August 2020 mountain fire took it along with the structures.Now we have built a shed and powered it with solar energy but in the valley with much poorer signal. I bought almost an identical booster and  installed it. We immediately could make and receive calls and get online with Verizon LTE. Maybe because mountains are all bare after fire I get 2 bars of LTE from almost 0.Updated on 10/2021: Same as the first booster it only covers probably 10sf instead of 3000sf. The most annoying thing was that it needed to be rebooted from time to time. I contacted the manufacturer tech support. The guy was very responsive and helpful.  They have a very undesirable company policy. You have to send the booster back to them for testing before they would replace it. Fortunately their office is just 20 minutes from our home. I was able to drop it off and the guy could test it and give me a replacement. It seemed to have solved needing reboot problem. But the covered area is still small and undependable.I recently bought a much cheaper booster (half price of this one) from a different brand. It works much much better.  I consistently have 3- 4 bars and the covered area is at least 10 times bigger.  I bought the antenna adapters to swap the two to make a better comparison between the two. The result is disappointing. The much more expensive device falls behind by far. The cell phone signal booster by nature is asymmetric. It can give you a good download speed but the uploading speed is next to 0.So I bought a Verizon Jetpack hotspot and a pair of MIFI antennas for it. Now we have near 20Mbps downloading speed and 1 Mbps uploading speed.
5,We moved to a rural area two years ago and didn’t realize that high speed internet and reliable cell service would not exist out here. We got a Verizon hotspot which gave us 1 bar and sometimes 2 and allowed for frustratingly slow internet service. We found two places in the house where we could make phone calls but if you moved just a few feet away the call would drop. My wife began to research cell phone signal boosters and decided on this one. I am always super suspicious of things like this and regard them as likely snake oil but since we knew we could return it if it didn’t work we decided to give it a try. When we first got it and plugged it in it did absolutely nothing for improving our signal. I walked around the house and upstairs with the antenna pointing it various directions and getting as far away from the base unit as possible. Still didn’t work and my suspicions that it was useless were confirmed. Before we boxed it up to send back my wife insisted I mount it to the outside of the house on the highest point just to be sure. I very reluctantly got out the ladder and did it and plugged it in and our phones for the first time ever at the new house jumped to 4 bars! Our hotspot that provides our internet access also jumped to 4 bars. I was really shocked because I had been certain that it was useless. The key thing to success was getting the antenna high enough. Where I had it mounted it wasn’t visually acceptable so we ordered an antenna mast and 50 more feet of cable. It is currently mounted on the mast at about 30 feet pointed to the nearest town which has a cell phone antenna mounted on a water tower. With the cost of the mast booster extra cable and mast mounting hardware the total cost came to about $1000. However we can now enjoy good internet and phone service and even watch Netflix which was out of the question before. You can reliably talk on the phone anywhere in the house including the basement. Mind you the internet is not as fast as it was in the city but it’s very acceptable. A good investment for us despite my skepticism. Just be aware the antenna needs to be up quite high to work in some applications like ours.
4,We had 1 bar before we installed it afterwards we were getting 4 to 5 bars on our cell phones. Unfortunately with 2 weeks our bars started to dwindle. We figured it was the power supply when it went totally down. We are having a problem trying to find a replacement.
5,*** Got in contact with the company and was sent to a voicemail which I figured would be the furthest I'd get. After a few minutes I had a live rep from CA on the phone with me to troubleshoot my issue. Once I gave him the readings from my multimeter he immediately shipped a replacement part which I received in the mail today and all is working again!*** After only 10 months of use the booster just died and will not power back on! Way to expensive for something that did not last even a year! ***I must admit that I was a bit skeptical about this product since I live in a valley between mountains with virtually zero cell coverage. I am required to be on-call and be available by phone or text for my job but living in the area that I do meant that I'd get delayed/jumbled text messages or I'd get a ring if I was lucky and I'd have to go find signal up the road and make a phone call. Usually my phone never rang and I'd just get a random voicemail alert.Before installing this signal booster my cellphone would go between 1 bar of service roaming or just no service at all. Well let me tell you something about this signal booster. I pulled it straight out of the box when I came in from work tongiht and did a temporary setup just to see if it was worth the price that I paid for the product. I gathered together an old antenna pole and some tools and mounted the antenna roughly pointing in the direction that I know the closest cell tower is to my location which is about 4.5 miles away. After connecting all of the cables and plugging in the power supply I went and grabbed my phone. As soon as I picked up my phone the first thing that I noticed was that my phone was showing 4 bars of service!!!! This is impressive considering I was standing in my basement which was a deadzone for my phone. I moved up stairs where I had the panel antenna on the floor at the top of my stairs and I still had 4 bars of service! I sent some picture text and made a phone call just to see if it would really work and for the  first time ever I was able to send a picture message in just a matter or seconds and was able to make a crystal clear phone call without dropping the call!I moved around my house a bit trying to see how far I could move away from the antenna without loosing service. At this time I have everything temporarly mounted to one side of my house. I was able to walk to the opposite side of my house and at the far end I still had 2 bars of service. I'm confident once I install the signal booster in a secure location adjust the antenna and place the booster and panel antenna in a more central location that I'll have excellent coverage throughout my home!My only regret is not buying this signal booster a long time ago!
4,Cell phone signal boosters are often need in fringe areas or where cell signals are weaker due to terrain.  These will not drastically improve poor connections if you can't get a signal this won't magically get you one but it does a good job of stabilizing drops due to building structures in marginal areas.It takes some work to get the locations right for these and you will need to run cabling into your home but the instructions and help videos provided by SureCall get you the information you need.  If you're not comfortable with working on ladders or running cables hire that part out.While this kit has all that's needed to put an antenna up and start running you'll need additional items such as masts or mounts cable surge suppressors and various tools.  You will likely need to set things up temporarily and move them around until it works best for you.My only issue was a contact with tech support.  I got a directional antenna because my cell connections were always finding a specific tower that's just at the end of the range.  It's also geographically the nearest to my home.  Then my provider T-Mobile started playing with the towers as they upgraded to 5G and my connections were bouncing between towers.  I asked tech support whether the omni directional antenna would cure that issue and they gave me a canned response about using the equipment according to the directions.  Further communications resulted in similar canned response.  Fortunately my provider settled down and I'm back and running no longer dropping calls at home.This will not boost 5G signals for that you'll need a more expensive unit.
5,My partner & I decided to purchase land in rural Vermont to start pursuing our dream of living a more self-sustaining lifestyle. At the time we purchased this off-grid property the seller had told us that Wi-Fi as available which is great because I work from home. Upon purchasing we realized this was not the case...I called every provider in the area and outside of spending about $120 - $200 a month on a service that included cable & phone (which we do not need) via an un-reliable satellite we knew there had to be a better option.I did hours of research when I came upon the SureCall products I was going back and forth between the Flare & the whole-home option but our cabin is only 860 sqft so I decided to go with the Flare first and worst case I could always upgrade if needed.Of the reviews I read many were complaining about the setup however I found it to be extremely straight-forward. The instructions were clear I will say that the phone number it says to call that changes your signal strength meter to dB did not work on my IPhone. For us it didn't make a big difference because we already knew more or less where the best cell signal was. It helped that we have some trade knowledge but really anyone could install this product with a little determination. Now these signal boosters are NOT magic you have to have a cell signal in order for them to work. At the cabin we got 2 bars of LTE in some spots outside and none inside unless you stood with your phone literally touching the window!I highly recommend a dry run before attaching - my boyfriend stood outside with the antenna BEFORE attaching to the house we plugged everything in inside and within seconds we saw the LTE bars go from 0 to 4 - it was truly incredible. Once we determined that was a good spot we attached the antenna to the house using the hardware provided. For our situation the 50ft of coax cable was more than enough but make sure you have enough to ensure you have 25 feet of separation from the antenna outside to the responder inside. After that I connected my Verizon MIFI Hotspot work laptop and phone and was able to get a solid 3-4 bars consistently throughout the day. As you move around the space it does tend to drop so long-term I may upgrade to the whole-home option but for right now this products works perfectly & is certainly worth the investment for a small space!
3,I’m not impressed for the cost and amount of time and effort for installation . I work from home and I just don’t see the improvement I was hoping for.
4,Working very well money is worth it very very good signal
5,We got lucky and happened to already have a pole mounted in just the right spot on the roof. So we had only to attach the antenna and run the included 50 foot coax cable along the roof to the appropriate room down the siding and up through the floor. That's the hardest part which my s/o said went much more smoothly than he expected.Once you get the coax cable inside it really is just plug and play. It couldn't be simpler. We just assumed there was some sort of programming we needed to do and were surprised to learn that we were done. It was working!After installation we were able to watch youtube videos in multiple rooms without issue. We made a phone call between the middle of the house (not far from the outdoor antenna) and the room at the opposite end of the house from the indoor piece worked great. I ran a speed test in the room with the indoor piece which previously got little to no signal (phone calls and texts were often not possible). I got 13 mbps down and 3 up and the down speed was much more consistent than the speed test before install. I realize that objectively speaking 13 mbps is appalling but this is a place where 1 mbps passes for a reasonable internet speed and that's on ethernet.I walked all around the outside of the house a couple of times with my Android in field test mode prior to installing. The numbers ranged from -120 to -101 (-101 being the spot underneath where we installed the antenna). Indoors in the room that we put the inside piece the field test number was -125 prior to installation. I can't remember what the number was after installation... I think it was -100. I'll have to test it again the next time I go there.Oh the distance between the indoor piece and the outdoor antenna was roughly 45 feet horizontally. 25 is considered the minimum I believe.We've had it installed less than a day but we love it so far! If I remember I'll come back and update after some time goes by.
3,This product didn’t really help my cell signal
5,Recently moved into a three story 5500sf stone and large timber built house with an additional 2000sf of basement on 3 acres of land. It's in a rural area with only one (not so great) ISP option other than satellite internet. Cellphone reception is two bars outside and one inside and zero in the basement. So I needed an affordable option to get decent to good cellphone service.* In the backyard we have an old 45ft radio tower and near the top is where I installed the directional Yagi antenna. I used the cable that came with it and ran that down the length of the tower into a demarcation enclosure   CableGuard CG-2000 Coax Demarcation Enclosure        * Inside the enclosure I connected the cable into a Wilson Electronics Lightning Surge Protector   Wilson Electronics Lightning Surge Protector N-Female (50 Ohm)         The other end of the cable was then connected into a 100ft Wilson cable   Wilson Electronics 100 ft. Black Wilson400 Ultra Low Loss Coax Cable (N-Male to N-Male)        . and ran underground in conduit that eventually comes into the server room (Everything is properly grounded with 10awg wire into a grounding rod)* Inside the house all cables where connected to the booster and then into a splitter   Wilson Electronics -4.8 dB 3-Way Splitter N-Female (50 Ohm)          using a short 2ft cable   SureCall 2' SC-400 Ultra Low-Loss Coax Cable with N-Male Connectors - Black        * I have three antennas coming off the splitter to cover almost all areas of the house. One is an omin-directional   SureCall Wide Band Omni-Directional Internal Ceiling Mount Dome Antenna (includes mounting kit 698 - 2700 MHz)          another is   SureCall Wide Band Directional Internal Wall Mount Panel Antenna  (includes mounting kit 698 - 2700 MHz)         . The third is the antenna that comes with the kit.***NOTE*** I interchangeably used SureCall & Wilson/Weboost connectors cables antennas and other misc items. I found that as long as you had the correct ends on the cables or at least the correct adapter it all worked with each other.* I had to use these to extend cables   uxcell 2pcs N Female to Female Coax Connector Adapter Couplers        This whole process was very time consuming labor intensive and expensive once you add it all up. But in the end worth it and needed. We now get an average of 3 bars inside and sometimes LTE in some places of the house. In the basement we get 3 bars regularly. The whole system is not without it's own hiccups. After three months of running this system I've only had to reboot the system once and have yet to have to call support. Other than that is it almost like install it and let it do it's thing.
5,So glad we bought this. Only had one bar in our country home before and now up to four. When folks called we often had to go outside to talk  I called a place specializing in cell boosters. They ran me through cell power tests and said only the $1100 booster would work for our situation. I waited two months for that booster to drop in price but since our wifi also is not good I needed to make a decision.For a third the price I tried SureCall. It was a two person job to install and took 4 hours (we really wanted to make sure we were installing in the right location and never could get the orange light to stop blinking where it worked best). You are supposed to aim for having enough distance between the outside antenna and the inside base to achieve a green light on the base unit. We didn't buy any extra cable and even if we had a ranch house is only so big. Anyway lots of crawling around in the attack getting the cable to it's location after we choose our outside location on our one story house. Ironically it worked best about 8 feet up between the garage doors. (We tried the roof). Sometimes the orange light goes away and it is just green. But always we have at least three bars. We can even talk in the basement now even though the base unit is in there living room.Last night the kids learned they could play Fortnite using the Verizon hotspot. They haven't been able to really complete lagless since we moved here 8 months ago. They are super happy.There were places outside where we could previously get 3 and 4 bars with your tongue sticking out so I'm glad we took our chances with this purchase. Take your time on installation. It's the most important part.
4,Update: I still struggle with the transmitting antenna in the home. It's more directional than I'd like but this may be a limitation of the current tech available requiring it.I've since walked around my house with my cell on a poll testing speeds. Since there are multiple towers in the area they keep load jumping me between them and all are 2-6mi away. Of course the closest is an underpowered tower with the slowest speeds. My top tower is 4mi away with 30mb/s so I aimed at it and mounted my antenna outside under the eve. This improved my consistency of reception quite a bit.Attached are my speed tests which I get quite a bit of variation on for speeds do to the load jumping so I posted those that seemed most consistent along with transmitting through walls. I would really suggest not trying to go through walls where you can help it!Original Review: I mounted it in the attic (not outside) and I went from. .5mbs without to 11.2mbs with. I would encourage using a real compass and not an app. I originally used a 100' double shielded coax that had already been run through my house... seemed to work almost as well as the 50' that came with but generally the shorter the cable the better as long as you keep the minimum distances in mind.If you have an installed but unused existing antenna cable dsl or satellite coax already run outside you can hook into that.I would also say the most difficult thing is finding a reliable app or website sharing your carrier's tower location. I went to three recommended ones and all three claimed different locations.The transmitting antenna is fairly directional so it's better placed near an end of your home. It does not go through floors well but I understand there are other antennas that could be better. Despite this working on a 100' coax I'm sure that cutting off any notable amount of extra cable would help.Only minor problem I had it that all three major components seem to work best when further apart and antennas facing away from each other. This is probably why both antennas are directional.The 4 stars is because the transmitting antenna appears to be overly directional. I'll be looking to replace it or add a second if allowable.
5,From 1-2 bars LTE to  2-3 bars 5g.Worth every penny.  We are off the grid.  Phenomenal upgrade
5,I have a deer camp in a remote area of Alabama and there is no cell service at the camp.  If you need to make a call or text you have to drive about five miles on a rough dirt road to an area where you can get service...We call this area the phone booth.  Every night my fellow hunters and I make the run to the phone booth...Not any more!!!My fellow hunters had tried similar devices before and told me to not waist my money but after reading all the reviews on Amazon...I thought why not give it a try...I mean I could always return it for a refund.  I installed it on one of them telescopic pool cleaner poles (Because I had one laying around) and mounted on top of a light pole outside my trailer at camp...Total of about 25 feet in height.  Ran the cable through a window and hooked everything up.  My phone showed two bars but only when my phone was within 18 inches of the indoor base unit...Not anywhere in my trailer like advertised.  Came home and fired of an email to their support.  I started off telling them my situation and how I installed it...I ask about 20 questions on how to make it perform better and sent the email.  I got a reply the same day with answers to all my questions and suggestions to improve my reception...Now that’s customer service.I was told the range from and around the base unit is dependent on the incoming cell signal.  So have no cell signal I’m not going to get much range.  But I’m totally happy with that...I now can make and receive calls and texts.  I make my phone a hotspot and lean it against the base.  I can then use my iPad anywhere in my trailer. I’m still trying different configurations trying to improve my reception and will update this post.  Bottom line is I now have the ability to make and receive calls and text...Which is why I purchased this product.  It does what it says it will..Highly recommend this product
3,This item didn't work for us. There is little to no improvement.
3,Install was simple enough. I put the antenna on a 15’ wooden pole outside of my trailer. I ran the cable all the way under my trailer and up into my living room which only left 2’ of cable left. So I ran the total Length of the cable yet I’m getting the flashing yellow on the right side which indicates it’s too close to the antenna and thus not getting the best reception possible. Doesn’t make sense to me since I’m literally as far away as possible since I have no more slack in the cable. Signal went from 1 bar in the trailer to 2-3 bars. Only in the living room though. If I go into the next room over it drops to 1. If I set literally 3 feet from it I get full signal. But stand 10’ away and get 2-3. Does that have anything to do with the blinking yellow not giving me the best signal it can give? For what I paid I feel like this thing should work better.2/12/2022 UPDATEthis thing has stopped working like 98% of the time. Lights indicate it’s in proper working order and receiving signal but I’m not getting anything inside my house when I have service outside.  Would not advise purchasing.
5,Went from barely sending texts inside to two strong bars of LTE can stream video with little to no issue. Installed outside antenna on an old Dish Network satellite mount was even able to use the coax cable from the satellite this made my install very simple as the cable was already ran. I didn’t have exceptionally high hopes for this but with nothing but issues with my internet provider I wanted to give it a shot and I’m impressed so far. Don’t expect the device to perform miracles you must have service at the outside antenna. In my opinion it seems that this booster will bring whatever quality signal you have outside to the inside of the house so as long as you can get a quality signal somewhere outside it should work. The lights on my inside antenna show that it should be moved further away from the outside antenna sometimes but it’s already thirty five feet away I have not worried about it yet as it’s intermittent and the booster is working well however I may play with it someday and see if I can get even more speed out of it. The boosters only been up a couple of days I will update this review if any issues arise. Give it a shot it’s kind of expensive but based on its construction and how well its working so far I’d recommend it. Only complaint I’d say is the cable would have been far too short for a clean install had I not used the old satellite TV system for the installation.
2,I kept getting the flashing yellow light on the right side which according to the manual that came with it and the pdf I downloaded means there is oscillation between booster and antenna.  The specs say you need 25 feet of distance between which I had achieved more than that with vertical separation as well.  I went and bought a 100' same ohm rated quad insulate coax to replace the 50'it comes with.  I increased separation and using a laser measured 72' of separation.  Still same issue and when the light was flashing it goes from 5g to 4g.  So I look up some info online and everything I find says for a 72dB gain booster you need 100-125' of separation.  I call tech support and they tell me that the manual is wrong amd the light flashing is normal.  Well I know the few times intermittently when it wasn't flashing I was getting 5g and speed test was 26mbps when flashing I'm getting 4g at 2-6mbps.  So this booster seems to work some of the time but I seem to get better service most of the time without it
3,PRO - It does improve the speeds when it works right but randomly it will just kill the internet signal (without it my internet never loses connection) until I unplug the extender then re-plug it in. (happens a few times every hour)CON - It always shows the blinking light indicating that the The antenna is to close to the extender even when I relocated it as far as the cord that came with it could go. I bought a 20ft extension for it and moved it around the house but it worked worse with the extender further away.  Catch 22 move it closer and a red light pops on and the whole thing shuts down but get a cord to extend the range and it slows down worse then ever (even slower then having no extender.
5,If you're like me you've spent weeks or months reading everything you could about repeaters/signal boosters and you probably are concerned about the occasional negative reviews that tell you "its not worth it." I suspect that some of those folks probably didn't optimize their antenna placements or maybe the signal outside their house was always poor to begin with because this product is SWEET!This is the model I decided on and my wife and I made it our Christmas Gift to each other because of the price and our need for better LTE data. It was well worth it!I spent a lot of time researching the direction of my nearest Verizon tower (3.75 miles away); even mapping it to determine the degrees on the compass to be sure I'm pointing the Yagi antenna in the right direction. Otherwise I just followed the directions; too easy!I've got a 2700 Sq. Ft. cape cod with a basement. I permanently installed the Yagi after determining the optimal placement on a 12' steel pole mounted to the exterior and I've (temporary) installed the internal panel antenna in my basement but I think I'm going to put it on my main level.  With the panel antenna in the basement before we would get 3-bars of 3G Verizon service to maybe 1-bar of 4G LTE on the main level but as soon as I turned it on we got 2-3 bars of 4G LTE in the basement (no surprise) and 1-2 bars of CONSISTENT 4G LTE on the main level... so yeah I'm going to move the internal panel to my main level so I can get 3 bars of LTE where I live the most.If you're concerned about the cost; think about how much of your life might involve internet access and dependable phone service... don't go cheap on a unit that is a couple hundred dollars... and if you have a large home I'd even say to avoid the model that has the whip antenna. Spend the $500 and get this model; consider it an investment in your family and lifestyle.
1,Delivered Aug 14 2022. Installed as instructed.  Our first placement displayed color error code that manual stated to close to antenna needed to be at least 25 feet apart.  Unplugged power and moved to another location and seemed to worked.  3 days later same code (display color) comes up.  Thought maybe to close to internet router so unplugged power and moved again.. 3 days later same code. Unplugged power and moved again further away.  3 days later same code.  Called "Tech" support.  They stated manual shipped with unit not up to date.  Manual on line is current and with that display code an additional reason was listed.  Tech stated antenna was searching for a better cell location.  (Really? Every 3 days?) I asked why is it every 3 days it displays.  His answer was I don't know.It seems that unplugging power resets the error light because one time I removed power but left where it was and error light gone when powered back up until 3 days later.Also the 3500 sq ft listed in description is not correct.  Our house is 1 story rectangle about 1800 sq ft.  Even though manual states not to go by bars on phone we do.  In the back bedrooms bars range from 1 to 3 same as before.  If in same room as unit usually 3 to 5.  The unit is sitting in the middle of the house so bedroom furthest apart about 20 to 25 ft away.Conclusion do not waste extra money on this unit thinking it will help in a large house.  Get a cheaper unit probably work just as well.
5,I have very poor service outside (1-2 bars max -110db at best). This was mostly due to obstructions. My house is at the bottom of an 800ft driveway; at the top of my driveway I have 3 bars of service.I replaced the 50 foot rg6 with 50ft of rg-11 (to optimize the little signal I do have outside) and also hooked it into a grounding block (this is not mentioned in the manual but required by the NEC). It provides a path for static electricity to ground out preventing a lightning strike and a allowing for a clearer signal.I’m giving it 5 stars because it does work and it works significantly better than the zboost unit I had (didn’t even cover one room and didn’t boost LTE). Before getting on the roof with the Yagi antenna I simply hooked this into the existing zboost antenna. It was a significant improvement over the zboost unit! I did add the Yagi antenna in the mix which did seem to improve coverage.However - be wary of the square footage claims. If you have very poor service outside and/or don’t provide adequate separation between the antennas it will not cover as much as you hope. In my case adding an extra 10-20 feet to the antenna mast (already 10 foot off my roof) would help since there is service higher up but then guy wires would be necessary and therefore more holes in my roof. So I decided not to go that route.In my case I was hoping it would cover the entire house. Initially I mounted the directional panel antenna at one end of the house (it’s a one-story ranch) but the signal never made it to the other end. I ended up mounting it closer to the middle. Even though it’s directional the signal does seem to radiate backwords some. In my case I was able to get a consistent 2 bars of service in the rooms behind the panel with 4-5 bars and a significantly faster download speeds in the rooms directly in front of the antenna.It’s also worth noting that I mounted it in the ceiling of my basement so that it would penetrate into the first floor and the basement. So I’m essentially trying to cover 2800 square feet. A second antenna for each floor would probably help but it does provide a minimum of 1-2 bars everywhere in the home. Originally I floated from no service to one bar inside.Overall it works very well and is well built. If you have very poor signal outside don’t expect full signal throughout the house.
4,Moved to the top of a rural mountain community. The nearest tower is six miles away and home is below ridgeline with no line of sight to tower. ATT had only one bar no other service in area. After install I now have four bars 5g edge. Obviously it’s not high speed cable but I am able to stream movies. Zoom video calls are still hit and miss with some latency issues. Pretty impressed it actually worked. Temporary setup is on roof and planning on mounting an additional 10' mast as well as upgrading to coaxial 400 to cut down on signal loss over long cable run.
5,I bought this to boost my t mobile home internet and Verizon cell coverage since my Verizon WiFi calling was not compatible with tmobile home internet (something to do with vpns not working over ipv6). I’m on my family’s Verizon family plan and it’s so cheap that I didn’t want to change providers. My priority was getting Verizon service inside since the t mobile signal was decent to begin with. I get around 20 mbps down and 10 up via lte outside my house from Verizon but inside my house I was getting no signal. When I first installed this i was very frustrated since the flashes indicated the inside emitter was too close to the outside antennae and when I was doing speed tests my internet was super slow.  I didn’t think the emitter and antenna were that close to eachother but when I measured  they were 20 feet apart..they need to be at least 25 feet apart. Once I moved the outside antennae and the inside emitter a bit farther from each other - it worked perfect. So glad I figured it out. Make sure you follow the directions and read about how these work. I read reviews where people seem frustrated but I guarantee they are installing it wrong. I had the same problems at the beginning but figured it out after spacing them apart the right distance. Be patient and try different locations of both the antenna and the emitter. Also; it is boosting both my tmobile and Verizon coverage at the same time. Pretty awesome!
5,This unit honestly outperformed my expectations. I’m using the yagi antenna mounted on a 10’ piece of metal conduit and the basic amplifier with whip antenna inside.We have struggled with poor reception in our metal sided and (double) roofed mobile home as long as we’ve lived here. We’ve been lucky to get one usable bar while inside (without leaning against a window). Outside our home 2-3 bars is typical.Installed the antenna and amp flipped it on and instant full bars on both our phones. Did some test calls and speed tests and very impressed! Service is now better inside than it ever was outside. LTE was hit or miss outside usually defaulting to 3G. Now we have a consistent speedy LTE connection inside for those rare occasions when our comcast service kicks out. (The amplifier is also powered through a UPS so our quality connection should persist through power outages)I did my research before installing and used the google maps measure tool (it makes that nice straight line from one point to another) along with our carrier’s tower waypoint data to get a really good bearing for the antenna.Installation couldn’t have been easier from the standpoint of what actually comes in the box. It was pretty much plug and play. The real challenge was in running the cable and fastening the mast I used. I ended up boring a hole in the end of a piece of 4x4 PT wood and then added a couple of galvanized pipe clamps to stabilize the mast (see pic). I also capped the top of the conduit so it doesn’t become a rain collector 🤣
4,I have a lake house in a rural Virginia community and the area is quite hilly.  In fact the house is down in a Hollow. Up on the main road (probably 50 feet higher than the location of the house my phone will pull 30 mb LTE from Verizon.  During the winter when the leaves are off the trees we can get about 10 mb inside the house.  During the summer calls are easily dropped and you can forget any reliable internet speed from LTE.We have Verizon DSL which is another horror story and the reason we depend so much on our cell phones to provide reliable internet.We took a chance on this product and it works as described.  The outdoor yagi antenna is mounted high in a tree and aimed toward the tower.  It took some fine tuning and quite a few trips up the ladder to get the best signal.  We now consistently have 5-10 mb LTE in the house which often peaks at 15-20.  The time of day seems to have something to do with that with better speeds in the morning.  I assume that is due to higher demand on the towers as the day progresses.  Now we don't drop calls in the house even in the far reaches of the basement.  While I hate winter I'm actually looking forward to seeing the speeds we will have once the leaves drop from the trees.Overall I am pleased with the purchase although it seems a bit expensive.  The actual unit feels sturdy and has a nice solid metal case but both antenna feel a bit cheap.  Also for the price it seems they could have included cable with a higher shield rating.Finally I have noticed the price seems to fluctuate quite a bit on Amazon.  Fortunately when I made the purchase in June it was almost $150 cheaper than the list price today.
5,Rural Maine is notorious for spotty cell signal/strength. Our particular area is tough. This thing blew me away. After finding my closest cell tower and downloading the recommended signal strength app to my Samsung Galaxy A50 I was able to get -104 dBm standing 20 feet up on a ladder outside my house pointing toward the tower. (That’s 4 shy of the recommended minimum.) so yeah I had no bars inside our home and sometimes couldn’t send or receive text messages without delays of days. I was concerned that not even having the minimum outside signal strength would make the installation a vain exercise but I was desperate. So I mounted the Yagi antenna on the pole and connected the cable and stretched it out away (50 ft) to test. With my phone directly in front of the directional inside antenna I had max bars 4G (we don’t even have 5G out here yet). So I went the rest of the way. Drilled a hole in my old wood house ran the cable through my cellar and located the inside antenna in our living room. Now we have 4 to 5 bars anywhere in the living room (-83 dBm) and I can have a half hour continuously clear phone conversation even in the kitchen more than 25 feet away. Blown away. Running the cable etc was the hardest but totally worth it. Yes this purchase felt expensive to us but going from zero phone signal to hero of my home is priceless.
5,I've only had it for a couple of days so far. BUT it works. Outside my house I have 2 bars. Inside my house I have 0. Unless I put my phone in a window. Installed the antenna outside an the roof. Installed the flare in the center of my home. My cell is now full 5 bars in most of my house and 3 to 4 bars at the furthest points. Slowest data speeds 30 to 40 gb download. Fastest speeds up to 130mb download. I have AT&T my wife has Verizon. It works for both of us. AND we live where the only option for home internet was Verizon Home LTE. It went from 1 gb download speed in the window to over 65gb download speed. So far loving this. If anything changes I will update this review.
5,I gave this booster 5 stars but it was quite an adventure and learning experience to get there. My original purchase included the indoor whip and outdoor yagi. Results sucked. Suspecting my poor azimuth and elevation placement of the yagi I purchased the omni outdoor antenna. (As a note I tried three local towers with the yagi and most likely my angles were correct.) My results with the omni also sucked. Frustrated I contacted the SureCall folks. The help was excellent. After some discussions it was decided the booster needed to be sent in. The turn around was quite quick. No problems were found but a software update was accomplished on the unit. I received an indoor panel antenna with the returned unit. Once hooked up...... bars!!! 5 of them. Received dBm's dropped from the 120's to the 90's. Speed tests before the booster were in the 2MB range. Using the booster 20+.So.... what was the problem??? The indoor antenna and placement. First of all the whip antenna is absolutely useless. Holding the phone within 1 foot of it did not improve anything as far as signal strength. With the panel connected I saw a definitive change. As great as that was I found the panel's range pretty limited also. In the same room..... great walk 20 feet away and kiss any signal good-by.I noticed from digging around that some folks were using two three or more indoor antennas to cover their homes. For my needs I needed two. A "N" splitter can be purchased on Amazon. I at first ordered the cheap ($15.65) dome that is sold on this site. Useless unless within four feet of it. After receiving the $36 SureCall dome the first one hit the garbage. I tweaked the panel antenna position to cover our den area. I placed the dome antenna in the attic directly over my office desk. If you're in either of those rooms signal quality is sweet. I still get a dramatic loss when leaving the room.I'm going to leave my setup as is. My pride and pocketbook took some pretty good smacks throughout this battle. To cover the home properly (one story house) it really would take four indoor antennas. Placement is absolutely critical from what I've found and I would think this job would be significantly harder with a two story home.My sword is leaning up up in the corner..... good luck with your own battle.(This project did require some extra cable. I have used a site WiFiExperts for previous projects. They built cables to the required lengths with the proper connectors for me...... Not a plug just a recommendation.)
4,I live out in the stix literally. There is only one cell phone tower that covers my area and it is 10+ miles away in mountainous terrain. My phone is my internet etc.This product does work if you follow the simple instructions and how to set up and aim antennas.I wish in hindsight I had bought the 100$ cheaper unit with the omni-directional indoor antenna.  Because i could have bought the larger indoor antenna after the fact for only 50 dollars. Thus saving 50 dollars but getting two types of indoor antenna to work with.I live in a tiny trailer and the directional indoor antenna is almost TO powerful meaning i gotta making sure my phone is positioned correctly and a certain distance away to prevent feedback.  The outdoor antenna is a directional yagi and for me that was the only way to go as there is only one tower to boost signal from.Anyway long story short is i can now make phone calls with the phone to my ear instead of yelling at it in its one working spot in the window.  Latency is still an issue for my wifi hotspot but the fact that i can send a text and make a call in a timely fashion was the least of the improvements i could have hoped for.
4,First of all I'd like to point out that we had low expectations for this.  Our signal is awful - way beyond dead zone and I remember seeing that these needed a min of -100 to work.  We're at -129dbm but we thought we'd give it a try and worse case send it back if it didn't work.  Normally we cant make a phone call without being disconnected and not being able to hear.  My signal fluctuates between 1 bar of 3G and 1X.  forget phone calls forget watching videos.We put the antenna on a 36" pole on our roof and played with the direction till we got our best signal.  Our best is -87dm when you're sitting within a foot of the panel antenna. by the time you're 5 feet away you're worse than -100dbm but the signal is still strong enough (3 bars) to stream youtube without buffering.  Normally when it rains our satellite internet goes out and we're in the dark because we cant get radar via TV cell phone or internet.  Now as long as we get within a few feet of the panel antenna we can get an up to date radar picture during a storm.  We also can get clear phone calls now (though we dont advertise!  lol).so overall I think it works better than advertised since our starting signal strength is worse than they recommend.  We don't get whole house boosting by any means but we get 3 bars sitting within a few feet of the panel antenna.  that's about as good as we're going to get where we live so we're happy with it.I assume I can get a Verizon wireless card with an unlimited data plan and have good internet too (so I can work from home).  This is also a huge benefit as we're currently limited to our 5 gig metered satellite internet connection.
3,Only got a good signal off it if I was within a 5 foot area around the booster
1,I really wanted to like this booster but it quit working after 8 hours of use so I sent it back.  Amazon's return policy and performance was outstanding. Amazon gets 5 stars but the booster only gets one.I'm one of those guys who usually don't read the instructions but in this case I downloaded the manual and read it closely before I even ordered the booster. There are some specific conditions that need to be met and I wanted to ensure that the physical layout of my installation met those requirements. (It did)  Because I had seen some critical reviews I decided to do a temporary installation before drilling holes and running cables. I ran the RG-6 cable through open windows instead of drilling holes through the walls. I mounted the Yagi antenna on a temporary 12 foot mast for aiming purposes. I moved the booster/antenna unit around in the house for best location testing purposes. I carefully aimed the Yagi antenna at the nearest Verizon Cell tower and fired up the system and it worked just fine. So far so good. The cell tower was 14 miles away from my cabin in sparsely populated Northern Wisconsin and I was quite impressed. The before-booster one bar cell signal was -115 dbm signal strength inside the cabin. After-booster installation gave me a hugely improved -96 dbm signal strength inside the cabin which was a great improvement and gave me four bars on the phone. For reference the cell tower signal strength outside of the cabin and before booster installation was between  -112 to -102 dbm. (When you are dealing with signal strength readings in dbm the least negative reading is better. -1 dbm is about the best you can get. I used an app called "Network Cell Info Lite" to get signal measurements.) I tried the booster in several locations to give the best coverage in the cabin and sure enough the best location had 30 feet of separation between the Yagi antenna and the inside antenna and the Yagi pointing away from the inside antenna. The indicator lights worked as described in the manual. I was a happy camper and was making plans to do the permanent installation on the next day. After watching a couple of hours of TV I decided to turn off the booster before going to bed.When I put my hand on the booster to turn it off it was HOT. There were no indicator lights illuminating  except the power light. All of the Cellular band indicator lights were dark. I determined that I would trouble shoot it in the morning. The first thing I did was to tighten the cable connections as stated in the trouble shooting guide. I turned the booster on and got only the power light again. I loosened and re-tightened the cable connection and got the same result. I wiggled the connection and got some cellular band indicator lights but ended up with dark indicator lights again shortly thereafter and an illuminated power light.  Thinking the supplied RG-6 cable might be bad I swapped out the supplied RG-6 cable with 50 feet of RG-6 cable that I use with my satellite TV dish. No improvement. The verified known good RG-6 cable gave the same results as the supplied RG-6 cable.  Obviously something was wrong inside the booster itself and I decided to return it.When the booster worked it was 5 star quality. Unfortunately the system failed after about 8 hours of on and off use. I need to get much more than 8 hours of service out of a $366 purchase so it gets a 1 star rating.
5,A little expensive but you pay for what you get. Already had a directional antenna and this seems to be working well. The lights make it feel like it is working as expected.
3,I really wanted this booster to work for me.  Bought it after looking at the reviews and  reading the product description.  I was sure it said it supported T-mobile  bands 2 and 66.  After I got it and  wired it up according to the instructions I was pleased to see my Verizon phone now got four bands vice  the two I usually had. But I had bought it to boost the signal for my internet using the T-mobile  towers  and the new  router I got  that received their signal.  It did nothing and instead somehow  ended up killing my internet connection entirely.  So I called the customer support  line and talked to Anthony.  Nice guy.  We ran through the trouble shooting guides and  came to find out this particular bold does not support T-mobile bands 2 and 66.  My bad I guess.  So I undid everything and  patched the hole in my  wall I made  for the cable and sent it back. Thanks Amazon!  Bottom line - know what bandwidth  your carrier is supplying  and get a booster to support same.
5,My temporary installation mounted on the balcony railing on a short post with the cable running the length of the hallway didn't seem to make much of a difference initially but after a day or two I noticed that I had good reception throughout the house.I suspect that there is a period of "tuning" where the device is optimizing its function which is not clearly documented in the instructions.We will eventually get the wires off the floor but this is a game changer for me.
3,I dislike that when it goes to 5G the booster quits working
2,The yellow light does not go out. Definitely more than 30 feet from the antenna. Even 10 feet from it calls get dropped. Have had this unit for 13 months. Wasted $285.00.  Should have used it to help pay for a better phone.
5,I've never gotten cell reception at the house.  I live on the back side of a mountain.  I had one window where I could stand and possibly get 1-2 bars.  I did a search and found the location of the nearest tower.  I mounted the booster in the attic by attaching it to a roof joist and pointing it in the direction of the tower.  I just knew it was going to be a huge waste of time and I was extremely careful to not damage anything because I was certain I would be returning this item.  I ran the cable down through a first floor closet and through the floor into an unfinished basement using most of the supplied cable.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  I have good reception everywhere in the house.  Amazing!
5,Hooked unit up with coaxial and stuck the antanea out an upstairs window and I went from 1&2's to 4&5's in cell signal. And I didn't even attach the antanea permanently yet. Now I have enough signal so that I don't constantly getting the death spiral.Only negative is the yellow light cycles through fast blink to slow blink to off. And the antanea and booster are more than the required distance apart. Don't know. But it is still working!
5,We live in an extremely remote area of the mountains of Colorado where cell service is sporadic at best.  We have Verizon service with reception ranging from no service to one bar.  We dropped calls often could not make outgoing calls and often did not receive incoming calls.  Even texting was poor.  Before buying this package we contacted SureCall tech support (who answered immediately) and received good information on the product.  After purchase and prior to installation we contacted SureCall tech support again for advice on installation.  After an initial phone call we traded several emails.  Their responses were prompt always within the hour and easily understood.  Once we installed the booster and turned it on we immediately went from no service/one bar to 3/4 bars.  We were amazed!  So far everything works perfectly - no dropped calls easily making and receiving calls and reception is clear.  Installation was easy.  We did purchase the Wilson Pole Mount which also helped.  Obviously the best part is that it works but SureCall tech support was super and made the whole project a success.
4,We live in a rural area surrounded by forest. We have 1-2 bars lte outside. My wife’s iPhone XR had 1-2 bars lte inside. My iPhone 6 cycles between 1 bar lte 2 bars 3g and 1x. My phone was essentially not functional unless I connected to our cellular WiFi that is capped at15gb per month. This was frustrating since my phone has a truly unlimited data plan. I installed the yahoo antenna on my roof and used an old satellite coax cable that runs into my utility closet downstairs and then connected that to an unused cable outlet in my living room. Initially i started with the whip antenna but quickly upgraded to the panel antenna for better coverage. The result is 2-3 bars lte on my iPhone 6 in the living room and 2 bars most everywhere else upstairs. My wife’s iPhone XR has 3-4 bars in the living room and 2-3 elsewwhere. Our bandwidth tests at a reliable 2-5 mb/s. Not incredible but functional. Can finally stream movies and shows and not worry about going over our data cap. This product worked exactly how I had hoped.
5,If you live a house built in a hole you come to appreciate any intermittent cell signal and you adapt by figuring out when and where you can place your phone. One day I'd just had enough.  And dropped the big money. With minimal expectation. But it works (most of the time). No exclamation marks. For this kind of money it had better.
2,The cell phone booster arrived quickly with good packaging. Setup was very easy. We did get interference light flickering on before eventually shutting down the booster even though we had the antenna the full 50' away which was the length of the cable included with the package. I contacted Tech Support and they said it should work with 50' but they didn't know what would cause the interference. I ended up buying a 100' and that resolved the interference issue.However we bought the Yagi antenna for maximum cell boost. Trying to point it in the right direction was very difficult. The instructions told us to install apps to locate the antenna but they didn't work. Once screen showing the map of local antenna's gave a message that it could not load and was in development only.I ended up driving around to find the local antennas. We had 3 within 8 miles but two were apparently not for our carrier. One antenna that was 5.27 miles away (as the crow flies) from our wooded cabin gave us 5 bars next to it so we knew this was the one to use. Without the booster we had intermittent connectivity outside (between 1-2 bars) with a -117 dbm rating and no connectivity inside. With the booster on and the Yagi mounted 15' up in a tree pointed at the tower our signal only slightly improved with the dbm averaging -105 (lots of fluctuation from -56 to -120). We were able to get intermittent signal in the house.I expected much better for the price. This was in northern Wisconsin so no mountains and most of the area between our cabin and the cell tower is water so shouldn't have been much interference. Therefore I'll probably return the device and try a different one.
5,THIS IS A LONG ONE! I am rating this 5 stars because it gave us service after 14 years in this house. We live in the mountains and have had extremely spotty reception dropped calls texts coming through days late etc. We switched from Verizon to ATT in order to get new phones and realized there was no service at all with att. yikes. We had tried various other smaller boosters over the years with no success. A friend recommended this system so I bought it out of desperation. We tried to set it up ourselves. Not fun. Even though they say there's a way to tell where the strongest signal is coming from it didn't work for us. So for self installation in a mountainous area I give 1 star. And I couldn't talk to tech support because there was no signal. Luckily the same friend had an installer they used to fine tune it. He mounted it on a tall pole on the very top of the roof. Even then it was spotty. We had him come back and play with the antenna position and BINGO! we have reception. So even with an installer it took a couple of tries to get it right. My house is under 2000 sq ft so I ordered that sized system. The installer suggested I add the panel antenna from the next size up system.It didn't come with the cable to connect the interior panel to the panel antenna and it doesn't say that when you order it. frustrating. But SureCall took pity on me and sent me a cable after I drove an hour to get the wrong one. They sent wrong one as well.  lol but they were so nice on phone and yesterday after many tries I have the right cable and connected it. Now I have 2-3 bars in the house. So I definitely recommend this system. I suggest you order a bigger one than your house sq footage needs to boost signal even more. I definitely recommend finding an installer. SureCall was very receptive to my situation and the help I needed. Good customer service.
5,Quality Product - While I have not been using this booster system but a couple days I am very impressed. It works exactly as described. The install was fairly easy and instructions while a little vague are adequate. I live in a rural area limited to only a slow dsl service and decided to go to cellular based internet for higher speeds. So far so good.The signal I was getting from my hotspot was a little sparatic so I researched and bought the SureCall Fusion 4 Home in hopes of getting faster speeds and signal stability. So far its doing a great job. I am averaging a 10 to 15 decimal increase in signal strength and streaming 4k and HD content with no buffering.To those in the market for a home cell booster system I would highly recommend this product. Expensive yes but you get what you pay for. Go cheap and your gonna get cheap.Note: I will tell people do your research on these types of products and follow the instructions. A key to this system and other similar ones is antenna separation. Make sure you have enough distance between them for proper booster operation. From reading countless reviews and questions people ask they are clueless how these products work and many times call items defective when they are not or don't work in there particular situations.Do your homework and make an educated decision.The surcall fusion for home is a quality product and In my opinion the best cellular booster kit for home on the market right now.
2,Over $600 invested with the recommended installer… I went from having one bar on my cell phones to having two bars…
5,This thing works but make sure you follow their instructions to keep the inside antenna 25-ft away from the outside booster. I live in a remote area with no cell phone service (I live in a mountainous area with dense forest). I can get a couple of bars at best but no data about a mile up the road from me but on my land my phone says "no service". The first time I hooked this thing up was while I was building my house. I was able to get a small signal but it was sketchy. Now that my home is built I finally got around to installing the booster correctly and placed it on a 30-ft high pole with the inside antenna well over 25-ft away from the outside booster and I now have FULL BARS of cell phone service with data! I'm amazed at how well this thing provides a signal amidst an area where I normally have no service whatsoever.
5,The SureCall Fusion is the best I have bought.  SureCall is the third booster I tried and it has been the only one that has worked.  I had zero to 1 bar and now have 3-4 bars depending on where I stand in my house.  I live in the country in a low spot and 100 feet out of the AT&T coverage area.  With all of these things against me I had three bars as soon as we plugged the booster in.  Installation was very easy.  SureCall gives you all  the hardware and plenty of the cable that's needed.  Mount the antenna and plug it in pretty much takes takes care of the installation.  The one thing I found to be the most important is to get the brains (receiver)  of the booster as far away from the antenna as possible.  That includes horizontal and vertical distance.  If you have had failed attempts with other boosters this SureCall is the one to buy.
3,After installing and contacting tech support a few times this isn't quite what I had in mind for a booster.  I get constant alerts that the transmitter is too close to the antenna which is almost 40 feet away and outside above the roof.  Tech support suggested I move it and try it someplace else...well if I could I would but there is no other place I can put it.  The boosted signal is one extra bar.  Not at all what I expected after reading the company boasting about the unit.  All in all I am very disappointed with this.
5,IT WORKS!!!  I was skeptical and especially at over $400.  I have Verizon; one tower is 3.2 miles away and the other is 5.2 miles away.  I have always 1 bar 3G or No Service in the house and I had to do something.  We had an old tripod still mounted to the roof for the large rotary TV antennas that were popular 25 years ago.  I installed the outdoor antenna on a 10' piece of 1" conduit attached to the old TV antenna tripod so it's mounted about 13'-14' above the peak of a single story 1800 sq ft house or about 25' above the ground.  The indoor antenna is in the basement as far away from the outdoor antenna as I could get it.  If I am in the basement where I previously had No Service I now have 3 bars LTE service!  On the main floor of the house I have usually have 2 bars LTE but its plenty good enough to talk and surf.  I am very impressed with this antenna; I went with this one because of the reviews and the ability to set the signal strengths as I need/want them.  I might look into getting the remote antenna down the road but this works fine now.  This antenna comes with the outdoor Yagi antenna with mounting bracket and two U clamps to mount to an existing pole indoor receiver + power cord small indoor whip antenna and 50' of coax cable.  I bought a 100' length of coax cable instead because I knew this was going to be over 50'.  In retrospect its worth every penny!
5,Rural home.  No Cell service except AT&T.  Been with them over 15 years.  THEN The nearest cell tower went out.  When restored my phones went from 2-3 bars to NO SERVICE- 1 bar.  NO ONE at AT&T could help.  CSRs managers supervisors 10 hours on the phone -NO HELP.One can’t live without cell service today especially when one’s landline has been gone for awhile.  So I looked at antennas/boosters.  WeBoost’s model to give me the square footage I wanted was close to $1000.  The SureCall model was about 1/2 of that.In the meantime a friend visited my home.  He uses MetroPCS.  He had 3 bars!  So I moved one phone to MetroPCS.  My result: NO BARs for the old IPhone 6 I moved to MetroPCS .  MetroPCS DID tell me that their phones were optimized for their network and that my signal strength might be less than my friend’s.FF a few days.  I ordered and installed the SureCall Fusion4Home with Yagi and Panel antennas.  It was a hasty install: a quick bolt up to my ground level DirecTv pole and wired through a nearby window to the main floor in split entry home.  AT&T phones jumped to 4 bars and MetroPCS phone to 3 bars!  I didn’t even do a roof install (yet)!  Even better all phones now worked in the cellar.Bottom line: Great reception on both networks and I ported all three phones from AT&T Unlimited at $210-$220 a month to MetroPCS Unlimited at $80 a month!  A savings of $130 a month minimum!!!  OR over $1500 a year.  For me SureCall has sure been worth the $500 investment!
5,No more dropped calls or having to move from place to place when calls were breaking up.  No more texts stuck or delayed in 'sending' or not sent at all on the first attempt.  Using the Network Cell Info app for Android and the AT&T SIM Status function on my phone I easily located the optimal location for the antenna. Which by sheer coincidence is my chimney.  So I tap-conned brackets to the chimney and used an eight foot cyclone fence line post to mount the antenna. So far so good.  However the devil is in the details which are unique to every installation. I will spare you the many details I was confronted with but suffice to say I am very particular in my work. The bottom line is if you don't have the time patience skills knowledge and tools you might want to consider professional installation.SureCall's help desk and tech support is excellent A-1. (Which I did not need for the actual installation. Long story.)
5,I first tried the SureCall Flare system and had a hard time getting enough separation between antennas.  The Flare wanted to shutdown to prevent oscillation.  I tried both the omni-directional and the yagi directional outside antennas and kept having oscillation problems.The SureCall Fusion4Home works with no problem with the antenna separation less 27ft vertical and about 3ft horizontal.  The other package had problems with 27ft vertical and 33ft horizontal.  A minimum of 25ft vertical is recommended.  The antennas are both directional in this system and I think that really helps.  It is important that the indoor antenna is not pointed toward the outdoor antenna.I also like the fact that you can change the maximum gain on the 5 bands if you need to.  I have not had to reduce the gain on any band.We can now use are cell phones in any room of our house.  We had 1 room where we could not make or receive calls before.  We also had a lot of dropped calls before I installed the SureCall Fusion4Home. No more dropped calls.Make sure you can get enough antenna separation before you buy a cell phone booster.  This is extremely important to maximize the usefulness of the system.  I can see some homes would have problems getting separation.I would highly recommend the system if you need a cell phone booster.
4,I was getting 120db readings at my house and with this I'm now in the 90's but still not where I'd like to be. (60-70) my data rate soared from 3mbs to 50 or more and that's great but I think my tower locator program might be off so I'm going to play with it more.  It still takes a long time to download web pages. It's not very easy to set up if you don't have the proper signal indicator meter. I also had some issues with ground loops causing red lights even though I was more than 30 feet between the roof unit and inside wall unit.
4,I thought it was good okay.... until 4-5 weeks after I purchased it...my power went out.. OML..back in time..had to walk around the house and/or go outside to get a signal.. only to have it drop .. didn't send..  It's so great to be able to set in house and used my phone and hotspot...I love it now..
5,I am SO impressed with this product. I have a second home Baja California 250 miles south of the border in San Felipe Mexico (actually 25 miles south of San Felipe). It's basically open desert right up to the beach. I have Verizon (with a Mexico plan) and the phone automatically switches to Telcel or MovieStar carriers once I cross the border. If I am on the main road by my house I can get a pretty good signal. Unfortunately the main road is about a quarter mile from my house. On top of that my house is on the beach which is down below a bluff which completely blocks all cell signals to me. I mounted the Yagi antenna on the eave of my roof and pointed it towards the cell tower which is probably 20 miles away. I also bought the Omni-Directional antenna for inside the house and mounted it on the ceiling replacing the whip antenna the SureCall comes with. My iPhone was in my hand showing "No Signal". I switched the SureCall unit on and within 1 minute (without touching anything on the unit) I had 4 bars Telcel LTE. INCREDIBLE I've had this house for around 12 years and never a signal in the house. As a side note I wanted to see how the whip antenna compared to the Omni-Directional antenna. The results were almost the same. Although I had a very good signal in the house I could not walk as far from the main unit when the whip antenna was attached.Thank You SureCall. This was the best $$$ I've spent on a product. Works as advertised and was SUPER easy to set up.
5,My dad and I purchased this with the hopes to be able to get a better signal. We had almost no signal at all with our Verizon phones. Literally on the Verizon map there was signal all around the property and none in the exact spot that the house was at.So we installed the antenna and pointed it at the direction where we were getting some intermittent signals from. We successfully connected and had internet on my phone. It was great signal then it failed to send and receive calls and texts.We troubleshot the issue for several days. Called the support line(excellent customer service!!!) they even sent us a new antenna; we actually found it was not the antenna. We moved the antenna to the other side of the house and connected to another cell tower area.Come to find out it is not the booster ITS THE TOWERS. The booster is designed to connect to a strong signal from outside. It seemed to be picking up a tower that had only data on it. Maybe it was due to it being in an area where TVA operated(power company) and they just had data towers for IoT devices.  I believe that the issues people are having is not the booster but the towers. If you have issues try pointing the antenna in another direction toward other towers or maybe change they type of antenna used. I used apps on my phone to tell me the tower ids and used some online tower maps to help find out what I was connecting to. I was able to see the information needed to determine that whenever I hit the same tower that my booster was picking up I had the same issues without the booster. The maps can be your friend. Also a tip if you have an interstate close by(up to maybe 20 miles) you may want to point the antenna in that direction. Interstates are heavily covered nowadays.
5,AT&T user and 3 miles from nearest tower.  Rural area surrounded by woods and gentle hills.  Was one to two bars inside the home.  Sporadic LTE with decent conversation worthy service and other times unable to text internet or able to make calls without going outside.  Mounted the exterior poll on a 20ft pole to get over the nearest hill top (but not the trees...would have needed 100ft tower for that).  Placed internal unit in center of house.Now have full bars and constant LTE throughout 70% of the house.  Calls are perfect.  Text is good except for the furthest room.  LTE internet speed is great...actually speed tested twice as fast as my wifi signal from radio dsl.  Canceling dsl.Very happy customer.  Will buy another for my metal roof/sided shop/barn soon.
4,Cell tower is about 7 miles away through trees and over some low hills. 1-2 bars at best. With this booster 3-4 bars and able to use phone as hot spot. Proximity to booster is important for data usage. Also found that since our phones use only LTE turning off the none LTE signals significantly improved quality and stability of the signal. Wish the LEDs had a color for "in use" other than simply off or blinking. Otherwise seems like an excellent product.
5,I was a little squetchy at first debating whether to switch phone companys again or try a home cellurar signal booster and for my surprise the SureCall signal booster did the job I went from crappy signal of 1 or 2 bars to a constant full bar and amazing data speedsthe conclusion I came up with was that no matter how good the carrier wassimply this house and walls are very thick not to mentiont the windows and doors and the fact that I live on a rural area made the signal inside my house very hard to txtcall or look something up on the internet...SureCall signal Fusion4Home did the trick now I can call any time send and recieve messages not to mention crazy speed when using the internet.To anyone looking for a boost or if you have a really enclosed house with little or no receptionmy suggestion is GIVE IT A TRY IT WILL WORK
5,After searching and reading hundreds of reviews I decided to try this kit and I made the right decision. I live out in the woods and I mean WOODS trees everywhere !!!! To make a phone call on my new I Phone X you had to go to the kitchen or on the corner of my front porch....and that was to get 1 bar. I am disabled so there is no way for me to get on my roof to install (that's until buddy can come help) so just to try it out I set it up in my spare bedroom upstairs. I mounted it to a post on the bed and have it pointed at the wall in the general direction of the cell tower closest to me. Well this temporary set up now allows us to make and receive phone calls anywhere in the house(even video chat) and we now have at least 3 bars. The connection is so good I can hotspot my PS4 and play online with my buddies that right there is worth the money. This has worked so good in the temporary spot that I have not rushed someone to come out here and help mount it outside where I'm sure will even be a better signal. I will update once I move it. Tip...read the instructions on how to set the gain dials and trust me if I can get it working anyone can.
4,This thing really boosted my 4g data speeds. I use Verizon and I live way far up a private road in some heavily forested and hilly area. I can't get internet through any land line here and satellite internet is a joke. Don't even waste your time with that. So my data connection was coming in on the tablet I use for a hotspot at 1-2 bars of 4g. That definitely doesn't cut it for Netflix and games and anything else. I was sad. Now I get a steady 4-5 bars of 4g and I haven't even set the thing up properly yet. I'm still on my test run about a week into it. I'm very happy now to be able to watch Netflix on my TV in HD like a normal person. I can't even get satellite cable where I'm at because our trees are way too big. The surecall fusion4home unit is the one to get with the yagi. Don't waste your time with the other stuff out there. The only reason this has 4 stars is because it's pretty much mandatory to buy a 100' rg11 cable and throw away the 50' rg6 cable that comes in the package. It should just come with a 100' rg11 cable.
4,I ordered this unit from "warehouse deals" and it had been totally well used! Even the outdoor antenna was sun faded! It wasn't working properly so the previous purchasers packaged it back up and returned it instead of letting anyone know it was defective. I installed the unit and could hear the callers perfectly but they couldn't hear me! I contacted Surecall and they were fantastic! They sent me out a new booster and also the Yagi antenna because it simply works better and is also more expensive..... all at no cost. The new booster works fine but not quite as well as I would have hoped. If I'm up on the roof right next to the antenna 28 feet off the ground my iphone X shows two bars LTE. Down below it's basically nothing. With the booster the phone is three bars but not LTE. I would think that it would boost the LTE signal and inside my home it would also be LTE but it's not? They honestly couldn't tell me why. AT least now our phones work in the house even if it's not LTE. Great customer service though!!!!!!
5,I have lived in a rural area surrounded by tall trees for the past 5 years. I have always struggled to get a decent internet services; both DSL and satellite and just getting a usable cell signal.I recently purchased an AT&T hotspot and tried multiple antennas with no progress on signal strength until now. It took a day of moving the outside antenna around my roof to find the best location and then a good location inside the house. After to soft install I determined the best location in the house for the inside antenna. Once installed this signal booster was amazing. My speeds went from the low MPS on both upload and download speeds to mid 20s download and mid teens on my upload speed. I could not be happier.
3,Bought this while living on the edge of town. only get about 3-4 bars before hand now I'm getting 5 although I have noticed no difference in speed or connection. It's very possible this isnt actually helping in anyway. Maybe out in the wood this would go much further for you.
5,SureCall Fusion4Home Cell Phone Signal Booster.  We have two different cell phone carriers Verizon and AT&T.  At our new location we have spotty service on both carriers.  We normally only see 1-2 bars and often get dropped or missed calls and no service at all in the basement.  The booster has made a big difference on Verizon.  As soon as we plugged it in we saw 4 bars and no longer have issues.  You can walk around the house including the basement without dropping the call anymore.  There wasn’t any improvement with AT&T; we aren’t able to pick up a good signal for it to work.I made a call to Surecall’s customer support and they were friendly and very responsive to my needs.
5,Our remote hunting cabin did not have the best service outside and almost none inside. After I installed this we were able to fully use our phones inside for searching and watching videos etc. and at night when we’re sleeping I have the peace of mind that I can get alerts on my phone in case of emergency.
5,I bought this for my second home.  I had zero to one bar and was unable to use text internet or phone service.  I purchased after reading up on the various options available.  I ended up mounting on a 35 foot tower.  However prior to mounting on the tower I set it up temporally on a 10 foot pole strapped to a tree just to make sure it was going to work.  I'm located in a valley approximately 15 miles from the tower.  I went from zero/one bar to four bars.  Phone service is great and I have not dropped a call yet.  Text works wonderful.  Internet connectivity is very good.  Good enough that I can use my phone as a hotspot and can connect to work via VPN on my laptop and actually work from the cabin.  Saves me from having to drive to town to use the Wi-Fi at the library.  I've very happy with this purchase.  Considering the cost I was concerned.  But I'm glad I made the purchase.  Just so you know I purchased the model with the Yagi antenna.  I will say that the range inside the home could be better.  I have to be within 15 feet of the unit indoor.  I'm just using the omnidirectional antenna that comes with the unit indoors.  But that's enough for me for the time being.  I may at some point upgrade the indoor antenna.
5,I held off for a while to really get to use the booster. I know that every location and situation is different and for some these things dont work at all so I had realistic expectations. I bought SureCall because of the generous return policy. Happy to say I will not be returning this. My use is the mountains of CO. My phone at the trailer had 0 to sometimes 1/2 bar of signal and was completely unusable. I installed the SureCall and spent some time rotating the yagi to find the best signal. I went to between 3 and 4 bars. Every once in a while it drops to 2. I can always call and text now. Occasionally I can get even get LTE data and stream although that is not consistent.I purchased because I needed reliable voice and text service where I had none and this unit works very very well to fill that need. Not paid not sponsored not affiliated.
3,Product did take outside signal and bring it in kind of.  What I mean by kind of is it did give me a solid signal indoors so long as I didn't move more than about 20 ft from the unit.  Also just on top of the house if I went there with my phone I could get much better download speeds and a much better signal that I could inside.  So I bought an outdoor antenna and I wired it in per their instruction.  But alas there was no better signal to be had.  Ended up returning this unit and purchasing a different unit that was an all-in-one cell phone router and modem hooked it to my antenna and now I get great internet throughout the house no glitches 20 meg downloads much happier now.  So while I do believe this unit may work for some people it did absolutely nothing to improve my signal or give me a better signal in any way.  I did contact support and they seemed to know very little about the product itself.
4,I'm somewhat split or mixed about this item. I really like it and I like that it does what it says it will do. My problem is that it hasn't resolved my issues of bad cell phone reception in the house. This is because my max signal at my direct line of site on the roof is only -122DB.I set up thes system aimed it ran my cable. The panel sit in an area overlooking an open room. All the system lights show reception and transmission. However I still only get about -99 DB. Which is ok but not great. And 4G is still sluggish.I called Surecall and they were helpful. Tech support was on the line and gave me some pointers. The bottom line you can't make chicken soup out of chicken feathers. And my reception is sol poor that there is very little signal to boost.So better than I was. Sure Call was very helpful. Plus I got the system on a lightning deal and saved a bunch. So I'm keeping it. Somewhat better and stronger beat nothing at all.
3,I bought this after reading high ratings on a tech site. Didn't know the antenna is designed to be installed outside and aimed at the strongest cell tower. I installed it inside but against window glass. My windows don’t open. Using my phones signal strength meter I saw no improvement at all when connecting to the SureCall.
3,We live on a mountain where basics like cable and internet are extra expensive and mediocre  so we use our phones a lot for every facet of entertainment . This seems to boost signals a bit though not by a considerable amount.
5,Before installing this cell booster I was lucky to get 1 bar on my AT&T cell phone. Now I consistently get two - three bars and sometimes even four bars. I have it mounted on a pole with my tv antenna. I am an early 60’s year old woman. I read the instructions researched hints online and installed it myself.
5,I live in an area with poor cellular reception. Outside my home the best I could get my iphone 6S to read during a field test was -98 (usually a bit past -100) and inside the house it was always around -109/-111 or so. I also use a Verizon jetpack for my wifi and since I work from home I need good service. Obviously that wasn't happening.I have two homes in two states (Michigan and Florida) and have a Wilson unit back in Michigan. It works well and has made a difference since I installed it three years ago. Not always the best signal but normally allows me to get my work done. Since getting to my Florida place this fall  I have been really hamstrung and almost unable to get anything done. I decided to try the SureCall Fusion4Home based mostly on price and some decent reviews I read. Well this unit has surpassed even my wildest expectations. I went from the -109db to -68db and the phone often has five bars (previously never more than two). My wifi is awesome! Prior to this speed tests would often show less than 1Mbps. I am now getting over 12Mbps and often I am at 20 Mbps. This is the best money I have spent in some time and I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their cellular reception.
5,Anteriormente en mi casa no había señal pero luego de usar este producto la señal mejoro exponencialmente a tal punto que ya estamos pensando comprar un segundo producto pero mas pequeño para otra ubicación de la casa y solo para llamadas.Testeamos y tuvimos señal con tres operadoras de Panamá desconocemos si hay señal de la otra compañía porque todos en la casa son usuarios de las tres primeras compañías .Antes no se podía hacer una llamada ahora se puede ver hasta Youtube en una resolución de  480.Hemos notado que en ciertas ocasiones la señal cae un poco pero es comprensible con los cinco dispositivos móviles que se conectan al mismo tiempo.Cabe mencionar que la antena recibe entre 2 y 3 barras de señal (según el teléfono que usamos para ubicar la mejor posición para la antena).
4,Helps somewhat but not as good as I had hoped.  Doesn't help signal at the ends of the house or upstairs with the booster downstairs.
5,The initial performance was very impressive I do live in a fairly remote area in the UP with a lot of trees and a metal roof in a low area with a hill between me and any cell towers. Initially for testing I’m using an existing install of cables and directional cell antenna ( thats not even pointing to the closest cell tower I discovered yesterday ) my cell signal went from -115 dBm to -89 dBm right off the bat. I will be installing the new directional antenna and new 50’ cable that came with this system along with other adjustments for the permanent setup.For # of bars it went from varying between 1-2 ( on existing older signal booster equipment ) to a solid 3 and some 4’s on iphone 8+ with this new booster and new indoor panel antenna. Text messages are sent immediately now before I would actually see the slider bar move and then stop and struggle to finish sending a text message.  I don’t have to sit right next to the signal booster now to make phone calls I can be across the room; 20 ft away as an example.I did purchase the unit that came with the outside directional antenna and inside panel antenna.
5,i  downloaded the 5g nr discovery app on cp and went on roof and told me with arrow and bars place for best signal for antenna i made my own mounting for roof and screwed in antenna- with sheet rock screws and washers  ran cable down house but came short so re routed cable and that worked down back of house- then drilled holes above back door ran cable through and then ran along ceiling took me a  few min find best place for inside antenna due to distance from roof mount to inside device - does require about 30' from both antennas and small house- but went from 1 to no bars sometimes two to 5g full bars to 5g 4 bars- very happy
5,We bought this because we have a very poor signal in our house.  We live in an area where the signal is poor to begin with in addition our 2500 sqft home was built in the 70's and has a foil wrapping under the siding which acts as a signal shield.  We had to sit in a window to get a signal and even then calls would drop routinely and the batteries would not last a day.We mounted the antennae on a 3ft pole on the far end of the house and ran the cable to the other end of the home and positioned the indoor booster in a second floor bedroom.  We now have a powerful signal everywhere in our home to include the basement.  The phone batteries now last for days.  Why we waited 15 years to do this is beyond me.  If you are on the fence about dropping several hundred dollars then get off it and buy it now you won't regret it.
3,First it works.  I have tested it and it boosts voice and 3G cell signal from ~-99dbm to ~-77dbm.  This is significant if you are familiar with cell signals (non-LTE).  Since dbm is a logarithmic scale this is a huge difference in signal strength.  Now I mounted my outdoor antenna on a pole and it is about 20 feet high (maybe a bit higher) so your results may vary.  LTE is better also but that is hard to measure.  These results were based on my phone carrier - USCellular.  Now I have wireless LTE hot spot for internet service.  Sprint is the provider. The results here do not seem to be as good.  I have no way to measure it but I cannot tell a difference.  I mainly got it for this so I am a bit disappointed.  I also feel it is very pricey - you can find similar products for $100 less.  I got this one because you can lower the power on individual signal bands - which can come in handy if say the 3G is constantly overriding (due to a better signal) the LTE bands.  It hasn't been an issue here.  In hindsight getting a less expensive one and trying it out may have been a better option.
2,Bought about a month ago - disappointed in amplificationI live about 7 miles from cell provider site and have about 2 bars of signal if I stand in yard - but not enough inside house.Fusion 4  does enable cell use inside - but just barely!  I now get 2 bars of 4G if I am in front of the panel antenna.  I can make calls and surf but my internet enabled TV refuses the connection (I have the Verizon data plan 24G/Mo) - no Netflix!  I do work from home and the repeater doesallow two PCs to connect simultaneously.  I am using a SAMSUNG Tablet for a Hotspot as it works better than the Motorola Droids and is only 10$/MO vs the 20 for a "hotspot/router" from Verizon.  Simply stated is does "repeat" the signal but it is still weak - standing 10 feet in front of the antenna - I still get only 2 bars on my Motorola!  I step outside - yep  - 2 bars and to make sure I turned off (unplug) the amplifier to make sure I get the signal I am testing for.I work in a data center that is electronically shielded - no cell signal can get into/out of the building.  So(!!) the building has a repeater inside with antenna on the roof.  It is Verizon provided equipment and anywhere in the building the Droid shows max signal. So it CAN be done - that is provide strong signal.  The "fusion 4" ain't the hardware to do that.  I am keeping it and thinking of getting a better outside and/or inside antenna but for now keepiing wildblue satellite internet for netflix (no metering of data 12 AM to 5 AM)
5,After buying an old farmhouse with metal siding and a metal roof I was pretty dismayed to realize (only after moving in of course!) That we had no cell service other than standing right next to a window or on the front porch.  Even then only 1 maybe 2 bars if I held tongue out the right side of my mouth and hopped on my left foot! I finally bit the bullet and bought this.  Set the directional antenna on the peak of my roof and pointed it towards the tower.  Ran the cable through the basement and up to my living room where I put the booster. It is more than 25' from the antenna and is fairly centrally located.  Turned it on and like magic I have 5 bars in the same room as the booster and in the farthest location (through several walls and a floor) I still get 2 bars and full LTE service.I am impressed.  If you are on the fence about this and like me had to go outside to use your cell phone just do it.  Admittedly I have only had it for a day but if this thing keeps working like this over the long term it will be well worth every penny spent on it.
5,This is the best money I have spent! I live in a rural part of Virginia and Verizon is what most people use to get cell service but being as I have AT&T I would get no service or barely 1 bar. This yagi antenna is amazing!! I now have 2-3 bars consistently and have piece of mind that a call can be made with out being dropped or having no reception. Texting sending pictures and surfing the internet work great too. The install was easy. I just used the provided “L” bracket to attach to my porch and pointed it in the direction of the nearest tower. No real “issues” aside from hiding the co-ax cable. Seriously money well spent. Just follow the directions and you should be good to go!! Thank you SureCall!!
4,As long as you follow the instructions this unit will amplify a weak existing signal outside your house. I think my signal outside my house is just about as weak as you can get before having no signal. At first I could barely get it to work.. I then realized I really needed a Signal Strength meter to properly aim the Yagi antenna. Once I had that and pointed the Yagi in the right direction..... It worked well. My home is about 1500 Square Feet. The panel antenna performed ok but not great. It definitely did not cover the whole house after numerous location moves. I tried other antennas Dome Whip and Desk top. None worked better than the panel.  So I bought a second Panel a Splitter and Some more cable. Using two panel antennas in my home gives me pretty good coverage . I still have dead spots in certain areas but overall it is working well. I wish the amplifier signal was just a little stronger. Without this I have zero signal in my home...
5,I live out in the boondocks.  I get service from a single tower and it is 6 or 7 miles away!!  Therefore I bounce between 0 and 1 bar depending where I am.  Outside in a few spots I get -90db signal but mostly -105-110.  Inside you can imagine.I got frustrated after being dropped from an important conference call for work a few weeks ago.  When the product arrived I simply grabbed a 8' section of pipe I had laying around and pounded it in the ground mounted the antenna ran the cord temporarily and plugged the box in.  Within 10 minutes I had -75 dB signal in the exact same chair I lost the call.Since then I ordered two more.  One for my house one for my work shop and one for my garage.  It was expensive but after dropping calls left and right and my phones data dropping out like crazy for the past 10 years Im happy as can be.Considering my experience I would imagine anyone who is in a spot that gets SOME signal and saying this does not improve it is not doing something right.  The connection I am using to write this review has the Yagi mounted in a position I was getting no bars and a -100 to 105 degree signal.
5,Turned our one bar signal into 4-5 bars.  Couldn't effectively use the phone without it.
4,The specs said the interior antenna had to be 25 ft from the exterior. Mine is 28 ft away straight line measured which is the max separation possible in my house. But it continually shuts down (right led red) due to oscillation. I wasted $275Edit:  The vendor sent me a directional Yagi anntena to replace the omni directional that came with the package I ordered. With the directional antenna installed my previous problems with oscillation went away. It now appears to be working as advertised. So if you live in a small house where separation of the inside/outside antenna is limited go with the directional antenna option. I have changed my review accordingly.
5,This thing rocks!! I barely had cell service. If I stood in the right location and held my tounge right I might have been able to complete a call. Lol I was sitting around -120. Now I'm around -79 and in the - 80s most of time. Great cell service and haven't dropped a call. Installation was easy. I didn't spend a fortune on a poll. Made my own with the thicker chain link post. Put 2 together for 18ft pole. Mounted to side of house as high as I could get it. Used an app to find tower and pointed the antenna to it. I have the inside antenna about 30 ft from outside antenna. I am amazed by this. I get better service now than what I got living in thr city.
5,Didn't have high hopes going into this purchase but was pleasantly surprised with the results.  In a remote rural area where we could rarely get signal inside the building we were able to get 3 bars after installing the surecall flare.  Install was super easy.
4,I was a little worried buying this device based on some of the reviews I've read.  But in summary  I am happy with the results.  I went from a single LTE bar if I stood in the right spot in the house to a reliable 3 bars everywhere and 4 bars in the best places.  I went from an average of -120dbm to -100dbm  (and a 20dbm improvement is nothing to snub your nose at).  I did not get a big improvement in data speed but at least is consistent now.  The other thing folks need to know is that the internal panel antenna is directional too; so placement and angle of the internal panel is critical.  I spent most of my installation time trying different locations for the internal antenna.  Actually the placement of the internal panel antenna seemed to make more impact on my results than placement of the external yagi antenna.
2,This didn't make any difference in our area where we live.
5,I left a position at Amazon in Seattle and bought a farm in Hurricane Mills TN to raise my boys. For 2 years we've lived without cell reception and it was a little maddening. Seriously I could barely send a text from the front porch which was the only place I had a hint of a signal. We have a metal roof and that didn't help things indoors either. I bought this hoping to get even a little improvement. I hooked it up in about 30 minutes and the moment I plugged in the power I instantly had a full  LTE signal. And the signal is strong throughout the entire 4000sq ft of our house. I freaked out! It was like Christmas around here. I could receive texts in real time. Walk around inside and actually talk on the phone. FaceTime with my family back in Seattle. Stream video. Even tether my laptop to my phone! I shared it on Facebook and I think 20 other people went and ordered it today. I highly recommend this booster. FYI I have ATT service.
5,Works great if you know how cell boosters work. Purchased the panel antenna later to cover whole house.When setting up the unit make sure the outside antenna is as far and high as possible from the inside antenna. Learned the hard way.Had the booster at the end of its 50ft cable but only mounted the outside antenna about 4ft higher than the inside booster where I could get a solid 2-3 bars facing the tower.This booster is far too strong to place less than 15 ft higher at the end of the 50ft cable. The booster Will grab its own signal with the outside antenna and notice it and reduce the inside antenna with automatic gain control to reduce feedback. The higher and farther the antenna outside is the better cause the inside antenna can broadcast stronger signals without it being picked up outside.Easily cover 1500sq ft pretty well with antennas mounted properly. With the panel antenna or a cpl domes you can cover 2000-3000sq feet.Surecall can help with antenna placement as well as tuning the booster for your carriers frequencies. Turning off frequencies for other carriers will reduce signal noise on the ones you do use.
5,I did a lot of research into how cell phone signal boosters actually work and the different types of antennas before I made this purchase. My mother lives in a very rural area where fiber and cable are not available. Having gone years dealing with the hassles and ridiculous cost of satellite television and internet I was able to get her relatively decent cell service that is until COVID hit and the cell traffic with everyone home all day reduced her signal strength. I was able to boost her indoor signal from -110 to -120 dB (poor) up to around -85 to -90 (good) and what a difference that has made in reducing the buffering she was constantly experiencing watching Amazon Prime and YouTube TV. Here internet is significantly faster as well. She's happy so that makes me happy! ;-)
5,You have to have a slight signal to amplify or it won’t work and the higher the outside antenna is on the house the better. I had a bar sometimes at home and now I’m getting 4 bars with LTE. I’m very impressed. I did mount the outdoor antenna on a small pole 10 feet above the roof of a 2 story. I tried at lower points on the house and it didn’t work as well.
5,Bought this for our cabin on top of a mountain where signal is very weak. I used a longer coax cable to put the antenna about 80-100 feet away and the whole process was extremely simple. We found a direction that hits towers for both T-Mobile and Verizon working with both at the same time and signal is much much better.
5,We live in a rural area with usually less than 1 - 2 bars of signal strength.  Data was very iffy.  We use Verizon for our phone and internet connectivity.  We couldn't even think about streaming without waiting for data to be cached.  Since we installed the SureCall Fusion4Home Signal Booster life is much better.  We are continuously connected with 4 bars of strength and 4G all the time.  Our data usage has actually decreased as no we no longer have to have the data "resent" due to loss of data connections.We purchased this unit after hurricane Michael devastated our area.  Cell phone's were iffy and varied from 0 to 3 bars  after installation this unit worked great and improved our reception to 4 bars continuously.  It is a bit expensive but you pay once and do not have to pay any more $ to the Cell carriers.Installation was easy and once I found an App to give me direction and distance connection was even easier.  The app was free.As you can see I highly recommend this signal booster.
5,We have cell service inside our cabin when we didn't before. Only wish we could use a password so our neighbors would have to get there own. We turn it off when we a not there to keep people from sitting on our deck and using the cell signal.
5,Living in a valley in a rural area our cell signal strength was usable but not good usually 116-120 dBm. After installing the SureCall Flare Cell Phone Signal Booster my signal strength is normally in the 80-85dBm range! This booster was worth every penny and I highly recommend it. I went with the omnidirectional antenna and it was a good choice for me. Installing the Coax was simple in concept but not easy in application but the problems were caused by my attic layout. The 50-foot Coax that was included with the booster was not long enough for me so I did have to purchase a 100-foot Coax and a roof mount...easily done. I am very happy with this booster.
4,Have a cabin in woods where I normally received 1 bar cell service.  Cellular surveillance camera constantly triggering due to poor reception.  Add the Sure Call unit and now get 3 bars throughout the 2k sf cabin and no poor connection security camera triggers!!
5,I have a signal in the house in the country although a weak one. (Even though I can see the nearest tower about 2 miles away). In certain locations of the house the signal would disappear.(Especially in the basement)I put this in the exact center of the house (48 x 24) and haven't had a dropped signal yet (2 weeks).Installation was easy even though I did a trial run to see if the signal increased. I didn't want to permanently install the cable if it wasn't going to work.For my situation this works great.Will be interested to see what happens when the snow and cold weather comes.
5,I have Mint Mobile which uses T-Mobile towers. The reception was great outside of my home (4 bars) but inside was very poor. In my living room area I had 0 bars most of the time. I attached this antenna to the eve of my house and ran the indoor booster into my attic. I was going to run the booster down into my living room but I ran out of time and decided to leave it in my attic. I now get 4 bars all through my 1900sqft home. I suspect that if I were to run the indoor booster down into a room the signal would be better but it works great as is. Very impressed.
3,What we have discovered is the specific phone (android only/ no info on iPhone) has the greatest impact on reception. S7active works well most times to were the S20 is sketchy at best especially evident in voice calls. ???
3,Did an install and appeared to work great as I got 4 bar LTE in an all metal building.  I plugged to move the interior base unit to new location and when I plugged it back in it would not power up.  Called SureCall and they were prompt and friendly they recommended to start with a replacement power cord.  That did not solve it so had to send the base unit to CA at the cost of $52 dollars.  Unit was determined to be defective and they are shipping me a replacement but there is no reimbursement for my shipping expense.
2,I was disappointed it only works if you hold your cell phone near the indoor antenna!
3,I know these are supposed to help but we couldn’t get any better signal unless the phone was laid right on the booster. Sent back as I can just move to better reception in the house if I want my phone in one place.
4,Directions are clear and the cell signal is enhanced even though the mounting isn’t optimal. An exterior top of roof would probably be even better but figured it wouldn’t hurt to try an interior attic mount. That works well enough and was much easier.
5,I was skeptical but after installing this booster i was quite surprised.  First of all my house does not have 0 signal typically we have 2 bars on a good day and in the basement 1 bar sometimes its only 1x down there but most of the time there is at least a signal. We installed the actual booster in the basement and now we have 5 bars in the main room and 4 bars in the back room.  The main level now has 3/4 bars and the upstairs has 3 bars.  I imagine if you buy the directional booster panel rather then the whip it will provide more signal but in our case we couldnt install it anywhere and get good single direction coverage.  Install was easy the antenna feels a bit generic not sure if its going to survive a high wind storm or a hail storm but only time will tell.  Directly in front of the booster we are getting -76 dBm.  On the Main level we are getting around -90-96dBm and on the second floor we get about -100-105 dBm. Significantly better than before.
4,We have a remote riverside cabin surrounded by mountains. Phone service was poor with sketchy connections and dropped calls. Internet was slow on our iPhones. We worried that the booster wouldn't get signals from beyond the mountains but needn't have worried. This worked great. We noticed an immediate dramatic improvement in reception.We needed to buy an antenna pole to mount this to the highest place on the outside of our cabin. All other necessary hardware was supplied.We wish the cable and antenna came in choice of colors. The white doesn't look good with our cabin We painted the cable but understand painting the antenna might affect performance so we left it  a garish white.The brief documentation doesn't explain that when the red or yellow lights aren't on that's good news. Why not have a green light if it's working properly?
5,We live on 50 acres where the nearest (the only one in the area) cell tower an AT&T unit that at best puts out a -92db signal 1 mile away with an unobstructed line of sight path to it has been made usable.  Our (Yaki) antenna is mounted at the highest point of the house and can see the tower just over a ridge but is hampered by the dense trees at that ridge.  That this unit gave us any kind of a usable signal is pretty impressive!  It did take some tweaking to get the right bands working for us so that as much noise was eliminated as possible - with the help of tech support we have reliable service... the rest is up to AT&T to do a long overdue upgrade on the tower they acquired over a year ago from the former provider to the area.
5,This was easy to install. I didn't run the cable as I just used an existing leftover old dish network coax. I sloppily mounted this about 6 feet off the ground and roughly aimed it at the nearest tower. I've had to do little adjusting to get it to work for me inside our metal-sided house but it works well so far. I'm sure if you take the time to install it and adjust it just right it will work even better than my experience but I went from zero to 1 bar to 3 or 4 bars with normal reception on Tmobile Sprint and Verizon cell phones. I also have a cricket ATT hot spot but we already had decent reception on that.
5,Paired with RG11 Cable went from 1 bar to full 5G.  Installed outside antenna on top of 30 ft shop roof (great quality yagi antenna thus far).  Ran 150 ft of RG11 plugged right in to inside booster and bam 5G.
4,Bought this so I could consistently receive text messages in home and potentially have a phone conversation while home. I live in the middle of nowhere and had previously not received important test messages do to my service. I got this and for the first day it worked great and then it just stopped working. I contacted the customer service folks and they were quick to respond and quick to replace any part needed. It now allows me to consistently receive all text messages and have cell phone conversations at home. I live in a somewhat small house but it works well for me. The only downside was the original defective part and having to pay for return shipping.
4,Before installing this I would have anywhere from no signal to maybe 2 bars at just the right time. Now I've always got a signal. It may be only 1 bar at times but I no longer go to "no signal."In that respect its been worth every penny.
1,SureCall? Sure NOT. Didn't work for me. I live about 5 miles between town and the interstate cell towers all around us but the metal roof on our house makes service spotty. The only internet service available is by hotspot so I have an AT&T hotspot and both of our cell phones run on Verizon. I chose this kit because it said it works for all services. Set it all up all lights green should be working like lightning right? NOPE. Absolutely no change at all on our Verizon cell phones.  On my AT&T hotspot I could get 5 bars of 4GLTE to show on my device IF I set it RIGHT IN FRONT of the flare box BUT the actual download speed WORSENED to where I couldn't actually use the internet at all. Speedtest was .12mps and no that is not a typo! Without the Flare I was getting anywhere from 3mps to 7mps.  We bought the kit hoping to boost the signal to get download speed high enough to use Hulu or something like that and ditch DirecTV but this didn't work at all. I know the problem is with the Flare kit because as soon as we would unplug it our download speed would go back to normal.  So basically our 2-3 bars of LTE were faster download alone than 5 bars of LTE with this 'signal booster'. The fact that absolutely nothing improved on our cell phones is further indication this system doesn't work.  We tried moving the Flare moving the antennae etc for 2 days.  I called their customer service line hoping to get some assistance with using it and spoke to "Andrew". He was absolutely no help at all and seemed disinterested in trying to get my system working. Will be returning.
5,AWESOME PRODUCT.  TOOK A BIT OF TIME TO INSTALL BUT WAS FAIRLY SIMPLE.  THE RESULTS AREGREAT.  WENT FROM 0 TO 1  BAR TO 3 AND 4 BARS AFTER INSTALLATION.  STILL ADJUSTING THE AIM OF THE ANTENNA TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE.  GREAT PRODUCT.
4,Very satisfied with Fusion4Home Yagi/Panel kit. Very good packaging quality components complete kit with all needed hardware.Now for performance considering it was just installed thus far it has been a dramatic improvement. We went from -120 to -80  which means we have 4 bars of 4G LTE in our home now with excellent connection/reception during calls with no dropped calls.After lot of research Glad I made the call to go with SureCall Fusion 4.
5,The product was really easy to set up just can’t be scared of heights. My provider is Verizon so when I go to the rural ranch I have no signal not even a bar. I barely get two bars on a ridge 20 mins away. With SureCall on the roof I’m able to get 4 bars LTE off the tower a good 10 miles away.
5,Our cellular service was very painful and frustrating with dropped calls at our rural house.  We had two bars maximum and around -116 db.  We now have 3 to 4 bars and -86 to -93 db.
2,To start off I don't want you to get the wrong impression of this product. It is built well and am impressed overall. With that being said I do have some disputes with the amplifier and continuity of signal. My cabin in the applachains has no service remotely sits in a valley (200' ridgelines on either side) and is 10 miles from the nearest tower. The Yagi directional antenna (mounted on a custom built antenna tower) really impressed me as it picked up the sprint tower without a problem. However the signal will only stay on for about three minutes with data and 5 with vocal (regular GMF frequencies). In other words it works well but for about ten minutes. It took some time to diagnose that the issue wasn't line of sight or the antenna... it was the amplifier. It advertises up to 4000 square feet but yet I can't walk out of the same room before it drops the call. It's range with the flip antenna is barely more than 15 feet in the same room. However right beside the amplifier I get 4 bars of 3G 3 bars of LTE. (Just for those 5ish minutes).  I've requested a panel antenna since it is higher gain and would reccommend getting a RG11 cable instead of the RG6 for less loss from the antenna to amplifier.  I feel that for the money the product should atleast do what it's advertised to
3,We finally got this to work. Kind of. Some of the time. After hours and hours and hours tuning it. But the amplification only extend to the immediate area around the pod. Barely a small room. Forget a whole floor or several rooms.
5,This thing works well. We have a remote cabin and went from one bar to full bars on T-Mobile.  We are able to work remotely using VPN and my son is doing remote schooling (Google meet and Zoom meetings) flawlessly.  It is a little tricky to set up because the antenna has to be quite a ways away from the transmitter or else it will “oscillate”.  That requires putting the antenna outside at one end of the cabin and the transmitter clear on the far side (as far as the cord will reach).  Once we worked that out it works well.  Voice calls are clear too.
5,Our cell signal had gotten so weak that we couldn't stay reliably connected to anything online and had significant problems with phone calls as well. The Surecall booster has really improved our experience with all of that. This unit doesn't cover a huge area but our house is pretty small so it's very much worth it for us!
1,Time wasted on install and troubleshooting.  This should have improved cell signal because I can make calls inside. Main goal was to decrease dropped calls however there was no improvement in signal strength.  Primary disappointment was the amount of time wasted on troubleshooting and moving antenna and post around the yard
4,In a remote Tennessee knoll where we see zero cell bars and have no signal I decided to try this product. After locating a cell tower 8 mi away we set the antenna up and booster per instructions. Immediately we were able to call the house landline from our iPhone and hold that call for the first time ever. In the past we could sometimes call out but get dropped with minutes.  We then tried 4g data and saw we had 3 bars. Email web browsing etc... all worked. We plan to tweak and tune our set up a bit more but so far we have service where we once did not.
1,I purchased this in January for an RV we had just bought but due to the weather in Colorado was unable to install and use it until this weekend once we moved the RV from storage to our cabin in the mountains. We followed the instructions but the right yellow light constantly flashes and we've noticed no noticeable improvement in our cell signal. We get about 2-3 bars on Verizon and AT&T (and sometimes even get LTE/4G - we did today before we connected the booster) normally but often lose calls/drop signal. With the booster we got no more bars and actually signal downgraded to just 3G.  We got disconnected from 1 of the 3 test calls we made. My husband mounted the antenna on a pole and extended it 12 feet in the air and drug it out as far as the cord would allow all around the RV. Sometimes the right yellow light would flash faster and then go to very fast red. Then he'd move in the opposite direction and it would slow to a slow yellow blinking on the right but never stopped the yellow flashing (indication that the AGC is preventing oscillations). The only instructions on how to fix are to make sure the connections are tight (we triple checked both) and to move the antenna further from the booster. It is only a 50' cord and we moved it as far away as the cord would allow but still no joy.  The left yellow light only flashed for a couple seconds when I would unplug and replug in the unit hoping it would reset but again no luck. I expected much better for $300.  So disappointed!
5,I rarely write reviews but I absolutely had to for this product!!!  My reception has been very patchy and then progressed to horrible over the last few months.  I work from home and all my clients were complaining.  I spent 3 days doing everything I could to improve it: Calling AT&T Apple Spectrum bought a new phone wifi-calling complete reset of phone and wifi... everything!! I found out AT&T doesn't use their cell phone signal boosters anymore so I was out of options.  I found this and wasn't sure it would work but I set it up today and I have 4 BARS!!  I haven't had 4 BARS in years!!  I live in a 2 level condo with no access to the antenna so this is set up on my upstairs balcony and the booster is downstairs in my office (where the reception was the worst).  THIS WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!  Wish I would have found it sooner :)
4,We live out in the boonies and this has helped with phone reception.  LTE Is not always as fast as I would like and it can still conk out in certain conditions but better than no signal at all.  Be sure to set it up with at least 25 Ft between the components.  The first time we didn’t quite have that distance and it didn’t work very well.
5,I bought this for my RV.  Its a pain to set up.  I have it on a stick tied to my ladder.  I've found no good way to wire it inside either.  BUT it works period.  Downloads and streaming video much improved.  Well worth the effort when cell service is there but spotty.
5,I am using this cell booster for an AT&T signal at this location.  Before installing the booster the AT&T service was useless. Although the phone showed 1 bar texts were delayed and voice calls dropped routinely. From the top of the house I could see 2 bars of signal standing on the roof.  After installing this booster we now have 2 to 3 bars of signal inside the house and the phone calls are reliable.  Plus messages are delivered quickly. However I have a coworker who bought this booster and where he lives he gets very weak signal (1 bar and "No Service" frequently even standing on his roof) - the booster did not make any difference for him.  So be sure to take your phone up to where you would plan to install the outdoor antenna and make sure you see at least 1 bar always at that location.
3,Well it works. The rg6 cable is an interior cable not exterior so if your installation requires any part of it to run outside then add exterior rg6 to the cost. I had my booster more than 30' away from my yagi antenna and I was getting an error. Called customer support and they said I needed to move it further. So I had to buy even more cable. With my first location despite the error code my dbi was around 80 and the signal was great. Prior to installation I had none. However now that I've moved it further as instructed I'm getting 110dbi which isn't as good. Yes I have service now but barely. Reached out to customer service for a follow up on the error but haven't received a response. It works I guess so there's that. But for the money idk.
5,In the Northern Adirondacks where cell towers are far and few between and the height limit is 40' set by the State.  My closest tower is 6 miles across hills and vales. This increased my reception  -110 to -105 db Now I have in the range of -90 to -95 db. This is a huge increase. We comfortably can talk within the kitchen with no problem. Doesn't cover the whole house but the house is over 100 years old with weird nooks etc. Considering my local wired provider @ $75 a month doesn't keep up with our rural location infrastructure I installed this as a test case and after the winter may very well drop my landline provider. Highly recommend. Download some cell signal apps and test them for strength and direction. I started this project in May and just finished the final install.
4,I live in a rural part of Wisconsin where TV and Internet are available by satellite so cell service is spotty at best. I got the kit with the Yagi receiver and directional indoor antenna.  After installing the system text messages come and go instantly and phone calls are more consistently made and received. The unit definitely does improve the ability to use our cell phones throughout the house both upstairs and in the basement.
1,My advice to potential buyers:We installed this unit in a geographic location where cell phones just don't work due to poor signal reception.  Initially I got excellent results for about a day and then using this unit did nothing to improve the signal.1. Test your unit before installing it permanently for a week.  Use heavy bandwidth usage apps with and without this unit to be sure it is really doing what it is supposed to do.2. If it stops working or does not work to begin with be sure to return it for your money back.  Mine worked great for a few days at first and then not all.I tried different co-ax cables antenna positions different types of inside antennas and locations reducing and increasing gains and nothing worked.  I tried every suggestion made by the manufacturer and by users with no results.  In all the tests the signal was the same or worst than when not using the unit.The odd thing about this is that when I use my mobile signal booster made by another manufacturer I get five times the signal strength.  However if I unplug the mobile signal booster and use this I go back to seeing no improvement in performance.I made numerous calls to Verizon on this as well who claim it is not their problem.  I returned this unit to Surecall for diagnosis.  Excellent customer service but they detected no issues with the unit as well.  Unfortunately I was not able to return my unit soon enough due to geographic restrictions.
5,I bought the Flare hoping it would increase the weak cellular signal I receive in my home office where my internet connection is via the Personal Hotspot on my iPhone 6.  Immediately upon delivery of the package I did a "temporary" installation just in case the item didn't work as advertised then compared my download speeds with the Flare turned off (2.8 Mbps) and with it turned on (13.4 Mbps).  To say I was pleased would be an understatement.  After using the Flare for four days I'm happy to report the unit is still performing admirably.The permanent installation was time consuming but given the results achieved was well worth it.If you're having similar issues with a weak cellular signal in your home I can recommend the Flare as the first thing you should try.
5,Have a yurt in the mountains and reception on calls spotty 1-2 bars and if not standing in the right place calls disconnected and no connection to internet to pick up information more than a header.  Now have 3-5 bars can be anywhere near and no dropped calls and connection to internet good with phone as hotspot.  I did change out RG-6 cable for RG-11 and seems to be better & more consistent.  Directions clear & when I called Sure Call I spoke to a person very quickly who answered my question...what a relief to not be on the automated directory forever!
5,After having a metal roof installed my phone reception died. This works well and I have better reception than before.  I also live in a wooded area and before the surecall there was only one spot in my house that had any reception.  Now I get reception through out my 1200 sq. ft. Home.
4,So far it s working well. It just have it temporarily installed on a pole.. Our stucco home must block the cell signal because we are about -120db without and Approx 90 db with the Sure all Flare 3.0.
4,It works but it's not a miracle cure for a bad signal.  Living in the sticks I occasionally could get a 4G (Verizon) signal.  I put this about 25 feet high 50 or so feet away from my house on an old telephone pole and now I usually have a signal.  I have 100 feet of quad shield coax between the antenna and unit but it's the fact that I live in a little hole carved out inside a 75 foot treeline wood lot.  I wish it were better but I'm not unhappy with the investment.
2,Im not sure what I think of this. I live in a rural area in a dead zone pretty much. I followed all the instructions on installing and making sure the inside antenna dont cross signals with the outside one.  My home isn't that big maybe 1100sq ft. As square footage advertised in the description of 4000sq ft I find that to be untrue. Will it boost the bars on your phone? Yes thats a fact. Iphone 11 normally see 1 bar I  got 4. But here's the problem  while I get these extra bars my phone has to be touching the indoor antenna. If I move 4ft or even 4 inches those bars are lost. For me I am disappointed with it. Will give you more bars but nothing else. My download speeds did not increase. I have AT&T.
4,We installed on the highest point of our home. We do get more bars and sometimes it works beautifully... sometimes not. Depends on with whom we're talking? I do think it's worth a try! I was never sure of the return policy...
5,We have a cabin in an area that there is one bar inside and three bars outside.  With this we can stream to a TV for my Littles to watch shows and my husband to watch football lol. Proves to be rather helpful.
4,I got it on a 50ft pole up in the air.  Works good.  Run the wires so the device stays inside a closet to keep it out of the overheating attic( also for more control of the knobs).  The biggest problem is that bands that are used turns to "idle" and my service is instantly dropped.  Even while streaming videos it just shuts off and starts indicating that its sleeping.  No way to control it even from website or troubleshooting pdf. Other than that it works as fast as the towers (720p)
3,It does work but not as well as I had hoped.  It takes a while to tune it to your phone. I have since bought the omni antenna and we are hoping it will be easier.  I understand it won't be as strong of a signal.We went from no phone or internet to at least enough signal to call and check emails. That is what we were after when remote camping.
3,I was assured that this would help my Sprint hotspot speeds calling tech support before purchase. After installing and calling tech support I was told this would not support the bands (25 26 and 41) on the tower I was using.  While I had 5 bars my data speeds were actually much slower.  I have no doubt that this product works for most people it just didn't work for me and my Sprint hotspot.
4,Works great except I occasionally get a error light which is supposedly caused by the antenna being too close to the signal amplifier. Doesn’t happen all the time and is easy to clear by unplugging and plugging the power cord. Using at our second out in the country farm house which is basically a metal building that interferes with signals from local towers. I’m getting about a 20-30db gain from 110/120 to 85/100. Will eventually raise antenna another 20ft and move further from the indoor unit. I’m with Verizon but have family with ATT and they claim significant improvements as well.
4,Seemed to  work a little.  I returned it because my provider (Sprint) sent me a free Wi-Fi based box that worked better and was free.
4,EASY INSTALL . STOPPED DROPPED CALLS . SPEEDED DOWNLOADS TO LAPTOPS ( HOTSPOTS ) AND CELL PHONES . AT 3.5 MILES FROM TOWER I AM ON THE FRINGE OF SERVICE AREA . HIT AND MISS PHONE CONVERSATIONS  AND SLOW OR NO DOWNLOADS . BOOSTER SOLVED ALL THAT . WOULD LIKE TO PAY A LITTLE LESS MONEY FOR IT . BUT ....IS VERY COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER MODELS AND IS STILL WELL WORTH THE MONEY FOR THE SERVICE IMPROVEMENT...THANKS......P.S. MAKE SURE YOU POINT THE OUTSIDE DIRECTIONAL ANTENNA TOWARD THE TOWER  AND THE INSIDE ANTENNA AWAY FROM THE OUTSIDE ONE BEFORE YOU COMPLAIN THAT IT DOESNT WORK
4,Difficult to get the transmitting antenna far enough away from the receiving antenna to avoid the flashing yellow light indicating that the two are too close.  Get the receiving antenna up high if you are distant from the cellphone towers.
3,Doesn’t work very well. Still dropping calls as much as my old booster did (web booster). Says it can be installed inside but not true. Had to get on roof to install antenna. Not impressed...Have to use WiFi calling for phone to work. In their defense I do live in a very rural area surrounded by mountains. No clear line of site to anything. That’s the only reason I gave 3 stars. Otherwise it’s pretty worthless for me.
5,In my rural location my cell service was poor to begin with 1 bar inside preferably near a door and 2 bars outside. However when I installed a new metal roof indoor service went to 0...no calling no texting. installed the Sure Call Flare 3.0 with the directional Yagi antenna and now I have 3 bars inside. Very pleased with the ease of installation. Had a question about the light codes we were getting during installation and the tech # answered right away and answered my questions.
5,Simply put this worked very well for us. Before this we purchased a zBoost ZB545.  We received absolutely no service increase with it so it promptly went back.  The SureCall product looked more promising so we purchased and installed in the same manner.  Got our cell phone hot spot going connected the PC and BOOM now that's what I'm talking about!  Down and up speed tests jumped considerably it worked!!  From previous under 1 Mbps down to now over 14 Mbps down for the work I do that is well enough. Even full consistent bars on the phone!  Nice!  While ours came missing some washers and looked a bit fragmented regardless it worked.  The metal unit had some weight to it unlike the plastic zBoost and I liked the variable controls.  We have this in a small office space.  The antenna is about 30 feet away from the booster unit.  Thanks SureCall !
5,It took some time but we finally got the Flare working with the free Yagi antenna that SureCall sent us about a month ago. The first Flare was defective so we sent it back without a hassle. This is a company that works very hard to help their customers make their products work. Dennis and Mark were really 2 helpful technicians with the company. Thanks guys!The only thing I was not able to achieve was faster data speeds with the Flare when compared to sitting our phone in one window pane in house even though the signal strength was much better with the Flare. But our Verizon wireless Home phone unit is now at 4 bars and the cell phones in the room with the Flare are getting much better signal strength.Getting any signal booster to not go into self-oscillations has been a real struggle but we finally got the Flare past this issue.
5,I have a mobile home in the country in Virginia. I have never had cell reception inside without standing in the door or outside. I did some research and even though it was a little pricey I took a shot at this working. I had-110 db outside which was not great but I could still talk and not drop calls. After installation I turned it on and immediately had a-95 db on the inside of the trailer. WOW was all I could say. I made a phone call and it was so nice to sit in my recliner and talk. I then tried the big test. I turned on my hotspot and connected to my tv and was able to stream HULU to my tv. EVEN MORE WOWED. Thank you.
5,I use straight talk with Verizon as the carrier. This brought my non existent indor signal to a constant half or more lte full signal. Haven't had any issues with dropped calls or connecting.  Lte data speeds are. Not that great but I'm also transmitting to a tower that is about 4 miles away. Been thinking of adding a channel master antenna rotator to the external antenna in case my primary tower goes down I could redirect to another tower.Only down side of this unit is the price. But to be able to use my phone without having to stand out in the road is well worth it.  I live in the country in NW Ohio so flat farm fields help to get a clear signal.
5,We use AT&T.  Moved from Houston to east Texas...back in the woods.  We live in a metal building (barndominium) and our cell service was almost non existent inside yet good outside.With this range extender we now have broadband service inside in all parts of the house!The antenna is mounted directly to the side of the building 17 ft off of the ground.The KEY is getting the antenna far ENOUGH away from the base component.  It comes with 50 ft of coax cable and we had to get around 40-45ft away for it to work correctly.  The hardest part was just figuring out positioning other than that it has worked flawlessly and was definitely “plug n play.
5,It works for my home! I'm disabled and need access to 911 from anywhere and there were too many "dead" spots. I had a serious injury a dislocated hip and luckily was in a "live' spot. If I hadn't been I could have laid there for days because the pain was so intense. Now a wonderful neighbour can call me to check if I'm OK if I don't answer he'll come right away or call 911 for me. For me this will be a life saver sothe price has no bearing on how I feel about this product.My house is 3000 sq. ft. the longest distance from the Fusion is about 100 feet through a number of walls.
5,I admit that I doubted this would work in our home. We live out in the sticks. Kinda in a bowl-like spot with many trees at the bottom of a hill. Our ATT service has declined over the years from having some spotty service to absolutely zero service.  We had to solely depend on our spotty WiFi for calls and everything else.  Immediately after this device was plugged in/installed I had 3 bars. That has NEVER happened here. NEVER! I am incredibly thankful this worked so well!
5,I had limited cell service and would drop calls all the time. Had a wildfire take out our home landline and internet. This cell phone booster now allows us to use our cell phones with no more dropped calls. Very satisfied with this product.
4,We were hoping that this would extend our service quite a bit.  I haven't seen much of a difference but my husband says he has.
4,Was able to get this installed up and running pretty quickly.  It seems that our mobile phones work better than they did before at our home.  I would recommend this to others.
5,I live in the fringe area for cell service for all the carriers July 2020 my old carrier just went all 4G in central Alabama. So my S10E stopped receiving calls or making calls after many calls with my old carrier I was told it was my problem. Problem solved with a new carrier and Sure Call. This is a heavily heat synced booster that I know boost signals for 3 of the big carriers at my home. Heat buildup hasn't been a problem (heat shortens the life of electronics) I think it will serve me well for many years
5,Live in the hills near the Atlantic side of the dom rep. Pointed it to cell tower and it works great. Tower is about 4miles away. Installed it on a thick pvc pipe. But it’s windy here so antennae sways and signal varies when it does.. it does the job. Gona anchor it to have a better signal. Would recommend it for the dom rep.
5,We were so excited to get our new manufactured home  I didn't even care to check the cell phone signal.  That was really dumb of me because I depend on a strong signal to teach my online classes.  :-(  I am living in a pretty much dead zone. (126 dbm).  My phone shows 1 small bar all the time.  This antenna was a God sent.  Mu husband hasn't been able to help me install it on the ceiling so I just put it outside on a 15ft pole.  Not tall at all and my signal improved so much. (85 dBm).  My phone shows 5 bars now!  I can teach my classes without any issues.  I am pretty sure I will get full signal when I install it high enough.  Thank you so much!!!
5,All I can say is wow!! We bought a house in a very rural area. The only internet provider in the area is AT&T and there is a waiting list for DSL. Since I work from home I was getting pretty worried. I spent several days researching boosters and bought the SureCall. Prior to installation phone calls were hit or miss and data was nonexistent. I installed the antenna and ran the cable through the garage plugged everything in and was completely amazed! LTE service in the house. I was able to use my phone as a hotspot and went to work with 0 issues. I downloaded and uploaded hundreds of files during the week. This is a must have for anyone living in an area with spotty cell service and limited internet choices. It paid for itself in a day! Only downside is it only works on the first floor of the house.
5,I love this booster. It has improved reception all over my house more than advertised actually. Trying to install it myself was a little frustrating (I’m not really a DIY’er) but once I contacted someone who knew what they were doing it went smoothly.My call quality has improved with the Flare. It helps me get a few extra bars of signal in my home and I can place calls in areas where I'd drop them before (or where the call quality was very poor). My download speeds have improved and video streaming is faster now with the Flare boosting my 4G signal.It also covers multiple plans. It works well with my T-Mobile plan as well as my friends AT&T or Verizon.Maybe not as important but it actually looks good sitting on my book shelf—it goes well with my decor.
5,Definitely not easy to install I would have paid if we could have found someone to do it. However it works great! We were able to ditch our AT&T land line and just use our cell phones for calls. No way we could do that without this device.
5,A piece of technology that actually delivers!Prior to the latest  AT&T network "upgrade" a  passive high gain antenna was enough to deliver a strong cell signal.Purchased this system and am very pleased with the results.>> All components are well constructed>> Installation super easy!  -- READ The Instructions for proper antenna placement.>> Will buy again.
1,Sadly this product did not work for us. It does not extend any cell boost unless you stand right next to it; does not even extend 5 ft away from the flair.  We spent too much time trying to make it work then missed the return deadline by only 5 days.  Ugh.  Wish we would’ve realized that sooner.
4,Installed in my house so I could have Verizon coverage in my basement office.  Took me signal from 0-1 bar 3G up to 4 bars LTE.  I can now talk and text with out dropping the signal.  Seems to work better with my Galaxy S7 than my iPhone SE.  Follow the instructions with regards to the location of the antenna relative to the booster.  Additionally having a second person to test signal strength while adjusting the outside antenna is extremely important to how well this product functions.
5,I live in an area with VERY spotty reception though only a few miles from center of town. Did a lot of research and comparison and bought other similar items (including AT&T microcell which even after returning/exchaning 4 times would NOT activate) without success. I hooked this up and simply laid the Yagi antenna on my roof and got a decent increase in reception. When I put it about 9 feet up on a pole pointing in the correct direction (using cell tower directional software easy to find online) reception increased to 90% - 95%. Literally my reception now is as good or better than at my office or in the middle of town. Follow the directions (including how far apart to keep the exterior Yagi antenna and interior panel) and you will experience excellent results. Honestly I was surprised at how well this worked after trying so many other options that came up short.
2,Did not increase signal strength can't talk to anyone only computer generated answers
5,I have a 1200 SQ' house with a tin ceiling. Usually had 1/2 to 1 bar on my phone that is on ATT. Purchased this one which is supposed to cover 3000 SQ'.Mounted antenna on a 20' pole with 2' in the ground. Went on line and found closest ATT tower and pointed antenna in that direction.Hooked wire up to inside unit. Turned it on and BAM 5 bars baby. 5 bars in all areas except bathroom and 4 bars there.I am satisfied.
5,I live 20ish miles out of the nearest town the nearest cell tower is 14 miles away. I normally get 1x to no service on my property. I first purchased one of the competitors 120$ units and it didn’t do anything after that I debated this unit due to price and the possibility of it not working either. I arrived and I mounted the antenna 26’ up plugged everything in and it worked!! It was spotty and would fluctuate between 3 bars LTE 2 bars LTE and no service but it did work. The next day I moved the antenna up to 40’ and it’s been much more reliable. I’ve never gotten 4 bars LTE with it but I think my distance to the closest tower plays a part there but 3 bars it way better than no service.
5,We live in a metal barn home. The cell reception is awful unless you hover near the windows to make calls or send texts.  It's been 4 years and I was finally fed up with it.Ordered the system and it was delivered. Pretty straight forward directions.  I was able to use the antenna cable that was already in place to connect the cell antenna on the roof to my living room. Now we have 4 Bar LTE service inside the house.WHY DID I WAIT????!!!! It's a great purchase and no more dropped calls and horrible service inside.
4,Cell service in my neck of the woods leaves a lot to be desired and without a landline calls can be difficult. With 0 to 1 bar (mainly 2.5G with occasional 3G) if you're in the right location upstairs you could make a call but with this in place and making sure I pointed the Yagi in the right direction I can obtain a solid 3G+ for phone calls and LTE for data. I think I've had it in place now for about a month and am glad to have made this purchase.
4,Its pricey but well worth the moneyI have a travel trailer parked in between mountains in Leona Valley and had no service because I have Sprint and the area is dominated by AT&T or Verizon...because my mother is elderly and living alone no phone service is out of the question.....the amplifier has a function that lets you dial it in with a simple twist of the 5 screws that show band frequency.....now I have 3-or4 bars on the 3g-LTE ...nice....I can order Pizza from inside the trailer like a modern person.
5,I installed mine on a existing tv tower on my home. Being a 2 story home it is about 30’ up. When I temporarily set it up it indicated the inside station was to close. I purchased a splicer and an additional 50’ cable ran it through my basement and inside a wall for nicer installation. It now works great. We had almost no signal inside the house and now we go between 2-full bars with an average over 3. It is a very simple device to install.
4,So far it seems to help our signal a lot. We originally got a weboost but returned it because it helped the consistency of our signal but not really the strength or speed. This seems to help with all. I mean when we have no signal we have no signal and that is just how it is. But if there is any signal at all this thing makes it usable both for phone calls and even for some internet.
5,Product was literally install and use.  I live in a rural area and would conventionally get a moderate signal on my Apple iphone.  I installed the Surecall Fusion 4 Home and consistently have maximum signal reception.  I now use my cell phone tethered to my laptop for internet access.  Prior to purchase I completed a comprehensive review of competitive products and Surecall products received excellent reviews in a variety of categories.  Highly recommend this product if you live in a remote area and need consistent improvement in signal reception.
5,We have a cabin in a remote area of the Appalachian Food Hills we could not get a cell phone signal and our provider is Verizon. I installed it myself and it wasn't too hard but you do have to be handy. Verizon granted me permission to point it towards one of their cell phone towers about 3 miles away and it worked FANTASTIC! We not only can make calls clearly in the cabin but we also get Data.
5,Works well. We have very poor coverage from all networks. I mounted the Yagi to a previously installed satellite dish and used an app from the Android store to find the best direction to point the Yagi.  I ran the cable through a roof vent across the attic and down the wall into a room on the opposite side of the house where I've installed the booster and internal antenna.Cell signal went from about -118dB to about -95dB sitting at my desk as measured by the "Network Cell Lite" app.It's imperative you provide ample distance and proper orientation between the external and internal antennas. If they aren't far enough apart or they are oriented in such a way that their signals can cause interference with each other you're not going to get good results.
5,I never write reviews but I had to on this one. I went from 1 bar to 3 sometimes 4. For the first time in years I can make calls and not worry the party won't understand me  or that the call will be dropped. I felt I was living in a third world country for years. Now  my wife hasn't gotten off the phone for two days. It's worth every penny. We've finally joined the 21st century. Bravo Surecall!
5,5 out of 5 for me as on now but will update in a few months. Installation was really easy and it was pretty much plug and play. The only hardest part routing the coax cable from the roof into my basement. Once everything is hooked up it worked immediately. From zero signal in the basement to full bars. I should have done this years ago!
4,It gave me lye and 4 g but it was not strong enough . Still too slow for data
5,I bought the more expensive weboost first. Spent hours and hours finding the best spot on my roof setting it to the direction that got the best signal position it around in my house to re-broadcast the signal.  This surecall got better reception after five minutes and a bungee cord. Also has a cleaner design. I would say that both of them dont have great broadcasting distance. I need to be in the same room as the device to get good speed but I'm much happier with the surecall. It works with my girlfriends cricket line and my Verizon straight talk when the weboost wouldn't get decent reception for the cricket line. Would buy again no question.
5,I order this SureCall Yagi/Whip Signal Booster Kit  5 months ago and I can verify it works. We moved to  a rural area a year ago our signal inside our home would be 3G which  allowed us to use our 4G cellphones in only one spot in the house. The phones would not ring most of the time even the 3G flip phone we used would not work well inside. We installed the SureCall and put the signal booster with the inside antenna  in the center of the house and the signal is great. We now have 4G and can surf the web talk text in any room of our home. We got rid of the 3G flip phone and got new 4G phone. Thanks SureCall for this product so glad I found it...
5,After the first one being a dud that wouldn't power on and having to pay $23 more in shipping to send it back for a replacement this seems to work well so long as I'm within ~15' of it.  On AT&T I went from a questionable one bar of 3g that I could only get if I had the phone propped in the window just right to 2-4 bars of 4g LTE in most of the building. (Off-grid location in the middle of nowhere about 10 miles or so from the closest tower having to go through quite a bit of trees.)(edit: revised range downwards after a bit of use... Full signal right next to it about half signal where picture is taken from and signal is lost by the table in the background.)
4,This works pretty well. I am 23 or so miles from the nearest cell tower. This took me from standing on the porch in the cold tilting my head to being able to make and receive calls inside with consistency. I have full signal if I am within 10' of the internal antenna. It drops off significantly after that but I may try an omni directional antenna and see if that provides better coverage in my home.
3,I bought 9 of these boosters over the last few months and have had to return a few over this issue. The yagi antenna is not made very well. Aside from it being a 25ohm antenna it has a pin inside the F connector that comes out when you connect a cable to it that's not supposed to. If you lose the pin or can't get the pin back in the F connector the yagi is inoperable and will NOT pick up signal. I called SureCall about the issue and no one called me back. Shocking.  I would return all the boosters I bought if I could and buy better ones.
5,Intermittent (very intermittent) 2g signal on one phone (Pixel 2) is what we got (older phones even poorer reception) - went to LTE 90% of the time (at slow speeds however) hitting Tmobile towers miles and miles away (not hitting any Sprint towers for phone #2 however at higher than 2g!!).  It truly went from nothing to at least something - and that is infinitely better than nothing.  I wouldn't use this if I were in town had wifi network access or a wireless ISP availability but I don't and the house is in a cell dead spot (or was before this) with satellite ISP the only other connection to civilization.  House is in a canyon surrounded by trees. DEFINITELY exceeded my expectations.Sidenote: The outdoor antenna works from INSIDE our attic!
4,Great! It is working fine now after so many research from the reviews who bought this particular model.I Also. bought the Sure call Signal meter to locate the exact tower where i lived. The only complaint i have right now is the Antenna inside my house. You have to be close enough to obtain 4 or 5 bars otherwise 3 bars are consistent. In the future i'm thinking of changing it to a Flat Panel Antenna. maybe it will help the wide coverage's.
5,So far so good! I went from zero cell service in my house to 2-4 bars of LTE. I was able to attach the antenna to an existing pole on my roof which made the install a breeze. I tested it in on my porch before doing the full install to save myself time if I had had to return it thankfully it didn’t come to that
5,This thing is awesome! I live in a rural community where service especially within your home can be troublesome. I heard about this product and decided I would give it a try. I am not disappointed this thing worked amazing. Everywhere within my house I had full service and I maintained 3 and 4G the whole time. Like I said living in a rural area in almost the middle of nowhere this thing is a must have when service is spotty. Plug this thing in and set it up and it does wonders. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to boost their service or just want to pick up additional bars to where they can call without having to walk around finding a spot where you can actually have a good conversation on the phone. Love it!
5,I purchased this to us with an RV. The results did not disappoint. While the results are not scientific here is what I found. Outside my camper my cell had little reception and dropped calls.  With  surecall I've gone to 4 bars and am able to utilize streaming services (Amazon Prime youTube ESPN).
5,Nothing is cheap that works good. The reason for 4 stars on the value is it looks like where the housing for the inside unit snaps together is coming apart and won't push together but not a big issue being it's the back side.  I mounted the bracket directly to the side of our eve of our home ran the cable plugged it in and Bam! We had 2 to 3 bars of 4G in the house! We have a tin roof and corrugated siding so we usually have no service at all! Very pleased!
5,This booster was a breeze to install.  The reception was immediate.  We were blown away.  We went from zero bars in our metal building to three bars!  I highly recommend this signal booster.
1,After installing and adjusting the SureCall Flare 3.0 Cell Phone Signal Booster for Home Yagi Antenna Configuration I contacted Amazon support and they could not resolve the problem. Amazon support put me in contact with the selling company's tech support come to find out I do not have enough cell signal for the antenna to pick up and boost. There suggestion was to return it to the seller "AMAZON" when I contacted Amazon they informed me that my return window had closed and the seller does not sell to the public. Even with Amazon knowing that I was having issues with this item and was working with the selling company to try and resolve this issue to no avail the still will not allow me to return this item.In short if you have problems with this antenna not working properly when you first get it installed RETURN THE ANTENNA do not try there tech support or allow the to persuade you to use the sellers tech support.
5,We had a weboost with omni antenna for four years. It only supplied us with 2 bars in the house where we had none. Outside where I stationed the antenna we had only two bars... The SureCall Flare 3.0 with Yagi antenna gives us 4 bars in most of the house! We're still receiving only two bars sometimes three at the same antenna location . It boosted two bars to four! Its super easy to install. Determining the strongest signal location was the hard part. I downloaded four different apps and studied them several days before installing in the exact location as our old one. We're 10 miles or so from antennas in a rural area..
5,Works beautifully. Live in a remote cabin and had no usable signal.  We rely on satellite internet but have no options when bad weather occurs.  We now get 3-4 bars with great data speeds.  We could not be happier with the performance.  I assumed my signal was coming from one direction and determined using cell mapper app that it was coming from a mountain top many miles away. Wish I would have tried this long ago because it's a real life changer for us.
1,I was unable to get this item to work and returned it. I show this item as received by you on 8/25 and have not received a refund yet.
5,I bought this for my home because where I live in the house (and outside the house) I only had one bar of cell signal certainly not enough for when the power goes out or when the landline is downed by falling branches. After installing I was extremely happy with how drastically my cell reception improved. I still only have one bar in the back of the house but when I am out in the front where the fireplace is located we have enough to be able to make and receive calls. This winter I will surely have a chance to see how well it does when using the emergency generator.
5,Cell signal is now better inside the house than it is outside
5,Our mountain home proved too remote for cell service until I gambled on the reputation of SureCall Flare. The cell signal  from the lone provider in our area was so weak I only got "no signal" alerts at our location. Once I ran through the simple set up my Flare was quickly up and running.  Now we have a solid signal even with the omni-directional antenna included with my purchase. With a directional antenna I'm sure the boost is even better. If you are experiencing similar issues I highly recommend you consider giving SureCall a try!
1,At risk of life and limb I installed the antenna on an 11' mast (additional equipment) at the roof peak. Ran cable down the outside of the house through the basement and up to the living room. The booster is now located 70 feet from the antenna. 2500 sq. ft. coverage is a joke 2 feet is more like it. prior to installation our signal strength was -121 dBm where I am now sitting 25 feet from the booster it is -124dBm. A total waste of time effort and money.
5,I used to get 1 or 2 bars around my house and none in my basement. Now I'm happy to report 3 to 5 bars everywhere in my house including my basement. That makes me a happy boy.
4,Does not work with visible or t-mobile. Worked very well with at&t.
5,Everything needed to install and start working was included in the package. I installed the product myself and it was very easy indeed to install. Also the most important thing is that it works exactly as described. I am very happy with how this product works.
5,Installation was straight forward. Put it up where it has a direct line to the cell tower run the cable inside the house and connect it to the inside unit. My cell phone went from 1 bar to 4 bars inside the house. Now I can ZOOM with family and watch movies on my phone with no waiting.
3,It was easy to install and I went from 1 bar to 4 bars...... BUT just in one room of the house.  I leave the living room where it's mounted and go to the kitchen and I drop the call.  For the price I would have expected much more.
5,Have a house in the mountains around Boquete Panama where I always had to go up the steep bank behind the house to get any cell reception. Put this antenna up there and ran 150 ft. of RG6 coax to the booster in the house and now have ability to use phone and internet on phone in the house for first time. Even with the much longer cable I still get codes that tell me the antenna and booster are to close together but does not cause any problems. We use Claro but it also works well for neighbors that use Movil. Need to get them to buy their own so they quit hanging out on our patio. lol
3,I did not want to run a cable into my attic and install it up there in the heat where I thought it would be bad for electronics so I ran it down the side of my house and mounted it where I could get to it and it would be in normal temps. Well that was great until it snowed heavily. That killed it. So I would suggest putting a protective box around it if you mount it on the side of your house like I did.
5,Love it. Went from one bar inside and dropped phone calls to 3 and 4 bars. It does go and come at times but we finally have good service inside the house. We also did away with our sorry internet provider.
5,I have tested this product in 3 locations in the last week.  First in Ithaca NY where I had one bar of Verizon coverage at my house and it went to full strength as soon as I turned on the device.  Then I headed to the mountains of virginia where it immediately helped out a friend at his house to increase coverage from 2 bars to 4 bars.  And for the final test I am in the bahamas on Cat Island and it boosted the single for BTC from 1 bar to full strength LTE.  This device works great.  It WILL NOT create signal where there is none but as long as it's one bar it will boost it.
5,I live in a metal building and the cell signal inside really sucked.  I had to go outside to get decent enet or cell signal on my phone or hotspot.  This seemed to have a good price point so I gave it a try.  Before installing this I got 1/2 to 1 bar inside--Now I get FULL bars on 2 different carriers.  Be sure to check for the bands of your carrier before ordering.  I had a different booster prior and it didn't work at all--wrong bands.
2,I placed the inside unit as far from the outside antennae as the provided cable would allow but it still interferes with itself about once a day and wont recover itself without a power-cycle. I got tired of this so I put the power cord on a timer so that it reboots every 12 hours. Disappointing.
5,I live in the boonies of WV. I usually am lucky to get one bar on a good day. Then we installed this system. Wow! I was skeptical when I ordered but after seeing my cell jump up to 3 bars seconds after turning the booster on has changed my life! 😁 On cloudy days I get 1-2 bars but I used to get none on those days! I highly recommend this booster! Keep in mind though that if you get zero bars outside this will NOT work! You have to have something to boost.
1,This product and with professional installation does absolutely nothing.  Didn’t boost any signal.  So throwing away about $600 was a complete disappointment.  I wish I could’ve known this in advance.
5,It does what is supposed to do now I have 3-4 bars in our Verizon phones the speeds went from 2-4 mbps in my living room to 25-35 mbps as it is on the outside if you step out of my house the signal is good but once inside before the booster it used to go down way down and only 1-2 bars in some areas of my metal roof house but after installing this booster I have definitely higher speeds and better coverage around the main areas.
3,Always constantly or having to reset it. But when it works it does work well.
5,We moved to Maine in a very rural area. We ordered satellite wifi because our cell signal was weak as could be. 1 bar. The wifi was just as weak so we cancelled it after a month. We ordered the surecall flare used the existing coax cable for the wifi and mounted the antenna on the arm of the satellite dish . 5 BARS!!! This thing is awesome!!!
5,Installed yesterday at a deer camp/lease that’s always had poor cell reception. Quick and easy install few screws run cable few more screws plugged it all in and saw an instant improvement. Doubled my reception. If I was getting 1 bar it increased to 2 sometimes 3. If I was getting 2 bars it increased to 4. Flawlessly steamed 2 movies the other night on an Apple TV using a phone hotspot for service. Worked great with AT&T and my buddy with a Sprint phone  saw improvement too. Hope the results continue but so far so good.
3,This has improved our mobile service but doesn’t work as well as a cell tower booster I used to have. I need to be pretty close to the tower itself to get clear service. I thought the range would be farther.
5,We have installed similar products so installing this one was not difficult.It gave me wall to wall bars as long as I am in that room. The farther away you get the bars drop a little. Previous bars were 1-2. I could only use data early morning. Now I can use data anytime wo issue.
5,liked the quality of product as a kit and works really well given i was starting in a extremely compromised signal zone -128 went from 1/2 bar to 3 bars / BUT woulda been nice to have been appraised of some smaller connectors that make the install more fluid/ BUT their 'Shining Star' was their tech-support guy Hector H. he stayed positive as he helped me thru the 'coax-cell-signal world'
5,I was very frustrated that I was dropping calls and in some circumstances couldn't make a call at all from my house.  I would get from zero to sometimes one bar on my cellphone.  I can now get three and sometimes four bars and no dropped calls at all since installation.
3,Still have one bar but the reception improved. Not great but some definite improvement.
5,I live in an area with very poor cell service.  I have tried other types of boost to no avail.  With this SureCall boost I have three bars throughout the house.  It is so good I have to go inside for calls rather than standing by my garage's rainspout to get a signal.  Definitely work the price!
5,At our cabin we had very spotty signal being in the middle of the woods of a national forest. We installed the antenna up above the tree line and pointed it towards the Verizon tower 10 miles away. We went inside where previously we could barely send and receive text messages and now had amazing signal. Initially had issues with the LTE bands but the manufacture was great to deal with while troubleshooting/resolving the problem. We powered the booster off our cabins 12v solar system using   HitCar 12V 12-Volt 24V DC 2.1mm Car Truck Bus Van Boat Cigarette Lighter Power Supply Adapter Charger Cable         instead of the included AC adapter. The entire family agrees that it was a solid addition to the cabin.
5,Hi! I'm Jorgie: I live in the center of Puerto Rico surrounded by mountains I use to have only one bar of signal and in rare case two. I have no idea where the cells tower is located because I am not able to see them so I took my chances and bought this (sure call amplifier) I mounted the antenna on a 20 foot long steel pole on the roof of my house hooked up all the wires turned on the booster and the signal went from one bar to five bars in a "blink of the eye" like magic this product is awesome! It worth the price.
1,We got to use this maybe one time! Next time the thing didn’t work!
5,I bought mine in 2016 and it's been working great I had to go up 40 ft in the air with antenna because I'm in a low area. I like the directional antenna one tower slowed down so I found another to pull off of. Android apps I use are network cell info opensignal and speed test. Network cell info is most informative truly a 5 star app. Installing it is not for the fear of hights if u have to put up tall antenna pole or on a high spot. I did not have to call tech support but would have been faster figuring out settings. So cannot comment on tech support.
5,Couldn't get a cell signal inside or outside the house before I got this booster.
4,it works well in the whole house 6000 sq ft but with that said i have great signal out side the house so it does what its suppose to . i have not needed tech support.
1,I received a used product that I purchased "New". The box was torn packaging was missing and the internal receiver was scratched and clearly missing some of the rubber foot pads on the base.This product does not work well for more than one device. And it definitely does not grant anywhere near the signal gain that it promises. Also I set it up so that the antenna was far enough away from the receiver to exceed the manufacturer's recommended distance but it still gives the error message that it needs to be farther apart. I'm tired of moving the antenna once a week to see what works. One last thing it doesn't work well with Verizon but it did work well for my friend's device and they're on AT&T.
5,The SureCall Fusion4Home Yagi Panel Cell Phone Signal Booster worked great for us. We could barely get 1 bar of service now we have 4 bars. We installed it ourselves in a few hours the most time consuming part was running the cable. The set-up was easy we downloaded the "Network Signal Info" App as SureCall had suggested found our strongest signal directed the outdoor antenna in that direction ran the cable and connected everything. We turned it on and immediately had the strongest signal we have ever had at this location. Great product and great service we called them to find out what system they would recommend for our situation. I highly recommend this product.
5,For some reason our house and one very close by are in a cell signal black hole. The 3rd house in the area hasn't got a problem. After a year of having to stand in the front yard looking North East over the roof of the house I finally decided to bite the bullet and see if this thing would help. And it does! We can not make calls from every room in our 1500 sq ft concrete house with the metal roof. It has been up and running for about an hour with no issues. I will be happy to edit this if issues arise.
5,We have a split level home where the lower level is mostly below ground level and of course is cement block walks. My wife's office and our family room are located here. We were both experiencing lousy reception on our phones (Samsung S8+ & iPhone 7+) my iPad and her Kindle and work Lenovo laptop. Since installing the SureCall (very easy except for me at 68 climbing on the roof to install the antenna... lot of getting yelled at by the wife) neither of us have experienced a dropped call or any lose of signal on our devices. The wife states her work from home issues around lose of signal etc. are gone. Well worth the money.
5,I used this at my second home in the Southern Tier of NY State.  The mountains/hills really interfere with the signal and previously to having this unit I could only place a call from one spot out on the deck....move 2 feet to the left or right it drops.After installing this unit I can call from anywhere.  I get either 4 LTE or 3G...sometimes it drops but I never had either before....so I'm damn happy.  Plus I don't even have the unit mounted on my roof....its off the deck.  So given the amazing increase in signal and the less than perfect way that I installed it I would say this is a damn good unit.
5,We have a multi-room office shack inside a manufacturing building and the reception inside the shack stinks.  I just put the antennae on top of a tool box on the shop floor and snaked the cord back to the office shack as a quickie crap test and plugged it in.  We immediately went from maybe 1 bar to full signal strength inside the office shack.  Literally...all I did was plug it in to the wall power to make it work.
5,I couldn't get a 4G LTE signal in my house but I could in my yard. The nearest cell tower is over 8 miles away. It was so frustrating having to go outside to make a call or send a text and wait for a reply. After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I now have a 4G LTE signal in my house it is only 2 to 3 bars but I can make calls send and receive texts without having to go outside to my yard. It does take time to set up but it was worth the time we put in to install it.
5,I didn't have much faith in this product only because nothing seems to ever work as advertised. But after running around my yard with the antenna I found a good spot. I couldn't stream anything before installing. Now I can stream and that's all I ever hopes for. Thanks for making a quality product that works as advertised.
5,I purchased the SureCall product with hopes it would solve the cellular reception problem in my 3 story home.  It did.  I now have the best overall reception I have ever had and it is consistent even in the daylight basement. We have tried other products sold by our cellular provider and none of those products worked as well as this product does. It has exceeded our expectations.  The small signal booster tower located approximately 35 feet from the furthest room in the house through multiple walls and we get good reception in that room as well.  Most importantly my wife no longer complains about our bad cell reception.
3,I live in a rural area and this signal booster didn't really improve my cell phone signal reliably @ all.  We've tried moving it around to different area's of the house - on top of cabinets etc.  Lot of money for something that doesnt work for me.
5,After getting it installed on my home the "Flare" unit had a "short" in the wiring. I contacted their customer service line and they immediately sent me a replacement awesome customer support. I am very happy with this system and would buy another one. It boosts my Cricket (AT&T) signal in my house so I can finally make/receive calls. Just a little tip though get the Wilson Fixed antenna mounting kit to get the antenna as high on your house as possible that makes a big difference. For my 3 story home it took care of the basement main floor and enough of the 3rd floor that calls connect just fine.
5,As many reviewers were I was skeptical. I recently switched to att and had anywhere from 1(mostly) to 2 bars 4g lte outside or near windows. I would often lose signal in interior areas. My wife's cspire had a weak signal. I installed the yagi antenna at roof top and flat panel in hallway close to middle of house. I now keep at least 1 bar of 4glte anywhere inside more like 3 to 4 bars closer to inside panel antenna. My wife's phone keeps 2 bars 4glte closer to panel. My dsl is slow this system made my cellular internet better. My thanks to the reviewers and their responses I read before purchasing!
5,I’ve had this for several months now and have to say I’m very pleased with how it works. I live in an area with poor ISP service (looking at you Windstream) I run this with a sim and the up and down speed averages 50/15 not great but way better than 10/1.5 they offer. I turned off the built in WiFi and use with Eero and its very stable. I reboot about once a month probably not necessary but I do it anyway. Well worth the cost.
4,This replaced my high-end Wilson booster and blew it away. One to two bars on a good day with no booster two to three with the Wilson and three to five with the SureCell. Quality all the way. The reason for one star off is the huge price jump (I paid $400).Update: After a year the SureCell yagi failed. Their customer service is five stars.
5,It works! I was living in a valley between 2 mountains. Surrounded by thick forest next to a couple ponds.... compleate dead zone. No service at all. Put it ontop of my 2 story house and I went from no service to full bars lte 14mpbs internet. Though this model did only provide that service for my downstairs. A little upstairs. But I expected that with this model. There’s another that has a stronger indoor antenna. Probably works amazing too. I’ll have perfect service the rest of my life no matter where I go. Well worth hashing our the money for it.
5,So I Ordered the Weboost first for close to 500 bucks and it was terrible it kept getting into feedback loops no matter how far away I put the antenna and when it did decide to work it would jump to 1x most of the time totally not worth it. I returned the weboost and ordered this after reading about in on boosting forums.It took me all of two hours to set it up and I instantly get 3 bars in a place I wouldn't get one I am very pleased with this product! Surecall you rock!
1,This booster does not work at all!!! Our neighbors (about 10 miles away) recommended it. After we set it up they told us to get the additional antenna (the plain white box looking thing that hangs there). They said it wouldn't really work without it. So we did now into this almost $500...and what do you know. Nothing! Well you can connect to 3G if you are standing RIGHT next to the little black box that has the on/off switch. That's about the only time you can get anything. We waited it out to see if the new antenna would help and unfortunately the return time frame passed in the meantime. Extremely disappointed as we are now stuck with a $500 hunk of junk that doesn't do anything!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Super bummed about this whole situation.
5,It did what they said it would. I hardly had signal and would have to go outside or stand at a window to use the phone. Now I have full bars and it was well worth the money to me.
5,I bought this booster to replace another that did not support LTE band 12.  This one works really well and now I have full LTE coverage inside my house.  Strength is typically -90 to -100dBm all through my house on band 12.  I used to only get very weak HSPA+ and even that would sometimes drop entirely.Caution:  make sure you have good LTE signal outside - this thing can't make a signal appear it can only boost what is already there.  Also if you get the Yagi make sure it is pointed accurately.
4,Live in the country and we switched from satellite internet to straight mobile using this and before we couldn't use our cell phones in the house
5,We live in the country where cell phone service is sketchy at best. Before the booster install texting might work and talking on the phone was out of the question. We now enjoy 3-4 bars and our cell phones work great. We have had this almost a year and no issues yet. I finally talked my parents who live next door to us into getting this same model. We just installed it today and they are very happy with it. I would definitely recommend this product and felt it was pretty straightforward installing it.
5,My husband installed this last night wayyy up near the top of our antenna tower outside ran the wire through the wall and on to the very nice looking indoor booster and the very second we plugged the thing in we both watched the bars on our cell phones go from one bar to four.  I used to have to hold my phone near a window to get -119 dBm and now it's holding steady in the -70s.  In rural Michigan that's freakin' incredible!  This is the best purchase I've made all year.
5,self explanatory instructions  went from one bar on a good day to consistent 2 with sometimes 3 bars. That may not sound that great but going from no service to having reliable service was huge for us.
4,This is a good booster and I get more bars inside my house now. It feels great to call inside. I used to have to go outside to call and text. AMD now I dont.
5,I live in a small town and cell service is very spotty. I recently moved and found in the new house I had barely 1 bar and was missing calls. I also couldn't send text messages with photos attached due to the poor signal strength. After installing this booster I get anywhere from 2 to 4 bars in my house. I couldn't be happier. Installation is very straightforward. I mounted my Yagi (outside) antenna on the eaves of my house without using a pole and still get great reception. FYI my cell service is through TracFone who uses other carriers towers.
3,Bought to replace small home WeBoost hoping for improved coverage.  Unfortunately  there is no improvement
5,Added before and after screen shots - in a metal building!  Signal not bad outside but building acts as a barrier - now I’m back up to full potential.
4,very easy to install and did the trick.  I went from zero bars inside to three bars inside from and external signal outside my house that was one bar.  key thing for success is to follow the directions and make sure the antennas are as far apart as possible.
5,This booster actual works in my situation I have a good signal outside my shop 5 bars 5G however inside my metal building I was only getting 1 or 2 bar with lots of missed calls. Took me a good couple of hours to install. I had to run the cable through a very shallow ceiling and its summer time here in Louisiana.  installed I have 5 Bars 5G coverage throughout my building. I couldn't be happier This review is for the" SureCall Flare Cell Phone Signal Booster"
5,I live in the middle of nowhere 600 feet from the main road in the woods in a Valley. I have one or two bars all the time and so do all my friends each one has a different carrier. I was pretty skeptical buying this. Took less than 30 minutes to install everything then within minutes I had full bars!! Had some friends come over all their phones had more bars than usual! Definitely would recommend Journey buddy that lives in the woods and have poor reception in the basement!!!
4,the range is not as good as i had hoped for even if i get 30-40ft waway signal drops pretty good close by i get 4-5 bars from verizon
2,Received the product and appears to be constructed with higher quality parts. Fairly easy to install and need to ensure that the antenna and receiver are at least 25ft apart. I’ve owned it for a little over a month and my experience has been a roller coaster ride. On some days it increases my reception by 2+ bars on other days it doesn’t work at all. I’ve found that an error is thrown at least once a day and requires the system to be rebooted. Once rebooted seems to work okay again for 12-18 hrs.
2,This was WAY too expensive for the results!After a some time with this unit I deeply regret the purchase. I have followed all "best practices" and suggestions from the manufacturer to NO avail.I am fully aware of the use fir these units as well as the good and bad. This unit has disappointed at every turn!Lesson learned!!
5,set the antenna on the ground behind my garage and plugged it in. Full 5 bars on my phone anywhere in the garage. Now the antenna is on top of the garage.
2,Fairly easy install.  Took a little tweaking to dial everyting in.  Only used on the weekends and not every weekend.  Using it to boost a hot spot.  Works with the hot spot right in front of it.  Probably has 30-40 days of use in the 7 months I've had it.  On my box after 7 months all the led's light up a dim amber.  Apparently the power adapter has gone bad.  Based on what I've seen online may be a common theme.  And they want almost $30 for a replacement.
5,With COVID-19 I was working out of my home.  I live in a small town on the ocean in Maine where AT&T registered 1 bar in my home office.  I had the SureCall installed and the minute I plugged in the system the bars went to 3 to 4 bars.  I was very impressed and still am.
5,This unit worked exactly as advertised however my provider did not have the bandwidth to support good signal strength. Even with my inside signal strength at an excellent level my download speed was less than 1mbps while upload was 5mbps. Excellent product.
5,This was dead simple to install. We have a camp deep in the Pocanos and you’d have to walk outside and about 40’ to the road to go from zero bars to one bar. The nearest cell tower is 2 miles away behind the hill we’re tucked up against.I ran out the cable after figuring where the indoor intenna should go put a ladder against the nearest tree and nailed it up.We immediately went from zero bars in the camp to three bars! That was it! No fuss!
5,I was skeptical at first that this would do any good at my house which is in a cell-phone black hole for all carriers.  However after installing it inside a decorative dormer (instead of on the roof) I have been very happy with the results.  For the first time ever I was able to conduct a phone call while sitting on my living room couch instead of going out to the front porch.  I still need to tweak its location in the house for best coverage but I love it.
5,I was surprised at how well this worked. I work in a confined space with four others and each of us are on a different network. It took some playing around with the antenna (it really wants to be outside as instructed) but it was worth it. Our signal strengths each went from one unreliable bar to five consistent bars(we are in a reinforced concrete faraday cage or something). We now send/receive calls and texts and can use data as though we were outside. It's been a game changer.
3,It intermittently worked as advertised.  If power cycled I could count on it giving me an extra 15db of signal strength but if I let my phones sit without use for a while they defaulted back to the low strength tower signal.  I had to return it but it might work well in a different setting.  BTW - I contacted the manufacturers customer support and they were very good about replying quickly.
5,I had to go outside my house to use my phone ? I finally went ahead and paid the extra cash and bought this unit. Was well worth the extra cost. Easy to setup and get going. Love it!!
5,At my summer cottage in north Wisconsin I had been getting 1 or 2 bars of mostly 3G Verizon service on my Note 4 phone.  Sometimes even 4G LTE would be available. Then we installed metal roof and suddenly I was barely able to receive phone calls indoors. I mounted the SureCall Flare's omnidirectional antenna 5 feet above the metal roof on a ladder and now have 2-4 bars of 4G LTE inside the cabin and can reliably watch Netflix and ESPN via my phone.  The Flare is well designed and the indoor antenna is attractive.
5,Works great.  Only issue I had was picking a location for the antena.  The directions also mention better then -100 signal strength at the antenna I had this in 4g but not LTE.  I turn off LTE on my phone and get solid service through out my house 2500 sq ft and in my unfinished basement.PVC pipe a wood block for leveling and some roofing screws worked to attach it.Buy some coax cable holders to run the cable along the side of your roof if you want it to look clean.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NBX0WUG/ref=asc_df_B00NBX0WUG5167924/?tag=hyprod-20&creative=395009&creativeASIN=B00NBX0WUG&linkCode=df0&hvadid=214510054050&hvpos=1o5&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16291344194648446402&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9016212&hvtargid=pla-348724599060
5,We live out in the county and get a pretty weak cell signal.  Before using this we had 1-2 bars only in very specific areas of the house.  Now we have 3-5 bars throughout the house.  Calls are clear now and don't drop when we move around.  4G LTE data works with no issues.I was able to mount the Yagi to an old tv antenna so that made installation easy.  After running the cables it was all plug & play.  No tuning or troubleshooting needed.
5,I am very pleased with the results we are getting!  Cell signal went from -112db to -90db with no fine tuning or adjustments.  After finding the optimum location to mount the outdoor Yagi antenna the installation was straightforward and easier than I expected.  I was concerned that we wouldn't get the required 30 ft separation between the outdoor and indoor antenna as our cabin does not have a large footprint but it works!  I may opt to upgrade to the dome or panel indoor antenna to better broadcast the boosted signal but overall we are really pleased with this product.
5,My shop is a concrete block building and calls would drop constantly.  During winters I would have to go outside to place a call.  After installing this signal booster I have 4 bars inside.  Best thing ever!
4,Just moved and for the first week I had no service. Got this and now I’m chatting up a storm!
5,Works exactly as advertised. Standing on the ground I had 1or 2 bars outside my hangar and zero inside. We easily mounted the receiving unit near the roof. I now have better cell reception inside the hangar than outside. Couldn’t be happier. Well worth the money.
5,Very Solid and sturdy and Wow what a Difference. Like night n day. Went from 1 bar or less and Now I get 2 to 3 bars in my home and I live in a bad area for cell signal
5,Right off the bat we stopped dropping calls and have been able to video chat with family. I went from 3G to 4G. No fancy install put it on a pole so it was 2foot higher than the roof. No problems at all. Living in the country it saved me over $1200 a year on not having a regular phone with unlimited long distance.
5,I have been looking for a signal booster for a while now. I have been researching and worrying they do not work from reading comments. I got this today. Ran the wire stuck the antenna out the window plugged it in and wa la. I now have 4 bars from 0-1 bar inside my house. Best purchase I have made in a long time. I am very happy. I bought the Yagi and am thinking I probably could have used the omni antenna.
5,I have T-Mobile and live in a remote location... no cable or DSL available either.. As nearly as I can tell the nearest T-Mobile cell tower is about 11 miles away and I cannot actually see it but using OpenSignal I can tell the direction. Outside I would occasionally get 4G signal with one or two bars but that was transient .. in and out. So I really wasn't expecting this to help that much but wow!  It has been very good and now I have quite reliable phone and LTE inside my house.
5,I went from no service to three bars and gained about 30-40db.  I live in a 1400 Sq Ft. house and this is rated at 4000 sq ft.  It fades pretty quick once you put a couple of walls between you and the antenna so that is a little disappointing however that is with this in a closet with the antenna that you see.  I bought an extra cable and dome antenna that I have not ran yet.  I expect signal improvements when I do this.
5,This booster is amazing... I purchased this for my Dad. He lives way out in the country with a rally week cell signal. Before installing the booster you had to sit in one room of the house without moving to talk. I installed the booster now he has a very solid 4g connection all throughout the house. I would highly recommend this product.
3,Doesn’t seem to work very well. A huge issue placing the antenna on the roof at the highest point as directed.
3,I have been using Weboost for many years.  This brand works much better.  But it is very temperamental.  Antenna go bad quickly.  And it sinc here and there.  Be aware when all the lights are on it is working.  I spent enormous time tying to figure out why it work well only sometimes...
3,When it worked it does a fine job my unit was defective from get go it refused to wake up after going into sleep mode due to no activity. Called the company and a new unit was sent within 7 days it's performance seems to be working good. Manufacturer did not pay for return shipping so I knocked them down a star down another star for not testing unit proper before selling it.
5,I live at the lake with the nearest Vz tower 3 miles away. Was only getting 1 bar sometimes 2 on a good day. Now consistent 4/4 bars and able to view streaming content. Great product great signal.
2,It came missing pieces. It did not have a RG cable with the product. It didn't have clamps to fix it to a pole. Nothing was mentioned in the description when I was deciding on buying it that for 20.00 less than a new product I would be missing critical pieces. I then had to run to Wal-Mart to pick up a cable and clamps. This is not an easy run as we live 45 minutes away from town. Once I hooked it up it seemed to work fine. I recommend the booster but not the seller. Buy new if your looking for one of these and get it from the manufacturer. You get everything to set it up and a warranty.
5,If you have an iPhone and you’re having problems getting a strong signal this product works immediately was easy to install saving me a lot of money.
5,Lost almost all signal when we got a metal roof. This has me back to 3 bars. It does its job!
5,System is performing better than expected. AT&T cell service in my area is very weak. Tech support at AT&T confirmed that I'm in a narrow band of signal deprivation.SureCall with antenna up 14 feet manages to give me acceptable service in spite of an input signal much weaker than than their advertised minimum.
5,Our cabin in the mountains gets a terrible cell signal.  We hooked this up with the easy to follow instructions pointed it in the direction of the closest cell tower and went from one bar to five bars immediately!
1,I’ve had this for a couple months now and moved the outdoor antenna to have better signal and notice when I moved the power cord on the indoor antenna the device hums and flashes on and off . There’s something wrong with this item. I call Surecall and they tell me I have to pay for it to be shipped to them so they can test the device before I get a replacement. Insane!!! What warranty in the world says they don’t trust that it’s messed up and want to verify it before they replace their faulty equipment !!! I will never recommend this company to anyone ever … ridiculous!!!
5,This product works exactly like it's supposed to!Went from inconsistent one bar of service to consistently three bars of Verizon LTE in my office.I have consistent two bars outside where I mounted my Yagi antenna about 18 feet up on a pole but due to my office being located in a hollow at the bottom of a hill service inside my office was very erratic.SureCall Fusion4Home fixed my problem.Setup was easyno more dropped calls and fast data speeds!  I have been using it about two months now and couldn't be happier!
5,I installed in ten minutes and it took the signal in my house with metal siding from one bar on my iPhone X to full bars.
2,It's easy to put in once download the apps etc on your phone we have the box n satellite thing as far from each other and only have service in one room of the house... I personally wouldn't buy it again or recommend it
5,We bought this for while we live in a shop while building our house. We got 2  sometimes 3 bars outside and NO service (big red circle with line thru it) in the shop bc we have a metal roof. We immediately jump from nothing to 4 to 5 bars. Couldnt be more pleased. We might could have gone with a cheaper model but we didnt want to take any chances.  This one does the trick and we are super pleased.
4,We live on the water and have less cell signal than needed. As others described this won’t increase the tower signal strength but did take us from a weak two bars inside our home to mostly three bars. Worth the effort/price for us!
1,I’ve been trying to get this to work for me for over a month and sadly now I am outside the return window but I still have not been able to consistently get a signal.Install is fine instructions are clear and you just have to find the direction of your cell tower and mount in on an open high point.During sporadic time periods I will see an increased signal but it’s extremely inconsistent. Most hours of the day it’s not enough to even check my email. Without this the signal is measurably “worse” to non existent but the boost is just not enough. I may be in a weirdly bad area I don’t know if my case is exceptional.
4,worked fine got 4 bars from one bar
1,Very frustrating. Very erratic and fluctuating results when the antenna was not even moved. The color codes on the lights are very confusing. In the end it did NOT help the cell signal at all. I returned it and I ended up getting a YAGI attached to a Verizon JetPack hotspot and that got a very reasonable internet signal.
5,Works great getting a signal in!!  I'm in a poor reception area and got nothing after I  had a metal roof installed.  Cell Booster brings that (now amplified) signal right to me!
5,I bought this for my Barndominium in a somewhat rural area.  I had 4G Verizon 2/3 bars outside and none inside the metal "Barndo".  Installed this and now I have 4G 3/4 inside all around my 1800 sq ft structure.  I have used it for text and voice and it solved my problem.  I did buy the directional antenna and I aimed it right at a Verizon tower which worked great.  This product exceeded my expectations.
4,Finally can make consistent calls from inside my house. I don't completely have the system in the final location in which I plan to set it but already the signal quality has increased quite well in my home.
1,We bought to use in our rv for better signal on our land. Unfortunately it did not perform as it should have. We tried several things to make it work properly but it just never worked for us. Was so wanting to love it. Disappointed
5,Great product.  Dont write reviews but very happy with product.  Live in the mts put on a pipe pole on roof (highest point). Getting 4g and 3g in room.  I live in a valley so was surprised.  360 degree antenna ment I didnt have to aim for tower 7 miles away either.  Just get it up as high as ya can and it does the rest.
5,Improved my cell signal by 2 bars. Installation took a little time but if you are handy it was easy. Also got a quick response to a question I had. I'm happy.
5,Included before and after screenshots of the signal strength (top is cell). I went from maybe getting texts to being able to use my phone normally. Inside a metal shed surrounded by trees. I have my office setup in there and it was critical I be able to have my phone functioning. 10/10 would buy again.
5,Works as advertised. I live in the city and my house  don't get the greatest signal inside my house. My whole family misses calls constantly phone number even rings. We're on the AT&T network but this works with all carriers. now that we've got this installed our signal strength is 5 bars in the whole house and don't miss calls any more in our phones respond faster now it also improved data speeds
1,We purchased this device in August and arranged through the company to have it installed as we realized it would have to be done by a professional. When I talked to the installation person we discussed the fact that we were in a 2 story house and he made sure I understood that whatever signal we had outside would be the signal we would have inside. They sent an installer (a really nice person)  that was totally unprepared for the job not even a ladder. The device was new to him and he was having difficulty figuring out how to get the best signal. He studied the directions many times. He had to leave for whatever reason and after a few hours he needed to leave. Our inside devices are on the floor upstairs. Installation is not complete and our phone call hasn’t been returned. Almost a $1000 later including the device and it isn’t doing us any good. To say we’re disappointed is an understatement.
5,Tried another brand first with poor results so I was skeptical when I bought this one. So far it has worked great. I get a good signal outside but it struggles on the data speeds inside through a metal roof and i was tired of hovering around windows. Wirhiut this i get about 500/750 kbs data speed with it I get 5 to 7 mbs. Not quite as good as outside but you can manage.
4,I think bandwidth is my major issue- AT&T is making a mint off data.This boost the signal. It is an expensive solution that gets me by. It is a boost not a miracle
1,Got this item because our neighborhood has poor reception at ground level (but three bars in the roof) - much worse in the house.  Frequently dropped calls poor audio etc.  used to be able to make calls on the second floor but can’t rely on that anymore.  Anyway this system was kind of a pain to install - mainly for running wires but that depends on house construction mostly.  After install I have no noticeable improvement to cell signal - even while standing in front of the antenna! Most channels are always blinking orange (automatically adjusting) but I have no idea if that means it’s connected) I’m going to try an extension to my outdoor antenna but I’m not hopeful - it certainly won’t improve signal for the whole house as I was hoping... MAYBE I’ll be able to get it to work on the main floor.
5,Phone signal was terrible until this purchase. If u live in the country with bad cell service u need this product. Couldn’t be happier with this purchase.
5,Bought a cabin in a rural area lots of trees cell tower 3 miles away & NO Cell Service. A very dear friend of mine told me about SureCall & Yes it works.  I now have cell phone service & Wifi like I'm in the city!!! I have recommended this product to many people in my same situation & they are ecstatic too!  Thanks SureCall Great product.
2,I was meticulous about the installation of this.  It did seem to increase our signal but we did not see any improvement in cell phone reception or call clarity.  We are with Verizon and both have I phone 11 Pros.  Still experiencing dropped calls and calls just cutting out intermittently.  Our solution was to better our internet connection with a better WiFi router and subscribe to a faster internet connection then making calls by internet not cellular.  Best of luck.....
5,This saved my job! I recently moved out into the country and the Verizon signal has never been good inside the house. I followed the instructions to install this antenna and installed the internal antenna in the center of my home. So far its an incredible difference. I needed a strong signal in order to perform duties with my job via the phone and computer. This is a dramatic improvement! I am getting 4G in the house at 3-4 bars when I used to barely get one bar.
5,So far so good. We live in an area where the cell single is a bar or two. This has improved it to 3-4 bars. I can also hot spot internet from my cell phone to my laptop.
4,Works well but I’ve noticed a need to reset it often not sure why
4,I bought this for my 5th wheel travel trailer. After trying every combination with the antenna I was very flustered and unhappy. I bought a Wilson trucker antenna and fastened it to the ladder using only the 14 ft cable I hooked it up and couldn't be happier. Working great
5,Installed this at a remote cabin where the cell service was very marginal. At the yagi position my cell showed about -105db or worse. Installed the yagi on a tv antenna pole with the amplifier about 40 feet away with the rubber antenna. There was not a great increase in bars on the cell but the quality of the calls was much better with no drop out. I called support with some questions and was connected quickly and questions were answered to my satisfaction.
1,I can't believe how much money time effort we spent setting this up - all to have it basically come to nothing. We had this mounted and working in our home for maybe six weeks max. After that the signal cut out and is gone. We can't figure it out. We finally disconnected it after 6 months --- there is no difference in signal in the house. We got this because of aluminum siding - outside there is signal but inside it's a Faraday cage. We had a few short weeks of relief but now our house is still a dead zone.
5,Great product. A little work to install from the roof and through the house  but does it work well! I went from one bar of signal to 3 bars all the time. Great for country folks!
5,I live in desert. There is weak reception’ after I installed this booster  the reception strengthen to 4  Very helpful stuff!
4,We live in a rural setting about 100 yards from tower.  Many times we loose calls etc.  Since putting this up we have a lot better quality and less losses.
5,We have used more expensive units for years at out lake house and main home.  We live way out in the country and service is sketchy at best.  This is the first booster we have used that actually works all over both homes.  We would highly recommend it family and friends.
4,It's expensive but it got us up from 0-1 bar to 1-3 bars depending where we stand. We installed it on the roof of a two story building above the tree line and pointed the antenna at the closest tower. It's worth it.
2,Didn't work.  Risk my neck to install it on the roof though!  Also ugly white cable goes great with Nothing!  chavez the support rep copy/pasted a sentence for me though.
3,Our house is 3500 ft2 and only works in the central room.  Doesn't seem to go thru walls inside the house to the bedrooms.  But  at least we get reception now.
3,Not quite a miracle but it works. Went from -110dB to a respectable -90dB. Mast mount antenna outside with the transceiver in a closet. Very easy to set up and adjust. Too new to comment on quality. Seems to be well built. Heavy transceiver body and decent connectors. Expense is the only complaint and limits it to three stars.
5,So i just moved to up state NY and had almost zero service at my house. The best was a -103 dbm at 5 asu or refeshes per sec. Almost unusable. After set up im at -86 dbm and 54 asu! So i went from not being able to get calls to streaming movies while 3 people are on their phones.Total night and day difference but you have to have some service to start with.
1,Nothing but trouble with this product. I have to turn off and on to get it to work at all and then in a matter of minutes I have to reboot it again. Contacted Sure Call customer service tech support and basically they said it was my poor installation and not the product. I guess the two years of electronics I took didn’t qualify me for this installation. I guess that’s why they suggested I contact one of their installers to set it up for a small fee of course. Nope I can’t recommend this product.
5,I live about 35 miles from a metro area in a home with a metal roof.  I could only get 1 bar consistently and it was making it really difficult to manage business calls.  The SureCall solved all my problems.  can't recommend another product more highly!
2,This thing is terrible. 3 bars outside tested via network signal info so we placed the outside antenna there. Inside we have 1-2 bars normal. They only way we can get 3 is directly within line of sight of the indoor antenna and within 10' from it. Make no mistake as well the indoor and outdoor antenna HAVE to be at least 35' from each other or it will not work at all. Return window is closed so we are stuck with it... IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN BUYING MINE I'LL SELL IT CHEAPER THAN A NEW ONE... EMAIL ME AT kny42706@yahoo.com.....Maybe you will have better luck.
4,Works well but I do wish the range was a bit more like what was advertised does not work well past about 50-75 feet. But much better that without it for indoor cell reception.
5,I ordered this used from amazon warehouse deals it didn't come with an ac adapter or outside antenna. Amazon refunded me the amount to order an external antenna and surecall sent me an adapter for free. It now works very well I have 5 bars where I use to have none. The install is easy just mount external antenna and plug it into the unit. 5 stars good customer service from amazon and surecall.
1,Gave more bars but less signal. I went from having higher speeds with less bars to more bars with slower speeds. Putting the antenna on the roof for a better signal but no improvements.
4,SureCall works well.  However it is limited by the incoming signal at the outdoor antenna and potential attachment sites on the building.  Installation was fairly easy.  For areas with weak signals it should solve most customers.
5,Gave me 1-2 extra bars and the speed was incredible. I went from 1-2 MBPS to 25+ MBPS D/L and 2-3 MBPS U/L. Worth every penny! I have Verizon and Live in the mountains a few miles away from the nearest tower.
5,This thing works!  We live where we cannot get any internet except dish and our cell signal was one bar at best.  We couldn't keep a call going and it was frustrating!  Now it's easily 3-4 bars in the house and never a dropped call.  Our data speed is excellent as well.  We mounted the antenna portion on the side of our chimney and have the base sitting in the living room.  Highly recommend for those with cell signal issues.
5,I live in a fairly remote cabin in Alaska. I had to drive down the road to get consistent cel service. Usually 0-1 bars in my house. I can now stream video and never drop a call from anywhere inside the house. This surecall flare booster works great!
5,No more dropped calls I got two one for house and one for shop. Didn't install it as good as the instructions but they still work. "UPDATE" Just a few hours after review the house one went dead no lights no signal. Will be returning that one."UPDATE" carried the booster out to the shop and plugged it into that power supply cord and it works. Contacted SureCall new power supply cord on way.
5,Just hooked it up yesterday.  It seems to be working as advertised.  We have foil backed boxing on our house in the country.  I can now use my cell phone in any room of the house.
2,I bought this figured out which direction is my cell tower took help from neighbor to drill holes in my house’s outside wall to install the outdoor antenna drilled another hole to get the wire inside to hook up the indoor antenna it worked for 5 mins then went back to 1 bar and dropped calls.This is such a waste of money. Take my advise rather try wifi calling.
5,I live in the mountains and have tried numerous devices to boost cell phone coverage and it's always hit or miss (mostly miss). I decided to give it one more try with this device and I am glad that I did. I tried before I hired someone to install it professionally and I am extremely pleased with the coverage. Yes some areas are stronger than others but I have coverage!.
5,Very pleased highly recommended. I have a Sprint phone tried weBoost claimed to work on Sprint 4G LTE no not really. This one does! My main signal in on band 26 850 Mhz. Boosted 4G LTE from 200-300kb/s to 2-3 Mb/s (10x). Tested it with my home security camera system. Before it was glitchy many frames freezing or skipping many seconds. Now very smooth can watch the clock (from the server) count the seconds with no pauses. A little pricey but it appears to be well worth it.
5,Very easy to install. We moved into a metal building and had absolutely no service. After installing we are able to get calls texts and data inside!
1,If you just need to place a phone call yeah sure. Don’t bother with data the speeds you already get standing outside with your phone were the same speeds I got with the booster... though it would say 3-5 bars lte. Both towers are less than 10 miles away opposite directions. Thank the lord I didn’t run this crap through my attic and set it up to have to rip it all out. Test it out like I did first put that crap on a pole and vice grip it to a ladder. If you wanna pay 500 bucks to place a call then go ahead but to be honest I got a 60 dollar cell booster from eBay which does just as good. Some ppl have great luck not sure how! I even tried fiddling with the gain on the db and positioned the ladder every way but in the pool. No luck.
5,Went from 0 bars to three.  I live in a mountainous area and tower is 8 miles away.  Pretty easy to install.
5,I was always dropping calls and could not send texts. If the signal at my house gets too low I just stand next to the booster and they go right through.  Sometimes takes it from a 1 bar to full signal on a clear day.
5,Easy to install and we instantly saw our cell service boost from 0 bars to 3 bars. This was a relief as the purchase was costly.
5,The kit was easy to install.I live in a remote area and my phone went from zero bars to 2-3 bars in an area that had no signal bars.Improved downloads and streaming (4G LTE):My download speeds have improved.Video streaming is faster now with the Flare boosting my 4G signal.Covers multiple carriers and users:It worked for my Verizon plan as well as my friends AT&T plan.Everyone in my family now has usable signal inside my home.
3,This product is ok better than the worthless unit I first bought. Still only getting 2 bars but it works.
5,Definitely what we needed for a signal boost. Works great in two rooms but it does not reach out to 2500 sq ft in my house. I would buy it again though.
2,Installed this with lots of separation green light on the indoor unit and it works... sort of when I walk away from the indoor unit signal drops really fast support says "it is what it is" could not in good conscience recommend this
4,It was difficult getting the unit and the antenna far enough away from one another to prevent osculation.
2,I haven't had any luck with several different brands of boosters.  This on is no different.Antenna has to be mounted VERY far away from booster.  Living in a 2600 square foot house I have the antenna on one side outside and the booster on the other side of the house and often times the booster still shows "interference" light where it needs to be further away from the antenna.  I also have to restart (plug and unplug ) almost daily.
5,I purchased a different company’s unit first and could not get it to work even after multiple adjustments.  This unit worked first time with no problems.  Feels like a better build also.
1,No fault with Amazon their customer service was fantastic but I contacted SureCall because the unit failed to power up. Their product tech was very short in his answers and pretty much uncaring told me to test the power supply with a volt meter and get back to him by their sites e-mail. The power supply tested out fine. If you must return this item to SureCall the cost is on you with very specific shipping instructions down to the thickness of the bubble wrap. It may be a great system but I will never know. When you have balance issues due to a disability and have teetered on a step ladder installing a $350+ item for a couple hours it is not worth dealing with them. Uncertain that they would honor their warranty I returned the purchase.  Amazon sent me a packaging label and was more than helpful in the return process.
4,Works great for T-mobile and ATT.  Did not work for Verizon or Sprint...phones seemed to prefer the tower instead.  5 stars if it would work with all carriers.
4,Product works well but the transmitter and antenna need to be separated pretty far to prevent the transmitter flashing errors due to oscillation.
5,The numbers don't lie. I went from two bars and 19.3 Mbps down/0.89 Mbps up to three bars and 35.5 Mbps down/3.89 up. Antenna placement is CRITICALLY important. Later as a cosmetic improvement and for additional height I moved the outside antenna to the other side of the house (40' difference) and the performance was WORSE than without the antenna. I quickly moved it back.
2,In trying multiple locations and tower 7 miles away mounted on 20' high pole downloading tower finders calling tech support I was unable to achieve a signal that allows adequate connectivity in a remote area. Sadly I have to return this unit.Note** if you have a good cell signal this booster boosted. If you have 1 bar you can make calls but virtually no data. I tried to use hotspot for computer and would not improve signal enough to use.
5,Worked as described.. Worked to boost my cell signal in my home were I had little to no coverage
5,I live in a rural area with poor cell service. My home has a metal roof (also bad for cell service). Basically no booster no inside service with the booster and the antenna mounted 20’ above my rooftop pointed towards the nearest cell tower we get 3 bars LTE inside the house. Additional items needed are mounting bracket(s) and what ever lengths of pole for your particular installation.
4,It works perfectly for what I ordered it for from no service inside my camp to LTE and 4 bars
4,Does increase signal as advertised but does require researching use and cellular tower locations as well as other factors to get best results.
5,I went from sometime no signal to full bars even in basement. I am well satisfied. Now to see how long it lasts...
5,My rural area fringe reception went from 2 bars 3g to 5 bars 4G LTE.  Latency (ping) went from 200-300 to 60-70.  Expensive but worth every penny.  Very solid heavy metal construction.  All parts included except a pole to mount the antenna to but they are available on amazon and usually offered as a package when you make your Amazon purchase.
4,Invoice said NEW it was not.Missing stuff. Made it work.
5,Installed in a small metal house (barndemenium) where we did not have service inside.  Ran antenna through wall next to cable and across to fence in back of house where we had good reception (3-4 bars).  Now get great service (3-4 bars) inside!This was very easy to install.  The only difficult part was routing the cable through the wall.
5,In a Mobile home with no signal or data before except at a window on occasionI now have 5 bars on signal strength and 4G LTE data with AT&T.
5,All I can say is this product solved my issues of no signal inside. I actually have a better signal inside now them you do outside of house . Read directions and you will get it setup. Customer support is awesome . This is something I put of for years maybe not this specific product. But after having it I wished I would had but the bullet and spent that money years ago. Excellent .
5,Installed at our off grid cabin where we almost never had data and phone signal would only work in one part of the cabin. After installing this we get good signal for both throughout the whole cabin which is over 1700 square feet.
5,Mounted on a 10' conduit pole off of my chimney. I live in a valley and the nearest cell tower is 6 miles away leaving me with only 1 bar of 3G inside the house and 1-2 bars outside the house (sometimes LTE mostly 3G). Immediately upon firing this up I had 4-5 bars LTE and 20mbps download speeds. I maintain minimum 2 bars of LTE throughout my 2000 square ft house now!
2,Cell boost distance is a matter of several feet.  Then you lose bars.  Also the device is subject to oscillation and moving the device 45-feet away from the antenna does not solve the problem.
5,I built a barn with living quarters using R panels and 4" foam insulation. I had 4G signal outside but absolutely zero signal inside. Outside antenna is temporarily mounted inside the loafing area of the barn & it works great! Easy to install
1,Easy to install at first it worked great with full bars LTE then after a few days it started dropping calls and only works half the time not at all impressed for the money I spent. My old 3g booster from Wilson never dropped a call and had good net. Tried to call tech support but never got anyone.Update : past my window of returning so I’m stuck with an expensive piece of junk!! How can u have full bars lte and no service ??? Wouldn’t waste my money on this!
2,Continual oscillation between the interior and exterior antennas even when spread the entire length of the included cable apart. Continually flashing lights indicated the device was perpetually trying to adjust the signal to eliminate interference. When connected the signal always read -121 dB. Perhaps having omnidirectional antennas both inside and outside was the issue? Construction of both antennae appeared solid neither felt flimsy.
5,Amazing! We are rural barely had signal now we have 4G/3 bars (which is all we care to have)!Love the table top design! Worth every penny!
5,We have a camp that did not have any signal at all inside.  To make a call or text we had to go outside down the drive.  With this we now have 3 bars through out the camp  (1500 sq feet) and we can easily make and receive calls from inside.  I would really recommend this.  Our signal strength outside was not overly powerful and it still works.  Great product!!
5,I got this for my house that has poor service on cell phone.i installed it to the highest point on my house I could access.works great I can load everything now and even use a hotspot for movies. Before I had very poor service couldn't even make a call unless I would walk around outside.
5,Excellent quality. I get -118 dBm on Verizon LTE without it and after I installed it I get around -85 dBm!It was VERY easy to install. Finding the best signal in your home area is the most challenging part. Finding the tower is the next complicated part. Other than that you power it up and place your internal antenna.I would recommend to anyone that needs their cell signal boosted.
5,I have been having problems with my hotspot only getting 2 bars about 2 mins after plugging it in i had 5 bars.THIS IS A GAME CHANGER!
5,Honestly I was skeptical but after tons of research and living with no signal for the last 2 years in our home I decided to give it a shot! I can say this was money well spent! Our signal is 100x better and the install was super easy!
4,Was hoping for more of an improvement but it did work to eliminate dropped calls by getting us up to 1 bar from 0-1 bar.
5,I was pleasantly surprised how well this works it is worth every penny thank you so much for having such a great product
2,Unfortunatlly this product diddnt work for me .teck support was excellent and even sent be an updated directional antenna to try but it came to late to returne the item so I am still without barely any signal It will require a professional to come out and find the best signal location ang get it much higher than the 50 feet af cable provided and thicker less resistant coax to possibly get it to get a signal .
5,Easily mounted on the same pole as my TV antenna. Ran with separate line to the ground block and tied into existing RG6 in the house.  Went from no signal at all inside the house to full signal.
5,If you need a cell booster this does a good job.
5,This product works great in our 5th wheel. We went from no signal/1 bar to 4 bars on our att phones and Verizon jetpack. So far we love it.
5,Great signal booster works great
5,Used for Google Fi. simpke plug and play install. Calling for support simple and always a friendly tech to answer questions. Registration info for FCC was simplevia one link. Mounted on roof to enhance weak signal and dropped calls. Did the job no more phone signal issues with Google Fi
5,I picked up the SureCall Flare Omni. I had no bars in my basement and could never received calls. Txt messages would sometimes come through. I put the Omni cylinder antenna outside on a fence from my basement. Where I usually only even get 1 bar outside. I now get full signal in my basement calls and txt and data come through clear as day now. best investment ever!
5,The area coverage is far less then I had hoped for. If I could do it again I would double or even triple the area of stated coverage. 2400 square foot coverage barely covers two large rooms on one floor.
5,Very easy to install works great I'm just doing
5,Watched YouTube videos for install... very easy to get set up—-I guess due to no outside interference —1 flat antenna covers the entire house and seems to have improved signal down at barn which is over 100 yards away— I don’t know why it has improved the signal so far but it works like advertised
5,While we purchased this unit a few months back we finally just installed it yesterday. It was very easy to install overall and we were lucky to not have to do any adjustments with the antenna. We simply plugged everything in turned the booster on and we had service throughout our house and shop
5,My cellphone rarely had service before adding surecall. Now I have full service.
5,Product arrived on time. Product works great and does exactly what it’s supposed to do. I now can call and talk inside my home plus have a clear conversation. Great product!!
2,Got one bar increase out of this. Not worth the money.
5,Great product not sure if all boosters work as well but this one is nice.  It is really well built and went from zero bars in house to 3-4.
3,Product was not too bad to install.  After a few months I had an issue but the company's customer service was outstanding.  It did improve my cell service however data was still pretty slow.
5,Easy installation and works great!
2,The boost does boost signal However to get full signal your phone must be within inches from antenna. I reluctantly purchased an indoor antenna that promised to boost signal hoping to be able to get a signal to 1 whole room Nope I don't get much better that with whip. SureCall Fusion4Home Yagi/Whip does work but only out to about 15 feet for LTE only inches.
5,Easy to install.Went from 1 bar of cell service in my house to 4 bars in my concert basement.I recommend installing a GPS pointer app on your phone makes point the antenna perfect.
5,Took me 10 min to route the wire and attach my attena to the out side of our pole shed gives me full bars inside works with every cell carrier so far that's come into the building.
1,At best I experienced a 1-3 dB signal strength increase.  Did not matter which direction I pointed the yagi antenna. Knew precise location of my local cell tower by using Network Cell Info app on Android. The app showed minimal signal strength increase no matter where I placed the indoor unit and outdoor antenna.
1,This lists coverage as 2500 sqft but it will only cover that if you have complete line of sight to the unit.Coverage significantly declines with just 1 wall. I am contemplating returning the unit.EDIT:I wish I had returned this unit it is absolutely terrible. I have to constantly power cycle it and even then it mostly doesn't work. It really doesn't work through a single wall just feet away. Absolute garabge.
4,We had 1 bar or no connection after installing sure call I get 3 bars and 4g. Some break up when talking but not bad
5,We moved high into the mountains in a rural community where the only internet I have is using my cell as a hotspot. My business depends on fast dependable internet. My husband set this up in under an hour and we are now streaming Netflix no longer have dropped calls and even have a usable internet signal downstairs where we did not before installing this. I am thrilled!
5,Living in a metal pole barn we were never able to get a signal in the house.  Attached the booster to wood and magneted it to the side od the house  (not roof) and we instantly have 3+ bars throughout the 3300 sq ft home!!!
5,We are in a dead zone in our neighborhood for cell coverage and even though switching to Verizon helped we still had very low signal strength. We now can take calls in our house and we aren't dropping calls anymore. It's also increased download times on our phones/devices. It also wasn't too hard to install which is a problem we've had with other products like this.
1,The indoor antenna is the worst of any of this type of product. I only see an increase in signal strength if I am within 1 foot. Any farther away and it’s no better than if it’s turned off. Status lights are terrible. I get the same indications from the lights if there is an external antenna plugged  in or not. My antenna is 60 feet away an yet I often get oscillation errors. I verified antenna operation and I also have a second antenna located on a different lot and it operates the same. There is also no ability to attach a different internal antenna that might improve its indoor performance. I would not recommend this product.
1,After reading many of the reviews I purchased this unit. My house is equal distance between 2 towers. You'd think one would pick up. Omni directional antenna and all. No such luck. Finally gave up with getting a reception boost for my Sprint which is 1 to 2 bars as I needed reliable connections for my mobile hot spot the only internet that was available without going to outside provider. ATT had no lines available in the development (in the country) Sprint reception not strong enough to make the phone a reliable hot spot. Online Educator I finally broke down and had to order Hughes Net satellite. This unit might be good for some locations but it definitely is no good for others including my own. Anyone want to buy a spare?
5,We had abysmal cell reception in our thick walled hundred-year-old plus house. Now with the help of this ingenious Signal boosterwe have fabulous reception in every room even the closets!
1,Installed by the instructions but unit failed to sync or boost signal.  Paid particular attention to suggested distance between the antenna and base unit and met those requirements.  Unit still did not work.  I returned it for a refund.
1,Moved antenna around up high and low…….didn’t help.
5,We have a cabin in a so called dead zone. Worked great with our hot spot and cell phones.
2,Great concept just doesn't seem to boost signal as advertised. Contacted tech support via email.  Responded quickly just didn't really provide support.  Based on signal with the uninactive vs. unit active I really cannot see much difference.
1,I returned this product and it has been 2 weeks and not received a refund.  It did not work because the cell service is spotty.
1,I am not a novice at installing cellular antenna and booster.  Just installed (2) Wilson Long Rangers at the same property for AT&T cellular broadband and the results were great.  Using my SureCall signal tester I fine-tuned the direction of this Yagi for the best signal.  Connected to the booster and the inside signal is actually worse than the signal on the tester outside.  I do not recommend this package.
1,works great but outside antenna booster needs to be more that 25' (the distance recommended by manufacturer)apart from inside booster.  At 25' apart the booster was overloaded and warning lights came on.  I had to move them 35 ' apart for it to work.  This meant the supplied coax cable was too short and I had to buy an additional cable.  The inside unit keeps bring up an error message and I have to unplug it to reset.  Calls get dropped often. Buy the more expensive weboost system - and save yourself the expense of of having to replace this unit.
5,Bought this device for my mother. She lives in a rural area. Closest cell tower is 15 miles away. Went from no bars in the house to 2 bars of 4G LTE. Now my mother can FaceTime with her grandkids with ease.
5,I did a lot of research and you have to spend some bigger money to get results with these things.. I live in a florida swamp and needed signal. I put the antenna on the side of  a power line pole 20 ft up and instantly had signal! It works when others come to visit with different cellular providers. I have sprint.Love it!
5,Great product simple to install and set up.I have suggested this to at least 4 people that are having weak signal strength.
1,The installation was simple enough however there was absolutely no signal boost.  The product did not enhance any of our cell phone signals which included one phone using AT&T one from T-Mobile and one from Boost.Disappointing :(
5,Bought this for my 89 year old Dad. He had no signal in his house. He now has 4 bars. He’s a happy camper.  ATT could improve their tower at Cisco Texas. But for now all is okie dokey.
1,With out a booster here we get 1-2 bars. Followed installation instruction to a tee. Instructions said left yellow light transmitter was too close to antenna it was 48 feet and it came with 50 foot coax. Antenna was put on a 25 foot antenna with additional coax. never worked.
4,This product does work wonderfully but the status lights on the box can be confusing. We use this for AT&T and Sprint in a pretty remote location.
5,My cell phone didn't work well where I live. The trees are a problem by my home. I bought this hoping it would work it does! I'm very happy with this booster.
5,Work brings signal in from out side
1,Took minor effort to install  But this unit DOES NOT WORK no increase in reception! Major disappointment
5,Our new home had a very weak cell signal maybe one bar but usually no service and this got us to 2-3 bars in most of the house. Exceeded my expectations and it was a quick/easy installation.
5,Great product! As per other users we used to have bad or virtually no service at our home. Installed the cell booster now the wife is happy and can talk all she wants with no issues. Yes it is a bit expensive but we are quite happy with the performance of the product!
5,delivers 3-4 bars reception in a house that had zero!  I installed outdoor antenna in a nearby tree..facing verizon tower 3 miles away. our house has double barrier roof insulation..this device is a requirement if you want to talk on cell indoors.
5,Can finally talk on the phone anywhere in my home.
5,Awesome and so easy to install we live a mountainous area with lots of trees in the winter and early spring we have to literally hang out our window to get service now I can get it anywhere in the house except for an interior room.  Love it and recommend highly
5,Placed it on the roof of a small cabin in the country. Went from zero reception inside to four bars. It does work if you follow the instructions. So far I'm very pleased with the product.
1,Never could get this product setup. No matter what I did there was always an error saying that the antenna was too close to the base even though the cable that it came with was fully extended. Customer service is non-existent as all they do is read back to you the manual that came in the box and when that doesn't work they tell you someone else will call you back and they never do! By the time I realized I wasn't going to get any help the return window had closed... Don't waste your money!
2,Tried to install and configure but it was always showing too much power and oscillation with the surrounding frequencies and it become non-usable. Even worked with their tech support with no luck... Might work for others but it was a total waste of time for me...
4,Our office is in the boonies so we need this and it really works!
5,Works great.  We have cell and data in the house again. Put a metalRoof on and killed the cell service. Found the best signal outside put the antenna there and it works great.should have
5,Had one or two bars with constant call drops depending on where we were in the house.  Now we have a solid 2-3 bars at worst with 4-5 in most of the central part of the house.  No more drops or breaking up.  The hardest part was getting the yagi aimed and even that wasn't too bad.
5,I spent a long time Deciding which cell booster to buy. I’m so glad about this one! I went from having zero service in my basement to having full service. I’m so happy with my purchase.
4,Allows me to use my mobile hot spot at home with a consistent service.
5,This really worked! I tried everything to get better reception. Super happy with my purchase!
5,Installed in a metal building where my version signal was "1 to no service". I could go outside and I would get 2 bars. After installing the booster 4 bars in the metal building. EXCELLENT PRODUCT
5,It works great.  Such a novelty to have a signal inside my house.  We live on the outskirts of town and cell service was awful.  In places where there was absolutely no signal now has one to two bars.  Wonderful product.
5,It boosted my signal beautifully. Went from not being able to make calls to making and receiving calls like crazy. And it improved my data signal as well..
1,I live in a slightly remote area...(cell signal available quarter mile away) and the product did not pick up signal
3,it works ok  wish it could boost signal more but i have a a office in metal building so that is probably the problem
5,I live in the middle of nowhere. Cell signals come and go. I can't believe I get constant service! I can even watch TV without buffering.
5,Worth every penny was very hesitant to buy but I’m glad i did
5,Raised cell phone from 1 bar to 3 bars.
5,I couldn't have asked for better results out of a cell booster. Easy to install easy to use and boost Verizon 4G signal like no other.
1,Please don’t waste your money on this item. It never worked. We ended tossing it to the trash. T-Mobile provided us with a signal booster for free. I don’t like to write a negative review but this device deserved one :(
5,Raised signal in office from 1-2 bars to 3-4 bars with 4 most the time. Antenna placement tricky.
1,Installed per instructions. signal strength went for 1 to 2 bars to 3to 4 bars (-114db to -87 db) but internet  speed went from 12mbs to 7mbs. I am using getpack on ch. 4 which should work sure call said. Called tech support and they told me to turn lte-a and lte-v gain all way down. Did not help so they told me must be something to do to verizon tower. they said I could try to return to seller.How can I return to sellernce I installed it. Next stop is trash can.
4,Works as advertised does not cover much of the housegood for 400 sq. Ft.
1,Had high hopes but this thing gave no boost at all.Followed the installation instructions mechanically no problem very straight forward.The bit about an iPhone showing db meter instead of bars is no longer accurate since IOS 11 so that's no help. Pointed the Yagi toward the nearest tower using a compass nothing.. Rotated very slowly through 360 degrees nothing.Took it down boxed it back up sending it back.
5,I bought this for my business that is in a metal building.  With SureCall I am able to have full service throughout a 2500 ft building.Super easy to install and product does everything stayed in a the description.
4,Does help. Maybe not as much as I want it too but with the cost.
5,This product is working great it has been installed for about 21/2 months now and so far so good. The instructions were very easy to understand and set up took less than an hour to complete. This product does exactly what it is suppose to do.
4,It works as well as they said it would and I was very pleased.
2,It's easy to install but it made no difference for our cell signal. My husband has one of these at his work and it works well there but the one we installed at our house isn't helping anything. We will be returning it.
4,Works terrific as long as we don't bump the power cord other than that would have given it a 5.
5,This made a huge difference at our farm house.  Properly aimed at the tower (about 6 miles away) I was able to take the house from "No Service" inside to about 4 bars of LTE voice and reliable data service on AT&T.  (Specifically -94 to -98 dBm).
4,Works great for me!  Went from no signal when inside to 2-3.
1,I have great reception on the rooftop which is where I installed the booster. My phone now shows it has good bars and dB signal strength inside but I cannot hold a phone call. I called customer support every day for two weeks and they always said a technician will be calling me back. I never did get a call back. I bought a second unit identical to the first thinking the first one may have been defective but the new ones performance was the same as the first.
5,Pointed it to verizon tower was 3.5 miles away. Huge trees in lake cabin close to Canada. Used to get only 3G verizon inside house now streaming 4G netflix. Very happy. Please have as much separation between antennas as possible have the Yagi  mounted high on house and panel at person height level. Glad it worked.
5,Installed this in our 3500 sq foot home where we had 1 bar service before.  We now have reliable 3 bars and can make/receive calls.  Data is also usable.
5,I did not get good  cell signal in my home. I purchased this product and now I get awesome cell signal. It works just as described. Would recommend this product to all my family and friends who have spotty cell signal. It really works
1,this unit failed 2 weeks after I received it.  It did work boosting a -110 db signal to about -90 db but went dead 2 weeks later.  power supply still providing 5v but no lights and no boost from base unit.
5,Went from 1 bar/no service/dropped calls to 4 bars LTE inside our metal shop/office building.  1/2 hour set up.  Bolted antenna to eave of roof ran cable through wall to indoor antenna about 30' away plugged it in and done.
5,Excellent! Took my service from 1 bar to 4. I located it near the middle of my home and I get coverage throughout the entire home (1800 sq')I am so impressed I ordered another one for our other house.
5,I have metal walls and metal roof on my home surecall allows me to have full bars in my home. Without Surecall I don’t have one bar. Worth the money.
5,Simply amazing. Had zero service inside or outside my house. I even had nothing on my roof.We put the outdoor antenna on a pole about 30' up and we now have full bars Lte.Easy to set up even with the directional antenna.
5,I was skeptical at first being that I get zero service inside of my house.  I live in a rural area and only get about 1 bar 3g at the end of my drive way or in one of my upstairs rooms. Now I get 2 bars 4g inside.
1,This is single stream single band only. It actually made my cell service worse. This is designed for people that have absolutely no service. The bars on my phone went up but my internet severely suffered. I do not recommend for normal use. Only for absolute last resort.
5,This product works great!  I was working in an metal-encased office at a work site and got 0 bars inside.  I hooked this up and now I have full service inside the office space.  A life saver!
4,Quick delivery. Quick install. Quick configuration.
3,For the price I thought it would have more power. It works most of the time.
5,These was a great investment. We move out to the country and had NO SIGNAL at all. We put this outside on top of the house and now we have 3 bars.... I couldn't believe how good this work. Highly recommend!
5,Works really well indoors I saw a huge difference. Originally I had 2 bars outside and hardly any data and once indoors there was no service. With the SureCall I had almost all my bars 4G service with AT&T and data speeds around 10 MB/s.
5,My dad loves this he ditched his internet provider and went full time unlimited on our company cell line.
1,We live in a rural area.  Service is poor 1 bar with Verizon phone service.  This unit did not improve our service at all.  It was a waste of money.
1,Climbed up on the house and screwed this up into a tree.  I had high hopes it would work for us but unfortunately there was no noticeable difference in our cell coverage.  We have tried 2 other devices and those didn't work either.  Tech support tried to help us but still didn't work.  I returned for a full refund.
3,I think it probably needs professional calibration.
5,My boss would have to go to the other side of the building to use his cell phone.  Now he gets clear reception in his office.  No drops no clipping.
3,Did not help with with connection.
5,Work really well. Would recommend it to anyone
2,The product arrived to me damaged and now I must wait for another unit.  The Connectors were smashed and it should not have ever been sent to me like this.  I have another unit and have been happy with it however.
5,My phone went from 1 bar to 4 bars at Graham Wa.
5,It makes the investment in a cell phone worth while. Everywhere in my home now has a great signal rather than just poor or no signal before SureCall installation.Only problem was a completely loose antenna connector (photo) which was replaced fairly quickly...
5,DEER HUNTING CAMP HUBBARD LAKE MICHIGAN HAD NO SIGNAL.  A DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN YOU NEEDED TO CALL IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. VERIZON SERVICE. UPDATE SOON FOR OTHER PROVIDERSNOT ANY LONGER !
5,Changed everything wow I’m glad I bought this and so is my wife it works great two thumbs up
5,I have ATT and would only get 1 bar at my home. I installed this Unit and now get 5 bars in some areas of my home and a minimum of 3 bars..
5,I did not have a signal inside my house very little signal outside now I can use my cell phone In my house and can use it within range of my inside antenna on the outside of my home
5,This thing actually works... I mean it works great.Boosts the signal in my warehouse by an additional 30-60%.I suffered for years with poor cell phone reception.Why didn't I buy this sooner?
5,Works great. I needed better 4g in my house and it works great now. If you have a good signal outside it makes it that good inside. It's limited to how many walls it will go through but still a vast improvement.
5,Works pretty dang good here in southern Colorado. Worked the first try and setup was a breeze. Just follow instructions and you're good.Boosts my Verizon 4G LTE band and my son's Sprint and AT&T signals just fine.
5,Love it. Couldn’t receive or make any calls from my cell. Now it works great!!
1,Over all easy to set up. But call about the trouble light indicating the antenna and the booster were to close.  I tried two different ways to set it up but at least every other day I had to reset it.  Even then kept dropping calls. Not worth the money. If you do get one go with the largest you can afford. Otherwise wasting your time and money.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY- DOES NOT WORK. The product was difficult to install did not end up working total head ache to try and install. For people working form home it was a waste of money and then I am looking for an option to return the item and get my money back but see no option to do so. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5,Made a world of difference.  No more dropped calls no more waiting forever for data to go through.  Everything necessary for installation was included in the package.  Unheard of but so appreciated!  Certainly worth the money.
5,Product did not work at our location. Very quick to return and refund.
5,I was a skeptical to buy. After getting it I am a believer now.  It was easy to hook up very ear directions. It worked very well!
5,Had one bar of signal in my shed and calls were dropping consistently.  Put the yagi in the attic pointed at my cell tower and the panel on the wall below.  Went to 4 or 5 bars.  Love it.
1,Before buying I contacted SURECALL for their advice. After following instructions and installation -- the product DID NOT function as expected.  I called SURECALL and the tech passed me up to another tech.  He said I had the wrong product.  I returned it and did not reorder their product.
5,Signal was very weak in the house making it frustrating to search the internet with my phone or iPad. Installation was straightforward and it seems to work very well. Internet is now easy and voice is much better
1,T-Mobile is teh worst. Installed to help with signal in my home and did NOT help one bit. If i had not thrown teh box away i would have returned. Had one liek this for Verizon and it work great. If you thinking about T-Mobile run worst coverage ever.
1,Kept receiving an “error mode”. This was purchased for our camp in the middle of the woods that has horrible service and hoped this would solve a lot of issues but it did not. Will be returning.
5,works great only bad this is the antenna that come with it sucks your going to have so spend some extra money on a ceiling or wall mount antenna and CM400 cable for about $60+ more. I have AT&T gives me 3 bars and 4g
1,Bought this after reading the reviews.  Thought I give it a shot to help with my mom's new place.  She has almost zero bars with att in her new place due to the installation of radiant barrier for home energy efficiencyDoesn't help at all with her iPhone or my android phoneReturning prompltly
1,I followed the instructions - determined the prime location for access to best signal set it up properly provided good spacing between the external and internal antenna made sure all the settings were optimal and...nothing. No discernable difference between signal strength prior to and after setting up and activating the system.This was an attempt to improve a Verizon signal.
1,Absolute garbage! Will not keep signal! Never stays in green. This was a joke. I was past the “return”window and payed a tech way to much to install it to throw it in the trash can. But it does nothing at all.
5,I use a cellular modem for my internet. The two bottom speed tests were without the booster and the top five had the booster on. :)
3,Works okay. Brought bars up from 1 to 2 -3. Not as good as was reported or as I had hoped.
1,Tried mounting in several locations and followed all of the instructions but it just doesn't work.  If I go outside I get a strong cell signal on my phone but in the house its very weak.  I thought this SureCall booster would solve the problem but it had zero effect.  I missed the return window or I would have sent it back to Amazon.  Total waste of $270 - don't make the same mistake!!
5,Highly recommended product. I went from having 1 bar to 4-5 bars continuous. Install difficulty level  1 to 10 I give it a 5.
1,I have owned it for a while now.  Installed everything according to directions paying attention to distance from antenna to unit.  I have to constantly turn the unit off and on to get it to reacquire the cell signal.  Have to stand right next to the internal antenna to get enough bars to use the phone.  Not what you expect from a $400 dollar plus purchase.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,If you want to install one hire a guy to do it but make sure he will warrant the installation. Else don't do it. I installed two and I am an electrical engineer and none did a thing.Still have not found an installer willing to take it back if the system does not work. Good luck with it
1,Started out good but definitely not the 2400 sq inch coverage more like 150 . Some days it doesn't work at all others it is acceptable glad I got it on sale and didn't pay full priceUpdate its getting worse dont waste your money high priced pos worked good for 3 weeks now doesn't do anything for cell reception makes  no sense
3,didn't work for us but not the companies fault...we had no signal. I was hoping for a miracle.
5,Great overall product and very easy to install. Works with At&t Verizon and sprint.
1,I set it up correctly but I barely improved my signal.
2,Meh. Didn’t really give me much better reception.
5,I've been a long time Weboost/Wilson user and always wanted an alternative just because I wasn't always happy with the performance of Weboost at times. This Surecall  system works better than Weboost and I will buy Surecall from now on.
1,Bought mine in December of 2017. Has stopped working already. Worked OK for just a short time. Now it has either red lights or no lights at all depending on how high I set the little knobs for signal. Unless mine is a one off I would be careful on this one. Maybe look around for another one of some kind. Will update on how well they service after just 6 months.
5,Purchased to improve signal in a metal building. I now get lte signal and can make voice calls. Aiming the antenna is tricky.
5,Great product.  Went from 0-1 bar to 3-4 bars of signa in entire 2300 square foot house.
5,Great product works great!
5,We have a signal in our house in the areas that we didn’t before. I love this thing.
1,Cost a lot got two bar's didn't have any before
5,Just installed it easy as pie Works great had no service in house only 1-2 bars outside in spots just wat I needed
5,I could not get a signal outdoors better than -120 put this on a temp 24 foot ext ladder and get an average -88dbm indoors.  Interior transmitter could be stronger.
1,I have a metal roof which makes cell reception difficult to impossible within the house. This product is advertised as a remedy but it hasn't worked at all. I installed the antenna at the apex of my roof and ran the provided cable to the booster unit with little to no improvement of cell signal within my house. Outside cell signal is fine.
1,Worked for a week & then nothing. Even had a service tech come out & he couldn’t get it to work. Got a second one & the same thing happened.
1,This product does not work.  It has not helped any of my cell phones. I read all the reviews and expected it to help. Not this one. Very disappointed.
5,Great product! Cheaper than weboost and works better! This model is good for small homes only. My signal went from 1 bar of LTE to 4/4 bars.
5,Great product.
1,So far it's only good when I have my phone right next to the inside antenna. As soon as I walk away I go from 4 bars down to 1 and from 4g down to 3g or even 1x depending on which phone it is.  It's supposed to cover 3000 sq. ft. So far it looks like it has about a 3 ft. range. Something not right here.
1,Just received and obviously it's been opened. The listing doesn't say it's new but it doesn't say open box either.Inside everything looks okay but again obviously opened as there are empty bags and scratches on the unit. If it works I'll update but it will never get 5 stars since the listing doesn't mention it may be an open box item.
1,It only gave me a better signal in the house if i was right next to the box. Anywhere further and it made my Signal worse!
1,I've tried this item out in multiple locations and situations in the two years I have owned it.I can now give it a poor review with a clear conscience.I estimate it failed me 80% of the time I tried to boost my Verizon signal.  Save your money.
5,Home is in a dead zone for Verizon T-Mobile.  No more dropped calls. Internet is fast and efficient. Easy to set up. Has between 1 and 5 bars in all rooms of one story house.  Great!
5,Excellent device didn't have great service and now I have 4 bars all the time
5,I went from absolutely zero service to full service
1,I called support twice and tried all their suggestions.  I had two bars without it.  I had two bars with it.  I had poor video resolution without it. I had the same with it.  Moved the antenna several times as recommended.  I had 2-3Mbs up/down without it.  No change when it was turned on.  It just doesn't work.
3,Not support DATA
1,I saw no improvement at all.
5,no more dropped calls sitting in a aluminum motor coach in a weak cell phone area that we stay for months at.
5,Easy to install and my 4G LTE signal went from poor/ fair to excellent. And my download speeds doubled.
5,Delivers as promised. Transfers good signal strength  to areas of low to no signal. I could not live without it.
5,Best decision I made works great easy install.  Attractive unit that is a real work horse.
2,I could never get this adjusted so that I could be more than two feet from the base unit with the phone without getting RF feedback that rendered the system unusable. I returned the system.
5,Easy to install went from 2 bars to 4.
5,This product works great. My brother also installed one.
5,When the 4G service starts to fail due to the weather or too many customers on one tower the 3G picks up the slack and gets me through just fine.
5,Had now for a couple of months works really well.
5,We had one bar if we stood on one leg in exactly the right spot before installing this. We now have four bars of LTE! Worth every penny!
5,Good product have 4 bars now.
2,Very little help
1,Does very little to amplify signal. After moving the amplifier around several times and talking to support this amplifier gives me maybe one extra bar. Support tells me since I live on a heavily wooded lot the trees absorb alot of the energy of the signal. Sure would have been nice to know that prior to purchasing this amplifier.
5,A Little expensive but worth it. Works great.
1,This was an incredible waste of $500!! I tried and tried and tried just long enough to exceed the return timeline to make this work! Very frustrated with allowing myself to be duped and also that I let the return deadline pass!I’ve selected one star only because it was the only way to post this review.
2,Doesn’t work as advertised
5,Went 3G 1 bar at best to 4G 3 bar within 25 feet of unit inside or out.
1,WE did all we could to get this to work but it did not increase our signal at all.  Spent 2 hours in different locations on top of our roof but no success.  It is a good thing we can send products back on amazon.
5,Worked well but unfortunately the signal I was trying to amplify was nearly non existant. It brought in signal where there was none.
1,The biggest let down for this antenna is that after only 20 minutes of working the receiver fried and would no longer turn on at all. Definitely a piece of junk. It did boost my signal for a moment and I was able to get out 1 single text before it just shut off.
5,Boosted the reception in the back of our house.
5,It worked
2,It worked for about 4 months and then stopped completely. Bought in October 2017 and it was dead by February 2018.
5,Went from no service on T-Mobile to service and LTE at times. About 10 miles from the nearest tower with thick tall Florida jungle around the property.
5,Awesome works great.  I have Verizon.  Had one bar in house now 3-4 bars
5,Increases signal
1,Work when it is not in sleep mode. As soon as it goes to sleep nothing comes in and nothing goes out. And the only way to make it stop sleeping is to unplug it. It came with no directions except for piece of paper to tell you what all of the blinking means. I am sure you can find something that works better.
5,Only got 3g signal in house before install. Now LTE for all. Entire family is pleased.
5,Several things needed for proper and optimum installation.. not told this up front!
1,It didn't work.
1,Not working as advertised. The outdoor antenna does seem to pull signal but you need to be standing very near the indoor antenna to see a boost in reception. Not the 4000 square feet that they advertise.  I'm going to call the company to help troubleshoot the product to see if I should try to set it up differently.
5,We have full bars now in our steel building!
1,Bought this because we broke our cheap signal booster thought we would upgrade to something faster. It works on occasion often losing connection. Cheaper one was way better. Do not recommend.
1,Sure call leads you to believe the device will work without an outdoor antenna; it does not. I cannot put an external antenna on my apt so it was of no use. Better information for the buyer should be given.
5,Works for the most part. Have to be pretty close to the unit to get the best benifits which is normal.
1,I done a lot of research before I purchased the item.  I checked my carrier my phone and the cell towers in my area.  I have 2 bars of signal without the booster and with the booster I had 2 bars.RETURNED
1,This item was not worth the money. It did not do what it stated it did. We moved the device to several different locations and it was he same everywhere. We returned the item shortly after.
1,This product does not work at all. Paid for professional installation and still no difference. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!! If I could give it 0 stars I would have.
1,Didn't make any difference for us item returned.
5,We went from half of a bar to three bars.  Until we installed this all phone conversations were on the porch!
1,Not for everyone I spent a lot of money for this item and it doesn’t help one bit with me having service. Very disappointed. I’m wondering if I got a lemon or something??
1,We stretched the entire length of cord to make sure the distance was right before we did the install. It was fine for about a week now it’s flashing yellow indication it doesn’t have e ought distance between the antenna and the booster.
5,Cell reception inside mobile home
5,Works well have to pay attention to distance  between antenna and receiver.
5,Works even better than I thought it would
1,Quit working after 6 months.
1,EL EQUIPO SE INSTALO SEGUN RECOMENDACIONES ...Y BLOQUEO LA POCA SEÑAL QUE TENIA..ES LA PEOR COMPRA DE TODA MI VIDA....NO FUNCIONAME SIENTO ESTAFADO.....POR FAVOR NO GASTEN DINERO EN ESTA ESTAFA
1,Works sporadically.  Get LTE outside and says I have bars inside but phone works intermittently.  Even mounted the antenna outside in exact spot I get excellent service but didn't help.  If anything is important have to stand outside in the cold to talk or check email.  Wasted my $300.
5,Made a major difference in reception
2,Didn't Help at all
2,This hasn’t helped our signal at all!
1,AT&T wouldn't allow me to do this - They say WiFi calling is going to work - however for someone who lives in the country and has to use Satellite internet - wifi calling sucks.  Thanks AT&T for not allowing me to have the freedom of communication.
2,Not nearly powerful enough especially for the price
5,Increased cell service in home and has eliminated issues with no service or dropped calls
1,Did literally nothing. Called CS. Apparently the trees are blocking the signal so even though my phone can get a steady 2 bars this obnoxiously large white antenna couldn't get anything and gave my phone absolutely no service. Not worth the purchase. Looks like it's hughesnet and 1 bar 3G-1x forever..
5,Perfect device! It works so well I get 5 bars anywhere I go in my metal building.
5,The fact that I'm writing this review is proof this item works great.
1,La entrega fue a la hora exacta pero el artículo no cuenta con todas las patentes me faltó la antena ahora no se si devolver el artículo o como hacer el reclamo
1,This worked adequately (not great adequately) to boost my signal to usable but died after month 5: no power we cant get it to come back on.
5,Excellent
1,Don't buy this product it sucks.
5,Fast shipping and item arrived as described.....Thank you
1,Not working at all in my bad area. Increase signal level for around 7-10%I have 6 towers around me and as I understand the Verizon didn't give more speed then they can.Items are good. But you need to explain some tricky things.
5,We are in chicago IL and it worked great in our brick and plaster home.
5,Very good product
5,It does a great job of boosting the phone signal.  We love it.
5,Works as indicated.
1,Sorry installed properly but never provided an additional signal.
1,i installed according to directions worked for one day the wouldn't even power up. I ordered "amaboost" worked great out of the box
1,Signal was Awesome for a few months and died. No signal at all now. For the price get a unit that has a better return policy. A better return policy indicates how much trust they put in their product.
1,Great product wrong application.Wasn’t able to provide additional boost.
5,We are very please with the SureCall Fusion4Home Yagi/Panel Booster and Antenna. It works great and was shipped on time.
5,Works like a champ! I had zero signal in my cabin and now have full 4G this is awesome!
2,worked good for 9 months and quite. Can't get any customer service.
5,as advertised we now have a reliable signal when we had nothing before. It works and that counts.
1,the description of "easy to install" may be true - IF you are an accomplished electronics/electrician tech.  I spent months just trying to locate a person who would try to install - and subsequently had to abandon installation altogether.  we will never know if the device works.
5,Greatly boost cell phone signal in house
5,Made me a very happy camper...  Works great...
5,The signal went from 1 bar to almost a full set.
1,5 bars next to it on iPhone 11 and ATT 1 bar just 12 feet away same level.  Returning it.
5,Mark with SureCall customer service was amazing
1,Tried many configurations and combinations of exterior antenna and indoor device. No appreciable or consistent improvement in cell signal or download bandwidth.
5,Bought for a Christmas present working great so far
1,Was told it would work for total wireless but nope it does not! Technical support was not helpful!
5,Really surprised. Works great
1,Worked very poorly.  Was double the price of an At&t microcell and didn't work.  I  wouldn't bother with this and just get a microcell. Way cheaper and works way better.  Their technical troubleshooting was just as bad.
1,Waste of money. After going through the whole installation it never increased out service in our house. Do not recommend.
5,Worked so well at my office I bought another one for my house.
1,Did not work with Verizon
5,We now have a cell phone signal inside our home
1,Didn't work for me
1,Gives false service have 4g but does not work can not load anything
1,No change in signal output
1,Doesn't help boost cell service what's so ever. Huge waste of money!
5,Not easy to install but worth it
2,doesn't boost as advertised
1,A royal pain to get it into the best location and then it didn't improve my cell signal at all.  Waste of my Saturday morning.  Thank you Amazon for your return policy.
5,Two previous signal boosters did not work for us. The Fusion 4 works fine.
1,It didn’t work
1,Did nothing to increase signal  I spent a few hours trying to get this to work with no luck at all. I will be returning it
5,Great product works as described!
3,Installed the yagi antenna on my chimney and ran the indoor antenna to my kitchen.  No more dropped calls.  However the Description states it boosts 5G/4G LTE signals.  It does not only 4G.  Your 5G device is "compatible" meaning you will get a boosted 4G signal on your 5G device.Minus 2 stars for intentionally deceitful product description.  ALSO this is a signal booster it is not registered with your provider!  Only your end device (phone tablet router) are registered with your provider.  Lastly the signal strength from the tower to your home is NOT enhanced.  The signal strength is the signal strength.  If you get no service outside your home this will not fix the issue.  This grabs the signal outside your home and boosts that signal inside your home mitigating the interference of walls and ceilings.  The bars you see when inside your home are reflecting the connection from your device to your indoor antenna not the tower.
5,worked perfectly
5,went from ZERO to three bars in my basement
1,Did absolutely nothing. Still better off going outside holding phone in air. Junk
5,Works great at the cabin for laptop hotspot
1,Tech support was somewhat helpful
1,This product does not work!Due to the weather we have had I was unable to try it until not and it does not work!
1,If you live in a mountainous area.... forget this helping any.
5,Live rurally and have Verizon. Definitely fixed my signal issue.
1,Doesn’t work! Do not buy! There’s no tech support!
1,Tried it. Followed the instructions. Did not work. Sent it back.
1,I was told this thing would work in Mexico but it doesn’t I will be sending it back
1,This device barely increased my signal. It's not worth the money don't buy.
5,works like a champ
5,Great product and pricing
1,This doesn't work and now I am past my return window. I really want to return it. It made no difference for us.
1,Signal actually got worse. Tried to reach out and heard nothing. Will be returning this garbage.
1,It dI'd not but I think there was something wrong with the box. I  shouldn't have bought used I guess
1,Didn’t work as good as I thought. Get the more expensive one
1,It does not work and gives you a fake network
1,Worked for 3 months then quit What a big waste of money
5,Works as it should.
5,Exceeded expectations.
1,Ordered the wrong product
1,It didn’t work in UAE
5,Very satisfied
1,Just did not work as stated.  Did not boost my cell signal one bit.
5,Ok
1,I have Cricket it does not help on my 5g to get full signal have to be with in a foot of it. Have to still put phone in window to get real 5g. Move 12 ft from unit goes to 4g down to 7mbs. Do not buy waste of a lot of money.
5,It works good
1,Did not boost signal at all.  Very disappointed.
1,Outdated and not useful
1,Barely improved signal and completely died after 3 months
1,returned it
5,Works great
5,Most are Preset gains but this one is tuneable
4,Our house gets 1 bar of cell phone signal inside and out.We have 3 cell towers nearby.  Each a couple miles away in heavily populated suburbs.People on phone calls sometimes cannot hear us and hang up.My iPhone's Field Test mode shows very low measured RSRP.Field Test shows the phone uses all 3 neighborhood towers at different times.I ordered a SureCall Fusion4Home booster amp with an omni antenna.Set it up inside the house as a test. It did not seem to boost at all.Next hung the antenna from a rafter in the attic.There's an unused cable TV wire in my attic going to a wall outlet in my office/bedroom. Connected to it.Signal in bedroom was 2 bars.Download speed Mbps improved.iPhone Field Test showed significantly stronger signal next to the unit less improvement on the far side of the room.No boost outside the room.I noticed I could leave the amp switched off until I need it. Field Test mode seems to indicate the boost comes on in seconds after the amp is turned on.I then substituted a SureCall Flare booster amp.The Flare has slightly better specs than the Fusion4Home.With the Flare the signal in room showed 2 bars.iPhone's Field Test showed RSRPs slightly stronger than the Fusion4Home.Blinking yellow light indicated automatic feedback control- amp too close to upstairs antenna.No boost outside the room. Possibly from the output being limited.Next I moved the omni antenna the full 50 ft away from the inside amp to try increasing the amp's coverage area.The blinking yellow light stopped blinking but RSRP from that placement was very weak.So I moved the antenna back to the attic sweet spot and will live with the blinking light and 1 room of coverage.Your results may vary.The Flare amp does not have an off/on switch.  I use a wall plugin adapter with a rocker switch.
1,I am not reviewing a product but providing information which potential customers may want to know.  My ratings are not really ratings but attention getters - good on everything except Overall.  People read bad ratings first sometimes.  Perhaps my comments will help out.You all have certainly been nice to the buyers of the Fusion 4 Home Omni antenna buyers according to the negative reviews and gone way beyond good service.  Apparently those folks did not study your product information very well or tried to get by with the cheaper Omni and Whip package which SureCall literature clearly states works with stronger signals.  I am in a hilly rural area of central Texas and signal from ATT has gone from good for an 8  year period to progressively unacceptable over the past two years.  In the past month signal strength has stayed in the -90 to -132 range.  Slow to non-existent hotspot and cell data and dropped calls on every call we are involved in.  But at least 1 bar on iPhone and Samsung phones Sometimes No Service.  Something is fishy here.  No fibre optics available for hard wired service also by ATT.  And I am resisting satellite because of the additional monthly cost around $100 and it is not mobil. Cheaper to try your equipment first. and use existing hotspot.I will be complaining to the FCC about signal impairment from the provider without having been notified of change of service.  Service is bad 24 hours per day so no excuses about hills trees system overload etc.  I am convinced that ATT is redirecting their towers as a result of development of new dense residential neighborhoods in the area to keep new customers happy.  Wish I could prove that.  I am equal distance from 4 towers (all about 4 miles away) and my phone connects to whichever one has the best connection (which is not saying much).  I AM PLANNING ON BUYING THE YAGI/PANEL OPTION BECAUSE I HAVE WEAK SIGNAL STRENGTH.  This looks like a good choice.  Hope I can point the Yagi to find the tower with the best signal.  Unfortunately other carriers will not provide service due to some kind of hole we are in.  It is OK if you want to delete these comments since the overall rating is bad and it will affect your average numbers.
2,Bought for my house in a somewhat rural area. I could make phone calls fairly reliably without dropping them before purchasing this. I had no data whatsoever. After installing this product with the yagi directional antenna on a 35 foot pole pointed directly at the closest cell tower (3-4 miles away) I saw very minimal signal improvements. For instance my data went from nonexistent to dial up speeds taking several minutes to load a single webpage or photo if it even loaded at all. Still couldn’t send any text messages either. Moved the antenna to many locations with no improvement. The unit seems to be constructed well but it’s performance is inadequate. Ended up returning it for a refund. Not worth the $400 if you ask me but everyone’s situation is unique.
5,We recently got a metal roof and it zapped the cell reception in the house and it wasn't that great to start out with. After a lot of research settled on this one - it is pro-grade. I want it to work for us and our family especially with the 4G and LTE. Its the future. It took a while to gather the information and plan the installation as one has to find the nearest cell tower. We use Consumer Cellular on the AT&T network. The apps are almost useless and out of date. It took a call to AT&T and they were considerate and I was able to find one about a mile and a half away in a direction I did not know there was a AT&T cell tower. I mounted the antenna on a vent pipe because it was in the right direction and easiest to do. I ran the wire down though a window sash into the attic where I mounted the amplifier. Then came a bit of trial and error. The last cable run is about 20 feet (the connectors are different). The manual says the inside antenna and outside antenna cannot face each other or one can get an oscillating condition that ruins the reception since both send and receive cell signals. The panel has to be face the direction you want the signal to go none on the backside so had to pick the worst reception areas. They point roughly in the same direction about 15 feet apart but have the metal roof inbetween. I was concerned and called; the engineer and said to try it out and see if it works. The lights on the amplifier give a clue if there is a problem and moving stuff around is the main remedy. The reception varies somewhat depending exactly where in the house and the handling and position of the phone but where there was note I sometimes get three bars but never none as before. It will work if you read and follow the enclose materials that it comes with call to make sure you can point the outside yogi antenna the right direction and just it and read the lights correctly.
4,I use this booster for home that is surrounded by trees and tall buildings. It improves my signal on the day that our cellphones signal got dropped. CDMA Iphone is terrible and does not give option to read signal strength but the data goes through on our phones when I turn this device ON. I like the fact that it can be adjusted manually and easier managed than automatic versions which gives you no idea why all the LEDs are blinking. I think it is worth it to try if you are having difficulty of receving cellphone signal. I installed it for a bout 9 months and have been using it every day. The price seems high but people are paying two or three times for a cellphone that they don't need to replace yet and what is the phone for if the signal is intermittant?
4,For les than $50 dollars you can contact your provider and it will be connected to your router and you will have a boost in cellular signal. This is for people in the Boone Docks where there is no provider available.  Please understand that is if you do not have home internet and cellular signal is lost because of obstacles around you that prevent it from reaching your home. Signal is linear not scattered that is why there has to be towers on mountain and hills. Have lots of trees? Going to have to install it on a pole high enough for the signal to reach you. Just saying. Not talking bad about the product just learn what you are buying.  GOD BLESS YOU ALL and stay safe.
5,Overview: I bought an off-grid home in the woods of Aurora Maine and hoped to work from there. The home is so far off the grid that it requires 4WD to get there on logging roads in good weather. No power or satellite internet options. We received 1 bar and 1x signal there between the tall trees surrounding the house.Prep: I called different cell booster companies to decide what device to try. I was told by one comapny that "we can't turn 1x into 3G/4G/LTE" but SureCall said that usually they can at least get 3G if 1x is present. Based on price functionality and return policy I decided to purchase the SureFire Flare 3.0 (with directional antenna) with the Wilson Electronics Pole Mount for Outside Home Antenna - 901117 - 10". I mapped the compass direction to the nearest cell antenna bought this device then registered it with Verizon.Testing: I powered up the generator mounted this device on a tree pointed in the exact bearing where it needed to point directly into the forest. Still 1x but increased to 2 or 3 bars of cell reception. Since we're on the water I moved this to point to the water in clear sky with no obstructions which was about 10 degrees off from the bearing I had mapped. Then I received 3 or 4 bars with LTE internet! We fiddled with the location of the antenna and consistently got LTE. Speeds varied and we will look to tie speeds to environmental factors such as wind and cloud cover.This unit exceeded expectations and at this price point and with its return policy I definitely recommend.Rated customer service at 0/5 because I did not have to interact with them. 5/5 for both ease of installation and value for the money.
5,Wow. I had hope but this product blew me away. My daughter lives in the middle of nowhere - many miles from any tower in any direction. No IPS available except satellite. The best she could do with her iPhone on a good day was place her phone in a particular window to get enough service to send a text. I had no signal meters or high tech devices to help me. I used the OpenSignal app to help locate a tower but the best signal I could get from it was 2.5G which is useless. Tried for a full day all over the roof...but I concentrated in the direction OpenSignal pointed me. Frustrated I spent that evening pointing the directional Yagi antenna outside each upstairs window with the unit spread all over the upstairs floor. Surprisingly I found a 1-2 bar signal pointing in the exact opposite direction OpenSignal had pointed me. The area is in the mountains and the spot was one small break between mountains. The next day I mounted the Yagi on a location on the roof that had the best view of that spot. I left the rest of the unit spread all over the upstairs as I moved the Yagi an inch or so in each direction. I was getting 1-2 bars of 3.75G - 4G which was exactly what I wanted. I kept running the speed test on OpenSignal to check upload/download speeds till I was satisfied I had the best possible reception. I then tightened down the Yagi unhooked the upstairs setup and ran wire and did the permanent setup downstairs on the main floor. For two days...through a rainstorm...it has given three bars of 3.75G - 4G service throughout all three floors (counting the basement) of the house. Cellular works text works - even iMessage - Siri works and she is maintaining a 1 mbps upload and download...not blazing speed but better than the nothing she has had to live with. She is sending and receiving photos. She is ecstatic...she has lived without internet or cell service for too long. For what little signal I was able to locate I am truly amazed!!!   SureCall Fusion4Home Yagi/Panel Cell Phone Signal Booster Kit for All Carriers 3G/4G LTE up to 4000 Sq Ft
5,Cell service in our little town circles around the local college. Outside that area it becomes sketchy at best. A few miles from the college our metal building we lease for a small business cuts out all but a little cell service. We installed this 'repeater' and service improved but we had to work with it to get the best from the unit. Proper antenna placement IS VERY IMPORTANT! We do recommend this unit but hate the high price it imposed.
1,Installed this fusion 4 system in my home and it actually made the reception worse contacted Sure cell and they told me that it would not work because my signal may to weak call them first before you buy  I can't return  I can;t useA big waste of time
5,Just ordered/received this device.  Took to ranch where AT&T signal has steadily degraded over the years.  Prior to install -124 signal strength.  Installed yagi antenna on old dish pole about 20’ high.  Used cellmapper.net to ID tower location.  Took compass and identified direction to point yagi antenna.  BAM!  Done!  Initial signal -79 and went as high as -83 on LTE tower.  Able to FaceTime YouTube Hulu from my iPad now!  Super!
1,Slow shipping  fast refund  didn't work at all .
1,Only VERY slight improvement in signal.
1,Would you pay big bucks for a gold ring if you knew it would turn green a week later? Of course not!That is the epitome of Made In China. It looks good. But underneath it's horribly built with unreliable parts. The SureCall products are all made in China. And reviews of their products are reflecting that. On the other hand. Wilson Electronics are all made in USA. And unless you live in an alternate universe you know what that means. Buy American. Not just because it's way better. But our jobs belong here. Not in China. Who's side are you on?
5,Im using it at a cabin in a deep valley in the central mountains of PA.  The nearest cell towers are 8 miles away and I get full LTE signal almost 95% of the time which is impressive.  When I come out of the mountains and into town my cell phone does not get as good as a signal as it does with my SureCall hooked up back at the cabin.  Easy hook up. Make sure antenna and booster is at least 30 feet apart for best results.
1,Horrible. A nightmare to set up. A mess of packaging cables small washers everywhere. When I finally got it set up it raised my phone signal (Verizon) a few bars even with the antenna inside the window but killed my wireless hotspot connection. Ended up disconnecting it so I could use the Internet. Go for something with a wireless antenna and more streamlined design and hope it doesn't kill your Internet.
5,Installed this on my mother's house and got great service throughout!  I bought a different product for my in-laws a few years back and it was way under-powered.  This setup is fantastic!
5,We installed this unit on and in our home because we live in a remote area with spotty cell coverage.  All of the providers signals were boosted.  Our primary phone is ATT and the signal went from 2 bars to 4-5.  We can now text stream music and talk on the phone in areas of the home we were unable to before.  We would recommend this to those who need some help getting coverage in their home.  Not a cure-all but DEFINITELY a big help.
5,Does what it promises. After having a metal roof installed recently our already shaky wireless service went to near zero. This restored it. If you can get onto your roof to install the antenna and run the cable it's a pretty doable project.
4,First I should say I got a returned Fusion 4home with yagi and panel inside antenna. Normally $499 but at about $350 I could not refuse.I had already researched the different companies and for the price I felt SureCall was the best option. I had already scoped out different set up scenarios. Before ordering.Specifically the cell carrier I wanted had great signal in about 10% of the house but had dead spots in the basement where I WFH. Our current carried was OK but kit great.I had originally set up the Yagi in that area on a kitchen cabinet and the antenna in the basement next to a wall. However it did not help our current cell carrier (wife is staying with current carrier).After some searching I found one 2 feet x 2 feet area in the basement that had amazing signal for my wife and good signal for me (carrier I want to change to. Got a test drive to check out signal in my home). The signal is also good on the first floor is would be hard to place the antenna there based on the house architecture.With the Yagi and the panel antenna in the basement (on the opposite part of the basement but panel facing the Yagi) there was too much cross talk at about 35 feet. So the signal sent through out the house was not very useful much of the time (blinking yellow lights). This was even with a RF blocking cloth folded 8 times as well as some HVAC sheets between them (next to Yagi).I then tried putting the panel antenna only about 14 feet away but facing away from the Yagi and with an metal support I beam between them at an angle so I estimate the I beam thickness is doubled. With this change and decreasing the signal gain from 64 to 54 (all blinking yellow entire time). And it works. About 90% of the time with good signal to over 90% of the house.The Yagi is pointing about 90 degrees relative to the panel since that is where the best direction is located for both cellular carriers.Overall very happy. However in hindsight I would bet if I got it professionally installed they would not have taken the 20 hours off prep testing before ordering the booster or the 10 hours of fiddling with different configurations to find the optimal location for me that will amplify both cell signals.FYI. The concept of installing and connecting the pieces together was easy. It is the optimal Yagi and panel antenna placements (which is the most critical part) that took time. Now since both are installed in an unfinished basement section I can easily upgrade to the 5G models in the future if needed.Edit: Two days later. As I said above the signal was not boosted 10% if the time. I made a call from the basement and the other person could not hear me. This was unacceptable. I put the antenna at the original good spot for the new carrier was well as decent spot for the current carrier which is about 50 feet away and about 12 feet higher than the inside antenna. This works much better where I can set the gain much higher to max in call settings. Boosting seems much more consistent. I hope this works 100% if the time.
5,This product definately exceeded expectations!  We went from barely 1 bar to between 2 and 4 bars depending on the location in the house.  The signal strength improved from -127 dB to between -94 and -110 dB.  We installed the external antenna on the side of the house (second floor) and the internal antenna on the ceiling of the 2nd floor pointing down.  All rooms in the house  (~2500 sq ft) now have acceptable service.We spent quite a bit of time testing the antenna locations before we did the "hard" install.  We choose to run the cables through the attic to improve the appearance.  Before the installation we had many dropped calls and were not able to access the internet.  After the call quality is excellent and we can stream videos.  We did not use live tech support but the videos we found online were very helpful.  The three stars for installation are not a criticism of this specific cell booster...only that the installation of any cell booster is not particularly easy...
5,I have 2 cell phones both have Verizon as carriers. Moto One that had no signal and now I have 2 or 3 bars 4g. Other is Samsung 8 it had 1bar 1g now I have 2 or 3 bars 4g. I can now get on YouTube check emails and make calls at home. Next I'm going to try with Firestick. Reception is best when level with inside antenna out to 10 ft away. Still have signal when not in line but not as good. You will have to turn outside antenna to find best reception. I have only had for short while but went from not cell use to able to use. Would recommend booster it may not work for someone else but so far it's working for me.
5,Moved to the country and the cell service in the home was absolutely non existent. There were only 2 places on the property I could get a small amount of 3G coverage. Although a core to install it was well worth the time and effort. 5G coverage in the house now and better coverage outside as well. It's not cheap but it's worth it
5,I put this up about 30 ft high have full use of phone features inside home now where we had none. Only one bar outside now 4 bars inside with -87dbm awesome product .( HIGHLY RECOMEND)
5,Helps cell signal I have a metal roof I can use phone in home now. Don't have to go out side to use it.
4,Increased the connection in my shop from unusable (-125) to 3-4 bars (-99).
5,While using the home phone We were constantly receiving unwanted calls. Even being on the do not call list seemed to increase the calls. With this cell phone booster I can talk all over the house with no trouble. When I first bought this item it seemed to work great now it doesn't pick up any signal.
4,Reception isn't fantastic but it DOES work.
4,We have US-Cellular and ATT phones and the booster made a big difference - using the website to find the closest tower and pointing the antenna in the direction sure worked fine - we got our closest tower 2.5 miles from the house and now I can use my mobiles reliable even in the basement! It's a nice change and helps that phones don't burn through the battery sitting at home. Only reason why I put it to 4 stars is that the 50feet cable is in my opinion a little short - they want you to setup the antenna at least 25 feet away from the base station and the 50 feet can be short - just worked for me but still would have routed wire different if the length was 75feet or so.
5,We have a solar powered cabin in the Adirondack mountains. If you live in and around mountains you know how difficult a signal can be. Recently an antenna was installed sort of nearby and at the right spot at the right time of day you could get a bar on your phone at the cabin.I was really excited to try this out and went for the more expensive Yagi model to really get the best I could. It did not disappoint. Install is pretty easy but I did have to use cell tower maps and some trial and error for direction.I immediately went from 1 bar to 3 bars of 5g. I was ecstatic. However it didn't last it dropped down to either 1 bar of 5g or 2 or 3 bars LTE. I actually found turning off 5g on my phone was better and I'd get 2 or 3 bars of LTE and better performance. I also had some hiccups where it'd work for hours and nothing changed but the light would suddenly start blinking yellow indicating that I was too close to the unit... so this was odd. However unplugging the receiver would reset everything and it would all work just fine.I'm very happy. I did some speed tests and I was at 1 to 2 mbs of speed before the install and up to 20mbs after. I was actually able to stream Sunday football from my phone as a hot spot to a tv!So this is a must for anyone needing a boost. I'm just not sure if some of the consistency issues are because of the mountains or the unit.
5,Installed this in house with no cell signal because of metal roof. Signal went to 4-5 bars on Verizon network inside house where there was no signal. Need to keep the outside antenna a minimum of 25 feet from the inside unit for it to function correctly and mounted on higher elevation to eliminate obstructions.
5,Before I set this up I had awful cell service. I could barely send text messages and forget about trying  to send a picture in a text. IF you were lucky a picture MIGHT actually send after 5 minutes of waiting. But after I set this up I was able to actually send pics AND videos! I could even stream YouTube videos! Realistically it’s not like super fast high speed internet but it bumped up my cell service to actually be usable without wanting to scream in frustration not being able to do anything. And at first I just set the thing up inside the house to test it out and my cell service was immediately better….that was without it even being outside!! Currently I only have it set up outside on the porch and not on the roof but it’s  still working great even without it being up high on the roof. I can’t wait until warmer weather when I can actually set it up on the roof….imagine how much better it’ll be then! I can’t say whether everyone will have the same success as I have with this unit. But all I can say is I am thrilled with how well it works for me and the money spent on this was totally worth it. Super easy to set up as far as the wires: just plug coax cable into antenna the other end into the receiver for the inside unit then plug the inside receiver unit into a wall plug and there you go. The most complicated part will actually be trying to install it on top of a roof and snaking the coax cable down and inside your house. Those are the only logistics you’ll have to troubleshoot for your particular space.
5,It works as described.
5,This improved the signal from the usual none to 1 bar to 4 and 5 bars of service. Really impressed.
5,My father purchased this. His home is in a rural area in kind of a "dead zone". He has Tracfone. I have T Mobile and my brother has Verizon. Barely a bar before installation. 4 bars for my brother and I and 5 for dad immediately after. Super easy to install. Definitely satisfied
5,I live in a rural area and no longer have a land line (by choice). However my cell service has been sketchy and when a call comes in I have to rush to the northwest corner of the house with my phone. Even then calls regularly drop or I lose caller's voice  or they mine without the call actually dropping. So frustrating.But no longer! The Sure Call works beautifully and for the first time I have 4 bars at home. I inquired of Sure Call about their installation service. They supply someone from my area but the cost I was told would be $299.00. No thank you! That's what I paid for the device.My handyman installed the Sure Call  antenna on my roof ran a wire down and into the house in less than 45 minutes and for less than half the company charge. I happily recommend this product.
1,I can't speak to the effectiveness of the product but their support is terrible.Product was DOA out of the box  (I should have just returned the whole thing and gotten a full replacement).Sent it in.Their receptionist signed for it but did not give it to the RMA department despite it being labelled that way?Weeks later they sent a replacement but not the power supply (what took so long)? How unprofessional and inefficient.Communication is horrible. Asked for a manager to contact me. Still waiting.I would seek out a superior product from a superior operation.
4,after using the surecall dbl and getting better signals i returned & purchased this surecall flare. i got instant improved signal strength. my signal went from 120s to low 90s & high 80s dcbl signal strength. works great! no more dropped calls nor missed calls. thx
5,Got this for my parents inside their shop building they only got 0-1 bars and call quality was terrible.They now get 2-3 bars.Note: This isn't set up for MIMO so you won't get CA out of this setup. (single antenna)
5,The first step is to register your booster online with your mobile service provider. Installation is straightforward and it’s plug and play after that. My iPhone's 5G went from 1 bars inside to 3-Full bars inside LTE from 2 bars to 4 (full) service bars. See the before and after photos.
5,I live in a heavily forested area with a hill between my home and a 4G cell tower 2.4 miles away. Prior to the install my interior Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) was -83dBm which matched the poor performance we experienced.I installed the SureCall Flare 3.0 as per the device directions (the exterior antenna as far away from the inside booster as possible in both distance and elevation) and my interior RSSI went from -83dBm to -54dBm a substantial improvement with download/upload speeds increasing and drop-offs decreasing. Regular cell phone reception also improved.The results are better than expected and I am very pleased.A few notes:- Due to the distance I used a 100' run of RG11 coax to reduce signal loss between the exterior antenna and the interior booster.- The exterior antenna is very light which allowed the use of a swivel eave mount and short mast instead of something more substantial.- Running the cable through the attic was difficult due to the length stiffness and bulk of the coax. Not fun.- The SureCall directions are clear and easy to follow and once everything is connected you just plug it in with no adjustments or other setup needed.- You really need two people to easily aim the exterior antenna one to move it in slight increments and someone inside to monitor the changes in signal strength.- Minor changes in antenna direction made a big difference in reception. An Android cell phone was used to measure dBm during the aiming process.- We still see variations in signal strength during the day but overall reception is significantly improved over what it was.
