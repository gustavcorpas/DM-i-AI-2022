5,It took me a little to find this cable. My IPad didn't recognize another ones to be charged. I charge my IPad with no problems with this cable and fast.
5,Just what I needed.  Size and quality ok
5,I only got the merchandise today so there is no basis for durability.  I didn’t want to leave it blank so gave this question a 3-star assuming it has average durability.
3,as a charging cable they work fine.  I ordered them because they were a good price and  the description indicted they were apple certified which is  what I needed to work for Apple Car play for my car.  Unfortunately. they didn't work in my car.  They work fine as cables go I don't believe they are Apple certified

5,I needed an apple iphone charger and not a cheap one that would wreck my phone and these are perfect-one for home and one for my car.

4,Well any apple wire last as long as you need to buy another
5,Nice part
3,Los cables Apple han sido una renta aparte para mi…muy caros y con obsolescencia corta.
5,My friend Cindy likes them having a back up when she needs it’s.
