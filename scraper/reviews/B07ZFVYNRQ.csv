5,Great in the car usb for charging on the go. Great to hang up the watch for the night on my usb in the wall
4,It‚Äôs great for what it is. Goes well in the car
5,It won‚Äôt charge as fast as an original charger of course but it‚Äôs works great and very convenient
5,i kept this in my bag for work. it comes in handy when my iwatch dies. i put this on my bag's zipper using a carabiner.
5,I don‚Äôt charge my Apple Watch every day and the fact that I can toss it in my purse and it NOT take up any space was a huge game changer for me. I‚Äôd definitely recommend.
4,This is super convenient for travel in the car.  Charges the watch while you drive!  I use it regularly.  The only thing I can say that is  slightly negative is the claim to "fast charge".  It charges fine - just not super fast.  Plus the fact that it gets pretty hot while charging (I am thinking that this is an Apple watch issue due to the fact that my iPhone 12 does the same thing).  I certainly do recommend this product.
4,I like that this is compact and not wired for traveling BUT you have to pay attention to the orientation of the plug. If it‚Äôs vertical instead of horizontal because of the USB receiver the watch wants to slide off the charger and gets an incomplete charge when it does stay put.
4,This product is great to keep in the purse or car for a needed charge.  However I notice that it overheats if charged for longer than a couple of hours.  I usually use it for emergencies so I don't have a need for a long charge.  Thus this is not a problem for me.
5,Honestly  I don‚Äôt understand why apple doesn‚Äôt have this . This seems like it would be designed by apple.
5,Charges well. Travels well.
5,My Apple Watch runs down before end of day so like this. Need to find out how to delete unwanted apps
5,Hi okay
5,Love it
4,I haven‚Äôt quite used it yet. I bought primarily for traveling. I will be testing it out next week. I also love not having the long cord to have to condense in a bag. I actually wished I had just got a wireless charger for the watch.
5,Leave it in the auto so you'll always have a way to charge the watch.
4,I bought this for when I travel on the weekends. It feels flimsy and cheap and doesn‚Äôt charge as fast as my Apple brand charger. However it‚Äôs sufficient for traveling and it‚Äôs inexpensive so I don‚Äôt have to worry about losing it
5,It is great for traveling. Compact and convenient. Only draw back is if you try to make use of USB charge ports at a hotel and they are up side down.
5,The charger works well. I purchased it for a backup because I have a habit of forgetting to charge my watch at home.
5,So nice not to have to bring my entire Apple Watch charger when I‚Äôm traveling. This charger works great and even if your charging block is at different angles my Apple Watch has stayed on. I like the USB cover as well to keep dirt or debris from getting into the port.
5,One of the best purchase!
5,My boyfriend NEEDS cords and chargers in every room and also in his car. Surely he‚Äôs keeping device charger manufacturers in business. He has a watch charger in the living room and the den but for when he‚Äôs on his way to the golf course he needs one in the car! I found this for him. It has decent reviews and my boyfriend‚Äôs watch definitely gets a charger out of it! Recommend!
5,I love this for my Apple Watch.  I bought this for travel but actually use it daily.  The charger doesn‚Äôt take up space on my counter  and never have to worry if I have the charging side up.
5,Great for travel or school
5,It‚Äôs great
5,I just took a 2 week trip.. camping in a tent. I have a small backup charger and I plugged this watch charger into it and set it in the picnic table. It was a great addition to my trip. I didn‚Äôt have to bring my long cord charger with my. Easy to pack and use!
5,Extremely Practical.Charges quickly.Well designed.Very compact
5,We‚Äôve used this on multiple trips and it works like a charm! Absolutely a must for travel
4,I love this little charger it folds up to be very compact and actually becomes a pendant when you‚Äôre not using it it‚Äôs great is the handle Carrie and use
5,This is good for when you are traveling and your Apple Watch has gotten low on power. I don‚Äôt know how you would use it at home to get the watch to balance on the charger while it is on a power strip.
5,so simple and small but works awesome
5,Left on a trip and realized I left my charger at home. So I decided to get this little charger. The size and the price was perfect.
4,decent if you don't want in display mode
5,I love the compact ‚Äúcordless‚Äù charger. It is left in my toiletry bag. I never have to worry about traveling with multiple chargers. Perfect!!
5,I attached it to my car key ring so it is always available to me to charge the Apple Watch that often dies at the least opportune time for recharging on the road. Works great.
4,This little charger pops right into my usb port in car and apple watch charges easily and quickly. I am very glad I purchased such a compact and reliable charger!
5,So convenient and small. Just need a plug and you‚Äôre set. Much easier than me carting around my cord!
4,Love the size and portability.  Sturdy little dongle.  The charging of course depends on the power source.  Works well plugged into the side of a laptop but not so much with USB wall plugs.
5,Traveling I keep forget my charger
5,I like this
5,I carry it to work every day and even used it to help out some works partners and they love it  it‚Äôs very useful anytime ü•∞‚òùÔ∏è
4,Very handy and good to have. Charging anytime.
4,It's ok. But hot little bit.
4,It‚Äôs convenient for traveling and so my cats won‚Äôt chew any cords. It just takes a little to charge.
4,Charger and watch got super hot after charging overnight and my Apple Watch won‚Äôt turn on.
5,I carry it on my keychain. I use my watch more than my phone so it‚Äôs cool to have it on demand!
4,I was really excited to get this and try it out because of an upcoming trip. It's ok I think - here's why. First I used an Apple "cube" to plug the charger in. It wouldn't work. Tried another one. Still didn't work. Used a different usb to plug it into and it worked. It seemed to take a long time to charge though - longer than the original Apple charger. Guess it will do I just expected it to perform like the Apple charger. I like the pink color and it was really simple to figure out.
4,I bought this a few months ago and waited until I had used it a few times before reviewing it.I keep it in my bag and have used it to charge my series 6 Apple Watch while in the car. It‚Äôs not the fastest charger in the world but it definitely works and the magnet is strong enough that it stays connected when I‚Äôm driving. I assume it would also work while connected to a power bank but I haven‚Äôt tried that yet.For ten bucks it‚Äôs worth keeping for emergencies.
5,Excellent
5,It‚Äôs the extra watch charger around the house. Small and compact. Easy to use.
5,Love it easy to use
5,Great I love it . Very durable
5,Really like this so far seems to be very sturdy and the watch so far doesn‚Äôt fall off so that‚Äôs good thing
5,Takes a while to charge but it‚Äôs good for emergencies
4,I thought this magnetic charger for my Apple Watch was a great idea because I thought it was like a bank but it doesn't hold a charge like I was thinking. instead you have to plug it in to something in order to charge the watch. So it works as a portable charger as long as you have a power source too. I had an idea of what I thought it was going to do but I was wrong. So the charger is not bad at all once I understood how it actually works. Plug it in to your laptop or car USB port and set your Apple Watch on it and it will charge. I'll update this once I see how long it takes to charge the watch to 50%.
5,Great product for a portable charger for my apple watch. The cable on the original cable is so unnecessarily long and cumbersome and this solves that. The only downside is that it charges very slowly. Still great product!
5,I use this in place of my actual charger most of the time bc I hate having cords everywhere. Anytime I travel with this people ask where I got it
4,The small size makes it easy to carry around.
5,I just wanted something to throw in my work bag so if I needed a charger in a pinch I had one. It has come in handy many times! Works great!
4,I love that this is so small without a cord. It‚Äôs easy to always keep in my purse so I can easily charge my watch if I‚Äôm traveling or at work.
3,This doesn‚Äôt charge quickly!!
3,Not what I expected I need an adapter to use on my computer and it needs to be connected to an outlet or computer in order to charge the watch. I thought it could get charge and I can use it on the go whenever my watch was low as oppose to have to either way use an outlet. For that purpose I can just use my regular apple watch charger.
5,Love it and it‚Äôs perfect on the road
4,These little chargers work great for travel or saving space.  But don't drop them or tug on them. They break very easily.
5,This is so easy to put in your bag or purse and use when needed. Or if you forget your regular charger as I often have it's always in the bottom of my purse! Very compact and works well!
5,Originally thought it would charge on the goLater realized it needed an external power sourceBut works fine in my car when my watch is running low. Thank You - Great product!
5,I love that I don't have to carry a long corded charger for my Apple Watch this charges quickly and is a breeze to pack. I just leave this in my travel case.
3,I love the convenience of just plugging it in while on the road and of course the lack of wires just wish it was a fast charger.
4,This product works well. It is small enough to take around with you. When it comes to battery power it takes a while to charge so I recommend using it only when you are not going to need your watch right away. Mine takes about 30 minutes to an hour to charge long enough for it to last a whole day. The product itself is well made but you can tell that it is dropped it will break right away.
4,I broke my USB-C fast charger so I'm left with the longer USB-A and this charger.This charges slower than the Apple OEM USB charger but still works okay...The vertical charging on this is a little finicky to get just right but once setup it holds and charges just fine.This is a must for my compact travel charging kit.
5,I travel for work and this is in my bag alwaysI have several types but this is my favorite
5,I think this charges faster than my factory charger. Love it.
3,Charges too slowly to really be usable. I returned it.
5,Great for travel work and where ever else you go. Works as expected and sturdy enough to support the weight of the watch.
5,Great value and works just like I had expected. Thank you
4,Take long to chart
5,Great little charge when I‚Äôm on the go. Just plug into your laptop and it‚Äôs a quick charge.
4,Great watch charger but not always. Most of the times it will charge just great.
5,I‚Äôve had this for about a year now and it‚Äôs saved me multiple times. Great to keep in my purse or vehicle to give a bump in my watch‚Äôs charge during long days or overnight trip. It‚Äôs holding up well still works perfectly. So I had to get another to just leave on the 2nd floor. For $10 it‚Äôs pretty great!
5,Convenient I use it in the electric outlet in the bathroom when I travel my watch sits directly on it.
3,Not very fast chargingDon‚Äôt charge to full no matter how long you charge
4,Could not get my IWatch 7 to charge with charger provided with phone.  Ordered this devise.Works nicely.  Like it.
5,Great to have as a spare. I keep it plugged into my computer so I have another charger handy for when my watch runs low.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Me falta probar cuanto tarda en cargar
5,You can take anywhere and won‚Äôt take much space
5,Convenient & Compact. No more messing with that long chord. Great for on the go & when traveling!!
4,Yes -- it's not the fastest charge but that's fine. It's easy to carry along for traveling and easy to use with your laptop if juice is running low.
5,Worked for taking on trip. Small compact charger with no cables to deal with.
5,This is the 2nd time I purchased this (I misplaced the other). It is so convenient takes up less space quick charges and overall looks and performs better than using the traditional cord that comes with the watch.
5,Between nursing school and 12 hour night shifts I have a huge problem remembering to charge my electronics. This little guy works perfect in my car with a USB adapter. Actually charges pretty fast and saves me from having to go through Apple Watch withdrawal symptoms every few days.
4,It did not charge. In fact drained the power. My watch was totally dead this morning. I will not use it again which disappoints me as it was a convenient style
3,It‚Äôs super lightweight and made of plastic. Charging my Apple Watch S7 very slow. Though it is easy to carry with but I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs very good quality.
5,Such a good little charger for on the go or even at home. I like that I can plug it in and ‚Äúhide‚Äù it instead of it being an eye sore on the counter. Tbh I need 20 of these. They‚Äôre that good.
5,Perfect for charging my Apple Watch and keep it up off the ground. I like using it in my car.
4,Purchased for on the go charging for my power bank. Works great.
4,Almost use it everyday. Still don‚Äôt quite idea the best way to get the watched fully charged. Many times it stopped at 80%+.
2,I‚Äôve only had this for 2-3 months and only used it 4-5 times. However only 1-2 times has it actually charged my watch. I‚Äôve used it in multiple different outlets (around my house in hotels in my car) and with a portable charger but often it doesn‚Äôt charge my watch and instead actually appears to be draining the battery even more. My roommate has one and uses it every night and hasn‚Äôt shared any problems with it. Not sure if I just got a defective one or my watch is too old to be compatible or what. It inconsistently charges my watch so I never know what to expect. If it worked I would absolutely love it because it‚Äôs perfect for traveling or keeping in a purse/work bag!
5,This is a lot more convient than the charger cable that came with the Apple watch.  Anyone with a computer can plug the unit into a port and leave it there for use.  Cost is well worth the cost!
5,I always forget my charger when I go away for a weekend and my watch usually is dead now I don‚Äôt need to worry I have this awesome little charger to take with me.  Works great!
5,I kinda thought I was buying a power bank but this charger works well when you are in the car and realize your watch is low. It's also great to tuck in your bags for travel charging.
5,Muy practico
5,Love  it cause you can charge it anywhere you go as long as you have a usb plug with you at all times. It is fast charging takes 2 hours to charge. One happy customer ‚ù§Ô∏è
4,I loved the compact design of this item. The only downfall is that it can be tricky to use with a case on your watch.
5,This is a great little portable charger that works well.  I carry it in my tech bag for when I'm out and about and my watch runs low on power.  I use it with either my 12W iPad charging brick or one of my power banks.
5,This charger isn't exactly what I thought I was ordering. . . I thought I was ordering a power bank that would charge my watch.  This is a wall power adapter that will charge a watch quickly so I'm happy with it anyhow.
5,N/a
5,Excellent space saver watch charger.
3,This charger is extremely easy to use plug it into a USB outlet and set your Watch on it. I've been trying to use my Apple Watch (6) while sleeping more lately which means I need to get a charge added to my Watch in the middle of the day. I bought this so I could take it with me easily and use it while working. And while it does start to charge right away it's incredibly slow. I left it on the charger for an hour when the Watch had 15% battery and it had only gained about 20% power. I guess this could be useful for travel if you intend to leave it on the charger all night long but if you want to grab a quick charge this isn't going to do a great job.
5,Perfect for on the go charging! I keep this in my car and its convenient to pop my watch to charge on a drive
5,Perfect for traveling and I keep it in my work bag for when I forget to charge it overnight
4,It is very self explanatory. It works the best when plugged into a portable charger or something. I use a MacBook so it is not comparable unless I have an adapter. So using it with a standard socket block would be ideal.
5,I mean it does what it‚Äôs intended to do
5,I do not like to take my expensive Apple Watch charger when I travel so this is perfect.  It is not as fast as the original charger but I charge my watch at night so not a problem!
5,Easy and convient for use.
5,I love this little charger!!!  Worked great for traveling to Vegas!!!  Use it all the time now!!!
5,I use it for everyday. It‚Äôs so tiny and works well so far.
5,I often forget to put my watch to charge at the end of the day. This little charger is so convenient. It's so much better than taking the whole cable and it getting tangled in my purse or with my other chargers.
4,Small and charges the watch.  Wish the usb port swilled so make it easier to connect to chargers.  Designed to slip into a laptop
4,I like it because it‚Äôs easy to throw my watch on BUT it‚Äôs kind of awkward because of the way it plugs into charging blocks. It tends to come out of the charging brick slightly and I find that my watch wasn‚Äôt being charged at all. Good value for the money though and I still use it every day
5,Love this on-the-go apple watch charger. I like the cover that goes over the USB because it protects it from damage as it sits at the bottom of my laptop bag üò¨ .
5,This is the perfect little charger my watch is always charged because I just take it off and set it on the charger instead of playing around with the cord and it‚Äôs falling off the charge circle. I recommend this to everyone I know who has an Apple Watch.
5,Great size for carrying daily enough power as long as you remember to bring a charging brick with you.
5,Use it in my bathroom and I love that there aren‚Äôt any extra cords to get in the way. I bought one for my husbands side as I lived mine so much!
5,Good for traveling. Quick charging. A must have.
3,I bought this because my cat chewed my original watch charger and I can say that the charge is slower than what I was used to with my original charger but for the price and quality you still can‚Äôt beat this
5,Very handy to charge on the go! Love the pink!
3,I arrive used and quite dirty.
5,Ease of use
5,I really like this charger. Great to carry while traveling.
5,The best charger proven for me and charge so fastReally comfortable for me‚ù§Ô∏èIt!!! So small very easy to carry anywhere Awesome ‚Ä¶
4,I like it
5,Can charge any time
5,This is small and easy to use while traveling. This stays in my to go bag. No issues.
3,This charges as fast as the original charger. It‚Äôs convenient because I can pop it into my bag and take it with me when I travel. My only complaint is this is pretty flimsy. I bumped into it and it came apart. It all snapped back together and works fine. Just wish it were more sturdy.
5,Seriously love this! Having this to take Instead of my OG one fav on the go product!
5,I love how small and portable this charger is and prefer this style since there is no cord!
4,I absolutely love this Apple Watch charger! It‚Äôs small compact great for traveling and a cute color. ONLY issues is that it slides out of the USB port ever so slightly sometimes doesn‚Äôt charge when you think it is. Also if a USB port is sideways (hotels as an example have this) obviously you cannot use this device.
5,Great buy! I carry this in my bag for when I notice my battery getting low. Have used at work on my computer to charge and in the car.
5,Small easy to use and can take anywhere
3,I am changing my review after about a months use.  It is very tricky to get the watch on it in exactly the right spot so it charges.  many times I have  put my watch on it and came back in several hours to find it is totally dead.  The other thing is when you do get your watch in the right spot the watch gets hotter than it ever did on an apple charger.  it is hot enough I worry about negative effects on the battery life.  I have stopped using it.Old review:  small size with no cable is a plus.  we use it in an rv with outles.  the magnet is strong enough to hold the watch in any direction.  does exactly what we need.
5,Very compact
5,I‚Äôve been using it for a couple of months now and it‚Äôs really convenient. I keep it on my keys and charge my watch mostly in the car in the afternoon. No problems with it at all.
5,Love this !
3,Slowest charger of my LIFE. My watch is constantly ‚Äúdinging‚Äù because it loses connectivity but then reconnects right away. It would be very useful for traveling and I take it to work with me everyday but put it in a room where you don‚Äôt have to hear it ding every 5 seconds and leave 2 hours for it to charge.
5,It‚Äôs noice but it
5,Was looking for another watch charger w usb end this is perfect!
5,Very compact easy to travel with and useful.
3,Carga muy lento
4,Works well to charge my watch on the go but the watch and charger get a little warm.
5,Small and very packable
5,
5,Small compact and great for travel!
4,Having used Apple's cumbersome charger for years and tried other brands that proved to be unreliable this solution is just what I was looking for.Compact design lets it do what you need it to do without a cable getting in the way and it makes topping off your watch in the car or traveling far more friendly.Strong magnet well built and works every time.  Great charger.  My only ask is for a USB C version!*UPDATE* Seems like something Apple did with the WatchOS update created an issue preventing the watch from fully charging it was as simple as contacting the seller for a upgraded replacement that works around Apple's bug -- excellent customer service!
5,Great product for a good price!!
5,Extremely convenient and handy. I keep it on my keychain so I'll have it with me at work. iWatch batteries don't last that long as you may know. With this USB charger I can charge my watch while I'm at the office.The item comes with a protective rubber cover for the USB prong but it doesn't completely cover it. But it is designed to come as close as possible to that while still giving you an easy grip point to remove it.
4,I have only tried the charger once so far. Magnetic part doesn‚Äôt seem to be as strong as my charger that came with the watch. My watch slide off the charger several times and I had to pay more attention than I should have while driving. I will update rating and review after more uses.
5,I watched a review on u tube and decided to go for it. Well all I can say is ‚Ä¶ perfect.  In the hotel I just plug it on and drop my watch on it and it charges right up now issues. What I like is the silicone cover to protect it in my electronics bag. They even though of a key chain tab.
5,Happy with the product small and quick charge
5,Connected this to a car charger on the dash and I get about a 30% charge increase during my 40 minute commute. Charging during both my morning and evening commutes allows me to wear the watch overnight for sleep tracking as well as being sure I never miss a step or standing hour... I almost never have to charge at home (except on weekends when I don't drive). Should have done this a long time ago!
5,i really needed a charger for my watch but didn't want a ton of cables in my purse.  this worked out perfectly and now i can charge my greedy watch wherever i go.
5,I‚Äôve read a lot of reviews referring to the charging time being slow. I have had the opposite experience. I travel for work and this thing charges just as fast as the one that came with my watch. The one that came with the watch may be a tad faster. But this thing takes about 10-20 min to charge it from 50% to 100%. I‚Äôve had zero issues. I think perhaps other people‚Äôs issues may lie in the adapter they are plugging it into maybe? Couldn‚Äôt tell ya all I know is it works just as good as my Apple charger‚Ä¶. For WAY less money. It‚Äôs compact and super easy to travel with. So those negative reviews? Sorry‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt relate.
4,NEEDS TO BE IN OUTLET FOR CHARGING. For some reason I thought this could charge and then be portable.  I was wrong; always must be in an outlet.  But this thing sure is sturdy.  My computer doesn‚Äôt have a USB port (stupid Apple) so I will probably use it as a back up charger when I travel.  I am worried my partner might run into it or kick it at some point when it‚Äôs sticking out of the wall so we will see how long it lasts.  If my computer set-up did have a USB charger I think I would certainly use it more.  Good magnet strength for watch.
5,When you are in a 3 ring competition and are running out of juice - this helps you charge back up to win!
4,I carry mine in my backpack so it I am away I can still charge watch. Only complaint is that often the charger port is sideways direction so it is a bit challenging to keep the watch from falling. A swivel option would be a benefit
5,Could not attach directly to computer as the watch housing was blocked by the computer. However I attached a USB cable; problem solved.
5,wish they‚Äôd made the USB cover part separate. other than that I like using this way better than an apple watch charger with a cord. especially when charging my apple watch in my car‚Äôs USB port. strong magnetic connection‚Äîapple watch does not easily slide or fall off. have had this product for several months now and gifted it to several fit friends‚Ä¶ all of our chargers are still going strong!
5,I haven‚Äôt had any issues yet I use it in my work truck and mainly charge my watch that way. My biggest worry was the magnet not being good and my watch sliding off during turns or bumpy roads. Luckily it‚Äôs good and my watch stays put and charging.
3,Will not fully charge my watch even if left overnight. Do not recommend. *update - seller contacted me offering a refund I assume in exchange for an amended review. I did not accept bc it was my fault for not reading other reviews. This morning my watch did finally charge to 100% so apparently it is just extremely slow.
3,The charger does work but it gets hit and makes the back of my watch so hot I can‚Äôt put it on right away. It makes me a bit nervous.
5,I love the portability and the fact that I can just put it in my car or Pop it in my purse
5,I found this product so easy to use. And it‚Äôs compact enough to keep in a purse or laptop bag with no problem. Charges my watch with ease. So happy to have found this product.
3,This was great at the beginning. No problem charging my watch.However after 3-4 months it just died. Wouldn't charge my watch anymore. It's compact and easy to carry around so there's that. Maybe it was just a fluke. But I did have to buy another charger from another company. It's a very good idea just didn't work for me. I would have expected at least 6 months on this item and hoped for more!
5,Easy to use! Slightly slower charging than traditional apple charger. Can get hot while charging
3,Please read everything about this charger before you purchase it.
5,It‚Äôs small in compact
4,Seems to work fine a little concerned over the USB quality plug but works.
3,I originally bought this product to use in our RV when we travel but most of the places we could use it the outlets were either sideways or upside down.  Next time I would try to find one that would be adjustable.
4,Maybe I got a defective one? At first charged very slowly but I didn‚Äôt mind. I bought it in April it is now July and when I took my watch off this charger the percent charger had gone DOWN 2%!! The watch was lit green with the charging screen but clearly was not charging my watch!THE COMPANY SENT A NEW CHARGER TO ME :)
5,I travel at least once a month for work and this is a must and it is super easy to use and works great!  love it :)
3,This charger overall works and is very portable however it does get quite hot when charging and it charges very slowly.  I like it for when I‚Äôm away from home.  I‚Äôve even used it to charge my watch in my car.
3,I really Like the design of this charger. It is great for travel with its small size. What it falls short is the charging speed. It is about 1/2 the speed of the original Apple charging cable. I will try different AC charging cubes and report back later.
5,I bought it for travel (lost it & bought another one!)‚Ä¶But its tidier than more cords so I keep it plugged in the bathroom & its  even kinda cute!!üíñ
5,Work great
4,I needed this bc sometimes I bump my watch on my bedside table at night and it fails to charge. So I keep this in my purse and I can charge in my car on my commute at my laptop and it‚Äôs been perfect for traveling so I don‚Äôt have to take my charging station apart to get my cord.
3,Apple Watch 5 42mm. I have bunch of Apple cords w. watch charge pucks but hoped for something a bit more convenient for travel.  This seemed to fit the bill.Seems to start charging when plugged in to a compatible USB outlet. Then it cuts off without charging the watch.Tried a bunch of different USB ports at different ratings.  Result is the same.  DOES NOT CHARGE THE WATCH. Cannot depend on this thing. Back it goes...EDIT: 25 Jun 2021The customer service contacted me after the return and apologized for the mishap - and informed me a new batch is being manufactured to higher specs.  They promised a replacement unit in return for a fair review. when the new batch comes out.  This shows they care about the customer feedback and are willing to resolve problems.  Will give them a couple months and update when the new unit shows up.
5,I bought this before a trip and it was perfect! The less cords to get tangled the better. This plugged right into the USB in the hotel nightstand and charged just as fast as the normal one. This is a must have if you‚Äôre on the go
5,Easy to travel with Apple watch charger - perfect for quick charging.  Doesn't seem to overheat either~!!!  Happy to have this unit so I don't have to use my laptop or tablet to charge watch.
5,My wife loves her Apple Watch and this charges it pretty well.  Not much more to say about that.What‚Äôs nice is if you get a USB charger with 2 USBs horizontal to the ground.  You can charge your Apple Watch on top and use the bottom USB to charge your IPhone.
5,Loved the color convient
5,Absolutely love this very sturdy and easy charges my watch very fast
5,This works great - perfect size to carry and I can charge my watch easily. Charges quickly too!
5,item arrived very quickly. this handy charger lives in my travel backpack and takes up no space at all. I never have to think about grabbing my apple watch cord from its dock when heading out. 10/10
5,As someone who travels constantly I'm always looking for convenient chargers for my Apple products.  I love the design of this charger for my Apple watch.  I also love the convenience.  I don't have to pack the long cord on the original charger when I'm on the go and love that I can just plug this one into my laptop (which I use all the time) and get a quick and full charge for my watch without any hassle.  The charger is perfect for me because I use my watch for everything and need to be able to charge it on the go wherever I am without any hassle.  I would recommend this as a great buy for yourself or a gift for other Apple watch owners in your life.
5,Genius.
5,I saw some reviews where people have had issues but I have had nothing but good experiences after having it for about 2 months.  It was a great price.  I don‚Äôt use it as my primary charger just something to have on the go or when I need it in a pinch.
5,Perfect for traveling so you don‚Äôt have to have a cord that will just get tangled up!
5,I absolutely love this thing for travel. Charges much faster than I thought it would based on how small it is. Don't hesitate get this to use for travel!
3,This little cordless charger is such a great idea. I love the fact that you can do away with the cord but‚Ä¶ it takes hours to fully charge. It charges much slower than original Apple Watch charger. I guess if you charge overnight it is fine. I wear my watch for as keep tracking so I charge in the morning. Not so great for my needs
5,I use this charger for my smart watch every day! I have one at work and one at home.
5,I purchased this because I was constantly worried about not remembering my watch charger or leaving it behind when I travel.  This is great I add it to my 'electronics bag' and have it with me and my iPhone charger iPods etc.  It is small and works great.
4,Se sobrecalenta
4,This product is so convenient as I often find myself needing a charged and without one and I love being able to keep it on my keys. However the charge is pretty slow so keep that in mind when purchasing. Makes sense for price though
5,Muy √∫til para llevarlo en un viaje no ocupa espacio y carga muy r√°pido!
4,I like the size like that it has a cap to keep USB connecter clean. I use this in my car plug it into USB on back of center console and it charges while I drive on long trips the magnetic connector keeps watch securely in place till I put it back on my wrist.
5,It‚Äôs super handy. I keep it on my keys to use with my computer or my usb portable charger and it gets the job done. I have an older watch and it doesn‚Äôt keep charge is good as it used to so this has been clutch!
5,Product works like it advertised. Plugged mine into the monitor on my computer and it works great!
4,I‚Äôm somewhat embarrassed to admit it was weeks off ‚Äòmeh‚Äô use before I noticed the removable film protection on the business end of the charger ‚Ä¶ a clear heads-up would be useful. I really like the physical form of this device ‚Äî compact sturdy satisfying attention to detail ‚Äî and since I removed the protective film I‚Äôm satisfied with the performance. The charger runs a little warm I think which leaves room for improvement but that doesn‚Äôt keep me from giving it a thumbs-up.
4,Plugs into an usb outlet and charges.  Doesn‚Äôt charge fast using my computer but put it on the outlet and works perfectly fine!
5,This apple watch charger is perfect for what I needed and wanted in a charger.  It charges my watch really fast with high efficiency.  I really like how portable it is.  I can throw it in my pocket my purse or a bag when I'm traveling that way I don't always have to take my cord from the house.  It is also perfect for traveling as it does not take up a whole lot of space because of it's smaller size.  Works perfectly and I highly recommend it.
5,Convenient place for recharging my 7 watch with its short battery life.
5,Great Apple Watch charger for on the go!
5,Needed an easy charger for my Apple Watch and this fits the bill! Easy to use and store!
5,Bought this to have a work for when my watch goes dead. It charges quickly and is easy to have right at my computer.
5,This is definitely a good quality product! I would recommend for anyone with an Apple Watch who travels a lot for fun or work or just all around on a daily basis and uses the heck out of their Apple watch to point where it doesn't stay charged up until their late night adventure or whatever. I just love how small/lightweight and sturdy design this piece is. It fits nicely with all my cords in my smaller backpack!
4,Works as advertised. Would be better with small extension cord...at least in the car i drive.  Overall I'm satisfied with this product.
5,The charging power does not work as well as the other one I puchested
4,None
5,After my cat chewed the wires of the first two chargers I had to find another solution. This is exactly what I needed. Charges great and no wires to tempt the chewer.
4,Love this form factor and it's sturdier than some other options. Weirdly after two weeks it's started randomly stopping charging for a second every minute or two. It starts charging again almost immediately so it doesn't slow down the charging much but it does mean the watch screen comes on constantly which makes it no good for overnight charging
5,compact & easy to use for travel.
2,This little travel Apple Watch charger was great for about six months and then it stopped working. It‚Äôs a very simple design  there was no way to figure out what went wrong!
4,Not good for charging in your car there isn‚Äôt much room when you plug it in the usb. It gets hot quick but it‚Äôs nice and sturdy.
5,Like small size. Wish it had a C usb port
5,This is nice to keep at the office if your watch dies on you and need to charge it. Or camping.
4,When the watch is perfectly positioned it charges fine.  But if it's slightly off (which is easy to be) it doesn't charge
5,It‚Äôs nice to have this. I keep it on my key chain because you never know when you need to charge my watch and it chargers it rather quickly. If I forget to bring my charger I know I have another on my key chain and this has happened a couple of times already.
5,I like that it‚Äôs not bulky! I can charge my Phone and watch in my car using one port! It‚Äôs perfect!!
5,I travel and have forgotten my Apple Watch charger at times.  This small charger stays in my computer bag and I don‚Äôt have to worry about charging my watch. Great charger and it has worked great for me
5,Worked so great I went back and bought another one.
5,Was given an apple watch that didn't have a charger found this on Amazon. I like the fact that there's no cord involved. So easy very satisfied.
5,Handy device. Sturdy great for travel ta it es op no space and has an amazingly quick recharge worth the price.
5,So compact and much easier to keep on hand when traveling than an
3,A friend recommended this charger for my Apple Watch. It worked great until about 1-2 weeks ago. I put the watch on the charger at night & the next morning the watch isn‚Äôt charged.  I tried different outlets & it still doesn‚Äôt charge the watch.
4,Great charger for my Apple Watch. My work is mostly mobile so I can take this anywhere‚Äôs. Just drop it in my purse and it goes with me. Small & convenient to use.
5,I mean you could make this your keychain/keyfob and always have a charger for your phone.  I personally just took the two I bought and put them in our travel laptop bag.  Now we always have chargers for our watches when we travel without having to tear apart our bedside table.
2,At first glance this product is both attractive and possessed of many positive reviews. The compact form is pleasing to me as the OEM (Apple) charger comes with a cable that I worry about damaging in my bag. The 'leather' tag hanging off the end is a tasteful accent.Unfortunately this device has few redeeming qualities by measure of its function. It charges slowly. So slowly that I seethe with hate for it. The Apple Watch doesn't accept too much power to begin with but this charger seems to suffer from heat dissipation issues and will charge at a rate of approximately 10% per hour.When I think 'travel charger' I'm not planning on going to bed and leaving it on this contraption. I would bring a regular charger for that. This is (in my head) for those times when you've got an hour in a terminal before your flight and your watch just gave you a low battery warning. This product doesn't work for me. I've gone back to packing the OEM charger and am much happier for it.
5,I really like this charger. It helps when I or get to charge my watch so I charge it in the car .
5,Easy to use fits easily in your purse or pocket and charges in a timely manor.
5,Charges fast good price
4,Works well but the leather piece broke easily.
5,Pocket size easy to use fast charging
5,This is ideal for travelers (I‚Äôm a flight attendant). It eliminates unnecessary cables in your bag. It does a great job charging and it fits almost anywhere.
5,Super small and perfect for traveling or just commuting. Seems sturdy enough.
5,This was perfect for getting chords off the countertop and having my watch protected while it charges! Love the idea.
5,My husband and I wanted to get rid of all these long cords. This little guy is great! Easy to use magnet is perfect. Great buy!
5,Great charger for the Apple Watch!
5,When I forget to charge my watch this comes in handy. No regrets!
4,So far so good. Small and convenient.
5,Perfect travel size charges my iWatch quickly inexpensive.
5,I tend to keep a survival kit of sorts in all of my travel bags purses in the cars etc. the one thing I was lacking were these. I now own 4 and they all serve their intended purpose. I keep 1 in both of our cars 1 in my purse and one in my zipped small toiletrie-type travel bag that tends to come with me anywhere. Knowing I have them gives me peace of mind. Thank you!Though I‚Äôm prepared for pretty much any issue I have while traveling in a road or airplane
5,It does what it should.  Because of the design there are some limits. But plugging into a mac or PC works great.
3,I was very pleased with this charger for months. It charged slowly and did seem to heat up. More and more as time went by. Now it heats up but does not charge. I am sad.
5,Works as it should not issues.  I just wished it had an enclosure on the bottom.
5,Perfect size for traveling and charges pretty fast! Great value!
5,I take this everywhere with me!  It is great to charge on the go!
5,Small efficient perfect for travel.
4,Great Little Product already been used well packaged and Well ahead of Delivery Scheduled10/10 Guy's :)
5,This is for my when my watch dies while I‚Äôm still at work. It‚Äôs small so easy to carry around with you instead of bringing a long charging cord. üëçüèº
4,It‚Äôs a great travel size charger. I use it mostly for work and it‚Äôs great. Chargers a bit slowly by it still gets the job done.
5,I love it! When out and about we need it and it comes in handy
5,This was my 4th watch charger after my cats chewed on the cords for the others and this charger absolutely solved that problem!!!
5,I bought this for my husband since he has been traveling for work a lot lately. At first he wasn‚Äôt so sure but now he absolutely loves this thing. You just put your watch right on it and there‚Äôs not a long wire in the way. Definitely worth it!
5,This is a wonderful product.  It is small and easy to pack or keep in the car.  No wires.
5,Surprisingly very useful and reliable
2,The base and the watch got very hot during use for even a short time. Returning as I don‚Äôt want to cause damage to the watch.
4,I bought two on special for $10. I keep one in the car and one in my briefcase. It works well on the rare occasion my Apple Watch battery gets very low. The only con is that the magnet is very weak.
5,I use it in my truck to charge my Apple Watch while I‚Äôm on the go
4,Love that I don‚Äôt have yet another cord laying around. Perfect for travel.
1,Was disappointed in this product. Had a lot of good reviews and wanted to bring it for my International trip because it's so small and compact. It was very disappointing that it didn't work. I have the first Apple Watch so it COULD BE that it isn't compatible with mine. However I did test it before the trip and it worked. Once I got over there - no. The watch would just get incredibly hot. I tried using it through a USB on the wall AND via my laptop. Not sure - maybe I just got a faulty one but for me not worth it.
5,My husband and I both have bedside Apple Watch charging stations so disconnecting for travel is a hassle. These are perfect to keep with our other travel chargers. It doesn‚Äôt come with an outlet so you‚Äôll either need an extra or a usb outlet.
5,It is nice to have as a back up battery when your traveling
5,Fits perfectly in my purse for on the go charging
5,Great product to have.in the past  I‚Äôve forgotten to charge or did not place my  my Apple Watch correctly on the charger a few times and had to go without the watch for the day. Now with this portable charger I can quick charge my watch at work or in the car. It also works with a battery pack so if your traveling you won‚Äôt need to bring all the wires for charging all your Apple products. Would recommend this!
5,Skeptical at first but it works great and is great for traveling without the hassle of a cord.
5,This is perfect for traveling or on the go. I also have a portable charger I use it with and it‚Äôs small enough to use without getting in the way or taking up a ton of room. It‚Äôs very sturdy and good quality product. I love that it has a cap over the USB to keep it covered when not using and it‚Äôs attached. When traveling you won‚Äôt lose the cap since it‚Äôs attached. I‚Äôm able to plug it right into my car my computer and my portable charger with no issues.
5,This is the easiest way to carry a charger for your Apple Watch. I used to worry or have to take the home charger with me when we traveled now I can charge in my vehicle if needed. It‚Äôs so convenient. Absolutely lie my portable charger.
5,After my cat chewing up my cord multiple times I found this and problem solved! It has worked great and seems to charge quickly.
5,Exactly what was needed to charge tge watch. Works well and packs small.
5,Best purchase. I hate charging my watch with anything else now. It sits perfectly on an outlet. Perfect for travel. See photo for reference on size.
5,I keep this plugged into my wall and at night set my watch on it. It‚Äôs very convenient.
2,Once my watch has charged i have to reset it each time because my screen gets zoomed in. I know this is a charger issue due to the fact that I‚Äôve used a different charger and I don‚Äôt have this issue.
5,I love this charger because it fits easily in my purse. It also charges my watch fairly quick.
5,Purchased so I could have a compact travelcharger. Works perfect and stays in my suitcase soI never have to worry if I remembered topack or not.
5,Works wonderfully! Definitely a must have if you own a watch.
3,Product came fast but made poorly fell apart not useable junk
5,I used to use a cable watch charge and carry it to everywhere it is extremely cluster and inconvenient. what a amazing product I have now. small device and easy to carry. I recommend this one to everyone.
5,Perfect to keep in you purse or pocket when traveling to keep that Apple watch charged!
4,Easy to take on trips but takes longer to charge than expected.
4,The design is great. I like that I don‚Äôt have to unplug my watch charger from the wall when I travel. It didn‚Äôt charge my watch fully from a pocket charger. I‚Äôm guessing it might have been the battery source and not this device.
5,Love the compact size.  I usually keep this at a friend‚Äôs for weekend stays but can easily stash it in my pocket or purse if needed elsewhere or for traveling.  Very satisfied.  No regrets üòäüëçüèΩ
2,It charges incredibly slow. For a full charge it takes about 2 1/2 hours.
5,This comes in handy in times when I forget to charge my Apple Watch at home. I‚Äôve got it plugged into my computer at work and I just pe my watch on there and let it charge while I‚Äôm in the office.
5,Have yet to use out. Will follow up. But is easy to charge iwatch.Follow up:My iwatch charger does not work when completely charged and going out.It only works when plugged in an outlet.  I‚Äôve tried it three times.I am going to order another type. Just FYI.Thanks!
2,Bought this for a trip a month before we left.  Tried to use it and it did not charge any of our watches not even sure if it charged.  By the time we returned from trip return window closed and was unable to send back.  Was a nice pocket size design sad it did not work out.
4,This is nice for traveling although seems not as study as it could be. After a couple of trips with it in a pouch with the rest of my chargers I noticed the face of it is riddled with many hairline cracks. It still works but I wonder for how long. I would not purchase this again if I need another travel watch charger. As I said it works but I doubt I‚Äôd recommend to anyone else.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I‚Äôve tested this item for about a week and love it! I‚Äôve been traveling so it‚Äôs easy to use in your car on the go and small enough to carry and take everywhere. I have a weird charging box to connect multiple cables and this Apple Watch charger has a magnet that is able to hold and charge my watch with no problem. Highly recommended
3,Is really useful
4,Works ok but charges a bit slower than OEM that came with the watch.
5,I keep this in my car.  It is perfect for recharging my watch if I forgot to charge it that morning or previous evening.  Small and no cords to get in the way.
5,Keeps your watch on nicely and charges great
2,I returned it. It was stylish and handy so I am disappointed to have to say it is not worth $10.Charges super slow and gets hot very fast.I spent over $900 on my Apple watch 7 (gold steel +apple care+tax) so I can‚Äôt risk it over this cheap floozy.  I was so into this cute charger that fits everywhere. I wish it had worked!
5,Charges great given you have a good power outlet
5,S√∫per pr√°ctico su espacio lo hace perfecto para llevar donde quiera y carga mi Apple Watch s√∫per r√°pido.
5,I bought this for my car and vacation travel. I found that it doesn‚Äôt work with all charges including car chargers. It comes in handy when you didn‚Äôt charge you watch the night before or to take up less space when packing for vacation. Totally worth it to make your life easier =)
5,Love this handy charger.  Makes charging watch so easy and convenient.  Bought several to give away after buying and using one for myself!
4,It is very convenient! It gets very hot though so that worries me.
5,I just have this for the days I go to work and have forgotten to charge my watch. I plug it into my laptop and it charges it pretty quickly. Good quality. Especially for the price.
3,I bought this to give my apple watch a boost during the workday otherwise it dies before bedtime. This serves its purpose. It doesn't necessarily save any space but it's easy to identify in my tech bag with other cables and adapters. My major complaints are that it seems to charge more slowly than my regular cable and it gets very warm even hot during use.
5,Love how small and compact it is can use with any charging block since it is USB makes it easy o charge my watch.
5,This thing does what it says. It charges an Apple Watch. It‚Äôs small so it‚Äôs great for travel. It‚Äôs sturdy too. I dropped it in my dogs water dish right after getting it (on accident - please don‚Äôt do this) and it still works perfectly. I‚Äôm impressed.
5,
5,Great addition to my travel laptop bag charge my watch without carrying a bulk charger with a long cord.
5,Very happy with this purchase. It makes it very easy for me to keep my watch charged. I love not having to deal with a cord.
5,After my Apple Watch battery starting dying before the end of the day I purchased this charger to keep in my purse. Does the trick perfectly!
5,Great chargers!
4,Works great. Very handy when traveling
3,Useful since it plugs in much easier than the long cords from Apple.  Much slower than the Apple charger.
5,It‚Äôs just perfect
2,The first 2 months it worked perfectly. It was awesome not having to deal with the cord. One morning I grabbed my watch and it was HOT. And the battery was dead. Thought it was odd so I moved the charger to a different outlet for an hour. Still my watch was not charged and device was obviously not working. Can‚Äôt return it. Waste of money.
5,This charger is great for traveling because there is no long cord. The watch can rest right on it while it is plugged into the wall (with a USB adapter).
4,It kinda took to long for a complete charge
4,Nice little gadget !Good for back up !
5,Instead of having to remember to take my home charger for the Apple Watch every time I go away this has been great! Just keep it in my travel bag and I‚Äôm set to go!
5,I purchased it again after I couldn't find my other one.  I spent a long time reviewing similar items and to be honest it's the least expensive and definitly is reliable.  I sometimes forget to charge my Apple watch overnight and out the door I go with a dead watch.  I can plug it in to USB port in my car and my watch is charged.
5,I have used this twice for travel and it was great. Small and compact and no wires. It is versatile so you can use it with virtually any plug.When I am not using it my BF keeps it in his truck so he can charge his watch while working.
5,I love this thing for when I travel. Its so much more convenient than wrapping up and unknotting another cord charger. Fits great plugged in on the side of my laptop sticks out far enough so my watch doesn't interfere with anything while charging. Also does fine plugged into a standard brick adapter plugged into the wall. Even works plugged into the charging ports on the desk lamps at hotels. Big fan of this thing.
5,Love it. Super compact for travel And to just have in your purse/bag in case your Apple Watch dies
5,Makes charging easy when traveling!
5,Just received the Black one that I ordered today and trying it out. Will update review after testing the charger for about a week.Update.......12/23/2020Seems like I have no issues with item or my watch heat up extremely hot. Does take  about 2.5 hours to fully charge when watch battery is around 10-20%. Item exceeds my expectations and hopefully doesn‚Äôt crap out once return window/ warranty on item run out. If so I will re update this review. Hope this review helps makes you decide.
5,This is the perfect small easily stored solution to charging your iwatch. Instead of all the cords we need for all of our electronics use this small plug to charge your iwatch
5,I love how streamline this product is however it doesn‚Äôt charge very well or sometimes at all! Not really worth the money.
4,It gets a little hot but it works great
3,Doesn‚Äôt charge very well and takes long to even hit 80%
3,When it stays connected it charges as expected.  Somehow someway the magnets get tired and decide to take a break and not hold on anymore.  Bad unit...possibly not worth the hassle to figure it out.
4,Great for traveling.  Does what it‚Äôs supposed to do.  The magnet doesn‚Äôt always align and charge but a little wiggle to the watch and it will begin charging.  For the price I think it‚Äôs a great purchase.
5,Se los recomiendo al 100% es muy buena encargar donde t√∫ lo quieras poner
5,Perfect for when you forget to charge or bring charger on vacay. Very convenient.
4,Quit working after 2nd charge. Company notified me and has corrected this with me and has switch manufacturers! Great customer service!
5,I bought this just to travel but I probably used it everyday day if I could. If you have a hotel room that has a build in usb outlets this is perfect. You just plug it in sit your watch on top and it charges your Apple Watch. It‚Äôs that easy. Don‚Äôt have to worry about cords or anything.
5,LOVE NOT HAVING A CORD LAYING AROUND
5,This charger is great for travel. I love being able to charge my watch on my laptop without a cord.
3,When plugged in it tune hot.
2,This thing is sooo slow to charge and it gets really hot when you use it. I've also only used it once and its already starting to fall apart.
5,This is darn handy!! I keep this in my travel-charger bag and it is so handy to have. It doesn‚Äôt take up much space so it is awesome to travel with‚Äîjust plug into any usb a plug and use. I‚Äôve used it in my car in a hotel home all over and I love it!!
5,I bought this to carry in my purse because I didn‚Äôt want a long cord to deal with.  I was worried about using it in my car as it is very tight in the console and has to go sideways. The magnet is strong enough to hold my watch on driving down the road even with pot holes. I have also used with my computer. The charger worked both places.
5,So happy to find this compact little charger for my watch. I travel quite a bit and love how small this is! I am able to toss it in my purse. I‚Äôve used it already at a few hotels and works well in the usb chargers in the hotel alarm clocks or lamps. A must for traveling if you have an Apple Watch.
3,Fine in a pinch if you use a computer with a USB port that is easily accessible.  Slow charging though!
4,I didn‚Äôt think this charger worked at 1st but after a couple tries I finally got it to work. It charges a little slow but it gets the job done after a few hours.
5,Works great. Very convenient. You must have this plugged into a USB port for this to work.
5,Used to charge my Apple Watch
4,Good charger.Only thing I have noticed - it only charges my watch to 85% and no further.
4,I got this just for travel and it works well. My only complaint is the orientation of the device makes it diffiicult to balance the watch so that it gets charged. It needs to be able to rotate while so that the face is horizontal regardless of the USB port orientation. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.
1,I only tried out this charger for the price. The slow charge was mentioned in several other reviews but it was even worse than I thought. PLUS the charger itself became very warm even hot while charging which to me screams safety hazard. It basically that took more than 2 hours each time to get from 10-15% to 75% of charge that was not particularly helpful.Save yourself the disappointment and just get an MFI-certified charger.
5,I purchased this to charge my Apple Watch because sometimes the cord length of my travel one was too short to place on a flat surface in some hotels.  Love this.  It even charged vertically when plugged into the nightstand alarm clock at the hotel.
4,While it doesn't charge as fast as the cable chargers this does the trick when you need absolutely needed.
5,Auto
5,I love it I keep it on my key Chain
5,Compact and user friendly
5,Nice & compact. Fits in my purse and is great for quick charging my watch when I am away from home all day need more battery life.
5,I absolutely love this product fast charging and space saver
5,Small and efficient no need for extra cordsLove it
5,This comes in very handy. I keep it in my pocketbook in case my watch dies during the day. I try not to charge it until it is completely dead. With this I can leave my regular charger at home and can use this in my car or at work to charge my watch and not have to worry about keeping up with my big charging cord.
5,Great product. I ended up purchasing a few. Great for travel or just sitting at your desk.
5,Gave several of these as holiday gifts
5,Great tool for the watch if you are on the road
5,This is so handy and I liked it so well that I gave it to all of my grandchildren and children that had an IWatch
5,I was getting tired of lugging the long cord with me. With this guy he fits great in my travel bag and I don‚Äôt have to worry about that ONE watch charger. Worked great charged at a great speed I‚Äôd recommend getting one.
5,I have two of these. One in my truck and the other at my office. Gives me a quick charge and nice for traveling
5,I like this product because it‚Äôs easy to use.
5,Great form factor and working well.
3,I typically forget to charge my Apple Watch so this fits perfectly in my car for on the go charging. It does charge pretty slow so don‚Äôt expect the same charging speed as you would get with the actual apple charger.
1,Some of the reviews were a red flag but this product looked better than the others and I hoped my experience would be different.  Unfortunately the  charger originally shipped did not work and I returned it for a replacement.  But the replacement did not fare any better.  Both chargers did not charge watch at all -  even after 12 hours.  In fact they seemed to drain power and created such heat that I think it is a fire hazard.  I tried the device with different charging blocks made by Apple and other manufacturers with same result -- no charge and extreme heat.  My watch got so hot I was concerned it might be permanently damaged.  Thankfully it still works and charges quickly with the original Apple charging cord.  I can get a full charge in about 2-3 hrs. I hate having to travel with the long corded charger and this product appeared to offer an alternative.  Regrettably this product is not the answer.  The only good thing I can say is that they were quick in sending me a replacement and ultimately a full refund but I wasted a lot of time trying this out.  Hopefully you don't have to waste yours.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The video says it all. Absolutely worth the price!
5,I bought this item back in august and it still works like day 1. Works very well.
3,When this charger arrived I thought it was a super cute idea. It‚Äôs compact and plugs directly into a USB adapter. I wish I had used it before the return window ended. I‚Äôm traveling and used it and it was charging for about 7 hours and was only at 81%! It was at 25% when I charged it. I mean - I can still get by on 81% but that‚Äôs a long time to not have a full charge. If they changed that this would be the perfect charger. Love that there‚Äôs no wire!
5,This watch charger is compact and fits in my purse or laptop case.  No more frustration with a dead watch battery at work.
5,I've used it multiple times since receiving it (July 5 2021) and have been pleasantly surprised.  Neither the unit nor the watch have gotten hot and the watch has fully charged each time.I anticipate using this in lieu of the Anker unit.  I recommend this Newdery Apple Watch charger.
3,It‚Äôs small convenient‚Äîbut slow to charge & a little cumbersome to balance your watch atop while it‚Äôs plugged into a USB port in your car or on your computer. You may need to jimmy something together to get your watch to maintain the magnetic hold and fully connect/charge. It‚Äôs also slow to charge. Smaller and more compact than carrying the charging wire everywhere you go though.
5,This charger has come in so handy! Easy to store and so convenient when needed!! Highly recommend!!
5,This is a sweet little charger! It seems sturdy and as tiny as a keychain. Just plug it in to a USB port on a plug or computer and you‚Äôre good to go. No more long cords to untangle. And no more watch dying on me with nothing in hand to charge it with. Worth every penny. I‚Äôm a transport nurse - I try on my watch at all times and never know how long my shift will be. Having something this small available and easy to carry is amazing.
5,Exactly what I hoped it would be. Use on my laptop. Super compact. The leather loop is not sturdy though or well made. But I love it
1,It charged my watch 10% the entire night when we went camping.  Should have tried it when I received it and not waited. Got another one for a friend coz she likes the size.  Hers doesn‚Äôt work either when I asked her to try it. Too late to return so I threw it in the trash.
5,It‚Äôs so cute and works great!
5,Sleek and sturdy.  Love that there is no cord to tangle or break.  Love the ingenious cap that double to support the charger from drooping or pulling out when plugged in.
5,I have my original Apple Watch charger rolled up in a charging stand on my bedside table and it is a pain to take it out every time I travel so I needed something easier. This I just keep on my keychain and have it whenever my watch needs charged it has come in handy so many times already!
5,Does the job - I plug it in at my desk for when I forget to charge at night
5,This is great for traveling or just for a second charger.  It‚Äôs small like a thumb drive so it can fit in your purse pocket or bag without  all the bulky wires.  Good purchase.
4,Like the convenience of this thing. Is a little bit shorter than expected. Bought it as a charger for my truck. Looks ok works well.
5,This little number is great. Small portable & a life saver. I often have to stay with my elderly parents for weeks at a time. I try to keep chargers in both homes but somehow mange to often be without. This little number is a game changer. Always prepared!
3,It got my watch hot while charging.
3,This little charger was exactly like I was wanting just beware that the magnet doesn‚Äôt seem as strong but my Apple charger.
5,Works great  easy to travel with.  Much cheaper and better than those advertised on Social Media.  If you have an iWatch and hate the long cord this is definitely the answer.
2,Great and compact for traveling but it takes way too long to charge my watch. It also gets VERY hot and makes my watch very warm. I no longer use it and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. Just buy a cord to save yourself the hassle
3,When I plugged it into my wall charger it wouldn‚Äôt do anything. I plugged it into my computer & my watch kept chiming every minute or so like it does when you first start to charge it. But it works fine in the car charger and my portable power pack which is where I plan to use it most. Just aggravating. But I needed one quickly so don‚Äôt have time to return it & try others.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†So easy to take on the . One of the best items that I have purchased .
5,I love this item! Great for on the go
2,This charger takes forever to charge my watch. If I use the apple charger it charges quickly but this takes half a day.
5,This is an easily portable sturdy charger. It has a strong magnet and can even hold my Apple Watch vertically like when it‚Äôs plugged into my car USB port. It charges relatively quickly as well. I‚Äôm buying another one.
4,So far so good.  I've only had this charger for a couple of days but tried it out as soon as I received it.  It's very portable and works so far.  It will be nice to use for travel and not have to take an extra charging cord as it plugs right in to usb adapter or computer
5,Works great‚Ä¶ use it by my bed‚Ä¶ or by my recliner‚Ä¶ even in the car!!!
5,Works perfectly for the iWatch.  Can be installed into a USB port in either direction.  You can use the cover to hold the watch vertically.
3,Everything seems ok about this except it charges probably around half the speed the original charging cable I got with my witch does. I probably would not buy this again unless they solve that issue.
5,I bought this item a month ago for my trip overseas. I love having something so compact and not having to worry about another wire. I used it with my anker portable charger and was able to continuously charge my Apple Watch
3,It heats up to the pont of hot to touch
2,Charging is ok traveling is great
5,I love this Apple Watch charger. Small enough to keep in my purse and travel with. I won‚Äôt ever be caught without a way to charge my watch again. Definitely recommend as a spare.
5,Works as advertised.
5,Great for traveling. Tucks easily into a "safe space" for packing purposes. Charges quickly. Bought another for a gift.
5,Convenient
5,Best purchase I‚Äôve made in a while. So easy to throw in your bag and go. It holds my watch perfectly whether it‚Äôs plugged into the wall or a computer. It‚Äôs very sturdy.
5,This definitely comes in hand when I for get to put my watch on the charger.
5,I love this item for traveling. It didn‚Äôt take up much space and keeps me from having so many cords to deal with. Worked great.
5,I was skeptical at first but I absolutely love this charger! It‚Äôs great to just plug into my laptop and works perfectly in a regular outlet. Also super cute!! I‚Äôve had it for a couple months and no problems!
3,I won‚Äôt be using this until my next trip. I‚Äôm sure it will work fine
3,Not very reliable. Won‚Äôt charge completely as I travel only used once or twice and I just put it up
3,Works in a pinch but doesn‚Äôt charge quickly. I use this as my backup
5,I‚Äôm not sure why I didn‚Äôt purchase this sooner. It‚Äôs so nice to have your watch charging anywhere you go without having to carry a long cable or bulky charger. I pop it in my backpack everywhere I go. Great for the car as well.
5,Very handy great for travel
5,Great as a gift
5,I'm in love with the fact that you can connected at work  in the car your laptop. Its so small and not bulky to carry it  no need of a cable getting tangled with your car keys inside your purse
3,Wouldn‚Äôt connect and charge my watch. Nice idea but didn‚Äôt work
5,I see a lot of negative reviews from dummies claiming this won‚Äôt hold the Apple Watch while in the upward position they‚Äôre wrong see enclosed photos. I use this charger more than I use the original this is a great little device.
5,Love that i can charge it in my truck without the extra wire!
5,Love it perfect for charging in the car or at the office and great to take on vacation.
4,Great portable Apple Watch charger. My only complaint is that the rubber cover for the end of the usb plug isn‚Äôt solid so it doesn‚Äôt actually protect or prevent damages to the plug.
3,Not super user friendly bought fir my traveling friend bday I do not need it I do not travel much. It is good if u plug in a USB port but not next if u are home.
5,üëç
2,I was very excited about this charger. I planned to keep it in my car so I could charge my watch during my commute to and from work. Over my hour long commute it never charged my watch more than a few percentage points. I noticed that it kept disconnecting and reconnecting throughout my drive and I assumed it was because it was sliding off the charger as I drove around but I tried using this at home In several different USB ports and have the same issue. It also makes my watch very hot (I guess from constantly connecting and disconnecting) and I‚Äôm worried it will damage my watch if I keep trying to use it. The idea of the product sounds better than the actual product ended up being.
5,Great for the car
5,It works i just thought it could charge my phone when the USB is not connected i thought i could charge it before my trip and just get my iwatch charged. But i have to connect the USB and out my watch at the same time its charging the USB
5,Only thing is that if your outlets aren‚Äôt vertical then this probably wouldn‚Äôt work.
5,Does what it‚Äôs supposed to do! I take my iWatch off at night when I brush my teeth and let it charge in the bathroom overnight. It‚Äôs ready to go in the morning!
5,This is so convenient. I plug it in to my computer and my AppleWatch is charged in less than an hr
5,easy carry in my purse to charge my watch!
3,The product works well in a pinch however the magnet doesn‚Äôt attach well to the watch so you have to play with it to make sure that it‚Äôs charging. Much slower charging speed compared to oem
5,Amazing addition to my traveling! Makes charging my watch on the go easy and quick. Sturdy and small design makes it very convenient.
5,I like this for charging my watch on the drive home from work.
5,quick charging.. holds watch secure.  defo recommend
5,I have had no issues with this product. It charges an Apple Watch series 3 and series 6 with no issues. Works great for travel
5,One less cable to bring on trip for charging an Apple Watch. This charger works as expected.
5,Impressive build quality and attractive design. Has a weight and sturdy feel that surprised me. The rubbery stretchy cap that also doubles as a stand in vertical orientation is clever and works well. In my opinion this is more convenient to carry around than a cable version of the watch charger. And I love the convenience of just plugging this into my laptop and having my watch charging within easy reach without the unruly tangle of a cable.
5,Works as expected. Didn‚Äôt charge my watch any faster than a regular charger. Comes in handy if you travel and forget to pack the charger. Luckily i put it on my key chain so I will always have it.
1,Didn‚Äôt work at all. Was completely defective. I guess you get what you pay for. I see others liked it maybe I would have too if it worked. You will take a gamble on it. Sent back.
5,Well made great size for traveling and works great. I don‚Äôt know what else you need to know.
5,This charge is awesome to carry around. It charges quickly. 10/10 would buy again.
3,Charger is practical but gets too hot while in use.
5,Had a problem with my old charger and bought this charger online.  It‚Äôs so easy to carry around without the issue of cable tangling around in my purse.  It‚Äôs been working great so far!
4,This is great charger for when you‚Äôre in a pinch. I throw it in my bag for the days that I forget to charge my watch. It does make my watch very hot so I try not to use it often
5,Its compact. Small. It works. Have no complaints so far and ive had it for some months.pull the trigger.
5,Like that it‚Äôs easy to carry slightly bigger than a old flash drive.  Got one fir  my car and home.
3,Bought this in the impression that I would be able to charge my Apple Watch in the car but it takes for ever to charge and after 15 mins it begins to heat up. The magnet is just like the original charger which is great and the design is really nice too! But once again practicality is what are the cons here.
1,I was super excited for this since I travel a lot and hate having a million cords with me. I think the one I got was faulty because it wont charge my watch at all.
1,It acted like it was charging (green lightning bolt on Apple Watch face) but it never actually increased battery percentage. Wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle I‚Äôll have to buy an Apple charger.
3,very good for traveling but takes much more time to charge the watch
5,Easy to use and available any time I need it
5,I love this charger! It fits into a socket out of the way the watch fits snuggly on the charger and the best part NO CORDS!!! Hallelujah!!
5,It is good
5,I used to be reluctant to travel with my Apple Watch because I didn't want to pack the super long cord cube etc.  This solves the problem.  I've only used it a couple times so I can't speak to its durability over the long term but so far it's been fantastic.  Also it's designed well and I've had friends order themselves the charger after they took a close look at mine.  Highly recommend.
5,This charger is amazing. Very easy to use and is fast charging my watch charged from 60% to 100% in 45 minutes  to an hour. I can use any charging block with it as well.
5,This product is so simple and easy to use! It‚Äôs perfect for travel as advertised!
3,This is very convenient for traveling but it does not charge the watch very fast.  It takes at least overnight to fully charge.
1,I was very excited about this item but it never worked.  I would charge it for days and it would charge my watch for 3 minutes.
5,Just what I needed in my office. Works great for travel as well. No more messy cords to untangle or worry about. I highly recommend it.
5,Works fine
5,This thing is so small it‚Äôs easy to pack.  Used it on my trip to Hawaii.
5,My order was fulfilled quickly and this item charges my apple watch as advertised. I ordered a second to keep in my car.
5,Works exactly as it‚Äôs supposed too. I use this little charger while traveling and I keep one in my backpack in case I need to charge my Apple Watch while I‚Äôm at work. It‚Äôs great.
5,I bought this for my desk at work and it is perfectly sized to be out of the way. I love not having a cord to mess with. It charges my watch just fine. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it.
4,Love the convenience of this charger. It‚Äôs a great size for everyday use in your purse or backpack. My only complaint is it charges VERY slow. I‚Äôm still glad I bought it it fits my needs.
5,I got this to take with me in our camper that has built in usb plugs.  My Watch sits on top and charges great.  Very handy
4,Great for travel and when your watch is in need of a quick charge.
1,I like the look of the item. I dislike the performance because the Apple Watch does not get charged when using this product.
5,I love that I can just set my watch on top of the charger at night whereas with the cord it always seemed to get in the way
5,Great for my office and traveling. easy to use and store. Recommend as a value item to charge your Apple Watch. We now have multiples - great price!
5,This is perfect for travel. I just leave it in my travel bag when I go on business trips. Works very well
5,So far I really like this product. I haven used it constantly though but it seems it be very easy and convenient!
4,I absolutely love the convenience of this nifty gadget. Definitely purchasing more!
5,Very good product work well value for your money good good
5,I use it by attaching to laptop. it charges just as good as a typical charger.
5,This this is amazing. I am able to keep it in my purse and even use it on my portable charging bank. Definitely worth the purchase especially if you wear your watch 24/7
1,This charger worked great for a couple months but is now dead and won't charge my watch at all.  Used it in the car and the magnet isn't strong enough to hold the watch on.  Have to make sure it sits completely flat and watch still falls off most of the time.
5,Works great! Great for travel!
5,Worth the money
5,For a pinch on the go it‚Äôs great in the car charging
1,Bit of a slow charger and overheated a lot. Makes sense when it failed after around 5 charges.
5,Such a clutch and compact charger for my watch. I am always using it because I like to use my watch while I sleep to track my sleep. One thing though the charger is extremely slow. Would be nice to have a solid 100% charge in an hour instead of 3. Besides that it is an amazing very useful charger. It helps get it up 10-30% so I can make it back home to charge it.
4,It charges the watch but the watch easily comes detached. It could use a stronger magnet. Depending on the orientation of the usb plug it might be worthless.
5,I have been looking for a different solution for charging my Apple Watch while traveling. I tried to be a very light traveler and this is by far the best solution I found for having a watch charger in my kit. It seems to charge the watch quickly.  The lack of a cord in this design has not been an issue with using it and has helped reduce the number of cords I‚Äôm carrying.
5,I always forget my watch charger so I ordered this and I love it it‚Äôs small and it plugs right into the plug in your phone sits right on it
5,like the fact charges just as fast as the Apple charger in my opinion. Plus easy to travel with can even charge in the car. Would recommend to anybody for secondary charger works great.
2,I like this product but if they could only make the USB plug twist 180¬∞ it would be much more useful.
5,THE best portable watch charger I have tried. My watch charger that it came with is inside a stand that I don‚Äôt want to disconnect so I bought this for traveling and it‚Äôs perfect.  Very strong magnet.
3,Very slow charger. Compact with no cord so it is somewhat convenient. However its slow charging speed makes it pretty useless.
5,Producto de uso vers√°til. Carga excelentemente. Buen dise√±o
3,Plugs into the car just fine but the watch gets very hot when you go to put it back on. Not sure if that‚Äôs normal.
4,N/A
5,Great price. Very compact size. Ease of use.
5,This was a great buy! I definitely enjoy being able to charge my watch in the car as well! Would definitely recommend and I would definitely buy again!
5,So convenient I can keep it in my purse for those nights I forget to charge my watch
5,This wireless charging is really convenient small and exquisite easy to carry and beautiful in appearance. It is great to take on a trip and the quality is also very good. It does not take up any space in the bag. It is very good and I like it!
5,This charger works wonderfully! It‚Äôs not a super strong magnet but it is strong enough that you won‚Äôt have to worry about it falling off. It‚Äôs super convenient to travel with and the best part is not having to worry about a cord! This thing is a fantastic deal.
5,Works just like a normal watch charger. I didn‚Äôt pay attention on how long it took to charge bc I left my dead watch on it. But it did fully charge.
5,Perfect for laptop or traveling- I got it for my mom who travels often. She loves that she doesn‚Äôt have to keep unplugging the one that came with the watch!
1,I am not impressed with this charger. My Apple Watch got EXTREMELY hot after charging my watch for 30 minutes I think it damaged the battery in my watch because now it doesn‚Äôt hold a charge like it used to. Do not buy this product!!!!
5,Easy to use and travel with
5,Perfect just what I needed for my Apple Watch ES traveling and re-charge while driving or out and about excellent solution when you have to charge it on the go...
5,Great little travel charger. It‚Äôs good quality. Works great. Quick charge. Great for travel. I keep it in my purse all the time. Easy to charge in your car.
5,This little product is actually very useful.Instead of coiling cords I use my power bank (which has a USB connector) or a wall charger & this watch charger works perfectly.I‚Äôve had it over a month now & it‚Äôs been working very well for me.
3,It doesn‚Äôt seem to consistently charge my watch.
1,I taught it was a battery pack but it‚Äôs not you have to plug it into a port for it to charge the watch.
5,This product is so convenient. It travels well and charges fast! It‚Äôs perfect!
5,I recently ordered this Apple Watch charger to put in my camper for traveling. I was pleasantly surprised! It‚Äôs a great little charger!!
3,Carga muy lento pero para emergencias est√° bien
5,I bought this as a gift for my husband for travel. He‚Äôs liked it so far.
5,more magnetic? when in car doesn‚Äôt seem to hold and use care to be level.
5,This little charger is perfect foe travel.  I just leaving it in my bag with my travel accessories and it is alway ready to go.
5,I love this charger!
5,Great product for traveling definitely I would buy it again. It doesn‚Äôt take much space. I don‚Äôt have to deal with more cables. Just plug it and charge it.
1,This product gets overheated super fast and it took more than 2 hours to only get from 5% battery to 40%
5,This is so handy! I clip it to my lanyard with my badge & keys for work. Serves its purpose perfectly and is very easy to use.
5,It great to charge your watch on your computer wall or from a portable charger/bank. IT IS NOT A PORTABLE CHARGER/BANK so it doesn‚Äôt hold charge. Others than that works fine
5,Like that if I‚Äôm on the go I can easily change my watch if I need to without having the long cord  Good for traveling
2,Thought it was going to charge wireless but it did not.It charges only when plugged just w/o a cord attached.
1,This charger when I received it looked great. When I placed my watch on it to charge it appeared to start to charge. After ten mins I went back to look at my phone and my watch locked up and never charged. After letting my watch sit off the charger for a while it seemed to correct it‚Äôs self. I was nervous to try to charge my watch again adroit would mess my watch up permanently.
5,Works the way it's designed to work out of the way
1,Have two of these and neither work they sent me to duds but still charged me for products I can‚Äôt even use
1,The product either doesn‚Äôt work or charges at the slowest rate ever. Have yet to get a decent charge from the device.
5,Charger Works well charges fast do recommend
5,Compact and functional
3,I was really excited to get this to replace my current one from apple on my desk because I was tired of dealing with another wire hanging from the desk. I got this for my Apple Watch series 5 and was disappointed when I had to wait for almost 4 hours for it to fully charge the watch.
5,Small and versatile. Ideal for travel and so easy to use! I love the color options too. Great product!
5,I purchased this to charge my iWatch when traveling or at the office.  It works great!!!
5,parctical
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†See video: starts charging. Stops charging. Starts again. Same loop over and over.Update: this charger has stopped working completely. When I use it my watch will charge for about 1 second disconnect and begin charging again. This causes my watch battery to drain instead of charge. Just to confirm when I connect to an official Apple Watch charger my watch charges as normal - so I can confirm it‚Äôs the charger and not my watch. I‚Äôve also tried plugging it into different USB ports to ensure that the port was not this issue either. This charger was a waste of money.I've plugged this into multiple types of charging blocks and ports and this charger takes 2-3 times longer to charge my watch than if I use my original cable from Apple. I love the portability of this charger but this slow charging time kills the usefulness for me.
5,This is great for traveling.
5,It worked for about a week. Now it will not charge my Apple Watch.
5,Amazing! I am always on the go and this is amazing for my constant back and forth travels in my Jeep. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 5/5 recommended
5,Small and compact easy to use usb plug and charge - throw it in your work bag or purse for a longer day -
5,This is a little gem! Take this on a trip or just have it in your purse to charge your watch it‚Äôs great small and sturdy.
5,Product issues have been fixed. The manufacturer was responsive in issuing a refund and sending a new one. Works great.
5,I love this charger it‚Äôs so convenient no more long cords hanging! It‚Äôs perfect!
5,Love this portable watch wireless charger! Great for traveling camping or if you misplace your Apple watch charger!
3,Keeps lagging on the last 7% of 100%. Heats up when ever you use it. It does it‚Äôs job really well until it reaches 93%.
5,Fits nicely to the side of my laptop so I can charge my watch and it doesn‚Äôt get in the way.
5,I love it
3,Charges fine it just gets really hot. Update got a new one it less hot
5,I carry this charger in my purse and use it anytime I need to charge my Apple watch.  It charges my watch very quickly!
2,This is for an Apple Watch and is intended to plug into a computer (or other USB A plug)  So it comes with a USB-A connector that can't even plug into any Apple computer made since 2016 or so. They are now all USB-C only...so why the ancient USB-A here? I guess I didn't read it well enough to realize that the connection wasn't to charge the device's internal battery like a lot of others...which then allows you to charge the watch without being plugged in. However this has to be connected to an outlet..that makes is really a dumb device...may as well just use the superior charging cable included with the Apple Watch to start with.  Dumb product iMO YMMV.
1,Got really hot. Had to return.
1,It did not charge my smartwatch so it was a wasted purchase.
5,Perfect for tossing in your purse. It has a rubber protector but the rest is bulletproof! Perfect for travel.
2,Noce and compact for travel but stopped working after 7 months.
5,Had a two weeks no issues chargers well seems like it‚Äôs made well and would definitely buy again
5,I used this item for travel.  I love it.  It is so convenient.
1,Crappy product. I tried plugging this into the computer and into a wall charger and it didn‚Äôt charge my device on either.
5,I used this for traveling and it was easy and compact.
5,Perfect accessory for travel. Great size and price.
2,It‚Äôs fine in a pinch. But charges super slow. It took forever to charge my watch
2,It takes too long to charge and the watch is extremely hot. I will not be using this product unfortunately I missed the return window.
5,Love this so convenient for traveling so you don't have to bring a million wires and have them tangle.
5,Perfect addition to my traveling connection / on the go
5,Convenient works fast doesn‚Äôt take up any room at all hardly. Love the pink.
1,I was very excited when I received the item but when I tried using it I got very frustrated. My watch wont stay connected on this charger the magnetic is too weak. I hope they improve it with a new model.
5,This is the best for using at work when I forget to place my watch on the charger overnight.
5,Like the quality and quick charge. Feels like ceramic and the magnet holds great even for a sideways placement. Definitely going to get a few more for the family to use. Great for traveling.
5,perfect size for even the smallest purses
5,Easy to add to key chain. Very convenient. Sturdy and affordable
1,I used this product twice. The first time it worked perfectly and charged my watch. I thought it was great and compact for traveling. The second time it didn‚Äôt charge my watch at all and instead overheated to the point where my watch was very hot and uncomfortable to touch. I‚Äôm not risking starting a house fire or ruining my watch for this product.
5,This thing is fantastic. The magnet is so much stronger than the one that came with my watch and it charges really fast
1,I bought this to have a conveniently sized Apple Watch charger when traveling. Although I did not expect this to be a fast charger like the one included with the watch this charger works so slowly it‚Äôs not really worth the effort. Even after leaving it on the charger all night (8-10 hours) it had not even charged more than 10%.
5,works great and nice to bring on the go
5,It is very handy but seems like it might break easily if your not careful when it is plugged in. Be sure to have it plugged into a place where it won't accidently get knocked.
5,Love that you don‚Äôt have to have a cord laying around!
5,Fits easily in my bag and charges my watch very quickly from the USB port on my office computer tower.
4,Exactly as described! Only negative thing I can say is that the 44mm size watch doesn't work as well with the magnet if not laying flat.
5,I love it it‚Äôs absolutely perfect
1,It hardly ever works. It‚Äôs not worth the money.
1,Bought this for traveling and it didn‚Äôt charge my watch at all. Had to go to Walmart to get a new charger so I could use my watch on my trip.
5,Convenient when traveling‚Äîno bulky cord to deal with! Charges quickly!
2,I‚Äôm not sure what to say about this charger but nothing good.when I see wireless I assume it has a battery but no.Its wireless because you plug it directly into power but no wire is involved.Anyway very slow charging and is junk.
5,This USB Charger for Apple Watch is very helpful in my car. Great!!
5,Convenient charger to have when traveling or to have at work works great!
5,Perfect for on the go
1,Pretty certain this travel charger ruined my Apple Watch. I have never had one thing wrong with my watch until I used this travel charger on a trip. My watch started acting strange and ultimately stopped working. I do not recommend! I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing as this was recommended on a social media shopping deals account.
5,This charger is perfect if you are traveling/on the go!
5,Perfect for traveling!!Love it
5,It‚Äôs small but very useful. I keep it in my purse and can charge my watch wherever I go
5,Great for traveling I always forget to bring one (and I have two). Charged very fast off of computer!
5,This is the only way I charge my Apple Watch 6! Perfect in every way!
1,I was received it broken. Never worked.
2,All they have to do is copy the specs of the original one but now they wanted to cut corners and make it cheaper and if you go from 0% to 100% your watch will be a molten lava rock
1,Worked great first charge. Now it charges suuuper slow. And it‚Äôs too small to use as a paper weight. So it‚Äôs just useless
5,Ease of use!  Small and compact!  Fast charging
3,It works but gets hot if you leave it on too long. Great for traveling and the car!!!
1,The description on this item says it is wireless. However not really! I did not see anything in description that says you need be be plugged into a USB-A port while charging the Apple Watch. So you either plug it into a device with a USB-A port and charge your watch while it is plugged in. The other options include plugging into a powered charging block and while plugged in charge your Apple Watch. This only works if it the USB port on the charging block connector is horizontal. Or you can buy a USB-A to USB-A extension cable. I returned this.I would NOT recommend this item. Unless this will work for you.I was expecting the unit to have a rechargeable button battery inside such that you can charge the unit and the just charge your watch on the go.
5,It holds your watch perfectly and charges quickly.
5,Size is super practical. Small to fit anywhere perfect for traveling or to just carry as a back up.
5,It's cheap it's small and it works. Better than lugging a whole cord around.
5,This worked really well with a portable charger which is a plus if you‚Äôre on the move
2,I found it to interfere with other USB items. I connected it to my computer to charge my watch. I also have a wireless mouse and noticed each time I would connect this charger my mouse would act really slow almost as if it had low battery. I would leave it for 30 min and could barely have 10% charge. It‚Äôs good to use when you aren‚Äôt in a hurry and have time to charge
1,I bought this charger while on vacation because I'd forgotten to take my Apple charger with me so I haven't used if frequently.  It's seemed to be charging slowly but in the past week I've finally tested it under varying conditions.Findings: It never charges my 4th gen.Apple watch more than 80% even when charging overnight. (In contrast the Apple charger fully charges it in just a couple hours.) After several hours the additional charge is minimal. It discharged the watch when I plugged the charger directly into the USB port in my car. whether the car was running or not. I imagine that in time I may find additional negative charging situations.On the plus side the charger is small and packable it does usually charge to some degree and it was not very costly. By the time I realized how much it doesn't meet my expectations I'd had the charger too long to return it.
5,It was small and convenient doing the job it was designed for.
5,Its going to be perfect for traveling and it seems sturdy but I will wright a updated review later but I like it for now
5,Can‚Äôt wait to use this for camping trips very compact and without the long cord
5,Bought this for convenience and for inside my vehicle.  Tired of wires all over the place.
5,great for traveling due to its compactness plus it works great to charge your Apple Watch
5,Works great
5,Great for use in car if your Apple Watch dies unexpectedly and of course unexplainable.
2,I really wanted to like this product for its features: slim travel friendly and easy to use. Unfortunately the charge is weak compared to and authentic Apple Watch charger.  I will no longer be using.
5,Love it! Easy to use for the office traveling.
5,Love it
5,The size and convenience is perfect for travel!
5,It‚Äôs a yes. No cord and it can charge in the car or at the office desk.
5,Charges quickly and very compact.
5,Good product
5,As long as you have some type of usb outlet... you‚Äôll always have power one of my best purchases works very well sturdy & compact.
5,Bought one bought another!
1,This thing charged once and the charge lasted about 15 min.  Not worth it
5,Great for traveling and very convenient. Use any USB port to plug in and start charging your Apple Watch.
5,Works great..especially when traveling.
3,Charges yet not magnetic enough.
5,very good handy product charging pretty fast!
5,Great for traveling.
1,FELL APART ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
5,Love this small gadget! Lives in my purse! Can charge anywhere!
5,Easy to use when traveling fits in your pocket I love it
5,Item is much sturdier than the previous version and does not over heat.
5,Easy to use and it is good for traveling.
5,Seems sturdy great compact size.
1,This didn‚Äôt work at all. At all!!  So frustrating!  What a waste of money. Left me without my watch until I could get home. Useless!
1,Does not work for apple watch
1,I would use in a pinch but since it gets hot when charging afraid to use and damage watch.
1,I had planned on taking this on a trip and being able to charge my watch when I am out and about.  I had assumed it was chargeable and then I could use it when needed.  Turns out that is NOT the case.  This thing must be plugged into a power source....like the directions say there should be a socket on a laptop...my iPad doesn't have a usb socket...so ultimately I will have to use a power bank and I think if I use a power bank a charger with a cord would be more useful than having to have this "portable" thing anchored to the power bank or to the little cube that is plugged into the wall.  I plan to get a backup charger like the one that came with the watch.
5,Works awesome compact and easy.
1,This charger is terrible. I've maybe used it 3x (for travel) and it no longer works.  I bought it less than 3 months ago.
5,Easy to use and great for in the car or at work
5,Good
5,This makes it easier to charge at home and on the go
5,It will be super handy for a travel charger for my watch and it actually works.
5,Works great! I like how easy it is to use with computers and saves spaces when traveling!
5,Love it no cord
1,Won‚Äôt charge watch
5,Very clever and convenient r.
1,I was super excited about this but it‚Äôs not charging my Apple Watch 6 series I‚Äôve tried multiple plugs and blocks. Going to return
5,Perfect for work and travels
5,I like the compact travel size
5,Using it for traveling. Very convenient
5,This is great for travel! One less cord and can throw into my purse
1,Would have given it 0 stars if I could have. I never think I‚Äôm going to be the one that gets the dud but it did indeed happen this time.This charger never worked. I don‚Äôt know if it even ever took a charge. I just know it never charged my Apple Watch. So either it didn‚Äôt take/hold a charge or it was unable to transfer the charge to my watch. If I ever get another Apple Watch battery/charger I will get one that has a battery charging light so I‚Äôll at least be able to tell if the thing is charging.Edit: This company contacted me after seeing my negative review and offered me money to remove it. If they had offered me money as reimbursement for the charger that didn‚Äôt work I would have amended my review and said the company attempted to make me whole but that wasn‚Äôt their intention. They just wanted the review removed.
5,Great accessory for your Apple Watch. Keep one in my purse and takes up no room.
5,Very easy to use & great lug into any plug. Works great!
3,Eh it‚Äôs ok. Doesn‚Äôt charge anywhere near as fast as a certified Apple brand charger.
5,Works great nice and small
4,Great if u have a portable charger. You can rest ur watch on top of it while plugged in.
5,Excellent quality and price
1,After using it for 8 months. it is dead quietly.
5,The cost-effective products are much better than the ones I bought in the store and the quality is also very good. My family likes it very much. recommend
5,I use it when I go camping or traveling .I just plug it into the car and we‚Äôre all set charges quick too
2,It takes long to charge and it turns on/off every few seconds.USB is in all the way and nothing is bumping or interfering with it to cause the unsteady charge. I‚Äôve tried it in my car laptop and with a charging block.
1,Bought this to have a backup for my family when we traveled if anyone forgot their charger for their phone.  First use the watch did sit right and never chargedSecond use it charged but seemed much weaker and took far longer to charge was very picky on placement.Last while still plugged we kept hearing a high pitched electric noise that could only be heard by my daughters by the was (college/Highschool age).  The device was warm and seemed to be surging on and off.  I dont know if would have caught fire eventually but either way I wont be using it for expensive apple watches.  Of course this happened outside the return window so Im stuck just throwing it away.
4,Great for traveling. I don‚Äôt like that‚Äôs it‚Äôs cracking from the heat
5,This is the best. Small convenient and no cords!
5,Item as described and perfect for use in my car!!
5,Always forgot to pack my Apple Watch charger so now this stays in my travel bag. Especially nice in modern hotels with USB plus - super simple and charges my watch overnight.
5,Works great in my pc at work and in the car.  :)
5,Works great! I love not having to deal with a cord.
5,Never worked. Customer service is crap! Don‚Äôt waste your money.
5,Great for travel!
5,LOVE this.... perfect for my gaming keyboard AND it‚Äôs easy to unplug and GO!
2,Very convenient but over heats watch when charging
3,Very good for traveling but it gets hot. I would only use for traveling not daily use.
5,This charger is less expensive than the OEM model. It does it's job well. The best feature is the form factor. It's small so it works great as a mobile charger and it fits on my key chain so it doesn't take much space to store.
1,It worked great ONCE. Then it just failed to charge. It drains the battery and gets super hot. I thought it was the watch but when I place it on my own charger it charges just fine. Don‚Äôt waste your time or use at your own risk.
1,After one charge my watch was fried. I put it back on my regular charger and it won‚Äôt work at all.
5,Get one you will not regret it :)
2,Just get the original Apple Watch charger for $13 more ($30 total). This charger looks awesome but it will overheat your watch (as many reviews say) and then kill your battery so you‚Äôre charging your watch every day twice. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was until my new watch arrived and the battery lasted a few days. I‚Äôm returning this charger and I just ordered the original charger in the Apple Store. It‚Äôs a shame because it‚Äôs a great idea but the technology inside is going to destroy your watch battery. Don‚Äôt be cheap like I was. Just get the original changer.
3,Great little compact charger but charging takes twice as long as the charger that came with the watch. The watch also gets hotter than normal on this charger. I have the WiFi version of the Series 5 Apple Watch.
5,Easy to carry
3,Works well but gets very warm when charging.
2,I thought this would be able to charge while traveling  Like portable phone chargers not so. It requires being plugged into USB port all all times to charge. It would be good for an office but not travel
5,So much more convenient while traveling!  One less cord needed.
1,charged it maybe 5% in 5 hours - don‚Äôt waste your money
1,I got it charged it and it‚Äôs never worked.I have tried multiple times but it just doesn‚Äôt work!
1,I was really excited to come across this charger as my watch will often run down on battery before I‚Äôm home for the day. Unfortunately after working a couple times I‚Äôve not been able to get it to charge for months across a variety of USB ports and power sources and it‚Äôs now heading for e-waste. Maybe I just got a dud but cannot recommend based on my experience.
5,Great for traveling or to put in purse or bag
1,I liked the convenience of this but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt not work. It has only fully charged my watch a couple times.
2,Good size durable but sloooow at charging
5,Works good
1,Charger is ineffective. Returned it. Watch was super hot and didn‚Äôt charge even half after 4 hours securely on the charger.
5,Lov Lov this .. charge anywhere
5,Convenient but a little difficult to keep attached to watch.
5,It‚Äôs small and convenient for me. I love it
5,I love it.
1,This charger simply does not work. I‚Äôve tried it with different power blocks and computers and NOTHING. Will be requesting a refund. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
5,I use this at work and plug right into my usb tower.
5,Easy to use and I can take it on the go
3,Takes too long to charge. While convenient it‚Äôs too slow. Would not recommend.
1,Takes too long to charge
5,I love this Apple portable charger..best investment
5,I carry this in my purse because sometimes I forget to charge my watch and this is great for a quick recharge.
1,This charged my watch just fine but there was an alarming ‚Äúimage‚Äù or imprint of some sort covering most of the watch face when I checked it after half an hour that makes me fear it could be damaging my Apple Watch.Not worth risking using it a second time.
5,This is so convenient to travel with. Plugs into a usb. Perfect.
5,Compactable/small
5,Best investment yet! Quick charge and convenient!!
1,I like the size and design but it is very slow to charge and then it just stopped working after a week. Waste of money.
5,So easy to use
5,Easier to use w out the wire.
2,Great idea but has 2 major faults. One as others have said it takes way too long to charge. Two it gets way too hot. I would not leave my watch on it for any extended length of time.I bought it to recharge my phone while I shower. It doesn‚Äôt charge it fast enough to get out of the red zone. Disappointing.
5,I love this! Super convenient!
5,Really useful and good product
5,Great product to charge my Apple Watch while traveling.
5,Very practical and convenient!
1,Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt use the item in time to be able to return it. Now stuck with something that doesn‚Äôt work
2,I was so excited to receive this based on the reviews and it worked like a charm... For the first 3 weeks. Sadly now it doesn't function properly at all. I put my Apple watch on it at 5% and 12 hours later when I checked it it was only at 87% and felt very hot to the touch. Maybe mine was just defective? I don't know. I wish I was still in the return window because I would definitely request one. Buy at your own risk. Take care not to let it overheat and damage your watch.
5,Great for traveling and to keep in purse!
5,Compact size thoughtful design.
5,Love this handy gadget
3,Magnet didn‚Äôt line up right. Would not charge. Didn‚Äôt think to check it before my trip.Update: Newdery reached out with a warranty refund.
3,I thought it was a device that you can charge and store for later use. I just used it at work only if I need a charge up
5,Perfect for our trip
1,All descriptions claim this is a wireless charger. It is not. This is just a shorter wall/USB charger than your regular cord. You still have to plug it into something in order to charge the watch which is completely opposite of what I want. I need a WIRELESS charger. Not a shorter one.
1,This totally fried my iwatch!!!!!! I had it plugged in and I came back an hour later and my watch was SUPER HOT and my watch never turned on again! I‚Äôve tried everything and it‚Äôs totally fried !! Has not turned on since! I‚Äôm so sad! This company should pay for this!!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I waited for this cause I needed a charger for my watch asap. Just got it today and it isn‚Äôt charging in anything. Got hot when I put it in the wall. Placed it on again and still nothing. I just want my watch charged. I‚Äôm not asking for much here. I don‚Äôt even feel like sending it back as Idk when I‚Äôll get a proper one.
5,For traveling etc
1,This charging device kind of concerns me because in the process of charging it overheats my watch then leaves a red ‚Äú!‚Äù with a message saying ‚Äúcellular service can not resume until battery cools down‚Äù. This concerns me that the charging device is overheating my watch battery & will end up damaging the lifespan of the battery in the watch.
1,This charger would not completely charge my watch. It would get warm and simply stop charging. The company sent a replacement after complaining but the replacement was no different. When I inquired again for help. The reply was ‚Äúsorry for your inconvenience ‚Äú.  Very disappointing.
3,Takes too long to change.
5,Perfect for traveling.
5,Love it
5,Great for travel. Works good.
1,It failed. I charged the first day and it was fine. But every day thereafter it only charged 75% then 50% then 25% and yesterday 5%. FAIL. Do not buy this. I would return but I got the charger to travel and left the packaging behind. FAIL.
5,Exactly what I was looking for small I could keep in my purse at all times and it works perfect would definitely recommend to anyone
5,Great product for travel....
1,I had high hopes.  Plugged in my apple charger for my watch and right away the screen lit up with an charging indicator.  Then switched to this product and‚Ä¶nothing‚Ä¶.no indicator on my screen nothing. Waited 10 minutes‚Ä¶still nothing.I don‚Äôt have time to wait to see ‚Äòif‚Äô it‚Äôs working or if I have a defect.  It‚Äôs going back. ‚ÄòTis a shame.
5,Ns
5,Liked the compact design
1,Wouldn‚Äôt charge my watch over night. Cheap junk.
5,Sturdy
1,This charger is not charging my watch. It‚Äôs losing power while on this thing.
5,It's very practical for travel
5,I got this for home cause I don‚Äôt like the long cord to the charger that came with the watch. Loved it so much I got a second one for travel.
5,Perfect size and it charges my watch fast!!!
1,Barely partially charged my SE overnight.  Throwing away because I have no packing
5,Easy to use and good product
5,Me encanto üòçüòçüòç
3,Unit gets hot does not charge well
1,Love the idea of this but the actual product is not good. Very cheap feel the magnet is not strong enough to hold the Watch in place. It charges extremely slowly and my watch gets very hot when using this charger.
1,Returned it. It would not work for traveling as I had hoped.
5,Love this product! Keep it on my keychain for easy access charges my watch quickly and effortlessly without all that cord!
5,This little charger has proven to be an exceptional value for the size and efficiency of this charger.  I can put it in my case and it takes up minimal room.
3,They should tell you that you need to install your own Apple Watch charger in the device to get that feature.
1,It was great for the almost 5 weeks that it worked.
3,Works but it charges SLOW - great if you charge overnight but not if you want it done in an hour like the regular Apple Watch charger.
5,Product is good!
5,Great for the price!
3,It gets to hot when charging my watch.
2,Sometimes I left it on thinking it was charging that night and ended up disappointed in the morning seeing it wasn‚Äôt charged
1,I wanted to love this I really did. I bought it to eliminate the charging cord and have a tidier charging option. The first night I used it my watch was overheated in the morning. Thankfully it cooled down and seems to be working fine but it is not worth risking frying your watch.
1,This charger worked great for the first five days. I am now currently charging my Apple Watch going on 2 1/2 hours and it‚Äôs only 50% charged. It is taking approximately four hours to charge which is totally unacceptable. Waste of money heads up!
5,Great for traveling and very sturdy
5,S√∫per practico
5,
5,I‚Äôve only had this for a couple months an travelled once but it had no issues charging my series 5. Quality seems up to par and well made.
5,For selfuse
5,Handy gadget to have.
5,Convenient and easy to use.
2,Super convenient for traveling and small enough to store anywhere but takes several hours to get a 20% charge.
5,Small convenient and sturdy
1,I got a temp error and the watch got so hot i could barely hold it. Not good at all! I will be returning this and sending back.I will say if this had worked it would have been a great solution usb powered and super portable but it just failed and is worthless.I have a series 1 watch btw. Charges fine on the stock charger.But at your own risk of burning your house down or destroying your watch!
1,When I took my watch off the charger it was VERY HOT to the touch. Did not charge as much as my apple charger in the same amount of time. I won‚Äôt be using it again because it might have caused damage to my watch.
5,Love it works well.
5,Works as advertised
1,Very slow to charge.
5,Works great does get warm
5,Works as described
2,So the magnet does not hold the watch if you have to plug the charger in this way as it shows in the picture. This is the 6 and it does not support the weight. You have to use it where the watch lays flat if you want to use this to charge your watch.
5,Keep this in my purse or car so i always have a charger. perfect travel size!
5,Perfect for travel!
5,Works great and no messy wires!
1,I bought two of these and tried them with multiple different types of wall chargers: 1 amp 0.5 amp apple branded even computer USB. Neither of them worked. One of them would initially give a charging signal on my watch and then immediately stop charging; the other one would keep the charging signal going on the apple watch and the charge on the apple watch would decrease 1-2% over an hour or so. Worst part was that the second one heated up the watch instead of charging it. Not sure what the chances are of getting two defective pieces but I wouldn't trust this product going forward.
1,Update:  Newdery sent me a 2nd one at no charge.  Worked one time then quit working also.Too late to return by the time I got to try it.  Would not charge even when plugged straight to wall outlet.  Sat on charger without gaining any power for several hours.  My watch was so hot it could have almost burned my arm.
5,Nice simple does the job.
1,This product sounds good at first glance but its both useless and non-practical! Its main purpose to charge at least at a decent rate it doesn‚Äôt work at all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ so in my opinion just get a regular cord.
5,I like it
1,This didn't work it just heated up to an unsafe temperature the watch battery never budged a single percent after being on the charger for  3 hours.
5,Works well
1,Cute small easy to throw in your bag. But unfortunately when charging your Apple Watch it gets too hot and doesn‚Äôt charge 100%. I would not recommend
5,Convenient!
2,It feels pretty cheap charges my watch very slowly. The contour of the charger doesn‚Äôt fit the back of the watch well (it‚Äôs not rounded enough) so the charger has to be horizontal so the weight of the watch holds it to the charger.
1,Stopped working after charging one time.
2,Works to charge the watch. I like that I can plug it into my computer or usb in my car. Main problem is that it charges extremely slowly and needs to be on the charger for many hours
1,I thought this was a great idea but extremely disappointed. I charged my watch for four hours only got to 70% and also became hot. I suppose if you planned to charge your watch overnight it would work but I don‚Äôt want to do that. Not worth it to return it but in my opinion not worth buying.
5,Great compact charger.
1,Did not like it threw it away
2,It wasn‚Äôt exactly what I was looking for and it seemed like it took a while for my Apple Watch to charge on this quite long. Also not sure if it‚Äôs great for the battery life either- device would get really hot.
2,Design is nice holds watch well but only giving 2 starts because it made my watch extremely hot so I only use it when I can watch to see if it's charged and can remove it immediately. I wouldn't leave my watch on it again over night.
1,I bought my first charger back in October. It did not charge my watch so I figured it was defective and returned and received a replacement. The replacement also does not work. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CHARGER THAT DOES NOT CHARGE
1,Only charged for a short time and got so hot it crashed my watch!  Don‚Äôt buy!  I‚Äôm in the process of trying to get my watch to work again!
5,I use this for traveling so I don‚Äôt have to take my cord with me. It‚Äôs nice quality and keeps my watch charged.
5,It‚Äôs perfect for a backup charger especially if you don‚Äôt wanna carry a cord with you!! Very practical and great quality. Nicely done
2,Liked the design and stopper at the end.  But it gets to be too hot after charging.
1,This item does not charge the watch unless the USB is plugged in.  This is NOT a portable charger that will charge on the move.  Returned.
2,Nice small convenient however it charges extra slow. It takes hours just to charge a third of the way. I bought 2 for 2 IPhones  series 4/44 watches. My watch was dead and it took forever to start back up with this charge.
1,The charger worked great at first. And still charges now; however it will randomly start and stop charging now during the middle of the night which then makes the screen of the watch light up illuminating the room.
5,Super convenient!
3,Wasn‚Äôt expecting such slow charging Time even from direct wall charger. No less than 3 hours.  Spend more for approved apple charger.
5,Works great
1,No idea what‚Äôs wrong with this thing but it worked once and now I can‚Äôt get it to charge anything again. Pointless waste of money.
1,The idea was great. But sadly it didn‚Äôt work even once for me.
5,Works great
5,Perfect for traveling no cords and compact. Fast charge
1,Because it is constantly coming out of USB port with no help from a human my watch will stop charging and still be dead in the morning. Poor quality.
2,I like that it‚Äôs small for traveling however it does not keep your watch charging for long. I have tried plugging it into different USB ports as well and no luck. I really wanted to use and love this product as it came recommended.
5,Wow! Super convenient and use to charge my iwatch in my bathroom overnight. No cords so is great!
1,Very disappointed!!!  It does not hold a charge (if it charges at all) and the watch gets hot.  Had to buy this when I was out of town ‚Ä¶ sorry but I would not recommend this.
5,Solid Product well-built.
2,It doesn‚Äôt work. It won‚Äôt charge on any outlet. It‚Äôs not worth the money
1,I had one that worked perfectly lost it and so bought another one. Sadly the second one did not work AT ALL. So bummed to have a dead watch for two weeks traveling. :(
1,I bought this less than six weeks ago. Last night it stopped charging my Apple watch. Regular Apple charging cable charges watch fine.
1,Worked great for 2 charges and then it quit working completely
1,I just bought this product June 1st 2021 and at first I loved it and it worked great. I loved the pink color and how small it is to pack for travel but after a month and a half it is not working. It makes the watch super hot and after an hour or more on the charger the battery completely drained. My watch has zero battery and I am worried it damaged it with how hot it got. When I went to return it I noticed I am just past the return date.
2,Product works well if plugged into usb of computer only. I tried several in wall charging hubs without success as well as the usb in my car.
5,Sweet
1,I tried this charger and on the first day my watch was really hot to touch after being plugged in for an hour. Now it won‚Äôt turn on other than the apple logo popping up for a few seconds. Don‚Äôt waste your money!!!
1,mine doesn't work after 6 months. When it was working it would only change a few percent.
1,Thought this would be great and bought it just before a trip. On that trip and it drained the watch and didn't charge it. The watch recognizes it and you can watch the power meter go down. I'll be returning when I get home.Update: was sent a replacement and just recently tried it for the first time on a trip and same issue. Will not charge your watch. It will act like it but you can literally watch it such the power out of the watch.
2,Light weight and easy to travel. Takes a life time to charge and the magnet sometimes has a hard time syncing to charge. You‚Äôll hear it make the sound of it charging a few times that you‚Äôll have to keep repositioning it.
1,I got it for the purpose to charge my watch on my break at work and it didn‚Äôt work at all
1,It worked for a couple days then just stopped working.
1,I got my charger today. That is when I discovered that it has to be plugged in at time of charging. That doesn‚Äôt help me when I‚Äôm out and about and discover my watch power is low. I am not always around a USB port. If that were the case then I could just use my regular wired one. I need some thing that‚Äôs truly portable and can charge when I need it to charge and where I needed to charge.
2,Seems to be a convini√©ndote product but my Apple Watch doesn‚Äôt charge with this. Maybe I got a defective one but my watch will sit on this charger for 1 hr and only charge 5%
1,The concept of this product is great however after using it here and there for about the last 6 weeks I have tossed it out. The reason is because it gets hot and causes the watch to over heat and shut off. It take HOURS to charge and because it‚Äôs so hot you have to wait about 10 mins before you can put it on or it will burn your skin! DON‚ÄôT WASTE YOUR MONEY! It‚Äôs also caused battery damage to my series 3 iwatch. Not worth it!
1,Received it on April 23 2022. Before May 23 it had already stopped charging completely. Extremely disappointed!
5,Great for the car
1,I have tried plugging this thing into every form of USB power and it just will not charge my watch.
5,Love it!  Works great!
2,I like that it‚Äôs portable but it takes too long to charge my iwatch .
1,Update: it now takes over 24 hours to give a full charge. Trash. Do not buy.Bought this to take on a trip. I have two portable battery packs with both of them my watch would stop charging after about two minutes. Once I plugged it into a iPhone cube on a wall outlet it charged fine but it got really hot. it did charge fast but I would not trust it on this overnight since it got so hot. Also the cover it leaves the whole top part exposed why not cover the while thing?
1,Junk. Bought two. 1 worked for two months. The other never worked. Too late to return. Would have been great for purse office traveling.
1,This product seemed to be the answer to all my needs for compact charger for Watch.  However the charger gets so HOT that it‚Äôs obviously not rightI wanted to return it but now its past the return window.  Sits in the drawer. I don‚Äôt trust it not to damage my watch.As an update.  The customer support did contact me and offered to replace or refund my purchase.  The customer service team was professional and prompt. 10/21/2021.
1,Gets very hot when plugged in
1,I regret not trying it right after receiving this. It doesn‚Äôt work. My Apple Watch only got hot sitting on this charger.
1,well I was pretty disappointed as much as you could be for something that‚Äôs less than $10. I‚Äôve used it five or six times and my watch was at 30 to 40% when I placed it on the charger after 6 to 8 hours the highest it charged was 91%. I tried switching out chargers to see if that would help went to an apple 5w to QI 2.0 12w. Didn't make a difference. And it was also very hot regardless of what charger I used. save your money and honestly probably just buy the OEM one.
1,I bought this because it looked easy for travel but it didn‚Äôt charge my phone. Disappointed.
2,I don't know if I got a lemon or what. Other reviews seem to be real good.. However mine takes forever to charge.. I leave it for hours and it charges very sliwly.
2,product would work very very slowly and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt charge at all I had this in my car on an extended USB charger and it wouldn‚Äôt work. not very good
2,When I first received it it worked fine.  Good charge and easy to use.  Stopped working just after the return window ended.  Money wasted.
2,Used it once and after that it didn‚Äôt work
1,I have tried charging my Apple Watch 10 different nights and it only took charge 2 of those nights. When I picked my watch up off of the charger it was hot. The nights my watch didn‚Äôt charge it showed it was connected but the charging percentage never moved the lighting bolt symbol is supposed to be green when charging but it stayed red. I dont know I have a bad unit but if they are all like this don‚Äôt buy one!
1,This charger didn‚Äôt even last 1 week.
5,convenient & portable
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Easy to bring being a portable charger! No need of a long cable to deal with. Charges fast!
1,Doesn't work but didn't realize until after the 30 days...
1,Worked great and was very convenient to keep in my purse but completely stopped working after about 2 months and while I was on vacation and needed it. Disappointing!
2,This is a great concept but terrible product takes forever to charge my watch and doesn‚Äôt work when I try to plug it into a wall plug.
5,What a great product. Love it. Perfect for traveling or office or home charging. Pure genius.
1,Was completely worthless. It actually used up power from my watch. Plugged in to multiple chargers. Battery started at 20%. Hour later 16%. Worthless.
1,Left my watch on the charger all weekend to come home to the screen being popped off due to over heating.
1,Do not buy. Cool concept but this worked for the first 2-3 charges and then stopped charging altogether.
1,Product didn't work would not charge at all no matter what cord/outlet I used.
1,Love the form factor. Love the portability. They even engineered a USB-A male end that can insert either way like USB-C.However this thing takes More than 8 hours to full charge my watch. My first 4 day trip  my watch was never above 50%. It died completely on the 4th day. I left it on all night and 8 hours later it was at 98%.I tried the small apple block the larger iPad block the hotel USB my laptop my travel battery. Nothing made a difference in how fast it could charge.At home my watch (Series 5 - 44mm - Cellular) takes maybe a few hours to charge using the Apple OEM cable and a regular iPhone block.I wish this thing worked.
2,It is easy to use but would get hot super fast. Take long to charge as well. I would only use when emergency.
1,Love how this product looks and the intended use for it but it doesn‚Äôt work as advertised. It won‚Äôt charge my Apple Watch at all. It gets too hot as well. It‚Äôll show it‚Äôs charging but the battery doesn‚Äôt retain any of it. Have no issues with my normal Apple Watch wire so I know my watch isn‚Äôt the issue
1,Waste of time/money. This did not charge my phone. Period. Ended up purchasing an authentic Apple charger.
1,Not only does This item not hold a charge. It‚Äôs literally just a charger that doesn‚Äôt have the convenience of having a cable to place it in a more convenient location. Very misleading. I was excited to have a way to charge my watch in my scrubs at work. To top it off I plugged it in and placed my watch on it and it literally never started charging. Totally worthless!
2,This worked well for a few months and then stopped working completely. Went in the trash.
1,The concept behind this is awesome reality a failure! Bought this thinking it would be super to have a charger to travel with. I left my charger at my daughters house so I had to use this one. I have used it three nights and not once did it charge more than half way even keeping it on through the night to charge. My regular charger chargers my watch fully in an hour.  I can not recommend buying.
1,This is the first time I‚Äôve ever written a review. This thing is actually straight up USELESS. I read some reviews about slow charging but I actually timed it myself and it charged about 1 percent every 10 minutes. Under what circumstances would anyone ever bother with this stupid contraption. My advice take the Apple charger roll it up tightly and make your own makeshift version of this garbage. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be trying next once I return this. Do not buy.
1,Waste of money. Doesn‚Äôt  even work. Buyer beware.
5,I love that this is so compact.  It works.
1,I left it on it all night and it didn‚Äôt charge at all. Definitely returning.
1,This charger is not worth it even tho cheap! It took hours to charge my watch and stopped working after the first week.
1,I liked the design and size so I ordered one to charge my older Apple watch. Nothing. Thought it might be defective ordered a second one. Still nothing. Older watch due for an upgrade replaced with Watch 7 stll neither charger works. Disappointing.
2,Takes hours to get to 50%
1,It will not charge my Apple Watch.
1,when i try to charge it re-starts the charging every 10 seconds and does not even go above 35%. During the  charging process my watch's battery got drained instead. When i used my regular apple watch charger everything was fine. I bought this to use during my vacation but i guess have to return it back!
1,I have tried numerous ways of application apple block USB port in wall or laptop‚Ä¶ nothing works.It keeps draining the battery instead. Will not recommend.
5,Good value for the price.  Nice and compact.  Works like a charm.
1,This would be great for travel if it worked. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt seem to be powerful.
2,Made a mistake on this purchase. Bought two and neither one works.
2,A very slow charger that takes hours more than the original Apple charger to get to a full charge.
5,very small to  put in the bag
1,I thought that if I ‚Äúcharged up‚Äù this device it would hold the charge and I could use it to recharge my watch on the fly‚Ä¶ But no. It will only charge it if it is plugged into a device and charging directly from there.. And only if that particular charging port set in a horizontal position. Not happy but it is what it is. Good enough for the money I guess.
1,Bad product. It over heated my new Iwatch and caused electrical damage. Watch has to be replaced.
1,Very disappointed in this charger I bought two and both only worked about a month.
1,This product heat up my Apple Watch when I connected it to a wall box.
1,Takes too long to charge  and at times charger keeps recycling which is very annoying. I bit the bullet and purchased a name brand one from the watch maker at least I know it is reliable. I was not happy with purchase. Past return date. Forgot to mention I tried charging watch on my computer as well and in a wall unit. Same results‚Ä¶slow to charge and recycle kept happening.
1,This lil gadget literally never charged my watch no matter the outlet or box
1,Return window closed before i used it.  It never worked as wireless and worked for a short period when plugged in.  Took forever too charge.
1,I was looking forward to use this while traveling. However the top broke after first use. Literally snapped off.
1,Horrible unit. Does not work properly after 5 minutes of charging
1,I used this charger twice and then it decided to stop working‚Ä¶..very disappointing.
1,This is a great ideas but the charging part gets extremely hot! Too afraid to let it charge overnight due to extend heat.
1,This is small for traveling sturdy and easy to use.  Too bad it absolutely sucks with regard to its basic function:  charging an Apple Watch.  It takes forever to charge.  My watch was at 15% and I plugged it into an Apple OEM wall charger and after 90 minutes the charge is only at 47%.  This item is a piece of garbage.  Do not buy it.
1,Charger stopped fully charging my watch about 6 weeks after purchase. Too late to return. But I can warn others DO NOT BUY THIS CHARGER!
1,Made my watch over heat very very quickly.  Do not use
1,This is like any charge pod I thought it was battery operated no is just a usb charger like the o you already have but without a cable!
2,Its the perfect size for travel but it would not charge my watch past 20\30 %.  Returned for this reason.
1,This worked fine when I plugged it into my laptop. But when I tried to use it in my car (which was my entire reason for purchasing this item) it didn‚Äôt charge my watch. I made sure it was connected properly and that my watch was magnetically attached but still no charge. Would not recommend.
1,It looked cute and nice concept of a pocket travel charger but it did not work as billed.  In horizontal position it did not charge at all.  In vertical position with the charger cap under the watch it charged very slowly like all night and still not 100%.  The final straw was when it kept beeping when I put it to charge and acting like it was intermittently loosing contact.  Returned it promptly.
1,I bought these for stocking stuffers.. got one for myself and I doesn‚Äôt charge. Two later to return- bummer
1,Quit working after two uses. What more can you say?
1,It doesn't work and takes probably 3 days to charge. After an evening of charging my watch it went from 10% to 18% - and I'm talking a full 8-hour charge. It's terrible.
5,Super for travel!
1,Worked one time then nothing. Could be  I got a lemon but I don't think so just a bad idea only working from a usb port. Very inconvenient to use and like I said lasted one charge then died. Buy at your own risk but my guess is you will be returning it.
1,I bought this charger for traveling purposes and while its great for putting in a bag the charger itself does not charge well at all. It took me over 9 hours to even get 75% on a charge. I used several outlets and charging bricks but had the same results. I would not recommend this product.
1,I successfully used this product twice. Both times with a device with multiple USB ports. It was slow but it charged. The third time I tried to use it I plugged it into my power bank for over an hour and it hardly went up a percent or two. Then I tried plugging it in my car on the way to work still nothing. Once I got to work I tried my laptop and a wall charger and still nothing. It‚Äôs completely dead and useless after only two uses. Don‚Äôt waste your money!
1,Not sure what is wrong with this charger. I was super excited after seeing several people online recommend it. I plugged it into a wall charger and put my watch on it and it wouldn't charge it at all. So I tried plugging it into a fully charged portable charger and put my watch on it....and the same thing. Super bummed :(
1,I bought this to travel. It sits so flat you can‚Äôt put your watch band under it. And if it gets off slightly then it won‚Äôt charge. And it drained my battery on my watch so bad that I had to get an original apple charger and use that to get it functional again. Not cool while on vacation. I returned it.
1,This got so hot my Apple Watch overheated and now it won‚Äôt turn on. I‚Äôm hoping it didn‚Äôt completely ruin my watch. Zero stars. Don‚Äôt buy it!
1,The charger worked fairly well upon purchase (it charged at a slower rate versus Apple‚Äôs version) but the charge rate was okay. It got quite warm during charging but still worked - until it started to fail. Placing an Apple Watch on it now the charger activates and deactivates. Now the item is bonafide e-waste!
1,Had really high hopes for this product due to its simplicity however that was not the case. I left it on the charger overnight two times with different outlets each time. Both times I woke to a dead watch. Hopefully this product can be improved it shows a lot of potential but is not there quite yet.
1,I really wanted to like this charge because of how compact and simple the design of it is but it doesn‚Äôt charge up my Apple Watch. When sitting on the charger the dead watch receives just enough power to light up the dead/charge now symbol. Maybe I got a dud? Idk maybe it‚Äôs not truly comparable with my Apple Watch version who knows what the problem is.
1,Ordered thought it would be good for traveling. Haven‚Äôt used it went fo travel this past weekend excited to try it out and it doesn‚Äôt work tried both my iPhone plug and into my pc and nothing. Outside my return window in the trash it goes.
1,This charger for my Apple Watch did not work at all. It overheated and actually drained the existing charge out of my watch. Just spend the money and get a good charger. Don‚Äôt buy anything that you can also find on WISH.
2,Terribly slow charging and cheap/weak construction
1,It didnt work. I tried two of them and it would charge to less than 35% and get really hot and stops charging more. The design is beautiful though.
1,Takes forever to charge and overheats constantly. Cheap POS.
1,I really wanted to like this product but it doesn‚Äôt work. It says that it‚Äôs charging it and all it does is make my battery go lower. If I could give it 1.5 stars I would and that is only because it looks nice and the pink is really cute and matches my decor.
5,Works great with portable IPhone charger
1,The charger die one month after I got it
1,I bought this device and it has not will not charge my apple watch. Do not waste your time or money just buy an actual apple watch charger. The worse purchase ever hands down.
5,Heavy solid metal great for travel!!!!
5,Small and handy. Quite perfect
1,I bought this item a first time only to find out it didn‚Äôt work. I was provided with a replacement and Bo refund and it still didn‚Äôt work. I missed the return deadline and spent $9 on a watch charger that doesn‚Äôt work.
1,I left my Apple Watch on this charger all night. I woke up to find that it hadn‚Äôt charged at all. The battery had actually drained to the point of being unable to turn on. The charging icon was on so it was attempting to charge but overheating and not charging at all.
2,Gets really hot quickly. But it is handy for a quick small kick of charge.
1,In theory sounds like a good product but it overheats the Apple Watch and crashes it. Watch took forever to turn on and now doesn't work properly. Don't waste your money
1,Within 10 minutes of my placing this on the item it heated my generation 1 Apple watch to the point that I thought the watch would explode!  In addition it discharged the charge that existed when I placed my watch on the item!
2,Mine only charged 1% per hour. It takes 100 hrs. to get a full charge
1,This product is not worth purchasing. It does not charge my Apple Watch. My watch died while plugged in .
1,It don‚Äôt work anymore ‚Ä¶.. after a week
1,Product does not work. I used multiple cubes from samsung Apple LG etc and my watch doesn‚Äôt fully charge after 1 whole night plugged in. I‚Äôve tried using it in my car and in the house and it doesn‚Äôt work. The normal Apple Watch charger works with the cubes mentioned earlier.
2,Doesn‚Äôt work with apple very well‚Ä¶ keeps going on & off & won‚Äôt charge.
2,Stopped working a month after use of course too once return window closed.
1,Don‚Äôt bother purchasing it will only charge your watch 1% for like hours. Completely useless
2,charged my watch on it for 12hrs only went from 10% to 70%. not the best
1,Not sure if I just got a dud or if it just sucks. Left my watch on it to charge plugged directly into an Apple adapter for 1 hour and it barely charged it at all. Not worth the hassle to return just gave it to a coworker and went back to using my corded charger.
5,Love it
1,I loved it and had no problems with it until earlier this week. Now it doesn‚Äôt work at all.I‚Äôve barely had it for two months and it‚Äôs already stopped working :(
1,I try to stay away from doing reviews but this is only been a month I purchased it it worked I think the first two or three times and now it no longer works it doesn‚Äôt charge.It doesn‚Äôt charge it doesn‚Äôt do anything this is garbage to waste your money.
1,It beep while it was charging which I charge mine at night. Then in the morning my charger  was hot to touch.
1,I had high hopes of only wearing my watch on vacation however this wouldn‚Äôt charge my watch and I ended up carrying my phone all week. I was very frustrated. It‚Äôs going straight into the trash. Please save yourself the frustration and try something else.
1,I was really excited to have a simple little charger for my watch but it never worked. I had a fourth of the battery life on my watch and I put it on the charger for a couple hours and go back to look at it and my watch was dead. I‚Äôve never had that problem before with any other charger. I do not recommend this product.
1,I had high hopes for this charger based on all of the positive reviews. It charges ok overnight but my watch is super hot to touch the next morning. I even charged it without a band but way too hot. I‚Äôm afraid it will damage the watch. Returned it.
1,This charger could be great to have in a pinch but I would not recommend as your main charger.  I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the product due to the overall charging time. However customer service was absolutely excellent.  I believe they will improve their product in the future.
1,Purchased to charge my Apple Watch 3 when I travel. The concept and design are good. Unfortunately this device did not charge my Apple Watch. Placed my watch on the charger and it appeared to be charging. However when I returned a few hours later the charge level had actually gone down.
1,Impressive reviews led me to buy this charger.  I thought the lack of a long cord would allow it to charge quickly.  WRONG!  This charger is excruciatingly slow requiring 2-3 hours to charge my Apple Watch.  What garbage!  Strongly advise that no one waste money on this.
1,I bought this to use in my car and in my office. Both places have built in USB ports. This charger is designed such that industry standard installation for USB A ports puts the watch on the underside of the charger so there's not good contact with the watch and it doesn't charge. It's going back. üòû
1,Less than one week of good charging before stopped working.
1,Would be great but doesn't work.
2,Difficult keeping the watch on it. It takes a lot of time to charge.
1,Stops charging after seconds of being plugged in
1,This product stopped working shortly after receiving it.  It shows that it's connected but never can charge to 100%.  I get 25% at best after charging overnight.  I thought it would be great to have while traveling but it was a big disappointment.
2,Beautiful device....charges much slower than regular chargers.
1,I‚Äôve used it about 2 or 3 times and now it won‚Äôt plug into a usb socket properly or charge without getting really hot
1,Upon initial test this appears to work properly. However upon wearing my battery down to 10% or less and placing on the charger overnight it Only charged my watch to 50% and wouldn‚Äôt charge beyond. Had to go purchase a replacement charger in the middle of my vacation. Not appreciated.
1,Waste of money instead of charging my watch it drained the battery. Plugged it in for 30min at 69% checked it and it was down to 54%. I tried charging again thinking maybe I didn‚Äôt place watch on charger correctly but that was not the case the charge dropped to 48% within minutes. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,This little gadget was great fir two weeks then forget about it! It just completely stopped working out of the blue. I‚Äôm extremely careful with my electronics and never drop or damage any of them. This was literally stored on my kitchen counter in a bowl until used. Definitely great when it worked! But not worth the money for two weeks. üëé
2,Extremely slow. I'd rather purchase the original apple watch charger.
5,Works perfect!
1,This worked poorly and didn‚Äôt charge my watch for most of my trip.  Sometimes I could get it to do a partial charge but it was no reliable and it was too late to return it.  Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,My Apple Watch 7 can‚Äôt be charged at all by using this charger. Don‚Äôt even want to waste time to return it. Not worth it.
1,This item looked perfect for travel -- no cords just pop it into your usb port to charge your apple watch. What I discovered was that this item said it charged my watch to 100% overnight but I would be down to 28% within two hours without running any apps music phone or anything in addition to telling me the time. Resets didn't help. Unfortunately I was nowhere in proximity to an apple store or an amazon delivery for several days. The problem went away when I returned to using the apple chargers.
1,Total waste of money. It looked like it was charging then by morning my watch was dead and both the watch and charger were hot. Spend the money and get a real Apple Watch charger.
1,I loved the idea of this and always having a charge on hand for my Apple Watch but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt work at all. It doesn‚Äôt charge my watch but does get extremely hot
1,Ordered it the first time and it never even shipped got refunded. Ordered a second time since I like the idea but it didn‚Äôt charge the watch for more than a few seconds at a time tried multiple charging bricks. Returned.
2,This charger takes way too long to charge Apple Watch
1,This PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK. I bought two have made sure they are full charged and neither works to charge my watch.  Now I can‚Äôt return it which is upsetting.  DO NOT BUY this product t.
1,Charging is painfully slow and causes the apple watch to become extremely hot. I'll be spending the extra money to purchase an MFi certified charger now.
1,I needed a second charger and thought this would be great. Wrong. Not good! Makes watch hot. Didn‚Äôt even charge the first time. Very slow. Caused some issues on my watch. DONT BUY. Stick with the real deal!
1,This product did not work. It charged my device 1% in a three hour period of time. I had to keep moving my watch around to try and get a connection but no matter what it still would not charge
5,Works great
1,Don't waste your dough. This product is nonsense. if you get 1% an hour you are lucky. Read even the 4 and 5 stars reviews--- they tell you the same thing they just do not care apparently.
1,This is a well designed Apple Watch charger and I ordered to have a backup charger for traveling. However it did not charge my watch at all and I ended up ordering another charger from a different manufacturer.
1,Did not work waste of money
1,it simply won‚Äôt charge. Put my watch on to charge lastnight it was 19% when I checked it this morning it was at 10%. It‚Äôs now dead and still not charging. Idk if I got a dud but I‚Äôm definitely disappointed.
2,Charges so slowly!
1,Charged whole night but the next day watch was only 1/10 charged and my watch and the charger were hot. Returned it.
1,With the weight of the watch it always comes unplugged in my trying. To many times I wake up for work and my watch is still dead or at 5%. Can‚Äôt trust it
1,After about 10 charging cycles the product wouldn‚Äôt charge the watch past 95%.
1,No
5,Very convenient!
1,I bought this for traveling.. It is very slow charging.. I would put it to charge my watch before bed and it would only charge it 5%.. I do not recommend this item  I ended up buying another charger
1,Convenient form-factor and size. Would be great for travel. Charges slow when it works which is almost never. I bought 3 at the same time - they're all the same: almost useless. Save your money and buy something else.
1,Doesn‚Äôt work
1,Worked for 2 mins then never worked again
1,Simply wouldn‚Äôt charge my watch.
1,I tried it on my Laptop as well as plugged it into a socket.  Both times made my watch really hot and even lost 1% charge on the watch.  I am returning it.  Do not recommend.
1,Over the past week I might had it fully charge one time using multiple usb outlets. They all start off charging but then the watch gets overheated and does not changer. Buyer Beware!! Yes I'm sending this item back.
1,Doesn‚Äôt stay connected to watch unable to charge
1,Charges series 2 Apple watch no problem but series 6 is very flaky. Positioning requires patience to have charging initiate only to stop charging within a few minutes.Update:  Seller continues to up bribe (now at $50) to delete this review.
1,Bought for charging watch at work when I forgot to use the Apple charger. Garbage!! 4 hours and it was barely half power. In my opinion a waste of time and worst waste of money!!
2,Was great in the beginning but after a few months it no longer takes the charge.
1,This charger would not charge the watch for more than a minute. Not sure if it‚Äôs just a weak wireless charger or what. Tried multiple wall plugs and USB ports all with the same result.
5,Love it
1,this is a great item specially for travel. i got this 2 weeks ago and now im in the middle of a trip and this stopped working. i only used this probably 4 times.
1,Did not continue charging once my watch was set into the charger‚Ä¶ on vacation and ordered another kind to deliver to my hotel.. frustrating‚Ä¶ missed my window to return
1,It wouldn‚Äôt charge an Apple Watch 7
1,Got a whopping 2% charge after an hour. I bought two of these so I figured maybe the first one I tried was defective. NOPE Neither of the chargers worked. Also tried like others on multiple ports. Laptop car USB home ports nothing worked.
1,The idea of convenience was very alluring but it just doesn‚Äôt work the way that it should. After having my watch on the charger for an hour it had only charged 2% and was hot to the touch. I also noticed that it constantly connected and disconnected throughout the time i decided to watch it to see why it only increased by 2%.
1,Very bad charger might damage your watch due to heat and take so long to charge. Don't knoe how it got all the good review from.
1,It will light up as if it is charging - but then ZERO charging will actually occur. Don‚Äôt waste your money. Knew the price was too good to be true.
1,Its so convenient to travel however its terrible at its job: charging. It takes forever to charge the watch compared to the original charger. Look for another w faster charge speed
1,Purchased this for traveling and it has never worked. It will ding on my watch as if it is charging but does not charge.
1,Will not purchase and it‚Äôs like a Dollar store Toy
1,I charged it when I received it and took it with me on an outing and it NEVER WORKED! You get what you pay for‚Ä¶trash.
1,I bought this to use when I travel to charge my Apple Watch and even though I left it charging all night it did not fully recharge my watch.
1,I charged my apple watch and after it was done the watch and the charger were burning hot.  That does not happen with the original charger that comes with the watch.  Although the design is great for travel and looks great I just don't want to take any chances that it can damage my watch.  Returned the item.  Would have love it if it charges without turning so hot.
1,It took all day to charge my watch and was quite warm in the process. It was dead the next time I tried to use it.
1,mine didnt even work
1,It came late and it doesn‚Äôt work at all didn‚Äôt even charge my watch not a single light üëé
1,I bought this for a trip that I was going on and it didn‚Äôt work!!!  Don‚Äôt waste your money.... came back and it says the window closed for me to return.
1,Very cheaply made. Did not charge my watch for more than a few seconds at a time and then just stopped. There are better products on the market - do not buy this one.
1,Since day one it didn‚Äôt work it would connect and begin to charge and then it would stop charging and the watch would heat up . I returned it for a refund
1,Can‚Äôt control off/on and volume button w/o taking cover off Keeps sliding off
1,It does charge the watch. However it does not charge it efficiently. Slows very slowly and not worth it the money.
1,It took hours to get a full charge I had it plugged in and my watch on the charger over night and it never got to 100%
1,It doesn‚Äôt charge my watch at all. I love the portability & that it lacks the annoying cord I just wish it worked
1,It did not work I tried it on iwatch 3 and 6 did not work on either wish I could no star
1,Tried this product.Charges watch very slow . Charger also cuts on and off. I have tried multiple adapters and each one I have the same result.I do not recommend this.
1,Was so disappointed with this! It is the slowest charging doc ever! I had my watch on all night and it only charges about 5%!!! Would not recommend. Great idea but it doesn‚Äôt work
1,After charging for two hours my watch had only gained about 10% charge. Such a disappointment and return window is short. Wish i had tested it immediately upon receiving it rather than waiting till my next travel.
1,Bought 2 and neither would charge. Tried multiple  outlets and plug-in types. They never charged meaning they also never charged our watches. Total sham would not recommend.
1,Tried it plugged into small chargers laptops large chargers etc and never worked once.
1,This charger worked for about a month.It was very slow at changing. Now it doesn‚Äôt work at all.
1,S-L-O-W!!!!! Takes forever to charge and stalls out. I‚Äôve tried it in different outlets and in the car nothing matters it doesn‚Äôt work well at all and it also makes the iWatch super hot and for the time it‚Äôs on it won‚Äôt connect to your iPhone because it gives a warning saying that your iWatch has to cool down first!! Definitely getting returned!!
1,I tried this on my laptop for 30 minutes Said it was charging but didn't.  Tried on my USB hub on my desk top would not charge at all.  May have been the hub.  So I tried on my best wall adapter.  After another 30 minutes the watch LOST 2%.  Returned for refund.
1,It doesn‚Äôt charge my watch at all. I had my watch on it while did some work didn‚Äôt charge it at all. Such a waste of money.
1,I like the idea of it but mine does not charge my watch at all
1,At first I thought this was the perfect travel charger. However it started getting really hot when charging and then stopped charging altogether.
1,Product will not fully charge my watch. Nice and convenient. Just seems like it get hot and charges a title bit
1,This charger did not work for me. I could leave it on the charger all night and it would get maybe 5% charged if anything at all. Don't waste your money!
1,Works like it says it will
1,I love the idea of this but after 6 hours of charging it won‚Äôt charge my watch past 24%. I returned it.
1,I have had this for a while and only used a handful of times but it now doesn't work at all. Useless purchase.
1,Overheated my watch and caused it to get the red snake of death. Not worth buying a cheap charger for an expensive watch.
1,I've now tried two of these chargers - both are being returned because it doesn't actually charge my devices it simply keeps them from losing charge. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Doesn‚Äôt work. Doesn‚Äôt charge. Waste of money. Tried it in several different ports/outlets. Don‚Äôt bother.
1,It heats up the watch excessively. You can't put the watch back on. It can't be good to get that hot.
1,The Apple Watch just got hot.  No change in battery charge.
1,It does not work in the ubs cord my Ho window 10 & and HP window 7. It continues to overheat.
1,I tried to charge my Apple Watch 4 three different ways using the charger and none of the worked. After a full 8 hours nothing.
1,I liked this product for the first month but now I have had it for 45 days and it no longer works.
1,Worked once then would not charge again. I‚Äôm surprised it didn‚Äôt cook my watch. It would repeatedly get very hot but never charge.
1,Not super useful because it charges my watch upside down so the magnet falls off and my watch can‚Äôt charge
1,It doesn't work. I charge it and it doesn't charge my watch. I'm so üôÅ disappointed.
1,Charges to watch only up to 4% or so no matter how much time do you leave it on the charger. Pretty much useless
1,Had my watch on the charger for 24 hours and it never went past 10%.
1,Crappy quality. Have to juggle it in the plug to make it work then a few min later the watch stops charging anyway. Tried different plugs and outlets.
1,I‚Äôve tried different plugs outlets doesn‚Äôt charge my watch. Waste of money. Good concept failed execution.
1,The charger stopped charging my watch after 3 charges.  It go hot as it charged my watch.
1,I‚Äôve only ever used this portable charger once and it doesn‚Äôt even work. Waste of money.
1,It‚Äôs just enough the light and carving screen show up and then shut off.  Not worth it. Good concept though
1,My product was defective.  It is not able to charge my watch.
2,Great concept but didn‚Äôt charge my Apple Watch 5 reliably. Seemed like it worked day 1 but not after that. Not worth the $.
1,It's not charging well. It's not steady in charging. Every few minutes the charge disable. Either on the ac wall or on the power bank.
1,Takes FOREVER to charge your watch. Like more than overnight. So maybe if you only occasionally wear it it would be useful??
1,This charger is very compact and would be very handy if it actually charged quickly but it does not.
1,I bought three only one works the other two took up to 8 hours to charge 10%. Also they get too hot.
1,Did not charge my watch at all. I left it on for half a day and still nothing I returned it.
1,Nice and handy.Never worked for my watch.
1,The watch acted like it was going to charge when we put the watch on it but it never did.  Returned.
1,This charger made my watch almost break it got it so hot and did not even charge at all
1,only charges watch to 63%. I have purchased another brand (using the same power supply) that charges at 100&
1,Stopped charging after almost 2mo. Great concept just didn‚Äôt last long .
1,Doesn‚Äôt charge my Apple Watch series 5. Tried 3 different outlets and boxes to make sure the device doesn‚Äôt work.
1,First one arrived with cracked charging surface. Second one worked fine but just quit charging after three months.
1,The product didn‚Äôt work at all.
1,It‚Äôs worked great for about 5 days and would be very convenient but it stopped charging.
1,My series 2 apple watch got nice and hot but didn't actually charge up on this device.
1,It‚Äôs been charging for 2 days and can‚Äôt get more that 15% charge
1,This would be a great charger but the unit gets fairly hot while it‚Äôs charging probably not a good sign.
1,Watch overheats & does not charge
1,This product takes about 4 hours to charge watch. Should of returned!
1,Made a very low humming on all chargers used with slow charge and disconnected many times causing watch to ding over and over.
1,I liked the size of it but it quit working three weeks later.
1,Overheating both watch and charger And will kill your battery and watch Don‚Äôt buy

1,This does not work. I even tried to charge my watch while's it is plugged up and it still didn't work.
1,This worked only once and never again. Unfortunately we missed the return window.
1,Better to purchase a regular Apple Watch charger. As handy as this pocket charger seems it‚Äôs too short.
1,Does not work. Actually drains the watch battery when in use. Do not buy.
1,It only would charge my watch 10 minutes at a time. Never once have I had a full charge from this charger

1,First time that I needed it it continued to go on and off connected/disconnected
1,It ruined my I watch. Do not purchase!!
1,Will continuously disconnect from your watch making it impossible to charge. Not worth the price paid.
1,Product was junk. Wouldn‚Äôt fully charge and would heat up my watch
1,Will not charge! Have tried multiples times- must be a crap a shoot if you get one that works or not!!
1,Had plugged into my Apple laptop all day and turned on but still very little charge. Stay away.
1,It‚Äôs a piece of üí© it doesn‚Äôt work at all save your self money and frustration by something better
1,Watch displayed a hot warning after less than 5 minutes on this charger. Returned it.
1,I literally threw this in the garbage.  It did a better job draining my battery than charging my battery.
1,Used this charger one time and it seemed to work well. When I went to use it again I noticed cracks on the charging side of the device. Has a great ease of use but does not appear to hold up well.
1,Did it work

4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Easy to use and works well.Five stars except for one issue - I bought one of these a few months ago and the USB connector on the charger (white in the picture) was bidirectional; it could be installed with the charging surface either up or down to suit your charging needs. The new chargers (blue in the picture) can only be installed in one orientation. See video
1,Kit doesnt work please  pick up packakage at my house im cant see to drive to drivePick up package
1,Doesn‚Äôt work
4,Please be advised that this product does serve a fairly specific niche:  It's a compact Apple Watch charger and it's about as small as you can get with this particular device.  As such placing it somewhere where you can use it properly can be a bit challenging I found in my case that the  watch band itself has enough natural curl to be problematic with this.  It's not the fault of the design of this product its the reality of using it.  Just for grins I've been using it as my daily charger and maybe 1 in 10 times the watch slides off it and fails to charge.  However after a couple of failures I've learned how to do it in a way that's pretty reliable.  The biggest challenge for me was finding a USB port that's low to a flat surface.  In my case that'd be a desklamp I have that has a USB port right in the base.So in short:  If you need a daily charger for your Apple Watch it is VERY difficult for me to recommend it because it sacrifices a couple of niceties to get you a more compact charger.  If you're a business traveller trying to shrink your carry-on bag I can't recommend this enough.
4,This USB travel Apple Watch charger from Newdery is a convenient to top up your Apple Watch on the go.The footprint of this charger is small but the magnet is strong enough to keep the Apple Watch in place. I typically plug mine into an open USB port on my computer and it charges sufficiently fast enough that I can't complain too much about it. It's noticeably slower when I use a laptop vs a desktop but it charges on both.What I don't like about this charger is that it seems stressed when I charge the watch still inside its band. Granted I use aftermarket Apple Watch bands and maybe some of them are heavier than the official one that ships with the watch. Still a few ounces shouldn't make that much of a difference but it does. Also as mentioned earlier this charger does best when plugged into a desktop PC. Laptop charging (should be noted that I have a windows machine not a MacBook) is appreciably slower for me.Overall I like the convenience of this charger from Newdery. It's easy to carry effectively chargers the Apple Watch given the right power source and it's magnet has enough attraction to keep the watch secure.
1,The connection with the watch is so sensitive that you can't use this in the car or anywhere there are virations.  The Apple cable is the only way to go.
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND! It doesn't charge. PERIOD. Cheap circuitry.Initially seemed like it was just very very slow - but I would come home and charge on the regular charger. When I tried to charge ONLY on this to see how long it will take to charge to green I found out it is not doing a thing. It won't be efficient use to carry along if it doesn't charge like regular charger. Even after several hours the watch just got HOT and stayed on RED  not charged.
4,This charger is perfect to keep in my handbag in case the watch runs low.  The item charge the watch pretty quickly and i was very happy with it until it cracked.  The charger was in my handbag in a cosmetic bag any well cushioned. I don‚Äôt know how it could crack so easily. While the devices does slowly charge the watch (even cracked) its not worth it to risk the battery on the watch.  I will order another to replace the cracked one as it is helpful to have a portable Apple Watch charger!
4,I have not used the charger for travelling. Instead it stays plugged into my desktop and that is where I use it. It may be compact for travelling but I find it bulky at my desktop and may go back to what I used before: a USB charging cable specific for apple watches. I think the strap is a bit questionable if it is intended for a key chain. Not sure about how sturdy the little leather piece is? However for my purposes I find it a bit cumbersome to stick out of my USB port but would use it in my car.
5,I ordered this Newdery Apple Watch travel charger on impulse. For $15.99 (at time of this review) I didn‚Äôt think it would be much quality to it. But I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived!Comes packaged nicely to keep it stable and safe.The charger is heavier/denser than I imagined‚ÄîI thought it would be some cheap plastic light and unsubstantial but this little charger feels really well-crafted and substantial.Super great for traveling‚ÄîI hate when I have all those cords I have to worry over in my suitcase or carryon. This could just as easily fit in a bigger-sized wallet a purse backpack carry-on whatever. It‚Äôs small and compact. You could of course also use it as a spare charger or even your main one if you didn‚Äôt want cords snaking around.Slip off the protective covering to the USB port and plug into your USB receptacle. You could also plug it into your laptop if you wanted. That‚Äôs it. Done.It has a little leather-look tab to it that reads: watch. Cute.Quite happy with this little charger for my new Apple Watch!Recommend.I hope my review helped you today!
5,This is a perfect little travel charger. Very cool that no wires are required at all. Note that this is not like a portable battery and won't hold a charge on its own. It needs to be plugged in to charge your watch.I got this one for my husband's Apple Watch Series 5 44 mm. See photos for comparative size between the charger and the watch.The charger is well made with a nice glossy white finish. The protective 'cover' (it's doesn't cover the USB completely) doubles as a stand when plugged into a horizontal surface USB port. The microfiber / faux suede tab is looped so you can hang this on your keychain for convenience.Charging is very easy and fast. The actual USB can be plugged in either way into a port. I've not seen a USB like this before. The magnetic induction area works well.This is small enough for me to pop into my purse for my husband's "just in case" moments. It's even small enough to pack into a pocket. It's a perfect compact size to take anywhere.
1,I got this as a christmas and and tried to use to charge my apple watch which was dead. All it did was overheat my watch and was never able to gain a charge.If i wanted to use for travel i would rather have the wires and get somewhat of a faster charge as this product didnt work at all.
5,Very portable comes with a handy little cover for usb port. Much easier to charge watch than long winding cord. I just plug mine into a box plug and drape the watch over it!
5,It took a while but there are finally some great charging solutions for Apple Watches. I absolutely love this one as it easily plugs into my laptop and into any outlet with a USB connector. It works very well charging my Apple Watch just as quickly as the Apple charger that came with the device.The only obstacle I can't overcome is the height of the charger when plugged into the side of my computer. This is no one's fault and understood there isn't much that can be done to "lift" the charger so I end up moving my laptop further to the edge of the desk so that it sort of hangs over. It works fine either way and I don't chalk this up in a negative way at all.If you're looking for something cordless and effective to charge your Apple Watch look no further. This is great!
5,First off the most important feature it worked well charging my Watch 3 Nike LTE edition running the latest WatchOS (6.1.1).  I find the design both useful and limiting. I you have a desk USB dock or are using a battery pack then this simplifies charging your watch since you won't have cables running everywhere and the cap doubles as a stop for your watch to rest on. But if you have a wall plug that's next to the floor then that's where your watch will have to go too. It'd be sweet if they offered a cable receiver on the other end (either Lightning or USB) to let this double a long cable or cable-less depending on what you need it to be. But as it's still perfect for an emergency travel charger that takes up hardly any space or for a desk with a USB dock on it.
5,I was hesitant to try this charger as I'd already tried one that did not work. I'm glad that I ordered this. It is charging my Apple watch as I write this.This is a very well made charger. It's weighty in your hand even though it is extremely portable. The OEM charger has a very long cord that can get tangled up quite easily. I really like the fact that you can charge from any USB power source with this. No chords to untangle or untie.The leather strap makes it possible to attach this to a bag or keychain. It is definitely portable and perfect for traveling or  charging your Apple watch on the go. Until I travel again I'm going to use this charger at home.
5,I haven't seen anything like this NEWDERY Apple Watch charger and it is definitely coming with me on my next trip. The cap that covers the USB plug can then be placed around the plug so that it forms sort of a stand for the watch when plugged into a horizontal USB port. The USB plug can be inserted in both directions so it doesn't matter which way "up" the port is designed. The images show it in use with a watch that has an open band but it also works well on mine that has a "Milanese Loop" band.It charged my Apple Watch fine and is extremely convenient to carry.
5,I finally got the chance to use this Apple Watch charger and it is amazing! I used it with a standard Apple USB charging brick in a traditional vertical electrical receptacle (i.e. outlet) and it worked just as expected with my Apple Watch Series 3...perfect!I LOVE that it does not require any cords but plugs straight into the USB port. While I have yet to use this with a computer USB port I am certain it would function just as well. This is a really compact and convenient way to charge an Apple Watch. I highly recommend it!
5,I keep this little Apple Watch dongle in my bag and have used it to charge up my watch in the middle of the day.  I usually charge my watch overnight and leave that cable at home.  With this product I'm able to charge on the go - especially on days where I have heavy watch usage (like on workout days) and I want the watch to last well into the night.  You still need to plug this dongle to a power source and I usually just plug it into the side of my laptop while I am working.
5,I just love this little charger ! With the watchband I use it doesn't sit well with the regular charger but with this one it drapes over it so nicely. You can plug this in anywhere that has a usb which makes it so handy and it's so small you can put it in your purse. The quality is really good nice and sturdy too.
5,Works just like the original with less bulk.  Great for the road because it is small and it just attached to the computer.  It can attached to the wall as well but working on the road makes it very convenient to use the laptop instead.  Nice cap to keep the plug clean.
1,I‚Äôd plug my watch in before bed around 11pm and it would be at 50%. When I‚Äôd wake up at 7:30 with it still not fully charged it would be annoying. Slowest watch charger I‚Äôve ever used
1,The "Amazon's choice" tag is very misleading. You see it and buy a product because you think it would last long but all you get is trouble. I bought this charger and it had been working great but recently everytime I put my watch on it it keeps fluctuating between charging and not charging. Then if I leave it on the charger overnight it freezes my watch on the charging screen.Do better Amazon!
5,We're very happy with this little travel charger. It's perfect if for plugging into the side of your laptop (or any other USB power source). It's also got a really solid build and works perfectly. Zero complaints so far.
5,This is a Great travel adapter without the cable you can use it connected directly into a USB plug on your laptop charge hotel USB plug or even in my case a battery pack! Its simple easy and without the cable takes up way less room
2,It worked well for the first 6 months. But now it just seems to over heat and give very little to no charge.
1,Arrived crushed
1,Purchased two neither worked. The watch sits on it and cycles in and out of charge repeatedly and never gains charge
1,Doesn‚Äôt work at all it kills your battery instead of charging it do not recommend buying it!
1,Straight trash. It keeps the watch from going dead but doesn‚Äôt charge it. Had to use another one to charge the watch
5,Great purchase thank you so much.
4,Hi! Yes I got this item so have use it while traveling or even in my car when I forget to charge my Apple Watch. It‚Äôs awesome I throw it in my purse and I I need it I plug it in the power cord and done.
2,So yeah this is trash. It doesn't charge but for 5 mins. When you put your watch on this it takes a minute before its recognized but even after it finds it it only charges for five to ten minutes before it is no longer connected. The image you see is one of the multiple ports I have connected the device to. From my computer to an actual plug cube to the device meant to charge Apple devices. Same issue every time. I'm legit upset but I guess it is what it is. I just want my watch charged when I forget to take it off at night and not die when I'm out. Smh
5,I use this mainly when I travel!  Just plug it into a box and set your watch on top!  It's super small easy to use!!
5,No cord to mess with and you don‚Äôt have to worry about your watch disconnecting from the charger‚Ä¶I LOVE IT!
1,I received this charger today.It looks good.However the finishing quality is poor.I have even found something like rust in the corners.I am upset because of this low quality build and finish.I am going to return this.
5,Nice and compact works as intended. Very convenient.
1,I was really looking forward to having this charger for trips but unfortunately I still haven‚Äôt gotten it to work. I‚Äôve followed all the directions even tried different charging cords but no luck. Would be an amazingly helpful product if it worked. Maybe I just received a defective one.
4,This appears to be ok - it has to plugged in to charge - I thought it‚Äôs a mobile charger - so I plugged it in thinking I was charging it- nope - hope it works - cheap 9.00 - I do have it on my key chain -
5,I was annoyed that the apple watch needs to be charged more frequently than my last watch.  This charger is small and lightweight so I keep it attached to my laptop bag with a carabiner clip to use anytime my watch battery is running low.  It's made all the difference in being happy with my watch.
5,It connects like it‚Äôs charging but quickly disconnects. It continues to do this. I end up having to just remove my watch from it completely. Really disappointed. It would have been perfect for traveling.
5,Got this after finally getting a power bank for my iPhone. Got tired of having to lug around my charging cable for my Apple Watch and taking the chance of losing or forgetting the only charging cable I have for it. After doing a lot of research and searching I settled for this portable charger and have used it several times while at work with my portable power bank. Easy to use carry and slight enough that it doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space. Plan on traveling to see family and thankfully that there is one less cumbersome cord that I‚Äôll need to take with me.
4,Doesn‚Äôt charge very quickly but is good for travel overnight charging or in a pinch. Sometimes I leave the house without charging my watch fully and some mornings I'm down to 10-15%. I keep this in my car and charge my watch as I start my commute. When I travel I keep it in my travel bag because it comes in handy and takes up no space.I've not experienced any overheating issues but I only use this when I am on the go so not as often as the OEM from Apple. If you need a backup charger for peace of mind this fits the bill nicely.
5,So this is super small compact and cute. But‚Ä¶I put my watch on the charger starting at 7am. I checked on it throughout the day and by the time I went to bed at 9:30pm it was only 85% charged. This is definitely not fast charging. I tried it in other outlets and ports and the same thing. It charges slower than molasses. I guess it‚Äôs nice to have in a pinch? But not really.**UPDATE**I contacted customer service and they said that this is not how it should function and replaced my charger. The new one works very well and charges my watch from dead to fully charged in about 4-5 hours. With that I changed the rating to 5 stars as this is everything I had been looking for and the customer service was very nice!
5,Has a leather strap to put on a key chain I wish the USB was able to turn soo i don‚Äôt have to find a horizontal USB. Works like it should convenient.
5,I wish I had found this sooner! For the past two years I‚Äôve had my Apple Watch cord just folded up and held together with a hair clip because who needs 3‚Äô of cable for their watch! The charging block I‚Äôm using has the USB port at the bottom so mine sticks out vertically instead of horizontally but it doesn‚Äôt matter because the magnet is strong and holds it well. I‚Äôve also noticed that sometimes my Apple brand charger doesn‚Äôt charge even though it‚Äôs connected (I‚Äôll have to take it off and put it back on again a few times for it to connect) and I‚Äôve yet to have that problem with this charger. Starts charging right away every time. Highly recommend!
5,An IG vlogger I follow recommend this for traveling and she was right! I plug it into my portable charger and it works perfect. Thank you for the recommendation Daryl-Ann Denner!
3,It is a good price Apple Watch charger.Charged my watch only 25% after an hour of driving. For some reason it will not stay attached to the USB port and I have to keep pushing it in to make sure stays in and charging‚Ä¶
5,The wireless charging is very comfortable and compact. In the past it was troublesome to use the data cable to charge the mobile phone. However it is more convenient to use this wireless charging device. It can be directly put on the desktop after connecting the power. There is no need to look for the data cable. The mobile phone can be charged as soon as it is released. There is no pop-up window. The charging will not be hot. The charging is fast and stable and the overall use is very good Satisfied very convenient.
5,I used to travel a lot for work and suspect I will again soon.  Cable management makes for happier  business travel.  I was really excited to see this with no cable!  Tried it out works perfectly.Dropped it into my travel backpack.  Ready for the road.
5,I purchased this Apple Watch charger for travel but it seemed to charge incredibly slow. I contacted the seller who promptly responded and sent me a replacement for the apparent defective unit.I have now been using this charger as the main Apple Watch charger as this is sleeker and more compact and take along the OEM for travel.Recommended!
5,The charger is made of fine workmanship small and exquisite and convenient to carry. After a try it is very convenient to charge. It starts to charge when it is put on. The induction is very sensitive. The charging speed is no different from that of the original charger. It can be filled in almost an hour without heating. It is a very good product. It is recommended.
5,The original charging head of the watch can't be found. I bought an emergency one temporarily. After receiving the baby's use I feel very good. It seems that it's not the original one but the workmanship is not bad at all with the original one. It's very exquisite. The charging effect is no different from that of the original one. It's the same as the original one "charging for one hour using for 20 days"!
1,The item will not charge my Apple Watch. I charged it all night still no charge. I tried with different charges. I waited 8 days to late to return.
5,After failing to recharge my watch overnight and cause it to die at work I ordered the watch to be ordered. I realized I didn't have a second charger to carry with me just in case I found the gem. We just came out of town and used it to charge my cell phone and watch. This is perfect! What a convenient invention! Users who use both Apple watch and iPhone are recommended.
5,Definitely a game changer. Easy to plug in as it‚Äôs no annoying and long cord and compact for travel.
1,However that doesn't work for me!!  I wish it actually worked very disappointed!
5,The watch sticks to it well and doesn‚Äôt fall off. Takes a while o charge from my computer m don‚Äôt know if it supposed to be like that this would be my only complaint.
5,The quality is good. The charging is fast and it won't get hot when charging. The apple mobile phone and watch can be used at the same time which is very convenient and space saving. It feels that it is much better than the original one. It is very easy to use
5,This is a great product for quick charging! Especially in the car you plug it into a USB port and it‚Äôs so sturdy
5,This is so great - so much better than taking the long Apple Watch cord around. Use it in the car wall etc‚Ä¶
5,This charger works great and it so convenient.  Easily fits with my other portable chargers.  I keep it with my travel items.
5,Absolutely worth the money! It is perfect for traveling or to charge while at work! I am so happy I bought this for my sister as well! She loves how sturdy it is and it charges my watch pretty fast! So happy I found this!
5,This is great for keeping in my Jeep  very handy for a quick charge while driving.
5,Excellent device quick charge for Apple Watch easy carry and ready when needed.
5,Got a defective device customer service sent the replacement quickly next day now I can use to charge my watch at work or when driving. It‚Äôs so convenient and I‚Äôm satisfied.
5,love the tiny size.  handy to fit in small purse.
5,I liked the first one so much I bought a second.
5,Small but extremely well made and effective.
5,Super handy little Apple Watch charger! Excellent purchase!
5,This was a great idea and works perfect
5,The charging head is of good quality fast charging high power fast output beautiful appearance easy to carry everyone can buy with confidence
5,Very convenient at home or travel works well
5,WOW. A tiny little wonder. This will be wonderful when I travel. No wire to try to wind up or get tangled. Works great even upside down.
5,Works perfectly.
2,Will not charge my watch tried it in multiple ports and it wouldn‚Äôt turn on at all super unhappy with my purchase
5,Good product
5,Really like this charger. Highly portable and charges quick. Highly recommended!
5,Good
1,This product did not work.  It made my watch very warm and actually decharged vs charge.
4,This is a pretty cool gadget it works but man is it slow. Only way you'll be able to fully charge your watch is if you do it overnight. Don't buy it to get a fast charge cause you'll be disappointed. I'd say to charge 50% takes about 6 - 7 hours. Works in a pinch for sure though.
5,Good fro traveling charging power is also good.
3,Takes forever to charge your watch.
5,I really like how portable this charger is. Instead of carrying around the long cable that Apple provides this makes it much easier to charge my Apple Watch on my desktop and while traveling. Just plug it in and attach your watch works just as good as original charger!
5,This is a game changer for charging my watch on the go. I was a little reluctant on buying these but they are worth it.
5,love
5,This thing is perfect! I love the size and the simple way it works. I have a slot that sits vertically and the watch hangs on on my car dash! Perfect!
5,This is an amazing product! I had to buy another!
5,Perfect for travel
5,This is exactly what I was looking for. After awhile all the cords get messy. This is as compact as you can get and charges just as fast as my previous charger.
5,I started traveling and this little gadget help me a lot. I don‚Äôt need to bring another cable. I have a multi usb charger that helps me to keep everything minimalist. Easy to use install and carry.
5,I bought it to be my travel charger and that‚Äôs exactly what it is designed to do. Love it
5,Put this in my bathroom. No cords or clutter and can charge my watch conveniently every night.
5,So far works well - keep in car charge watch while driving
5,I purchased this for work and it works great.
1,This charger depletes my battery instead of charging my watch. Went from 40% to 10% in half hr
5,Love this little gadget to carry with you when you are traveling instead of the actual apple charger. Very convenient to use and the price is great as well
5,Does what it‚Äôs supposed to do.
5,Great portable charging device for my Apple Watch Series 6!
5,I bought it so far it seems of good quality only time will tell.
2,Buena presentaci√≥n buen acabado... pero la carga del Apple Watch es lenta.
5,I had to order an adapter to use in my car wish it would had come with this product
5,Perfect for my car!! I don‚Äôt want a lot of cords and there wasn‚Äôt a go place to lay my watch while charging so this was the perfect solution! Works perfectly and charges at a good rate.
5,Very useful for short travel and camping with a power bank.
5,I have always found the original charger that came with my watch to be very cumbersome to take with me when I travel.  This little charger is great for traveling.  No cables to get tangled!  I like that I can plug it into my laptop while on the airplane for a quick charge.
4,Exactly what I needed
5,Pretty straight forward on what this thing does . Come in handy many of times for me on the go and without the need of a extra cord
5,Work wonderfully! Definitely gonna end up buying a couple of em and using them. Saves on space!
3,Unit charges kinda slow even on iQ charger and also poops it‚Äôs self out of the plug.
4,Really like this but does get hot when plugged in and when charging.
2,It chargers my Apple Watch SUPER slow but eventually gets the job done. It‚Äôs small enough to throw in my purse for emergencies. Not in love with it but don‚Äôt hate it either....
5,cool little item works very well. very portable
5,Replacing a cord charger. This was fast easy to pack.  Very pleased
5,Seems good so far. small has a cover works good price
5,Absolutely the best thing ever great product!
5,Quick charger at the office for my Apple Watch !
5,Since I get this keychain charger I wear my Apple Watch in my trips .Thank you
5,Compack
5,Small and compact perfect for travel. Works great
5,Great
5,Better than expected. Quality build. Double sided USB that works both directions.
5,Working perfect
4,Small in size and easy to travel with
5,Very convenient and easy to use
1,Will not charge at all . Over heats watch just by placing it on top
5,none
5,Works good
5,I was worried it wouldn‚Äôt fit in the small console of my truck but I LOVE IT!  Great for charging on the go!  I even used it in my laptop yesterday.  Nice charge time too!
5,This is an excellent travel product and I‚Äôm impressed with how fast it charges my Apple Watch.
5,This charger is much better than the one that comes with the watch. The watch has a place to sit while it‚Äôs charging and no messy cords.
5,Great price so handy and portable!
5,The portability is a PLUS! No strings attached‚Ä¶woohoo!
5,I keep this on my travel bag it's super convenient to have an Apple watch charger on hand at all times! It's super easy to use and I notice no difference in charge time in comparison to any other Apple watch charger. I will NEVER be without a travel charger for all of my important devices again! Loving the ease of use and size for this one.
5,This little gadget has so many advantages: 1) It's portable. I can easily put it on a keychain and/or in my purse when travelling. No long cord to carry; 2) My watch easily connects to it. I have another type charger but the watch band gets in the way  so it doesn't always lay flat on the magnetic circle; however that's no problem with this charger; 3) color choices make it easy to find it; 4) the price is low even thought the construction and ease of use is high. I'm very happy with this purchase
5,Super fast and easy transaction. Overall good product!
5,Perfect for travel - use at home or in the office!!!! I love it!!!
2,Convenient but trouble some. Took forever to charge n didn‚Äôt grip the Apple Watch. Kept falling off
1,This is a complete waste of money it would not charge my watch at all!  Wish it would have worked I would love to have one with out all the wires that actually worked as advertised!
5,lived up to expectation
5,I always forget my Apple Watch charger on trips making it useless after the first day. This charger is small and study and is kept in my travel bags so it‚Äôs never forgotten. Game changer for sure.
5,My watch charger is often hit and miss but this works great just plug it into anything with a usb port and it just works well.
5,Small and nice I love it my watch fits very nice on the stand too
5,Couldn‚Äôt be more pleased.  Very convenient!!
5,Wonder for travel. Charging cord could be longer
5,Love these nice and portable great for getting a little extra juice on my watch in the car or away from home without having a messy wire. Plugs straight into a charging block or USB outlet and good to go! AWESOME!
5,As a flight attendant I have a million charger cords and they always get tangled. This eliminates the problem. I love that its straightforward and easy to pack love this product!
5,This is a good apple watch charger. Although it wont charge as fast a OEM charger it is great for travel as I hate carrying a bunch of cords with me for charging. This product is very small so I wouldn't suggest dropping it due to its size but it feels durable.
5,great for travel and work emergency charging. compact. i like that i can plug into my charger battery without extra cable
5,I love this thing I just keep it on my keys because my Apple Watch dies all the time
5,I like it!!! Small & portable!
1,overall looks really good the only problem is that it stopped working for me and it would not charger my watch after the first time of use.
5,Charged quickly easy for when on the go and can fit right in your pocket.
4,Update: I tried it with a different base and it works much better I am no longer regretting this purchase. It works just fine now but it does get warm to the touch occasionally.
5,Great price works perfectly strong hold as well
5,its good it just charges slow
5,Small charges fast easily portable and sturdy great purchase
5,Item arrived in good time in good condition & was as described.
5,The attached silicone cover is nice. Now I don‚Äôt have to keep up with additional pieces.If you travel this item is a must.
5,perfect for travel. no cords to deal with.
5,Small and portable. I only used it once so far but it worked great.
5,Sometimes when you think you have charged you watch only to get somewhere and realize the charge didn't take place. This portable charger you can plug into your laptop solves all problems.
5,Easy and efficient use it for my watch every other day.
5,I get a ton of notifications and my watch alway die before I get home or while I‚Äôm doing a walk towards end of the day.  Now I can actually use my power pack to charge my watch too!  Exciting!
5,This is a perfect little charger for the car. I plug it into a USB port and can charge my Apple Watch without have MORE cords around getting tangled. Of course it‚Äôs great for traveling too which is what I bought it for but I‚Äôm loving it in the car!
5,Works great.  I leave it plugged in at work.  No issues - a bargain for the price.
5,This little thing is perfect tot have in the car to add an little extra charge to your watch while you‚Äôre sitting. The only thing I would say to be careful to look at is the space above and around the charging port because you are putting a watch on top of the charger that can easily not fit or get knocked off if it‚Äôs a tight fit
5,I love love this product so easy to carry with you can plug in almost anywhere
1,Does not give full charge.  Watch gets hot.
5,Just received this today and so far so good‚Ä¶it is a cute color sturdy charges well and perfect for travel or small purses; it has a place where you could even hook it onto your keychain. A+
1,Stopped working and doesn‚Äôt charge well at all!
5,I keep this in my purse and have used it many time and let other use it to charge there watch as well. Works great
5,This makes my watch much more travel-worthy.  It works perfectly!!
5,Makes travel easy. Use it at cabin because it is easier to store.
5,Lightweight and easy to use. Highly recommend people use it.
4,I like this better than carrying the cable. The only downside is that you have to find a horizonal USB A plug and if you aren't using your laptop it could be difficult. Hotel plugs are often pointing up like on the top side of a desk or the USB slots (and 120v sockets) are vertical like when they have USB plugs in the back of the desk. This will - barely - hold an Apple watch vertically but the slightest vibration and it will drop.Essentially I'd say if you're going to plug this into the side of your laptop - 5 stars. If you are not it might be 3 stars for practicality.
1,Wasted my money on this one. I hadn‚Äôt used it until the return deadline passed.  It won‚Äôt charge at all. I tried various adapters outlets etc and always the same. Saving a dime was a waste of time.
5,I wanted a charger to keep at work for when my charger at home fails me. Those occasional days that you get to work and realize your watch didn‚Äôt charge. This is compact easy to carry and keep with you and efficient. Such a good idea! Worth the money.
5,Perfect to put in your bag or purse!
5,Amazing
5,This is a favorite purchase for charging my watch. I don‚Äôt travel much but have specific places I like to charge my watch. I love that this plugs in and you can place your watch right on the magnetic charger with no wires laying all over my counter. Am going to order more!
4,Convenient and good price as an extra Apple Watch charger  but Charges much slower than the Apple Original product
5,I got this for my college kid and he travels a lot  got a couple for the car n travel comes in handy when you‚Äôre in a pinch and your watch is on low battery best investment ever!!!
3,worked out as described but gets too hot. too strong?
5,Charges quickly and convenience
5,Nice and compact. Feels sturdy and quality. Excellent purchase!
3,I bought this to charge my watch while driving.  Unfortunately it is oriented horizontally and the USB port is oriented vertically which makes that impossible. My bad for not noticing this before buying. It would probably work with a laptop port.
5,Love it
5,Love it so far no issues.
4,This works but it seems to take longer to charge my watch as compared to the original Apple charger.
5,I use this little guy to charge my watch while I work. My watch kept dying at work bc I would forget to charge it. I didn‚Äôt want a lot of strings so I got this. Perfect.
4,It's super portable apple watch charger and works as expected. It's a must have accessory for travel. It would have easily got my 5 stars if magnet was strong enough.
5,Works like a charm. Plug N Play with ease.  Appreciate the rubber cover.
5,Super compact. Works great. Love it for travel.
5,Es super compacto.
3,At times difficult to set watch on charging area
5,I keep this in my travel bag. It does exactly what it needs to!
5,I like it. It leave it my my mothers place so I don‚Äôt have to keep traveling with my cable from my home and possibly forgetting it. Nice to have One less charger to carry
5,Xxx
5,This charges my Apple Watch very well! Only problem is finding a good position so the watch stays on the charger. I found that getting the charger in a position so the watch sits on top works best.
5,Charges quickly enough and takes up no room.
5,I like that it is small
5,small and easy to use no cablesthe beauty of this is that you can use any usb charging port even in your cari used a 2 port charging block at a recent hotel stay and was able to place this vertical and it had no trouble holding my watch allowing "night stand mode"will get more
3,This item will not charge your watch unless it is powered into your computer or a charging bank.This is something that folks need to know.  I almost returned it until my daughter figured out that this little device must be charging itself while charging your watch.  It doesn't charge your apple watch independently and on it's own.  It needs power one way or the other to charge your watch.  This info ought to be displayed on the specifications or product information page but it is not!
5,I absolutely love my new charger!
5,I found the original charger that came with the Apple Watch inconvenient for travel because it‚Äôs just one extra long cord to be dragging around. This little charger is only a couple of inches long and  it works just as well from what I can see! If you want to travel light this is a great little item to have. I find it charges my watch just as rapidly as the original charger.
5,Use with my Apple Watch 3 and it‚Äôs perfect!
5,Lack of space no problem‚Ä¶ works great
5,Greatest Thing I have purchased
5,I connected it in the car because I always forget a cable in the car. This I just plug in and leave there. Superb!
5,This is a great backup charger.  My watch battery seems to go out whenever I don‚Äôt have the cord to charge. I keep this in my purse so I can charge it anytime. I love it and will probably get one for my boss. üòâ
5,Had this device for six months.  No issues. Charge in the car or on my laptop.
5,Useful
5,Bought the Portable USB charger for my Apple watch recommended to me by my boss. Absolutely love this. So easy for travel and charges fast.
5,Quite convenient! Easy to take along no pesky cord and in the age of prolific USB outlets it provides a quick charge.
5,Love this little guy. SO much more convenient than a messy cord. Watch (3rd gen)  does not fall off even when vertical. Seems to charge in the same amount of time as the original cord.  I do find it charges much quicker when plugged in to a charging block than into my laptop. I‚Äôve read other reviews saying it stopped working after a few weeks. We‚Äôll see.
5,Great for on the go!
5,Works great and exactly what I needed for my watch so that I can take it with me and charge it at the camper or at work
5,Took 2 hours to charge an I-watch. Wasn‚Äôt a big deal because I had time but could be irritating if in a hurry.
5,I was getting frustrated with having to bring part of my Mac charger with me to charge my Apple Watch. This is extremely convenient and easy to use. Great price too.
2,Doesn‚Äôt work very wellI don‚Äôt recommend
4,The first one I ordered seemed to not work at all and would just get hot no matter which charger brick I used. I contacted customer service and they immediately sent a free replacement that arrived in just two days and works perfectly now. Excellent customer service!
5,I've had my portable wireless chargers for a little while now and I'm still just as impressed with them as I was when I first got them! It's been super reliable and charges my Apple Watch really quickly - I can get a full charge in just 2-3 hours which is great. I really like how lightweight and compact it is too - it's perfect for taking with me when I travel and means I don't have to worry about bringing a big and bulky charger with me. The cableless design is also great as it means I don't have to deal with tangled cables - it's just so much more convenient. Overall I'm really happy with this charger and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great wireless charger for their Apple Watch.
5,Loved this charger. Great for charging on the go.
5,Perfect for on the go travel or keep in your purse
5,Product works very well charges faster than expected.
5,Great buy  great for travel
4,Charger was easy to use and perfect for travel. My original apple watch charging cable is hooked up to a charging stand so its a pain to remove it from the stand for travel purposes. This charger is easy to put in travel cable bags and works well with wireless power banks. Downside is that it takes a longer time to charge my watch as opposed to the original charging cable but will still be fully charged if you I it on the charger overnight. Overall great buy and currently in use on my travels throughout the midwest.
1,Magnet is not strong enough to keep the watch attached in any other position other that laying flat.
5,I have a small area in the front of the car for charging.  This fit in there perfectly (I was worried it would be too big) so I will be able to charge my phone on the go if needed.
5,This little thing works great is cheap and small. I recommend for charging my Apple Watch. Not the fastest charger but it will get the job done. The magnet is strong enough to hold the watch on.
4,The media could not be loaded.
5,very quick charging for my Apple watch!
4,Love this item .I travel a lot and this charger is compact and very durable.would definitely recommend
5,Awesome!!
5,Small easy to pack for a trip. So much nicer than taking my normal charger from home. Good purchase!
5,Easy to use; fast charging for my watch.
5,So convenient.  Charges really fast!
5,Works exactly as it is explained. I love it. I‚Äôll never buy another regular corded watch charger again! It‚Äôs small out of the way. No cords. GREAT 2 thumbs up! üëçüèªüëçüèª
5,So far so good .. I just received it and only used it once in my laptop‚Ä¶ but I love it already ‚Ä¶ great idea‚Ä¶ I bought the bundle deal .. all 3 of them .. different types of chargers for the Apple Watch and iPhone
5,Great product! Works as expected. Will buy more.
5,This charger can literally fit in pockets backpacks traveling camping and even they can be attached to a keychain which I find very handy. I would recommend it to anyone wondering if it is worth it or not.
5,Muy servicial
5,Outlets were sideways and it held perfectly!
2,Purchased multiple. Half didn‚Äôt work. Didn‚Äôt bother returning but glad I checked all since they were going to be stocking stuffer presents for Christmas
2,Wouldn‚Äôt but again this is very slow charging. Would buy again
5,My cats don‚Äôt chew cords except every single Apple Watch charger cord I‚Äôve ever bought. üò©5 cords later I finally found this! Works well and so easy to travel with.
5,Love that this charger is small compact & doesn‚Äôt look like your typical charger as well. It more so resembles a USB memory stick which personally I find it to be more appealing
5,I love this portable apple watch charger! It fits right on my lanyard with the rest of my keys and it isn't too heavy. It is so convenient to have this right on my lanyard when needed.
4,it is OK but heats up.
5,So far works perfectly and great for traveling
3,Love the size and portability of this charger for my iphone watch.  My only complaint is that it gets my watch really HOT while charging.  Passed the return window so hopefully this will last for another trip.
5,Ok
5,forgot my charger and had amazon deliver to hotel! it works great and was a lifesaver to use my watch while I was away.
1,intermittent Charging
5,Es f√°cil de llevar en los viajes.
5,I like  this item because it is small and it does charge the iwatch very quickly..
5,I saw this on Instagram and thought this would be perfect because I hate cords. It plugs right in and you just put your watch on top of it. No more cords on my kitchen counter. Surprised at the quality for such a low price!
5,Tengo uno para la casa pero es mas grande y me ocupaba mas espacio para viajes.  Este es peque√±o y lo puedo poner en mi laptop o en un toma corriente con el conector de usb.
5,Great addition to my travel accessories (next to my universal multi connector cable and my new power bank - see my other reviews). It is probably as small as you can get for an Apple Watch charger. There is just enough room to hold the watch when it's plugged in but it does the job well.
5,I went camping and this came in handy . I now carry it everywhere just in case I need to charge my Apple watch. I absolutely love it .
1,It was not a very stable charge it just kept jump back and forth.  #Junk
5,This is such a convenient thing to have. Love how easy its to use and plug in. Super easy to carry around. No long strings attached üòÅ
5,Great product that allows an easy and simple way to charge your Apple Watch if there is a USB port available.
5,Takes up little space. Charges well. Fit my needs.
5,Perfect.
5,As advertised. Appears to be good construction and charges just as fast as my primary charger. No heating of charger or watch noticed so far. Good delivery.
5,I have only had to us it once so far. I got it for when I‚Äôm out and the battery dies. Charged from at 10% to and 100% in less then and hour. I found it charged faster then the one that came with it
5,I can charge my Apple Watch from a battery back using this. Pretty slick. Handy for the cottage.
5,It was small and the watch didn‚Äôt slip off when I plugged it in to the back of my iMac
5,Good product- Little over priced for what you get.Great to add to your key ring.
5,Online how small and easy it is to take and use anywhere
5,Works as designed. Very handy for your travel bag.
5,I liked the size and quality of the product.
5,So easy to useCompatible with any Apple chargers & McnooksLove it
5,It‚Äôs small snd practical love it
5,Reasonable price great value
5,Works to charge as expected
5,The charger is small and easy to carry around and charge on the go! Works well - happy with the product.
5,This is exactly what my wife needed as the battery on her Apple Watch wouldn't last the day when she's at work.
5,It‚Äôs good and works no cords
4,bon produit mais ca ne charge pas tres vite sur le port usb d'un pc portable ce qui est normal la puissance du port usb est faible
4,As promised but charges slow
4,Handy for in car charging. Make sure the USB connection is the right side up and the charger is not upside down it will fall on the floor.
3,I'm not sure what these other reviewers are reviewing here but this device took forever to even get a couple of percent of charge into my watch.  Ridiculously slow.  Maybe good for an overnight charge but if you were wanting a quick boost of charge to keep you going this device is not going to do it.
5,This charger works just as well as the apple branded Apple Watch charger.
5,Carino pratico funziona bene.Se uno deve trovare un difetto non essendo la calamita talmente forte da sorreggere il peso di un Apple Watch va trovato un ‚Äúmodo‚Äù di carica che permetta di caricare du un piano ..e dal ‚Äúlato giusto‚Äù‚Ä¶con una power bank ausiliaria posso ricaricare sempre comodamente ovunque io sia.
5,I like this little charger because it's very handy for travel. Plug it into my mobile power bank when I'm out. It's also fantastic when plugged into a USB wall outlet that has the USB on the bit that faces you not adjacent to the plug that way you can plug this in and rest your watch (face up) as it charges. Very happy with my purchase.
4,Was sent an empty bag on my first attempt and their customer service is awful.However Amazon refunded and I tried again.The design is effective and I appreciate no trailing wires. It‚Äôs easily able to support the watch wile charging.It‚Äôs a little slower than the apple charger. Also the magnetic attachment isn‚Äôt as strong so it doesn‚Äôt always fit properly and can dislodged. That‚Äôs resulted in it charging poorly and getting a little warm. A stronger magnetic connect might solve this issue.Overall I‚Äôm happy with it so far.
4,It charges and Apple Watch no problem but it gets really warm while doing so. It‚Äôs easy enough to travel with.
4,Very useful for people on the move. Can use it anywhere with a device such as a laptop or in any place which has a USB; however it does not retain charge.
4,Il faut juste faire attention pour q la montre ne glisse pas
1,I just tried to charge my watch for the first time. It will not charge. I plugged in my watch with a 50% battery life left. It took over an hour to get up to 60%. Half an hour later I checked it again and it dropped from 60% down to 54% while still on the charger the entire time. I do not recommend this product. I don't know if the one I received is defective - but this was a complete waste of money.
5,Wir haben drei Watches im Haus und irgendwie ben√∂tigt man immer ein Ladekabel in der N√§he. Vor allem wenn man mal eben das Wochenende wegf√§hrt kann man dieses Ladekabel/-ger√§t mal eben in die Tasche werfen. Das Ladeger√§t l√§dt minimal langsamer als das Originale was aber nicht st√∂rt da man als gelernter Watch Nutzer immer eine gewisse Zeit ohne Uhr klar kommt und die Ladezeiten eh meistens abpasst.Nat√ºrlich wird das Ger√§t leicht warm was aber auch bei den originalen Ladekabeln der Fall ist.Durch das √ºbliche magnetische Laden h√§lt die Uhr seitlich und sogar auf dem Kopf sodass je nach verwendetem Netzteil auch die Lage keine Probleme darstellt.PRO:KleinPasst in jede TascheKein KabelsalatPraktische SchutzkappeCONTRA:KeineInsgesamt - vor Allem f√ºr Reisen - ein super Ersatzladeger√§t!
5,F√ºr meine nagelneue Apple Watch brauchte ich ein neues Netzteil. Das Originalnetzteil ist nat√ºrlich noch nicht defekt das w√§re ja auch ein bisschen arg ungew√∂hnlich. Aber ich pendele zwischen zwei Wohnungen und kann nicht garantieren immer an mein Ladeger√§t zu denken.Nachdem ich das Netzteil inzwischen mehrere Tage im Einsatz hatte kann ich feststellen dass es ganz brav und unauff√§llig das macht was ein Netzteil soll: Es versorgt meine Apple Watch mit Strom. In irgendeiner Art und Weise negativ aufgefallen ist es dabei nicht. Die Verarbeitungsqualit√§t wirkt sehr hochwertig und unangenehme Ger√§usche gibt es auch nicht von sich. Es ist keinerlei Brummen Ziepen oder Kreischen zu vernehmen.Wenn ich es mit dem Originalnetzteil vergleiche dann besteht der gr√∂√üte Unterschied im T√úV GS-Siegel das das Originalnetzteil besitzt dieser Nachbau hingegen nicht. Wie viel dieses Pr√ºfzeichen wert ist und wie wichtig es ist muss jede und jeder letztlich f√ºr sich selbst entscheiden.Mein Fazit lautet also: Dieses Netzteil erh√§lt von mir das gr√∂√üte Lob das ein Netzteil bekommen kann und das ist die Feststellung dass es v√∂llig unauff√§llig seine Arbeit macht.
1,We purchased this for charging on the go; if it worked as advertised it would be great for travelling. HOWEVER! it overheats and takes forever to charge when it actually does work. You‚Äôre better off paying a little more for an official cable.
1,I bought this so I didn't have to bring my AppleWatch charger with me when I travel. I didn't use it until recently and it doesn't work but too late to return.
1,Will not charge watch
5,Molto pratico e soprattutto utile quando si √® in viaggio. Ottimo rapporto qualit√† prezzo.
5,Bene la comodit√† di portarlo in tasca per√≤ ci mette un po‚Äô per la ricarica
5,Rempli sa mission  l√©ger mais suffisamment qualitatif. A voir dans le temps et si besoin je modifierai mon avis
5,Dank dem H√§nkel super f√ºr den Schl√ºsselbund! ü§© als Schl√ºsselanh√§nger immer mit dabei & man kann seine Uhr immer laden! + Es kann kein Kabelsalat entstehen
5,Recharge rapide
5,Parfait
4,Compatto e comodo ma spesso la mattina trovo l‚ÄôApple Watch solo all‚Äô80% di carica e molto caldo.Come soluzione durante i viaggi va bene ma non per sostituire in toto il caricabatterie originale
5,Muy practico para el d√≠a a d√≠a que se descarga el reloj‚Ä¶
4,Fa quel che deve
4,Ladesteckers macht was er machen soll. Ein wenig warm wird das gute Teil sonst aber in Ordnung.
5,Funktioniert!
2,This was great for about the first 3 months I had it. It worked well and was great for traveling.Until it stopped charging my watch. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,I've used the charger for a while now or tried to but have reached a point where I have to give it up.  The form factor is good and on the surface it seems to be reasonably well built but the electronics don't seem to be up to the task as charging results are poor.  My Apple Watch appears to be charging as expected but leaving it overnight often results in only 20 to 25% charging.  In investigating it further it appears that the Watch starts a perpetual loop of starting to charge for a few moments (you see the 'charging' animation) and then back to not charging and then back to starting to charge.I've tried different charging adapters (i.e. Apple brick 3rd party battery packs etc.) and the result is the same with this charger.Hope this helps.
4,j ai command√© ce chargeur mais d√©√ßu car il ne fonctionnait pasLe vendeur a pris contact avec moi pour un remplacement du chargeurJ attends de voir si ma montre pourra de nouveau se charger avec le mini chargeur tr√®s pratique pour emmener de partoutMerci
5,Excellent for our motor home.  Takes up no space & works very effectively.
4,Rispetto all‚Äôoriginale la potenza di ricarica √® un po‚Äô bassa e ci mette a ricaricare
5,Para uma emergencia serve o relogio encaixa no iman e fica seguro o tempo de carregamento √© lento (apple watch 7)
5,Facile da trasportare insieme al notebook per non restare mai a secco di carico con Iwatch.
5,Good product and worth to have
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I had a goodman‚Äôs apple watch charger that didn‚Äôt work or charge my Apple Watch and I was looking for something small and effective and not costly. I liked the device the only thing I found awkward was it had to charge flat or the watch will drop if you charge it directly from the socket you‚Äôll probably need an extension lead then you can charge it flat other than that works ok does the job great for travelling or a temporary charger if you decide to get the official Apple Watch charger at a later date
5,Habe mir das Ladeger√§t als Zweitger√§t zugelegt und muss sagen es macht was es soll. Die Bewertungen dass die Watch beim Ladevorgang hei√ü wird sind vielleicht korrekt. Ich hatte das zuerst auch als ich es jedoch an einem anderen Netzteil probierte war die Watch innerhalb k√ºrzetser Zeit geladen und sie wurde auch nicht hei√ü. Was die Zeit bringt wird sich zeigen. Ich bin jedenfalls im Moment froh eine M√∂glichkeit gefunden zu haben die Watch unterwegs problemlos laden zu k√∂nnen zur Not mit einer Powerbank. Und das zu einem wirklich akzeptablen Preis.
4,Produit tr√®s pratique pour des voyages facile √† transporter
5,Lo porto sempre con me e quando il mio Apple Watch non mi misura pi√π i parametri perch√© scarico con questo posso ricaricarlo velocemente senza perdere nessun dato
1,This charger is very slow and creates way too much heat
4,Pratique simple et discret. Contente de mon achat. A voir dans le temps
4,Stavo cercando da tempo una soluzione che non fosse il classico caricatore con filo e prolunga USB. Questo √® compatto e ha incluso un piccolo cappuccio di gomma per evitare sporco e urti.molto pratico se utilizzato con prese orizzontali se l‚Äôattacco USB √® in verticale specialmente con un cinturino metallico come il mio un po‚Äô pesante fatica a restare magnificamente attaccato alla casa dell‚Äôorologio‚Ä¶ Non √® mai caduto ma per precauzione serro il cinturino quando lo carico.Tutto sommato in termini di  qualit√†/prezzo  lo ritengo un ottimo prodotto
5,Praktisch
5,Tut was es soll. Wird nicht warm. Ist sein Geld wert. Nutze es als Zweitladeger√§t und bin zufrieden.
4,I like the compact size to travel it charged apple watch well!it worked with battery pack same size as my iphon which has the wireless charging built in again is compact to carry when I need it till I arrive to hotel then top up battery pack again to keep everything running as we know Apple Watches needs top up every day! Great little device!
3,The one I‚Äôve just bought works but only when connected to a QC power supply. On a 2.4 W port it won‚Äôt charge my series 6 Apple Watch. As long as I make sure the watch is snug against the charger - in my case by keeping the elastic strap on and putting a toothpaste tube box under the charger with the watch band around them both - then the watch doesn't overheat while charging
5,Chargeur pour ma Watch !üëçsuper
3,Good charger but it doesn‚Äôt charge fast!
5,I hate having to grab my watch charger from my bedside table when my battery runs low. This slots into my laptop and charges while I'm at my desk. Great to throw in your travel bag too.
5,Tut genau das was es soll und ist dabei auch noch g√ºnstig.Gerade wenn man oft verreist ist das kleine Apple Watch Ladeger√§t perfekt.Verarbeitung top.
4,Pratique en voyahe l√©ger et ne prend pas de place. Par contre chauffe beaucoup je ne sais pas si cela est g√©nant ou pas.
4,Fa il suo dovere la carica avviene in tempi pi√π lenti rispetto al caricatore originale si riscontra un leggero surriscaldamento del caricatore e del watch ma non eccessivamente rilevante. Il caricatore √® piccolo e pratico per viaggi o da tenere nello zainetto in caso di emergenza. Acquisto consigliato!
5,EDIT vom 29.9.2022:Aufgrund meiner unten stehenden Rezension hat mich der Kundenservice kontaktiert und mir angeboten ein Austausch-Ger√§t zu senden. Tats√§chlich sind meine Probleme damit gel√∂st:- Der Magnet ist deutlich st√§rker als bei meinem urspr√ºnglichen Artikel. Meine Apple Watch Gen 4 h√§lt jetzt auch am Puck wenn der USB Stecker auf dem Kopf steht - was bei einer in der Steckdose integrierten USB-Buchse im Hotel schon einmal vorkommen kann.- Die Uhr wird vollst√§ndig geladen habe kein Abbrechen des Ladevorgangs mehr gehabtDeshalb erh√∂he ich jetzt gerne meine Rezension auf die vollen 5 Sterne.-------Obsolet - unten stehend meine vorherige Rezension:Wie viele anderen auch stoppt bei meiner Apple Watch (4. Gen.) der Ladevorgang bei ca. 90% und startet dann immer wieder mit dem Verbindungs-Gong der Watch. Sehr st√∂rend wenn nachts um 2:00 lieber schlafen m√∂chte.Der verbaute Magnet ist deutlich schw√§cher als der vom Original-Ladepuck leichte Ersch√ºtterungen reichen bereits dass die Uhr sich l√∂st laden ist somit nur m√∂glich wenn das Ladeger√§t absolut waagerecht steht und die Uhr gerade darauf liegt - das schr√§nkt die Einsatzm√∂glichkeiten ein.
5,Ottimo non sembra scaldare tenuta forte anche in verticale. Rapido. Consigliato
5,la compra lleg√≥ un d√≠a antes de lo previsto. Est√©ticamente es muy chulo y carga bien el reloj. Me parece una buen√≠sima compra.
3,Una buona idea ma ho qualche dubbio  dovuto alla poca attrazione magnetica per tenere fermo il watch
5,Piccolo comodo maneggevole. Usb quindi facilmente utilizzabile nei pc o nelle prese di ricarica. Ideale per le prese in macchina spesso la carica non dura tutta una giornata quindi √© molto utile averlo a portata di mano. √â stato cos√¨ utile che ne no preso ben due.
4,Really handy little charger
5,Bought as a last minute purchase for my holiday abroad. When you only have hand luggage every bit of space counts! This is great to chuck in a bag so I can charge my Apple watch on holiday.
3,Pratico da portare comodo per i viaggi.
5,Sempre meglio usare il carica originale ma in emergenza √® molto comodo e pratico.Consegna veloce venditore affidabile.
5,This is the first wireless charger that works with the Apple Watch 7.I am happy with its portability and design.Thank you from a happy customer.
5,Great to use for travelling fits with all USB charges fast and great when used with laptop.  Highly recommend. No lose cables no wires works well.
1,It looks great and I was so excited but it doesn't charge the watch.  According to the display it is charging but actually it just gets hot and drains the watch battery. Disappointing. Don't waste your money.
2,I bought 2 of these one for home use and one for at work.  I have had these for less than 4 months the first one crapped out at about the three month mark and the second about 3 weeks later
1,It was a convenient little charger for my truck. I could charge my watch during my commute to work and back home but it only lasted about two weeks. 100% do not recommend
5,way better than original watch charger
4,The charging is slow and it heats the watch more than originally charger but overall it was working and is a convenient key for traveling
1,I use it twice and same result every time.IWatch is getting very hot which is definitely not good for the device.It is very slow to charge.If you have to buy;  keep it as a last resort in your travel bag.Invest a bit more to get something who work fine.
2,Charge time is good.Fit into usb is poor as the fit is loose.Watch and charger get very hot within 5 min.Magnet strength is average. Not as strong as apple‚Äôs charger. But watch won‚Äôt fall off.
5,Easy to use fast charge great for travel with Apple Watch
2,Overall the product is good but unfortunately they sent me the wrong colour . I paid more for the white and received the black one instead.
5,My watch is a bit warm after charging with this and it doesn‚Äôt get warm with my original charger. Other than that it is great.  CoMpact for traveling .
5,Pratique petit et efficace je peux recharger ma montre partout ou je vais (voyage) et dans l‚Äôauto achat pratique lorsque je suis a l‚Äôext√©rieur de chez moi.
5,Bought this to leave in my car (which has a couple of USB sockets) in case I need to charge my watch on the move; and this is perfect. It's small enough to fit in my pretty full glove box in case I need it.
3,Have only tried it once to see if and how it workedWorked as promised not as fast a charge as my apple chargerBut it works!
1,I bought two of these.  Neither one works.I have an Apple Watch Series 5 and tried both on it.  Regrettable purchase.
1,With a variety of power sources tested it is at best half as far as the adapter that came with my Apple Watch series 5.
1,It gets hot and then fries the charge. Funny how others claim it works well for them. Lemon?
5,Tr√®s satisfaite
3,Carino comodo ma si surriscalda molto e come tempo di ricarica non √® cos√¨ veloce .. x ricariche occasionali per√≤ v√† bene
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Good convenient and efficient product convenient at home and in the car great for travel
4,Die Ladeleistung ist nat√ºrlich nicht so gut wie beim Original Apple Ladeger√§t. Aber wenn man unterwegs ist hat dieser Stick schon seine Vorteile‚Ä¶ mit mehr Leistung w√§re er perfekt
5,Onestamente non comprendo le recensioni negative per questo prodotto.Io lo trovo comodo efficiente e anche grazioso.Ha una caratteristica che non si pu√≤ sottovalutare ed √® il laccetto in stoffa che ti permette di allacciarlo alle chiavi per poterlo portare sempre con te. La semplicit√† d'uso √® indubbia apri il coperchietto e infili l'usb al pc pi√π facile di cos√¨? √à calamitato quindi basta avvicinare lo smartwatch e si attacca in automatico la maggior parte delle volte al punto giusto senza doverlo aggiustare. Qualche volta ho dovuto spostarlo di qualche millimetro per farlo aderire bene e non la vedo una grossa difficolt√† perch√© dovrei pensare che non funzioni solo per questo?Davvero non capisco queste recensioni. Inoltre Nonostante non sia il caricatore ufficiale carica l'orologio abbastanza velocemente per poterlo rimettere al polso dopo un'oretta.Io lo trovo super comodo e super efficiente.E lo consiglio senz'altro a chi ha l'incredibile pazienza di spendere una frazione di secondo ogni tanto per dare un tocchetto per aggiustare la posizione e farlo caricare üòÅRibadisco tra i miei oggetti tech economici preferiti. Sicuramente nella top 5
5,Carga bien y sin calentar el reloj. Es agradable al tacto y se adapta bien a Iwatch SE
2,I was looking for a charger for an Apple Watch Series 6 that is portable enough to carry around in my everyday bag preferably with no cables involved. In general I wouldn't have considered a charger that is not MFI-certified but I decided to give this one a go as it costs 1/3 of the price compared with other brands and there are a swarm of reviews complimenting this charger. I've tried to keep my expectations low as I knew that it would be a slow charger (it is mentioned repeatedly in most of the reviews). However many other issues made me quit on this one:1. the magnet was not strong enough and as a result I could charge the Apple Watch safely only if the charging side was in a horizontal position looking upwards. if I was using a USB power adapter that would position the charging side vertically or in a horizontal position with the charging side looking sideways the Apple Watch can start slipping and it was susceptible to displacement even in light vibrations.  The rubber cap did help in certain situations but again it was far from ideal to expect your ¬£400+ Apple watch to stay in position because of a rubber cap.2. The charger tends to warm up and made me concerned about the safety of the sensors of the Apple Watch.3. The charge seems to slow down and would stop when it would reach around 75%. Not sure why if that was because I was impatient and didn't give it extra time to finish the charging or it was some issue with the specific charger. In any case considering that took more than 2 hours each time to get from 10-15%  to 75% of charge that was not particularly helpful.In any case it still works and does it's job sort of and it is very portable. Personally however I've decided to bite the bullet and get an MFI-certified charger.
5,C‚Äôest le deuxi√®me que j‚Äôach√®te apr√®s avoir achet√© un pour moi !et qui  fonctionne tr√®s bien  et tr√®s peu encombrant . Ma femme me le prend souvent  alors j‚Äôai d√©cid√© de lui en prendre un pour elle la qualit√© est au rdv !!! Vous pouvez y aller les yeux ferm√©s !üëçüëçüëç
5,Ich fand es l√§stig das ladekabel jedesemal mitzunehmen ich suchte eine gute Alternative ein Freund empfahl mir dieses Ladeger√§t. Klein handlich und f√§hrt immer im Koffer mit.
5,Macht was es soll  l√§dt 1A
5,Handlich und kompakt da kann die iWatch auch mal an das BT-Radio im Auto angeschlossen werden um sie unterwegs mit gen√ºgend Ladung zu versorgen falls man mal zu Huase vergessen hat sie anzudocken. Dieses kleine Helferlein ist mir sogar lieber als der "Original-Puck" der blo√ü einen USB-C-Stecker hat. USB-A ist doch (noch) viel weiter verbreitet. Habe zwei gekauft einen f√ºr zu Hause den anderen f√ºr unterwegs und kaufe demn√§chst noch einen f√ºrs B√ºro. Super Sache zum kleinen Preis. Allerdings empfehle ich noch eine USB-Verl√§ngerung. Steht der Computer ung√ºnstig oder auch im Auto kann man es noch besser handhaben. (Im auto mache ich noch nen Haargummi drum damit die Uhr sitzen bleibt wo sie soll.) Das Teil war genau was ich gesucht habe. Und nach √ºber einer Woche testen kann ich nur sagen: Es funktioniert! Uneingeschr√§nlte Empfehlung von mir!
5,Niente cavo che impicciano carica bene ma rispetto al l'originale della Apple scalda un pochettino
3,Die Bewertungen reichen ja von super bis mies daher habe ich es einfach mal getestet und komme zu folgendem Ergebnis im Einsatz mit meiner Apple Watch SE und diversen Ladeger√§ten und Kabeln:- Drehbarer Anschluss (okay nicht drehbar aber um 180 Grad gedreht trotzdem einsteckbar) erm√∂glicht Einsatz an jeder horizontalen USB-Buchse in PC Laptop Powerbank etc.- Gleichzeitig der Nachteil vertikale Buchsen sind nicht nutzbar. Niemals nicht nein es geht WIRKLICH nicht ! (au√üer man nimmt ein Kabel dazwischen macht das Teil aber sinnlos das kann der Apple-Adapter ja auch)- Uhr liegend auf dem Magnetteller klappt prima l√§dt ordentlich wenn auch LANGSAMER als das Orignal (wer da gegenrechnet dass es gleichschnell geht wie soll das gehen bei weniger Output in Watt ????)- Uhr aufrecht bei Einsatz auf der Oberseite eines Ladeger√§tes das in einer Steckdosenleiste auf dem Tisch steckt: GEHT NICHT !Hersteller hat hier tolle Erfindung mit der Gummikappe gemacht die als "Stabilisator" herhalten soll aber v√∂llig versagt einen Magneten einzubauen der ne SE-Watch halten kann.Sie rutscht sie f√§llt EGAL wie herum sie angelehnt wird und ob das Armband auf oder zu ist...Dem kann man nicht vertrauen und ne Apple Watch auf dem Boden ?  Nein !  Erfindung gut gedacht Umsetzung "Sechs - Setzen".- Erw√§rmung ist h√∂her als beim Original wenn auch marginal.Wird nicht "hei√ü" und brennt auch nicht l√§dt auch durchgehend ohne auszusetzen aber hey an einer Laptop-USB-Buchse mit eh nur wenig Ladestrom w√ºrde ich es nicht testen.Ich habe den Adapter nun meistens an einer Powerbank (ja die sind i.d.R. liegend und die Buchse daher horizintal) das klappt prima und bietet die M√∂glichkeit unterwegs mal ein paar Prozent Akkuladung nachzuschieben.F√ºr den t√§glichen Gebrauch oder als Haupt-Ladeadapter aber nicht zu empfehlen. Dann lieber den doppelten Preis f√ºr's doppelte Vergn√ºgen und eine Uhr die niemals runterf√§llt (Apples Mag h√§lt auch eine Watch SE √ºber Kopf fest ;-)  )Mal sehen ob das Teil die 30 Tage R√ºckgabefrist √ºbersteht....
5,I work in mental health and as part of my job I often sleep at work.  Due to this I chose to buy a charger that I can just leave in a drawer at work.This item is perfect as it‚Äôs very small works well and 1/3 of the price of the apple equivalent.It charges at the same speed as my other ( official) apple charger and I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend it to others.
5,Tr√®s pratique pour charger mon Apple Watch en voiture une fois install√© sur un chargeur d‚Äôallume cigare. Convient bien pour mon Duster ou la Twingo 3 de ma femme car l‚Äôallume cigare ou la prise USB sont sur le tableau de bord.La montre reste bien aimant√©e malgr√© les bosses ou dos d‚Äô√¢ne. Je recommande
5,Nachdem ich einmal l√§nger unterwegs war und vergessen hatte das Ladeger√§t mitzunehmen und darauf hin irgendwie Ersatz besorgen musste kam ich zu dem Entschluss dass eine andere L√∂sung her muss damit mir so etwas nicht noch einmal passiert. In diesem Produkt habe ich meine L√∂sung gefunden. Es ist klein und kompakt und seither immer in meiner Umh√§ngetasche dabei. Und es hat mir schon des √∂fteren gute Dienste geleistet. Es hat zwar einen USB A Anschluss kann aber in beide Richtungen eingesteckt werden. Es ist also unabh√§ngig davon wie rum der USB Port / die USB Steckdose angebracht ist. Wichtig ist nur dass Ger√§t einigerma√üen Waagerecht positioniert wird damit die Uhr gut aufliegt und das Ger√§t sie dementsprechend gut l√§dt. Ich war z.B. mal in einem Hotel in dem es USB Steckdosen in den W√§nden gab. Dort musste ich das Ger√§t nur in die Wand stecken und schon war es einsatzbereit. Dort wo das nicht so einfach geht nehme ich ggf. meine Powerbank oder z.B. einen Laptop mit USB A Port zur Hilfe und schon geht es auch dort.Bis jetzt hat mich das Ger√§t nicht im Stich gelassen oder entt√§uscht dementsprechend bin ich zufrieden.
5,Brought to keep on my keys for charging when I am out and about. I tend to use it most at work plugging it into my USB ports on my computer or while driving home in the car. It works well charging my apple watch within 2 hours. It appears its not as fast as the original charger but is half the price so to be expected. I like the compact nature of the charge much better than a longer and tangled cable on my desk.
4,Vernis qui marque assez vite mais √ßa n'entrave pas le fonctionnement.Petit chargeur qui se glisse partout pour avoir toujours de quoi recharger en cas de batterie vide en pleine journ√©e..
5,Bit dubious about the quality it would be but has worked really well very convenient as small and easy to plug in where you are. Highly recommend
3,Hat leider zu wenig Leistung und ist nicht qualitativ das beste
5,Small and perfect for traveling
4,E' molto comodo e funziona bene anche se la carica risulta essere pi√π lenta che con il cavo originale. Tutto sommato un buon acquisto.
5,J‚Äôai achet√© ce chargeur pour voyager . Et le mettre dans mon sac . Bilan ben m√™me √† la maison je ne m‚Äôen passe plu il est parfait !
5,Excellent
4,Comodidad y versatilidad creo funcionar√° aunque necesito un poco m√°s de tipo de uso para calibrarlo mejor
5,Needs a plug with a horizontal aperture to enable watch to lay over great for travel. No lead to tangle!
4,El √∫nico defecto que le pongo es que a veces es como si el reloj no se situase 100% bien y hay que ajustarlo un poco con la mano para que empiece a cargar pero por lo dem√°s va muy bien.Sin ser el m√°s peque√±o del mercado es suficientemente peque√±o y es el que mejor carga de los que he probado sin cable.La forma en que su USB se puede poner de un lado u otro indistintamente es fant√°stica como si fuese un USB-C pero para USB normal.Su precio adem√°s es muy bueno para lo que ofrece
5,Ce produit est conforme √† sa description. Suite √† un d√©part en vacances j‚Äôavais oubli√© mon chargeur d‚Äôapple watch 3. J‚Äôai donc command√© cet article en urgence. Il r√©pond parfaitement √† mes attentes petit l√©ger joli et efficace. Je l‚Äôai branch√© sur ma prise d‚Äôiphone et le chargement a √©t√© tr√®s rapide via prise √©lectrique. Je recommande ce chargeur.
4,Der Ladestecker ist f√ºr den mobilen Gebrauch gut geeignet. Klein handlich immer verf√ºgbar
4,Only recently bought this charger and used it twiceWatch sits firmly against charger when uprightGets a little warm but doesn‚Äôt affect charging from what I can tell so farHandy to carry around in my handbag for those low battery times when not at home
1,It‚Äôs a good add up to the spare charger section but the output is low really low. Charging sideways with a plug is risky and it‚Äôs better to keep the watch on a flat surface.I‚Äôd rather suggest to go for the original wire.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This thing is BRILLIANT! Watch sits perfectly and securely on it. Great in the car (no wires) and it sits securely there too. I also use it on my work PC and because it can be put onto a bunch of keys it means I always have it on Me! Can‚Äôt praise this enough. Great build quality compact and so easy to use without the faff! I can‚Äôt believe Apple didn‚Äôt come up with this. (Perhaps they did I don‚Äôt know).
4,Ladeleistung okay.Stylisch laden in rosa.Macht Spa√ü im B√ºro.
5,Es peque√±o y carga rapidoadem√°s no hace falta que est√© horizontal
5,Particularly cool that it goes into usb slots both ways round so you can always put the charging face on top. Have had this for several months and still working fine so I'm ordering more so there's always a watch charger around when I need one.
3,Es complicado de utilizar sin cable. No lo puedes poner en todos los enchufes . Recomendar√≠a venderlo con cable
5,I bought this as a handy charger to keep in my car for stays away from home so I don‚Äôt risk losing my 2m Apple charger. I got the light pink and it‚Äôs a gorgeous colour.The charger works really well. I can‚Äôt really comment on the speed as I charge my watch overnight but it definitely fully charged my device in that time.The magnet is fairly strong and the watch can be charged on its side and it will still stay put especially due to the handy shelf created by the usb cap.I would definitely recommend as a travel charger that takes up barely any space.
5,Dieses Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Uhr funktioniert einwandfrei und ist die perfekte L√∂sung f√ºr unterwegs.
5,Para viajar
4,Ist gut f√ºr unterwegs und l√§dt einwandfrei. Nur die Verschlusskappe ist echt schwerg√§nig.
3,Firstly I bought this as it was small matches my phone & watch colour.I had reservations about the magnet strength for charging anglesBut the add gives assurance that there is a good connection.There is not it charges and stays if you plug the usb into say a laptop but anything over 45 degrees in any direction and the watch will fall off.And it does get hotter than apple chargers.Does it hold magnetically? No (gravity prevails)Is it easy to use? Yes plug & play (if horizontal)Does it charge? YesDoes it get hot? YesDoes the watch get hot? Yes
5,Es c√≥modo y pr√°ctico. No es muy caro. Se calienta pero por lo que vale merece la pena
2,Dauert leider ewig bis die Uhr geladen ist. Sonst nicht schlecht.
5,Plugs into the Campervan usb with ease and small to put away easily.
5,Ce chargeur tout petit peut √™tre gliss√© dans une poche et il ne prend pas de place dans un cartable ou un sac √† main.C'est un moyen de d√©pannage tr√®s utile si on a mal positionn√© sa Watch pour la charger pendant la nuit et qu'on d√©marrage la journ√©e avec une Watch peu charg√©e.Si on n'a pas de PC portable o√π les prises USB sont positionn√©es √† plat (par exemple si on veut charger sur un port USB public sur un PC-tablette o√π la prise USB est en hauteur...) mieux vaut se munir d'une petite rallonge USB.
4,Good
5,Pour charger mon Apple Watch via une batterie externe.
5,A lovely nice bit of kit. This unit has the same charge power as a standard Apple Watch charger. It‚Äôs magnetic properties mean that you an wall charge your watch. I use it at work to give my watch a charge while I‚Äôm working at my desk.Would I recommend‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Yes definitely!!
5,Fantastic item
5,Wie schon erw√§hnt l√§dt das Ger√§t die Apple Watch vern√ºnftig. Einzig wird die Uhr etwas warm nach dem Ladevorgang was beim Original Ladeger√§t nicht der Fall ist aber f√ºr den Preis f√ºr mich in Ordnung gibt es schlimmeres.
3,es c√≥modo el tama√±o pero el im√°n no es muy potente y a veces se suelta. Otras veces el reloj se calienta y no carga
5,This is a brilliant bit of kit‚Ä¶ my original cable is connected to a dock by the bed I wanted something to take away with me camping hotel abroad‚Ä¶ This item is easily included in your packing or just carried in your pocket. The watch charges just the same as on the original cable. Brilliant!
3,Le chargeur de poche pour ne plus √™tre pris au d√©pourvu cependant le chargement via l'induction est tr√®s lent. Je l'ai mis dans ma voiture.
5,Used mine when camping for two weeks we had electric hook up on a 10 amp feed.. it took about half an hour more than normal to fully charge my series 6 from 20 per cent.. I also (on long drives) plugged it into the cigarette lighter usb thingy and that charged it quickly too.. when I say quickly I don‚Äôt mean fast er than usual but better than any other non apple specific brand.. small enough to carry around.. fantastic product
5,Only used it once but seems to work fine compact and easy to use great for travelling
4,I helps charge up your iwatch but not as good as the real thing but a good backup quite sturdy feeling and small and compact if you don‚Äôt want cables.
4,Eine super L√∂sung f√ºr unterwegs oder als Zweitladeger√§t. L√§dt leider nicht so schnell wie das Originale aber durchaus verwendbar. Empfehle es weiter.
4,Bonjour alors pour les personnes qui pensent que le produit ne fonctionne pas et ce d√©connecte j‚Äôai pens√© la m√™me chose avant de m‚Äôapercevoir qu‚Äôil y a un morceau de plastique √† retirer sur la face de charge une fois ce dernier retir√© √ßa fonctionne tr√®s bien. Je suis satisfait du produit !
4,Utile per caricarlo quando sei in macchina o al PCpiccolo e comodo
5,Carga a una velocidad media. Como el cargador original de Apple. Es s√∫per practico ya que por su tama√±o lo llevo en el bolso e incluso en el bolsillo de los vaqueros. Genial!!
2,Although the design of this charger is great (perfect for traveling) and it charges my watch quickly my watch gets so hot in the process that after three uses it‚Äôs going in the bin!Update August 2022: I have been contacted daily for the last week by a person asking me to take down my review on the promise of a ¬£50 gift card. They have tried to use guilt by claiming my review will cause their company to go bankrupt leaving them unable to feed their children. Really disappointed that this kind of harassment is allowed for a genuine review of a substandard product.
3,Buon prodotto molto comodo viste le dimensioni ridotte; unica pecca √® la bassa velocit√† con cui carica e la bassa potenza del magnete che spesso rende difficile il posizionamento dell'Apple Watch. In ogni caso se volete un caricatore piccolo e portatile a basso prezzo ve lo consiglio.
5,Easy to plug into usb plug with no wires
5,Perfekt f√ºr unterwegs geeignet. USB im Auto super
5,Lo utilizo cuando viajo y lo llevo al trabajo cumple al 100% lo deseado. Adem√°s es muy c√≥modo al no tener que cagar con otro cable kilometrico
4,Oggetto molto comodo ma si usura facilmente se tenuto vicino alle chiavi
4,Prompt service .The item is as described . Super fast shipping.
4,Okay as a portable device although a bit awkward to plug in certain usb plugs like the standard Apple one. Had to get a flat horizontal one for the watch to stay put. No issues with charging on s3 however no fact charging on s5
5,Ich hab mir das Ger√§t zum Laden meiner APPLE WATCH im Au√üendienst bzw. auf Reisen gekauft einfach an einen USB-Port (z.B. am Laptop / MacBook) anschlie√üen Uhr auflegen und sie wird geladen.Gutes Produkt jederzeit wieder.Versand und Verpackung waren auch einwandfrei (nicht wie manchmal total √ºbertrieben und mehr M√ºll als Produkt)
2,Malo
4,Super pratique. Plus de c√¢ble qui tra√Æne et les chutes ne seront plus possible.
2,Piccolo e pratico per il resto confermo ci√≤ detto da altri recensori ferma la carica dell‚Äôorologio sempre all‚Äô80 % scalda tanto e ci mette un po‚Äô a caricare. Possiedo un 7 gps 45 mm.
4,Na
5,Excellent for travel just takes longer to charge than expected but a great little addition to my travel pack
5,perfekt f√ºr unterwegs
5,Super praktisch zum Laden der Apple Watch ohne lange Kabel mitzunehmen. Passt am Schl√ºsselanh√§nger und ist immer verf√ºgbar
5,Great for work one less cord hanging around
5,Arrivato da poco l'ho usato subito. bellissima confezione materiali ottimi.Davvero un bellissimo prodotto
1,Ich kaufte dies um auf Reisen ein Apple Watch Ladeger√§t in bequemer Gr√∂√üe zu haben. Obwohl ich nicht erwartet hatte dass dies ein Schnellladeger√§t wie das der Apple Watch beiliegende ist arbeitet dieses Ladeger√§t so langsam dass es die M√ºhe nicht wirklich wert ist. Selbst nachdem es die ganze Nacht (8 - 10 Stunden) am Ladeger√§t gelassen wurde hatte es nicht einmal mehr als 20% aufgeladen.Update: Nach anderthalb Monaten ist das Produkt komplett tot.
5,Mi serviva qualcosa di comodo per i viaggi. Anche se non ha la stessa potenza di carica di quello originale fa il suo dovere. Occupa poco spazio lo uso in auto o in viaggio.
5,Ich habe mir den Apple Watch USB Charger gekauft um meine AW6 w√§hrend der Fahrt im Auto mal nachladen zu k√∂nnen wenn die Batterie fast leer ist. Gleich in schwarz gekauft damit es auch zur Innenausstattung passt. Passt 1a im Audi A1 GB. Kann ich nur weiter empfehlen.
5,Cercavo un caricabatterie secondario da tenere in valigia o nello zaino ho trovato questo modello ultra compatto (cos√¨ evito di ingarbugliare il cavo) tascabile con la possibilit√† di caricare Apple Watch senza problemi.Io ho la versione da 40mm e riesco a caricarlo anche in verticale per esempio nella presa USB dell'auto.Risulta molto pi√π comoda la ricarica in orizzontale collegandolo alla porta USB di un PC per esempio.Consigliato come carica secondario perch√© quello a cavo risulta sempre la soluzione pi√π valida.
5,Die Ladezeit ist etwas l√§nger als beim original Ladeger√§t aber als Reise- oder Ersatzladegr√§tist es zu Empfehlen.F√ºr den Preis ist es ein gutes Ladeger√§t
4,Could do with being a bit stronger
5,per ricaricare il proprio apple watch.La calamita √® potente e ricarica abbastanza velocemente.Io l'ho preso per poterlo avere sempre con meConsigliato
4,De momento todo bien con el es c√≥modo depende donde lo pongas a cargar sea fuente de luz o pc tarda mas o menos compra correcta.
5,Very Handydoes the job
3,Will only charge watch to 15%. Gets too hot to continue use.Wouldn‚Äôt bother
5,Fa egregiamente il suo dovere. Il magnete non √® potente come il caricatore Apple ma posiziona correttamente l'orologio basta tenerlo orizzontale e non inclinarlo troppo.Del resto costa anche meno la met√† dell'originale Apple ed √® pi√π comodo in viaggio perch√® non ha il cavo.Per quelli che dicono che carica lentamente.... Avete mai verificato in quanto tempo si ricarica l'orologio con il cavo originale? Forse no.
3,La montre gagne 30% par heure ce qui est peu (80% avec le chargeur Apple d'origine)6 tests r√©alis√©s avec diff√©rentes alimentations et batteries externes m√™mes r√©sultats.Produit pratique √† laisser dans un sac mais il faudra pr√©voir 3 heures 30 pour charger la montre enti√®rement.ex : 56% √† 10h13 88% √† 11h19. (batterie externe PD)38% √† 18h33 70% √† 19h37. (alimentation 65W)8% √† 8h11 42% √† 9h17 (alimentation apple 30W)
3,Habe erst einmal die Watch 5 damit geladen. Dies hat gut funktioniert mir fiel jedoch auf dass das Ladeger√§t deutlich w√§rmer wird als das originale Ladeger√§t. Deshalb habe ich auch einen Stern abgezogen.Ich werde weiterhin mit dem originalen Zubeh√∂r laden und dieses wirklich nur wenn mal not am Mann ist verwenden. Der Preis ist aber ok f√ºr mich. Nachtrag - nachdem ich es jetzt zwei- drei Mal benutzt habe habe mich entschlossen den Wireless Charger zur√ºck zu senden. Die Uhr wird extrem hei√ü. Das kann nicht gut sein f√ºr die Watch.
3,El cargador est√° de muy buen tama√±o y se ve bien hecho pero carga lent√≠simo.
5,Fait le job‚Ä¶accroch√© au porte cl√© plus de pb de batterie pour ma montre
4,Got it for travelling - specifically wanted to be able to use it with a USB power pack. It works although it does charge significantly slower than the original Apple iWatch 6 charger even though the power packs outlet is rated at 2.4A. I can live with that as it seems well made and does the job.
4,Fa quello che deve unica pecca non avere la possibilit√† di girare a piacimento il verso della ricarica. Perch√© il resto ok
4,Ocupa poco espacio. Para llevar en el bolso y cargar el reloj en caso de quedarte sin bater√≠a
5,Auf Dienstreise oder Urlaub wollte ich nicht immer mein kabelgebundenes Ladeger√§t ein- und auspacken. So habe ich mich entschlossen diesen kleinen Ladestecker zu kaufen.Die Verarbeitung ist solide und von guter Qualit√§t. Einen USB Anschluss findet man √ºberall und kann die Uhr problemlos laden. Der Magnet h√§lt die Uhr beim Laden jederzeit sicher auf dem Pad.Der Kauf hat sich gelohnt und ich w√ºrde den Ladestecker wieder kaufen!Update 13.09.2021Das Ger√§t arbeitet noch immer perfekt.Ich habe hier Bewertungen gelesen wonach das Laden zu lange dauert. Entscheidend f√ºr die Ladezeit ist m.E. Welche Ausgangsleistung die benutzte USB Buchse hat.
5,Perfect little travel one to take in the car or away
1,It felt sturdy looked good and was an ideal size. However it frequently overheated and most mornings I‚Äôd find it didn‚Äôt even fully charge my watch over nine hours.
5,Ho cercato molto un‚Äôalternativa al mio caricabatterie iWatch che fosse comoda per viaggiare e sono certa di aver dato un‚Äôottima scelta. Usato caricabatterie funziona davvero benissimo √® comodissimo da tenere sempre in borsa e carica quasi alla stessa velocit√† di quello originale. L‚Äôunica accortezza da avere √® di utilizzarlo tenendolo piatto in modo da poter appoggiare l‚ÄôiWatch in orizzontale (perch√© in verticale non mantiene abbastanza a lungo il contatto). Acquisto decisamente consigliato.
5,Caricatore di ottima fattura ricarica molto rapidamente e senza alcun tipo di problema il mio Apple Watch materiali di qualit√† e rifiniture molto curate inoltre le dimensioni molto ridotte lo rendono leggero e facile da trasportare si pu√≤ utilizzare sia con un Powerbank (quindi ottimo per i viaggi) ma anche con la presa da muro.Ottimo prodotto lo consiglio a tutti
5,Schnelle Lieferung! Ich suchte ein handliches Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Apple Watch und hab es gefunden. Pa√üt in jede Jackentasche und durch den USBAnschluss auch sehr kompatibel! Bei mir l√§dt es bislang sehr schnell. Bin zufrieden
5,Very compact and convenient charging hung on the keychain and always at hand..!üëå
4,It does work however the watch does not sit in the charger effectively also feels slightly cheap in build quality
5,carica molto piu' lentamente rispetto all'originale ma..........non scalda orologio e dura di piu la carica......
5,I use when travelling or at work easy to charge when on the go from laptop or plug.Good buy this one.
4,Bien en secours charge plus lente et tendance √† chauffer mais fait l‚Äôaffaire .
5,Endlich ein Ladeger√§t f√ºr meine Apple Watch das man locker in der Tasche mitf√ºhren kann das und √ºberall funktioniert. Falls man einen Laptop besitzt kann man es direkt an die USB Buchse anschlie√üen falls man einen richtigen Rechner besitzt (als ein MacBook & Co.) steckt man das Teil an einen USB-Adapter ;-)Hat man einen mobilen Akku dann daran. M√∂glichkeiten gibt es viele und man spart sich das teure Apple-Ladekabel als Zweitger√§t f√ºr Urlaub und Dienstreise. Die Ladedauer ist meiner Meinung nach identisch zum Original mit Stecker. F√ºr die paar Euro eine eindeutige Empfehlung.
5,√à la cosa migliore che ho potuto comprare. La mia Watch la carico solo ancora con questo.la ricarica √® ultra veloce e funziona perfettamente.lo posso consigliare al 100%!
5,Piccolo per√≤ fa bene il suo lavoro
5,J‚Äôai pas mal h√©sit√© sur tout ceux propos√©s par Amazon. Je voulais juste un chargeur de secours pour le travail.Fort pratique car se branche partout en usb et pas de probl√®me de fils qui s‚Äôab√Æme.La recharge est bien s√ªr plus lente que le chargeur officiel et chauffe un peu plus. Mais tout cela reste raisonnable surtout en chargeur de secours.
5,Schnelle Lieferung gutes Produkt. Klein handlich - alles perfekt!
5,I really like this adaptor. Great value easy to pack. Worked great on my first trip.
2,L‚Äôidea non √® male e mi aveva tratto per la sua semplicit√†.il risultato √® il seguente: ho inserito il mio Apple Watch completamente scarico e ho trovato in primo luogo una certa difficolt√† a far s√¨ che attaccasse nel modo giusto. Dopo alcuni tentativi l‚ÄôApple Watch si √® finalmente messo nella posizione corretta ed √® partita la carica visibile dal quadrante dell‚Äôorologio. Dopo una notte intera in carica la mattina mi sono ritrovato il telefono a meno del 25% di carica. Possiamo quindi dire che se vi aspettate un device di emergenza in grado di mantenere in vita la carica del vostro Smart Watch in modo da non rimanere a zero potrebbe anche essere utile. Se vi aspettate un‚Äôalternativa al vero caricatore assolutamente no! Diciamo che la difficolt√† nel trovare il setup iniziale (mi aspettavo che bastasse poggiarlo come su qualunque caricatore) e la estrema lentezza ne decretano senza appello un giudizio di oggettiva scarsit√†
5,Perfect small and a great idea with the cap to position and hold the watch in any scenario. I have used it in the car on my car usb port to charge the watch while driving (it won't count any steps there anyway) or on long hikes with my battery pack. Works perfectly is small shipped fast durable can be used as a key ring addon and the magnet is strong enough to hold the watch in place together with the silicon cap.Best Apple Watch charger I could find for me & my friends ordered a total of 3 pieces so far.
5,Es justo lo que se necesita en caso de emergencia para la carga o si vas de viaje no se calienta
4,come da titolo il prodotto √® arrivato gi√† aperto coi sigilli rotti. ma Amazon non dovrebbe trattare diversamente i resi?
2,Das Gera√§t ist zwar sehr praktisch in der Handhabung aber die Ladezeit ist f√ºr mich v√∂llig inakzeptabel.Deshalb ist das Teil schon wieder auf dem R√ºckweg.
2,This charger takes about five hours to charge my Apple Watch whereas my official Apple charger takes about 40 minutes
5,Excellent really pleased with this.  Would of been even better if it had a case for protection.  I just use the box it came in.
5,Small and easy to plug into any usb plug. Charges watch fine
5,Initially I was searching for a charging dock for my apple watch(series 1) and now Iam happy with this product‚Ä¶I will surely recommend this‚Ä¶.It saved lots of money‚Ä¶
1,Nat√ºrlich kein vergleich zum Original von Apple.Man mehrere versuche bis die Uhr dann wirklich l√§d...√§rgerlich wenn man es erst am n√§chsten morgen sieht dass die Uhr nicht geladen ist.Dazu l√§dt das es extrem langsam (wenn es √ºberhaupt l√§dt)UPDATE: Verk√§ufer schreibt seit gut paar Wochen mehrmals t√§glich Emails mit der Bitte um L√∂schung der Bewertung.Daf√ºr w√ºrde es dann auch 40‚Ç¨ als Amazon Gutschein geben.
5,Ladeleistung kann ich noch nicht einsch√§tzen aber f√ºr unterwegs super - Farbe ist Sand und nicht pink üòâ
5,Il dispositivo √® di buona qualit√† oltre che utile e di poco ingombro anche quando collegato al PC. La potenza di carica √© pi√π che adeguata per la ricarica dell‚ÄôApple Watch.
5,Ottimo rapporto qualit√† prezzo
3,Per emergenza va bene
4,Il prodotto e' valido e i materiali sembrano premium. Non si surriscalda e rimane molto portabile date le sue modeste dimensioni. Non metto 5 stelle solo perche' il magnete d'aggancio non e' proprio solidissimo.
1,Optisch fand ist das Ladeger√§t gut aber seitens der Nutzung ist dies schlecht. Die ersten zwei Monate hat sie komischerweise funktioniert. Jetzt wo keine R√ºcksendung mehr m√∂glich ist funktioniert es nicht mehr richtig.Die Uhr l√§dt nie vollst√§ndig auf wohl sie ganze Nacht auf dem Ladeger√§t liegt und die Uhr ist jedes Mal sehr hei√ü wenn ich sie von der Ladestation abnehme. Das kann nicht gut sein. Nicht kaufen!!!
5,I used this with with my Inuit power bank to charge my Apple Watch SE whilst on holiday in Cyprus and it worked fantastically.  Well recommended.
5,Je suis satisfaite de mon achat. Tout √† fait compatible avec mon Apple Watch 6.La montre tient √† la verticale (bon √©videmment il ne faut pas trop bouger le support).La charge est longue mais je n‚Äôai pas achet√© le produit pour cela. Je m‚Äôen sers le soir et √ßa me convient. En d√©placement c‚Äôest beaucoup plus pratique que le c√¢ble.
5,L√§dt gut und schnell praktisch zum mitnehmen das einzige was nervt zwischendurch muss man die Uhr irgendwie da dranh√§ngen und sich ein bisschen mit pr√ºgeln damit sie auch nicht runter f√§llt oder so auch wenn es magnetisch ist. Aber sonst perfekt.
4,Produit qui fonctionne bien n√©anmoins une rayure pr√©sente de base
5,Very good product low price. Highly recommend.
5,Comodisimo para cuando te tienes que llevar un cargador fuera de casa
5,It‚Äôs a life saver. Compact and easy to carry on your key ring. Fantastic.
5,Molto comodo da portare sempre al seguito. Funziona alla grande
5,Ho scritto come titolo fantastico perch√® realmente lo trovo cos√¨ piccolo con un magnete che tiene anche in verticale  comodo da tenere nello zaino per i viaggi .5 stelle nulla recriminare .Se trover√≤ difetti aggiorner√≤ la recensione
5,A veces tarda en cargar hay que decir que depende tambien del adaptador que uses pero va bastante bien. Y lo puedes llevar en cualquier sitio no tiene cables y te saca de un apuro
5,Es peque√±o y muy pr√°ctico el reloj no cae aunque est√© conectado en vertical.
3,Allem voran: das Ladeger√§t ist nat√ºrlich super praktisch da kein Kabel erforderlich ist welches auch nicht kaputt gehen kann oder sich verheddert. komischerweise wird das Ladeger√§t aber immer sehr hei√ü und w√§rmt dadurch auch die Uhr was mir ein wenig Unbehagen bereitet. Gleichzeitig l√§dt es die Uhr nach meinem subjektiven empfinden langsamer als das Original ‚Äì Ladeger√§t.
4,Stable en position horizon en verticale je suis relativement pas assez confiante peut-√™tre pas assez magn√©tique.Mais fonctionne tr√®s bien
5,Tolles gadget  Klein handlich und ohne Kabelgewirr.Einfach in USB stecken und laden. H√§lt Uhr auch in Schr√§glage beim Laden da Magnet stark genug ist.Super absolut top
3,Na ja
4,An Powerbank gut nutzbar. Direkt am Ladestecker nicht immer m√∂glich.
5,Ladet meine Apple Watch Series 3 einwandfrei auf. Perfekt als 2tes Ladeger√§t f√ºr unterwegs vor allem durch den USB-A Stecker welcher in beide Richtungen eingesteckt werden kann.Das Ladeger√§t und die Uhr werden aber im Gegensatz zum Original Apple-Kabel deutlich w√§rmer habe aber dadurch noch keinen negativen Effekt bemerkt.
1,Watch heats up and doesn‚Äôt charge well
5,Klasse Ladestation bin begeistert vor allem kein l√§stiges Kabel mehr.
5,Da ich viel unterwegs bin habe ich jetzt die optimale L√∂sung zum Aufladen der Apple Wach in Verbindung mit meiner Power Bank gefunden. Preis- Leistungsverh√§ltnis sehr gut . üëç
1,Bought this travel charger for my watch.  Had a few months with no problems.  No badly overheating no matter what it‚Äôs plugged in to.  Causes watch to overheat and shut down.  Have returned for refund.  Disappointed.
4,Gutes Ger√§t f√ºr unterwegs Ladezeit etwas lang
4,Bon produit fonctionne
5,Per i viaggi di lavoro mi serviva un carica iwatch senza fili da mettere nel case accessori. Che fosse compatto ed efficiente. Fino ad ora fa il suo dovere sta in un taschino e carica l‚Äôorologio senza problemi. Spero duri! Ricevuto in tempo e ben imballato con la solita efficienza Amazon.
5,Comodissima
1,Newly owner of Apple Watch S3I thought I needed a travel charger.Amazon prompt that it always delivered to me even faster than I expected.  This is where the good things are over.The leaflet says that it is compatible with S3 it's a joke the watch fits completely in the charger cavity you have to position it with your hand to sit in the center.Ok you can live with this but I was inspired to check the load after about 15 minutes danger.The watch had reached 75% and was burning like a radiator. The following charges (with original Apple cable and plug charger) stopped at 68% nothing more.  I hope I have no battery problems the warranty does not cover such experiments.In conclusion I do not give a valid general verdict but for Apple Watch S3 I do not recommend it.
5,It takes a while to charge but as long as your not in a rush it is ideal I would buy again
3,Pomal√© nab√≠jen√≠. Dost zah≈ôeje hodinky. Doba nab√≠jen√≠ min 2 hodiny.
5,Works a treat. Got some weight to it but a nice little package for charging watch while travelling. I found it got pretty warm but no dangerously and I left it charging overnight in a power bank with no issues for several nights. I love It‚Äôs design - very sleek and compact and looks more expensive then it is.Magnetic connection is good and sturdy.
4,Comodo da portare sempre con se
4,Para viajar lo mejor
5,Unterm Strich bin ich zufrieden mit dem Ladestecker ich habe ihn auf meinem Schl√ºsselbund montiert weil ich das original Ladekabel immer vergesse so habe ich ein Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Watch immer dabei eignet sich perfekt als Schl√ºsselanh√§nger.Einziger kleiner Nachteil - mir kommt vor der Stecker l√§dt ein wenig langsamer als das original Ladekabel deswegen nur 3 Sterne f√ºr die Ladeleistung sonst Top Produkt!
5,Ottimo
5,Hat prima geklappt Artikel sehr gut
5,Volevo un sistema piccolo e portatile per caricare Apple Watch in ufficio attaccandolo alla usb del computer e voil√†: piccolo benfatto con materiali robusti (almento cos√¨ sembra vediamo se durer√†) e pratico.Ha anche un piccolo anello/ cordino in simil pelle per poter essere attaccato ad esempio al porta chiavi (anche se come porta chiavi forse potrebbe diventare un pochino ingombrante e a contatto con le chiavi immagino potrebbe rovinarsi).
3,Molto comodo e bella l‚Äôidea ! Ma purtroppo basta un nulla per perdere la ricarica !  Per emergenza va bene
5,Perfettamente funzionante. Consigliato
5,Brilliant Apple Watches don‚Äôt hold a long charge and this little travel charger is perfect on my keychain for the days you need to charge your watch in between
3,poco pratico.l'orologio non sta attaccato bene e si sposta continuamente in pi√π di un'occasione ritrovi l'orologio un poco spostato e la ricarica interrotta.Dipende sia dal fatto che il magnete √® debole sia dal fatto che i ragazzi di Cupertino hanno pensato la parte inferiore dell'orologetto come una sfera e questo facilita qualsiasi spostamento.con un magnete pi√π forte sarebbe promosso.
5,Prodotto per me indispensabile per la sua comodit√†. Mi consente di caricare il mio Apple watch serie 4 mentre sono in ufficio attaccandolo alla porta usb del pc portatile senza dovermi portare dietro il cavo ingombrante. Ho apprezzato anche la linguetta marrone in cuoio che rende questo accessorio oltre che comodo anche bello da vedere.
2,peccato che scalda troppo perch√© √® un articolo comodo ed economico
5,Great quality starting from the fast delivery nice and secure packaging and the high quality finishing material.This handy charger is very practical on the keychain and easy to use wherever USB plug is available. The extra protection piece is coming handy as well.Seller was great on handling a wrongly ordered color very fast and without any further complications. Really recommended!
5,praktisch und funktioniert bisher gut (apple watch 5)
1,Compr√© este articulo y en el mismo dia lo devolvi. Mientras cargaba el reloj se puso a una temperatura exagerada pens√© que se fundiria por la temperatura que hab√≠a cogido. Para mi es un articulo mal fabricado y peligroso. No lo recomiendo para nada.
2,Well this one works better than the similar UGreen one I tried and returned.  It actually charges my watch - at a slow but acceptable rate (around 0.5% per minute or c3hr for a full charge). That's about 1/3 the charging speed of a genuine Apple charger but ok for overnight charging.  BUT it makes my watch very hot - to the point where it is uncomfortable to put on immediately.  I can't think this is good for the watch or the battery life of the watch and as the watch costs an awful lot more than I am saving with this device I don't want to risk it.  So returned and buying the 0.3m genuine Apple lead for ¬£29 (twice the price).  Shame as the format is perfect for me.
4,Top et pratique
5,Charges fast. Kept in my handbag for boosting at the office or in the car!!
5,Lo porto sempre con me in borsa per averlo disponibile quando sono fuori casa. Comodo e utile leggerissimo. Lo consiglio
3,Klein und praktisch aber l√§dt langsam - kein Vergleich zum Originalladeger√§t f√ºr die Apple Watch
5,Ottimo per situazioni di emergenza. Io lo attacco al power Bank. Calamita non troppo forte. Tempi di ricarica uguale all‚Äôoriginale. Consigliato
2,Debido a su conector USB y a ser r√≠gido depende mucho de la posici√≥n del enchufe para que pueda ser m√°s o menos c√≥moda su carga.Tarda bastante en cargar y eso que lo uso con un adaptador de carga r√°pida y da continuos pitidos el  porque pierde la carga es decir la carga es intermitente. Lo cual es especialmente inc√≥modo cuando est√°s durmiendo ya que suena la campana de que has dejado de cargar cada pocos minutos
5,Easy to charge up Apple Watch from laptop.
4,Plus: Das Ladeger√§t ist handlich passt sogar in die Hosentasche und ist gut auf Reisen einsetzbar.Minus: Ladedauer ist zu lang. Eine vollst√§ndige Ladung erfolgt nicht immer und die Mitnahme von einem Netzteil ist u. U. n√∂tig.
1,Connesso a pi√π porte usb di potenza diversa ha caricato di nemmeno il 10% in un‚Äôora e mezza l‚ÄôApple watch. Aggiungiamoci che continua a disconnettersi e si scalda parecchio.Effettuato il reso‚Ä¶
5,It starts immediately after setting the clock during loading. You can use a closed or open bracelet. The battery is very stable and takes a long time to charge. There is watch 2. It's loading quite fast so that after a short time you can calm down with the clock in the next few hours.
4,Buen producto
5,Ottimo prodotto
5,Todo correcto
3,Prodotto buono comodo e molto portatile.Se da usare con power bank o comunque in viaggio diventa scomodo perch√© non ha l‚Äôaggancio magnetico all‚Äôorologio
3,Pues lo cog√≠ para viaje pero la verdad es que le cuesta cargar lo que no est√° escrito. No lo recomiendo especialmente.
5,Espectacular cargador peque√±o de muy bonito y como dise√±o. Su peso y tama√±o te permiten llevarlo contigo a donde quieras!! 100% recomendado
3,Vraiment moins rapide que le c√¢ble vendu avec la montre.
1,Lo uso solo para viajes y no mucho enpez√≥ a fallar a veces pero ya no funciona del todo. mala calidad y no funciona despues de pocos usos. Marca no fiable de baja calidad.
3,Dieser Adapter ist zwar gut f√ºr unterwegs aber die Ladezeit/Leistung im Vergleich zum Apple Original liegt bei 70% d. h. es dauert mindestens 30 % l√§nger
5,Preisleistung stimmt!
4,The magnet isn't very strong either but it keeps the watch in place.  I once had to awkwardly put the watch on the charger upside down i.e. against gravity and it was held in place but a small bump against it made it drop.But hey it's cheap and gets it done.
5,Love this as if you have an Apple Watch the most annoying thing is how long the charger is! I have mine wired into a docking station so this is great to throw in my bag for on the go! It charges well doesn‚Äôt get hot no complaints at all
5,Brauchten eine  Ladem√∂glichkeit f√ºr unterwegs im Wohnmobil wenn man mal keinen Landstrom und somit nur mit usb laden kann. Funktioniert einwandfrei nimmt quasi keinen Platz weg und man hat nicht noch mehr Kabellage
5,E' pi√π lento nella carica rispetto all'originale Apple e scalda lo smartwatch cosa che non mi spiego data la minor potenza. Per√≤ fa il suo dovere ed √® comodissimo in viaggio. A quel prezzo poi...Consigliato!
5,Ideal to carry in a bag for Charing apple watch light in weight small in size and can be attached to a keychain or something similar.
4,Practical for travel
5,Very compact so far no problems. My original is in storage(stupid me) so I got this as a kind of go between. Fully charged the battery in about 3 hours. Excellent value.
5,accessorio molto utile che mi permette di caricare l'apple watch con il mio PC portatile
5,Nicht mehr ohne! W√ºrde ich jederzeit wieder kaufen.
5,Comodo da tenere in borsa o in tasca e collegare al pc.
5,Did what it said WYSIWYG!
5,Usato durante i viaggi va benissimo
5,√à abbastanza comodo e fa bene il suo compito
5,Perfekt f√ºr unterwegs. Ich habe das originale Ladekabel  in einer ladestation verbaut und es auszubauen ist immer sehr nervig. Da ich beruflich h√§ufig unterwegs bin und das original ladekabel nicht jedesmal ausbauen m√∂chte ist dieses kleine Ladeger√§t optimal f√ºr mich geeignet. Ich w√ºrde es wieder kaufen :)
1,This device did not charge my watch. It stops charging after a few minutes. I took this camping this weekend with both car charger USB VW camper 2amp USB and resorted to 5amp power bank to try and get it to charge. It actually lost charge overnight rendering my watch useless for the days hiking. Very very disappointed and will not be able to use it for intended purposes‚Ä¶or any useful purpose. Wast of money.
5,Comodo da mettere in borsa ottimo per la ricarica fuori casa
5,Plut√¥t gris que bleu
5,Highly recommend this seller quick ship and good price.
5,Easy to use and a perfect travel accessory
5,Easy to use maybe a tat slower than original charger
1,Ich hatte das Ger√§t f√ºr das Laden unterwegs gekauft wurde wegen der Pandemie nur 3-4 Mal benutzt die  Uhr AW 6 wurde zuletzt innerhalb 12 Stunden nicht mehr richtig aufgeladen bei ca. 50% war Schluss.Hatte mit dem Verk√§ufer wegen Garantiefall Kontakt aufgenommen da das Ger√§t nicht mal ein Jahr alt war. Vom Verk√§ufer Shenzhen Xindeli Technology Co. wurde sehr frech geantwortet das er die Garantieabwicklung ablehnt und ich mir ein neues Ger√§t kaufen soll. Ich habe mich dann mit Amazon in Verbindung gesetzt wo mir sofort geholfen und der Kaufpreis erstattet wurde DANKE Amazon!!!! Mein Rat: nicht bei diesem Anbieter kaufen!
5,I highly recommend this sellervery professional high quality products.
5,Great charger perfect size to carry and use anywhere very happy with this purchase.
5,For the price what‚Äôs not to like?
5,Das Ladeger√§t ist wunderbar auf Reisen. Da ich die Uhr √ºber Nacht lade kann ich nichts zur Geschwindigkeit des Lasevorgangs nichts sagen.Klasse Teil!
5,Ich habe einen USB Ladekabel gesucht welches ohne lange Kabel und gut f√ºr unterwegs ist im Auto oder Urlaub. Die Ladezeiten sind Ok. Etwas langsamer als das Original aber die 1-2 Stunden l√§nger sind akzeptabel. Nutze das Lagekabel f√ºr meine Applewatch 2
4,Es pr√°ctico y carga perfectamente
4,Chargement un peu long mais fonctionne correctement.Petit et pratique √† emporter plut√¥t que le chargeur Apple.Bon rapport qualit√©/prix
5,Es comodisimo! Ocupa poco carga fenomenal r√°pido encantada con la compra
5,Great and easy to take when on holiday. Works a treat.
5,Good customer service replaced a faulty one but the new one gas worked well for a long time
4,F√ºr den Preis ok.
1,Charging time is nearly like 4 hours
5,hab mir das Ding f√ºrs B√ºro gekauft.Steckt in der Dockingstation auf dem Schreibtisch.Ladeleistung = identisch mit Apple LadepadDesign = sehr sch√∂n (meine Meinung)Funktion = 100%Preis/Leistung = top (meine Meinung)Probleme = keineAlternative = bestimmt viele aber ich bleib bei dieser :D
3,Produkt ist gut verarbeitet l√§dt die Uhr wie gew√ºnscht und hat mit dem kleinen B√§ndchen auch noch einen gewissen Chic. Da ich es immer in einer Kleinteilet√ºte habe um es mit auf Gesch√§ftsreisen zu nehmen kommt mir die Schutzkappe f√ºr den USB Anschluss sehr gelegen zumal sie eine Verliersicherung hat. Warum trotzdem nur drei Sterne? Die Appletastaturen haben zwei USB Ports um z.B. solche Ladeaccessoires zu verbinden. Wenn ich dieses Gadget darein stecke w√ºrde es zwar funktionieren aber die Uhr kann ich nicht mehr drauflegen siehe Bild.
5,Ottimo prodotto funziona perfettamente
5,super pratique
5,Mi porto sempre dietro un computer per cui riesco sempre a caricare il mio apple watch
5,Liked everything about this charger great when on holiday and does charge quick!!
5,Comodo pratico e di buona fattura.Nulla da aggiungere si collega tranquillamente ad una power bank quindi quando si √® fuori casa non c‚Äô√® bisogno di portare con se il filo.Lo consiglio assolutamente.Spedizone top con prime.
3,Dise√±o bien practico y r√°pido de llevar encima.Pero se calienta son ya varias veces lo que lo he puesto y se calienta y si controlo los amperios lo pongo a cargar con 1amperio no mas pero se calienta por precio pues no es el mismo que el original. No lo cargo siempre con este intento usar el original solo lo uso en casos de viajes trabajo tiempo en la calle.
5,Para cargar mi reloj
1,Am Anfang war ich super happy mit dem Ladeger√§t. Ohne l√§stiges Kabel. Einfach zu transportieren. Gute Ladeleistung.Letzte Woche war ich unterwegs und habe nachts geladen. Morgens um 9 meldete sich die Apple Watch - Akku nur noch 10%. Jetzt habe ich rausgefunden warum. Die Uhr l√§dt nur noch 1-2% pro Stunde.Damit hat sich das Ding disqualifiziert. Schade.
2,The product has the USB fitted upside down so when plugged horizontally into any laptop or MacBook the curved magnetic bit that the watch attaches to faces the table below and the gap between the product and the table is too small to fit the watch. Very poor design; product was returned.
5,Con minimo ingombro fa il suo dovere. Ricarica di Apple Watch veloce e senza problemi!
2,Das Aufladen mit diesem Ladeger√§t dauert 2 bis 25 mal l√§nger als mit dem mitgelieferten Originalladeger√§t.Der Preis ist OK die Ladezeit m√ºsste jedoch k√ºrzer sein um mehr Sterne zu vergeben.
5,Super compatto si porta dietro come un portachiavi lo si pu√≤ attaccare a qualunque presa usb e subito ricarica iwatch! Comodissimo penso di prendere un altro da mettere fisso in valigia
5,Easy to use compact and handy! Perfect for travelling:)
3,Das Teil ist praktisch zum Mitnehmen. Meine Apple Watch SE h√§ngt jetzt schon 4 Stunden drauf und ist immer noch nicht voll. Mit Originalkabel dauert es nur 15 - 2 h.
5,I love this design brilliant for travel. Magnet works well and charges well
5,Awesome bit of kit and very good
5,Toujours dans mon sac. Facile √† transporter pour l‚Äôavoir √† port√©e de mains
5,L√§dt bei mir eine Apple Watch 3. Kann im Ergebnis keinen Unterschied zum originalen Ladeger√§t von Apple erkennen. Muss halt klar sein dass die USB Quelle eine Hauptrolle spielt. Als flexibles L√∂sung bei Reisen prima.
5,Parfait. Le seul b√©mol c‚Äôest qu‚Äôavec une coque la montre ne tiens pas sur la tranche. Donc oblig√© de la mettre √† plat. Rien de grave. Je recommande
5,Come descrizione funziona e ricarica regolarnente
2,Ich fand das Produkt super f√ºr unterwegs nimmt kaum Platz weg kein langes Kabel super. Aber bei Laden √ºberhitzt das Ding so derma√üen dass ich micb kaum noch traue meine Uhr dranzuh√§ngen. Habs auch in unterschiedlichen Steckdosen versucht immer das gleiche
5,Consiglio per una veloce ricarica!
5,It was a gift but the person is really pleased with w
3,L√§d sehr langsam. F√ºrs Auto nicht ideal da die Uhr bei jedem Ruckler des Wagens vom Ladeger√§t runterrutscht.
5,Does the job super compact and easy to store üëçüèº
5,Tr√®s pratique pour recharger mon Apple Watch au bureau lorsque j‚Äôai oubli√© de le faire √† la maison.Pas encombrant charge rapide.
3,No cumple con mis espectativas...a lo mejor a otras personas le funciona bien.
3,As a portable device for charging your watch underway this product is ok. It charges at a ridiculously slow rate. It is however a much more portable charger than a meter of cable.You can plug it into the hotel TV powerpack or other random USB socket that you can find and the watch will ‚Äûglue‚Äú itself to it.Ok for underways but not a replacement for the original charger.
5,Love it Really handy easy to take in the car
5,Facile da utilizzare in auto
3,USB Ladeger√§t l√§dt sehr sehr langsam weiss nicht ob das normal ist oder so geh√∂rt aber sollte das normal sein kommt von mir keine Kaufempfehlung
5,Comodo per chi vuole ricaricare lo smartwatch senza troppi fili.  Velocit√† di ricarica media.
2,Preso perch√© piccolo e comodo da portare in giro non avendo i fili del caricatore normale. Molto bello da vedere e sembra fatto bene. Unica pecca‚Ä¶ scalda tantissimo l‚Äôorologio‚Ä¶ quando lo riprendi dopo la carica e‚Äô bollente sembra che anche arrivato a ricarica completa il caricatore continua a caricare facendo scaldare molto l‚Äôorologio. Per paura di danni permanenti lo sto usando pochissimo solo se proprio necessario. Peccato
5,Habe meine Uhr geschenkt bekommen von meinen Kindern .Da die ladestation vergessen wurde gilt dieses jetzt f√ºr mein Wohnwagen .Tut was es soll Kaufen w√ºrde ich es wieder
5,Great little gadget perfect for travelling or in the office
5,Mi piaceva il fatto che non ci fossero cavi cos√¨ l‚Äôho acquistato ma avevo qualche perplessit√†. Invece √® comodo occupa poco spazio  funziona benissimo ed √® anche carino. Inoltre con un ottimo rapporto qualit√† prezzo
5,Works well and doesn‚Äôt leave trailing cables
1,HA CARICATO 2 VOLTE E POI HA SMESSO DI FUNZIONARE. PRODOTTO PESSIMO!!!!
5,Arrivato nei tempi previsti e perfettamente funzionante.
5,Subito trovato benissimo! Fa il suo dovere!Se il cinturino e pesante non funziona in verticale
5,Brilliant charges really good
5,Tr√®s pratique en d√©placement pour ne pas s‚Äôencombrer et pouvoir charger sa Watch.
5,Easy to use. Doesn't take up much space and charges quickly.
5,un produit d'utilit√© a emport√© partout et rassurant d'une rechange compl√®te de votre montre Apple
5,cumple con su utilidad buena compra
2,Bello ma il magnete non √® abbastanza potente. La fase di ricarica √® abbastanza lunga. Non mi ha convinto‚Ä¶
5,I love the fact that there‚Äôs no wires and my watch makes contact more easily great prduct
5,Ottimo ?
5,Would buy again
5,Great little gadget! I can hook it Onto my bag zip and always have it handy for me watch.
1,Charger charged watch for first 10 seconds in the USB after that - totally useless. Charger heated watch heater zero charging.Watch now won‚Äôt turn on.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
5,Tr√®s pratique pour partir en voyage .
5,Para llevarlo de viaje es ideal. Ocupa poco es muy c√≥modo y pr√°ctico
3,Mi √® piaciuta molto la portabilit√† dell‚Äôaccessorio trovo per√≤ che per quanto mi riguarda ho trovato poco stabile non c‚Äô√® una perfetta adesione con l‚Äôorologio e inoltre ho notato una carica non molto rapida
5,Habs bisher nur auf Funktion getestet da ich das Original Ladeger√§t fest eingebaut habe. Da es funktioniert reicht mir das auf Reisen. Nach einer Testphase werde ich nachberichten.
5,Easy to use
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Well it works its cheaper than the original apple watch charging lead and this is very easier to use plus very portable/small.üëçüèªüëçüèª
5,F√ºr den kleinen Preis absolut unschlagbar!
5,Bin bis jetzt sehr zufrieden mit dem Ladestecker er wirkt sehr Hochwertig und l√§dt bis jetzt zuverl√§ssig.Zum Versand kann ich auch nur sagen das er schnell bei mir ankam und gut verpackt geliefert wurde.Also alles in allen eine Kaufempfehlung!
3,Ich hab mir das Teil gekauft um meine Uhr auf Arbeit laden zu k√∂nnen. Prinzipiell finde ich es ganz praktisch dass klein und handlich ist.Abz√ºge gibt es aber daf√ºr dass der Deckel nicht durchg√§ngig ist und damit im Rucksack Dreck in den Anschluss kommen kann. Dazu habe ich das Gef√ºhl dass die Uhr sehr langsam l√§dtDazu werden Uhr und Ladeger√§t nach kurzer Zeit sehr warm.
5,Comodo
3,Photo is a white charger order says white charger box has a white charger on it ..... inside it‚Äôs blackDisappointing
5,Easy to use with a usb battery pack
5,Ottimo toglie l‚Äôansia di rimanere senza Apple Watch anche in viaggio o fuori casa
5,Ottimo prodotto qualit√† prezzo
1,Agreed with @Kate Bush‚Äôs review. This isn‚Äôt safe. It got extremely hot the watch was too hot to touch and it crashed the watch. Now I see the sanke of death in the watch and even the original watch charger could not fix it. It also didn‚Äôt charge but drained the battery - probably because of the heat it generated. I lost the watch because of the charger and Now I have to go to apple service centre to get it fixed. Hate it
5,Amazing!!!!
5,Great charger works perfectly. Great to carry around with power bank and Mac
5,piccolo e comodo funzionale si adatta benissimo allo smartwatch come il caricabatterie originale. fa il suo dovere ma la velocit√† di ricarica naturalmente non √® la stessa del cavo in dotazione con Apple.
5,Besitzer der Apple Watch wissen aus leidvoller Erfahrung dass man dauernd laden muss. Die L√∂sung von Apple mit dem langen Kabel ist ja eigentlich super aber die Kabel sehen irgendwie immer unordentlich aus. Wenn eine Wandsteckdose frei ist kann ich das Laden an der und mit diesem Stecker sehr empfehlen. Der Magnet funktioniert gut und der Adapter wird nicht warm.
5,Realmente me ha gustado bastante la verdad es perfecto para no quedarte nunca sin carga en el reloj yo personalmente compr√© dos uno siempre en el coche tiene el tama√±o perfecto.
5,Eine tolle Erg√§nzung zum standardm√§√üigen (langen) Ladekabel f√ºr die Apple Watch. Das kleine handliche USB-Ladeger√§t steckt im T√§schchen bei meiner Powerbank und so habe ich es immer mit dabei.
5,Funziona bene solo l'adesione dell'orologio non √® sempre solida
5,Der kleine Lader f√ºr die A-watch hat mir bereits im Urlaub gute Dienste geleistet.Man muss nicht das Originalger√§t entheddern das bei mir auf dem Schreibtisch fest in einem Cradle sitzt.Einen USB Anschlu√ü findet sich doch mittlerweile √ºberall selbst im Auto ist nun kurz mal Aufladen m√∂glich.Die Uhr h√§lt gut mittels Magnetismus fest auch in vertikaler Position.Gut!
5,Comodopratico ed esteticamente di designe.
5,Ok works well
5,Ottimo rapporto qualit√† prezzo  stile diverso dallo standard  in diversi colori  ho scelto il blu ( per cambiare il solito bianco )Per ora corrisponde alle aspettative
1,This isn‚Äôt safe. It got extremely hot the watch was too hot to touch and it crashed the watch. It displayed one of those hot symbols on it which I‚Äôve never seen on an Apple Watch before then it crashed. It also didn‚Äôt charge but drained the battery - probably because of the heat it generated.*edit* the seller has contacted me and asked me to delete this review in return for compensation. I would definitely avoid.*further edit* the seller has been bombarding me with emails on a daily basis offering vouchers asking me to delete the review. Really irritating!
5,Ottimo per la ricarica in ufficio o fuori casa tramite presa usbRicarica velocementeMolto pratico e funzionale
5,Unterwegs super als Ladeger√§t mit wenig Platz in der Tasche.Kann man uneingeschr√§nkt weiterempfehlen.
3,This product is advertised as being a power bank for cordless I watch charging. It IS NOT cordless you have to plug it into your laptop!
5,Perfect little charger for travelling just the job !
5,Veramente eccezionale‚Ä¶ comodo pratico e non ingombrante.. 5 stelle sono poche ‚Ä¶. Sono soddisfattissimo
2,Il caricabatterie √® bello piccolo pratico con il magnete che fa il suo dovere anche se messo in verticale. C‚Äô√® un particolare da non sottovalutare l‚ÄôApple Watch si surriscalda molto almeno quello che ho io che √® una serie 6 provato anche direttamente nelle prese usb del pc ma il surriscaldamento anche se pi√π lieve si ripresenta
5,Is as advertised
5,Accessorio portatile molto comodo paragonabile all‚Äôoriginale come funzionalit√†. L‚Äôassenza del cavo rende tutto pi√π facile e pi√π ordinato durante la ricarica. Il magnete tiene molto bene anche in posizione verticale. Davvero un ottimo articolo!
5,Great idea if your on the move a lot nice and neat and charges fast
5,L‚Äôho preso proprio perch√© √® piccolo resistente portatile carino E poi lo posso attaccare qualunque presa USB dare una ricarica veloce al mio Apple Watch
5,Sehr klein praktisch.. Einfach an einer Power Bank andocken und √ºberall die Apple watch laden.Empfehlenswert.
5,Ein tolles Ger√§t! Eine sehr gute Erg√§nzung zum Kabel. Sehr praktisch! Kann man auch gerne als Geschenk f√ºr Apple Watch Besitzer einplanen üëç
5,Klein - fein - praktisch
5,Fonctionne parfaitement pour Apple Watch 6J‚Äôen ai 3 au total pour √™tre s√ªr de ne jamais manquer de batterie peu importe ou je me trouve.
5,Ras
5,Durchdacht ! Praktisch und einfach super. Passt selbst in die kleinste Tasche. Adappter PC Laptop Notebook l√§dt zackig auf und man hat die Uhr im Blick.
4,Great for travel bag
5,Tr√®s pratique de par sa taille et efficace en plus !
1,Das Laden dauert sehr lange der Anschluss an die USB-Schnittstelle eine Computers braucht Platz da die Uhr auch noch darauf passen muss. Die Uhr erw√§rmt sich w√§hrend des Ladens sehr stark.Da mache ich mir Sorgen um den Akku der Uhr.Es bleibt wohl nur der Griff zum Originalteil.
2,Prodotto accettabile peccato il magnete un po‚Äô troppo debole e la spina usb che non pu√≤ essere ruotata in orizzoy
1,Prodotto molto scadente!
4,Der Ladevorgang geht deutlich langsamer als beim Original aber f√ºr Unterwegs eine gute L√∂sung.
5,Suis contente je peux l‚Äôemporter partout
5,Fonctionne parfaitement ! Discret pratique efficace
2,Le chargeur est tr√®s joli l√©ger et fin‚Ä¶J‚Äôai bien enlev√© le plastique comme conseill√© plus haut dans les commentaires mais malheureusement la charge est tr√®s tr√®s tr√®s longue et la montre est tr√®s chaude.Le point positif est pour le design et la faible charge.D√©√ßu.
5,Ho Ricevuto il prodotto con remore dovute ad un acquisto di un prodotto simile acquistato in precedenza che mi aveva deluso ma devo dire che questo NEWDERY √® un ottimo prodotto √® un ottimo rapporto qualit√† prezzo... materiali buoni  carica veloce ed √® molto stiloso facile da usare e comodo da trasportare. Consigliatissimo
5,Comprato in offerta devo dire ottimo prodotto ma scalda un pelino tutto sommato lo consiglio per praticit√† e velocit√† di ricarica
5,Avevo lasciato tre stelle ma devo ammettere di essermi ricreduto. Materiale resistente la tenuta della calamita √® buona e tutto sommato lo consiglio!
5,Echt praktisches Teil und immer am Schl√ºsselbund dabei. Das einzige Manko ist Leistung. Das Aufladen dauert doch schon recht lange und ist kein Vergleich zum Originalkabel. Aber Preis/Leistung stimmt und es praktisch und besser ist wie gar kein Kabel
2,I specifically asked about the charging rate prior to purchase and was informed it‚Äôs the same as the Apple Cable. It is not! Charges very slowly. Added 12% (from 20%) in 45 minutes. With same charger and original cable added 35% in 30 minutes. I bought this for a quick charging boost when out and about and it just isn‚Äôt fit for that job.
5,Does the job. Perfect size. Worth the price.
5,F√ºr unterwegs einfach tollKabelbr√ºche ade‚Äò
2,Won‚Äôt charge in a USB wall socket. Will only work using a laptop.
5,A very handy item to have and with no lead to get damaged.
5,Vergesse leider oft meine Watch √ºber Nacht zu laden und bin beruflich √ºber 12 Stunden am Tag au√üer Haus. Somit kann ich meine Uhr schnell √ºber den externen Akku laden und muss nicht mehr mehrere Stunden am Tag mit einer leeren / schwarzen Uhr rumlaufen.Klasse !
5,Comprato perch√© ero fuori casa e avevo dimenticato quello originale. Arrivato il giorno dopo. Comodo utile funzionale. Ottimo prodotto
1,Es ist klein und kompakt und somit eigentlich super geeignet um es √ºberall mitzunehmen.Und da kommt das Problem man m√∂chte die AppleWatch schnell laden wenn man unterwegs ist aber das wird leider nichts.Mit einem Schnelladeger√§t dauert es 10 Minuten um es auf 1% Ladekapazit√§t zu bringen dass ist wirklich viel zu langsam und somit ist der Formfaktor dahin.
5,This charger doesnt exactly what it says. Shame there isn‚Äôt a battery operated one but still really good
3,Klein handlich √ºberall zu verwenden perfekt.
5,Everything! nice fast charging simple very study in the usb slot
5,Consiglio vivamente
2,Otherwise a great product but charging speed is too low. It takes very long to charge the watch. Original charging cable is much faster.
2,Man braucht gut 5h bis die Uhr voll aufgeladen ist. Zudem hebt der Magnet die Uhr kaum. Die f√§llt sehr schnell runter.
1,Le chargeur chauffe mais ne charge pas la montre produit renvoy√©
5,Ottima carica e pratico da portare sempre con te
5,Kam super schnell und ist f√ºr Unterwegs eine tolle L√∂sung
5,Leggero e funzionale anche elegante e carino funziona benissimo ed √® arrivato prestissimo. eccellente prodotto. Consigliato
5,Und funktioniert einwandfrei. Gute Preis-Leistung. Insgesamt ein gutes Produkt. W√ºrde ich jederzeit wieder kaufen fslls ich noch mal welche brauchen sollte.
2,Purtroppo la ricarica risulta molto pi√π lenta rispetto al cavo di ricarica estetica e tenuta buona ma l‚Äôho reso perch√© non √® valido da portare in giro perch√© in un ora di ricarica la percentuale sale solo al 40% rispetto al cavo originale che a parit√† di alimentatore va ben oltre 80%
5,Top
5,Wie erwartet tolles kleines Tool zum mitnehmen um √ºberall die Apple Watch zu laden...
5,Ich bin √ºberrascht wie gut das Ladeger√§t funktioniert. Ich kann es auf jeden Fall weiter empfehlen:-)
1,Worked when I first plugged in stopped working after 10 minutes. Plugged into another USB socket same thing happened. Unplug the plugged in again stayed on for 20 minutes got very warm I am plugged because I wasn‚Äôt sure how safe it will be. It‚Äôs gone straight in the bin an absolute waste of money
5,Buona soluzione per poter caricare il proprio iwatch quando si √® fuori casa senza portarsi dietro tutto il cavo. Io lo tengo sempre nella borsa lavoro per ricariche urgenti ed √® compatto e potente allo stesso tempo. Consigliato
3,Das Ding wird ziemlich warm ob das gut f√ºr die Uhr ist?Au√üerdem habe ich einen SCHWARZES Ladeger√§t bekommen statt dem abgebildeten wei√üen.
5,It is nice and compact easy to use very easy to carry its great
5,very useful  well made  better than the original
5,Great little gadget to have if you forget to charge you‚Äôre watch.Would recommend
5,F√ºr unterwegs einfach super
5,Comodo tascabile poco ingombrante. Funzione bene. Forse scalda un po' troppo ma non e' un problema. Un acquisto centrato.
1,Unable to use as it is upside down when plugged in to a laptop or desk charger!
2,Non carica come quello originale √® molto lento e si surriscalda molto ed √® caldo anche L orologio lo uso per necessit√†
5,Ottimo prodotto l‚Äôorologio aderisce perfettamente al supporto.Ottimo da trasportare da mettere in borsa ma anche nella tasca.
5,I brought this for easy charging on the go seeing that I have the original one in a charging stand. It‚Äôs easy to use and feels of a high quality.
5,Parfait comme chargeur qu‚Äôon trimbale de partout !
1,2 x bestellt - 2 x nicht funktionsf√§hig mit neuer Apple Watch 7. Meine Uhr wird leider gar nicht geladen und ich habe mehrere USB-Ladeger√§te sowie ein Macbook Pro ausprobiert ü§∑üèº
5,E' perfetto. Molto versatile facile da trasportare e assolutamente al prezzo giusto! E non √® bianco :)
5,Con questo strumento puoi ricaricare il tuo iwatch senza il cavo ed √® molto pratico e meno ingombrante.
5,funziona solo attaccato ad alimentatore ottimo x auto o attaccato a un powerbank ma non da solo ma non fa niente
1,Gefallen hat mir die Kompaktheit. Meine Sorge gilt der hohen Temperatur die an der Powerbank beim Laden der Apple Watch 7 entsteht. Das normale Apple Watch Ladeger√§t verursacht diese Hitzeentwicklung nicht. Ich gehe hier nicht das Risiko ein dass meine Apple Watch besch√§digt wird und schicke den Ladeadapter zur√ºck
5,Molto comodo e performante. Carica veloce
5,Super momentan nach 2 Monate
5,Funktioniert einwandfrei auch mit watch se
5,Ras depuis 2 semaines fonctionne parfaitement ! A voir dans le temps !
5,Works well and charges I watch quickly. Well worth buying.
5,H√§lt was es verspricht
5,Molto bello nel design acquirente veloce e professionale comodissimo in viaggio
5,Erster Eindruck ist auf jeden Fall gut. Er Funktioniert und ist Stabil wird im Auto verwendet.
1,Stopped working after first charge exchanged it for a new one and same thing happened again. Was literally able to charge my watch only once with this. Typical Chinese make not at all reliable. The seller was kind enough to refund and take it back.
1,This product not fit for Apple watch and it's waist of money
5,Piccolo pratico e veloce. Senza avere fili e prolunghe inutili. Molto comodo
5,Everyday charging
5,Artikel wie beschrieben funktioniert einwandfrei gute Alternative zum Original Ladeger√§t
5,Alles super danke sch√∂n
1,Could have anticipated this thought I would give it a try. Simply does not charge. Wake up in the AM and watch is not charged. Works sometimes but no use.
5,Das kann man nur weiter empfehlen üëç
5,Rien a dire
5,CORRESPOND A LA DESCRIPTION DU PRODUIT
5,Ben fatto molto comodo per chi viaggia! Unico consiglio usare carica batterie cn almeno 10w! Altrim troppo lento nel caricare
1,Das Ger√§t l√§dt die Apple Watch nur an manchen Devices mit USB Anschluss (Laptop Docking-Station etc.). Direkt an der Steckdose mit entsprechendem Adapter wird die Watch nicht geladen. Auch in meinem Auto habe ich diverse USB-Anschl√ºsse getestet und bei keinem konnte die Uhr geladen werden. F√ºr unterwegs oder im Urlaub ist das Ger√§t somit vollkommen unbrauchbar und geht wieder zur√ºck. Warum k√∂nnen die Hersteller ihre Ger√§te nicht selbst testen und lassen dies von Kunden tun?
5,Great product.
5,Sch√∂n klein. Die Uhr wird etwas w√§rmer Tals im Original
5,Molto comodo e pratico . Forse non carica veloce come L originale ma comunque fa bene il suo dovere ..
1,It is unreliable sometimes it charges other times not - which is not great if you rely on it while travelling. It takes a very very long time to charge when it is working. It gets very hot so I was concerned about a fire risk I wouldn't put it near anything flammable. So I would look elsewhere. Will be getting something to replace this one.
5,Danke sch√∂n
5,Ladeger√§t f√ºr Apple Watch wenn man unterwegs ist.Funktioniert tadellos!
2,Trotz unterschiedlicher Netzteile kaum Aufladung. Mit Kabel am selben Netzteil wurde die Uhr aufgeladen.Grunds√§tzlich gute Idee funktioniert aber nicht wie erhofft.
5,Excellent product used in cars USB and with a power pack and on a socket.
5,Platzsparende Ladem√∂glichkeit
5,Ive had it about a month and it still works. Fingers crossed.
1,Purtroppo √® un caricatore che avrei portato alla casa al mare.A causa della pandemia non ho potuto utilizzarlo e quando lo utilizzai dopo due mesi dall‚Äôacquisto mi sono accorto che non carica
5,Super Produkt! Erwartungen hinsichtlich Qualit√§t Verarbeitung und Funktion √ºbertroffen.
3,Stylisch klein und gut f√ºr unterwegs leider dauert das aufladen der Uhr eine gef√ºhlte Ewigkeit.
5,super f√ºr unterwegs
2,Se calienta demasiado y no carga a la velocidad que debe.Es para salir del paso pero no me da demasiada confianza
5,Utile x viaggio
5,Sehr gut f√ºr die Watch
5,An meiner AppleWatch 2. Sch√∂n gearbeitet k√∂nnte von Apple sein. Kam zu sp√§t Versandpreis ersetzt. Alles gut.
2,LasLadeleistung ist Grottenschlecht.Je nach Stecker ist die Uhr senkrecht oder diagonal. Magnet ist m√§√üig.Im gesamten eher nicht so geil.
5,Perfekt
5,Nettes Spielzeug - L√§d langsam - wenn man Zeit hat ok
5,Hat alles toll funktioniert sehr hochwertig
2,Der Ladeadapter ist handlich und passt in jede Hosentasche. Gegen√ºber dem originalen Apple Ladepuck gibt es aber einen entscheidenden Nachteil: die Aufladung ist qu√§lend langsam. √úber Nacht ok. Als Notlader um mal kurz ein paar mAh vor dem Training in den Akku zu hieven v√∂llig ungeeignet. Damit hat das Teil mein Hauptkriterium nicht erf√ºllt!
5,Genau das was ich gesucht habe.
5,Se puede llevar en cualquier sitio y resulta muy pr√°ctico si te quedas sin bater√≠a fuera de casa.
1,Leider ist in der Beschreibung nicht ersichtlich dass die Output Leistung auf 2 Watt begrenzt ist.Empfohlen werden 5Watt f√ºr das Laden der Watch 6.Der Ladezyklus 0 bis 100% mit diesem Produkt dauert also fast 35 Std.Zudem entwickelt dieses Produkt wahrscheinlich wegen √ºberlast w√§rme die bei dem Original nicht auftritt.Das Produkt wurde mit Unterschiedlichen Netzteilen 2-20Watt getestet ohne dass sich das Ladeverhalten ge√§ndert hat.
5,Ich habe mir dieses Teil zugelegt damit ich meine Watch zwischendurch mal schnell laden kann.Funktioniert .
5,Ottimo comodo funziona e si pu√≤ portare ovunque visto le dimensioni.
5,Excellent product thank you :)
5,Lo tengo sempre in tasca comodo economico e molto funzionale!!
3,Es dauert sehr lange die Uhr zu laden
5,Schick. Noch nicht getestet.
5,Ho acquistato questo secondo caricatore per quando viaggio e funziona benissimo
1,The product size convenience is great. However the watch heats up beyond normal. On the apple provided charging cable the heat is negligible. So am not sure that on a long run if this charger will damage the watch.
5,Genau was ich immer gesucht habe... wenn man am Rechner sitzt und mal eben seine Uhr auf der Arbeit laden will... reinstecken drauflegen fertig
5,I like the fact there is no wire.It work well too and is very compact for travelling.
5,Super
5,Pratique
1,Love the design of this product however once used I can clearly see the charging speeds are nowhere new ‚Äúfast charge‚Äù as described in the product description!The watch also doesn‚Äôt appear to sit within the magnetic charge holder well - see pictures.I wouldn‚Äôt buy again.
2,Eigentlich super gr√∂√üe f√ºr Reisen. Leider l√§dt es nicht durchgehend hat keinen guten Kontakt. Sehr √§rgerlich
5,Sehr gut endlich rutscht die Uhr nicht mehr cVon der Landestelle
1,Lo use una vez durante una hora y pr√°cticamente no cargo nada el reloj. Pero la temperatura era de riesgo. Si lo llego a dejar durante la noche podr√≠a haberse quemado
5,Me va muy bien y prefiero que no tenga cable.
5,Erf√ºllt in vollem Umfang meine Erwartungen.  Bei Verwendung an manchen USB-Ports z. B.  Mein Notebook h√§ngt die Uhr unten. Funktioniert aber trotzdem sehr gut.
5,Alles super
5,Tr√®s pratique !
5,Comodo e stabile. Lo sto usando da poco.Pi√π che soddisfacente.
3,Esta biencarga bien pero se calienta mucho el reloj
1,Bought this for charging my Apple Watch but it keeps overheating and draining the battery also rubber bit to protect usb broke off after taken it from the box very poor and would not recommend to anyone
5,Optimal f√ºr unterwegs! Sehr zu empfehlen!
1,Thought this would be ideal for travelling as opposed to taking while charging unit I have at home away with me. It didn‚Äôt work at all - suggested it was charging the watch but wasn‚Äôt! Steer clear.
1,Hatte mir das Teil f√ºr unterwegs gekauft wenn ich bei langen Radtouren in der Mittagspause die Watch mal schnell nachladen wollte. Aber 10% mehr Ladung in einer halben Stunde ist nix. Das original Apple Kabel l√§dt gef√ºhlt 3-4 x schneller mit der Selben Powerbank. Au√üerdem wird die Watch mit dem Newdery extrem Warm. Zur√ºckgeschickt!
1,Hatte es mir f√ºr den Urlaub gekauft. Zeigt zwar ‚Äûladen‚Äú an l√§d aber nicht. Daf√ºr wurde meine Uhr so hei√ü dass ich schon f√ºrchtete dass sie kaputt sei. Nicht kaufen !!!
5,Handlich schick gut durchdacht und l√§dt die Watch zuverl√§ssig. Ideal auf Reisen.
3,Produit sympa mais le temps de charge est x3 par rapport au chargeur Apple Watch d‚Äôorigine
1,Lo tuve que devolver no cargaba y calentaba excesivamente  el reloj.
5,That bonus for this charger is it will charge from a power bank as well
5,Ottimo per il mio orgoglio
2,Received black not white as shown in photo and description. Returned for a refund.Seems to be an ongoing problem as seen another similar review.
1,Ich finde das hier ist eine Unversch√§mtheit.Es ist so unglaublich langsam dass man das nicht glauben kann.Der Kundenservice ist besonders schlecht.Ich hab es entsorgt und die ganzen positiven Bewertungen hier glaub ich kein Wort mehr.
1,Un prodotto inutile non carica nulla riscalda apple watch e te lo scarica invece di caricarlo.Lo sconsiglio ha solo una bella forma e sembrava comodo ma si √® rivelato un flop.
5,It is compact easy to use and I would recommend it.
1,Das Ladeger√§t funktionierte ein paar Monate und dann pl√∂tzlich nicht mehr. Keine Kaufempfehlung!!
1,Sehr schade das Ger√§t ist sehr praktisch man hat die Ladung f√ºr eine Apple-Watch immer dabei Funktion tadellos. Nach 5 Monaten aber Totalausfall von heute auf morgen l√§dt nicht mehr. Allenfalls nur als schwacher Magnet zu gebrauchen wenn man die R√ºcksendung nach China scheut...
1,Did not work! Bought it as a spare charger to keep in my purse went to use it today and it didn‚Äôt even work really disappointed and can‚Äôt figure out how to contact the seller ???
5,Facile da usare e trasportabile
5,Nothing to dislike.  WQorks v
1,plugged it and it charges but cracks have appeared on the surface and there seems to be a raised part. Not confident to use it again.
1,Questo aggeggio non si carica non carica √® un oggetto carino da vedere ma assolutamente inutile. Non capisco perch√© √® in vendita. Sperano probabilmente che la gente che lo acquista non abbia poi voglia di restituirlo. Deludo la speranza. Lo restituisco e voglio i soldi indietro. Non compratelo assolutamente. Non √® neanche un soprammobile.
5,Sehr praktisch kann man √ºberall hin mitnehmen und funktioniert super!
5,Tolles Produkt zum laden wenn man unterwegs ist.
1,Gute Idee mies umgesetzt. Kein Vergleich zum Original-Zubeh√∂r. Das Teil l√§dt mit Original-Apple-Ladeteil sehr langsam zudem wird die Uhr hei√ü. Schrott f√ºr viel Geld den ich umgehend zur√ºckschicke.Update: Verk√§ufer penetriert mich mit Mails und bittet um L√∂schung der Bewertung im Gegenzug bietet er Amazon-Gutscheine an (bis 40 Euro). Peinlich. Kauft den Trash nicht!
1,Ho dovuto effettuare il reso di questo articolo perch√© purtroppo non funzionava. Viene rilevato l‚Äôorologio lo surriscalda ma non lo carica. Peccato.
5,Tutto perfetto si aggancia e ricarica senza problemi l‚ÄôApple Watch nessun riscaldamento dell‚Äôapparecchio o altro difetto riscontrato
5,Buon prodotto
5,Klein und Handliches Ger√§t. Schnelle Lieferung. Vollsten zufrieden
1,Good little device for changing the s6 apple watch.. time will tell if it lasts but very positive so far!EDIT: Failed refuses to charge my series 6 watch .... RETURNED!
1,Salve a tutti usato poche volte mai funzionato preso proprio in emergenza per il mio Apple Watch la ricarica si vede solo ma non inizia mai rimane sempre l√¨
1,My Apple Watch got heat when I plugged it to that item and charging also not working. Dont buy this
5,Simplemente √∫til. Sin cables y funcional
5,Ideal for use with a Backup battery!
1,Didn‚Äôt charge my watch unfortunately I didn‚Äôt use it till after the return date so I‚Äôve wasted my money all it did was make the watch hot
2,Ne charge pas correctement et chauffe √©norm√©ment. √áa m‚Äôa bousill√© mon appel watch . Je ne conseil pas.Mick
2,Billige Verarbeitung
2,lent√≠ssim segons on l'endollis no carrega. no √©s funcional que per un rellotge et tiris un dia carregant per un dia d'√∫s
5,Comodo e piccolo
1,It actually takes any remaining charge out of the watch leaving it completely flat what a load of rubbish!!
1,my watch stopped working by using this product. I do not recommend it. i'm a lossy apple watch series
1,Der Teil l√§dt gut aber es ist total langsam und braucht voll lange bis zum vollst√§ndigen aufladen nach paar Monaten ist es kaputt gegangen und jetzt l√§dt gar nicht mehr obwohl ich nichts ge√§ndert habe die gleiche Steckdose das gleiche Ladeger√§t nur das Ding funktioniert nicht mehr
5,Ottimo prodotto
1,L√§dt viiiel zu langsam. Kann es nicht gebrauchen.
5,Muy bueno y comodo
1,Apple Watch 1 funktionierte nicht obwohl es in der Artikelbeschreibung angegeben wurde.Fazit: Artikel habe ich zur√ºck gesendet
5,Comodo e compatto
5,Excellent
2,Acquistato per avere un caricatore di riserva quando sono fuori.Ci mette moltissimo a caricare l'Apple Watch e dopo 10 minuti il retro √® cocente. Ho paura che a lungo andare danneggi in modo permanente il mio dispositivo.Tornassi indietro non lo acquisterei.
1,Keeps turning off but my apple charger doesn‚Äôt have this issue so has to be an issue with this charger
1,unbrauchbar habe versucht eine AppleWatch 3 √ºber Nacht aufzuladen. Es werden ca 1%/h geladen. D.h. ca 8h um von 70% auf 78% zu kommen. War als "Unterwegsladeger√§t" gedacht um l√§ngere Aktivit√§ten tracken zu k√∂nnen. Leider √ºberhaupt nicht m√∂glich mit diesem Teil. Geht direkt zur√ºck
5,Ottimo prodotto..! Ottimo venditore veloce e cortese..!
2,Wird ziemlich warm beim laden
5,Sehr praktisch f√ºr unterwegs. Habe es f√ºr mein Auto geholt
1,Tested it once it arrived seemed to work ok. Now away from home brought this to use properly ‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt work! Don‚Äôt waste your money. Useless!
1,Will be very useful if I decide to take up baking cup cakes as a hobby but it is useless for charging an Apple Watch.
1,Horrible!!!! No carga todo lo contratio DESCARGA! Enchufado a 93% de bateria y en pocos minutos me lo ha dejado en un 90% calienta la pantalla un peligro para el reloj. No lo puedo devolver porque tire la caja NO COMPREIS ESTA BASURA!!
1,Ich habe das Teil an mehreren verschiedenen USB-Ladeger√§ten ausprobiert (Original Apple Ladeger√§t verschiedene Anker Ladeger√§te  verschienede Powerbanks). Entweder wird meine Apple Watch 4 ca. 5% geladen und es h√∂rt dann auf zu laden oder es ist unglaublich langsam (3% in 2h). Also nicht zu gebrauchen.
1,Looks clever but design is actually dreadful and doesn‚Äôt support the weight of afford not to mention the charging is dreadfully slow save your money and buy an official charger
1,Ne charge casi ment pas. Achat litt√©ralement inutile. Pourtant petit du coup pratique √† transporter mais aucune utilit√©.
1,‚Ä¶aber nachdem ich meine Apple Watch mit dem Ger√§t geladen hab ist sie nun kaputt und muss jetzt ausgetauscht werden!! √Ñrgerlich..Die Uhr war eine Woche alt
1,Non funziona pi√π l ho ‚Äòusato due volte. soldi buttati
1,Terrible product scam seller. FIRE AND ELECTRICAL HAZARD Avoid. Asked me to rewrite review and they would provide refund.
5,Piccolo tascabile comodo
1,Per un po‚Äô di tempo ha funzionato‚Ä¶ anche se bisognava stare attenti che l‚Äôorologio non si spostasse altrimenti non si caricava pi√π‚Ä¶ poi ha cominciato a mandare in tilt l‚Äôorologio quindi l‚Äôho buttato‚Ä¶ peccato‚Ä¶
1,The item & watch become very hot when used to charge. Used it twice however I returned as I felt it was not safe to use!
1,I dislike this product as its not charging my Apple watch as intended.
1,Non carica.Ho messo in carica l‚ÄôApple Watch collegato al dispositivo con carica 35% dolo 2h la carica √® scesa al 15% nonostante l‚Äôorologio fosse in carica non compratelo. Inutile
5,Sehr gut
1,Takes hours to charge with this while the Apple charger takes only 30-40 min max. Horrible waste of money. They sent me an email offering me ‚Ç¨10 to take down my review. I think they should take the money and build a product that actually works.
5,Buon prodotto
1,Only worked inconsistently. Poor connection.
1,I don't see the point of this product. You can spend the same amount of money for a charger with an internal battery? Describing it as cordless implies it has a portable power source.
5,Klein und praktisch. Tut was es muss.
1,Das Ger√§t braucht 12 h zum Laden. Viel zu lange.
1,Ich habe das Ladeger√§t an mehreren USB-Anschl√ºssen getestet. Es beginnt kurz zu laden h√∂rt aber nach einigen Sekunden auf und es ist dann kein Ladefortschritt mehr zu erkennen. Schade aber so ist es nat√ºrlich v√∂llig unbrauchbar.
1,Hard to find a compatible plug watch always falls off of the charger.
1,Funktioniert √ºberhaupt nicht hat sogar meine watch zur absoluten Entleerung gebracht! Wenn ich meine watch auf das Teil drauflege ist sofort der rote Blitz = ladet nicht! Ganz schlecht f√ºr apple watch SE
1,Meine Apple Watch Series 5 l√§dt mit dem Adapter in 2h nur 10% und wird zudem hei√ü. Kann diese Produkt nicht empfehlen lieber ein wenig mehr f√ºr das Original-Kabel ausgeben.
1,Das Ladeger√§t l√§dt nur sporadisch selten 100 % meistens nur bis 45% oder weniger. F√ºr mich absolut unzuverl√§ssig und nicht zu gebrauchen. Meine Apple Watch l√§sst sich mit anderen Ladeger√§ten  problemlos voll aufladen.
1,Pathetic product! Doesn‚Äôt charge or at best charges at extremely slow rate. A total waste of money.
1,Das Ladeger√§t kam zwar sehr schnell an aber leider sieht es ganz anders aus. Auf allen Bildern selbst auf dem Verpackungskarton wird es nur in wei√ü mit brauner Schlaufe gezeigt. Tats√§chlich kam  es bei mir aber in ganz schwarz an und sieht billig aus. Den Anbieter zu kontaktieren verlief leider erfolglos. Ger√§t geht wieder zur√ºck!
1,Funktioniert nicht- Nike Watch Serie 3 l√§dt damit nicht - !! Leider
1,This product didn‚Äôt work - wouldn‚Äôt charge my Apple Watch. Waste of money.
5,Questo √® l'unico che va tra tanti provati
1,Ich habe dem Ger√§t wegen seines tollen Designs zweimal eine Chance gegeben doch beide Male Ladeprobleme. Zu Beginn funktioniert alles und an kurzer Zeit wird die Uhr sehr langsam geladen. Dabei sah ich dass die Ladeverbindung st√§ndig unterbricht so dass in Sch√ºben geladen wird was den Akku der Uhr kaput macht.Daher finger weg.
1,Didn‚Äôt work so had to return.
1,Scalda l‚ÄôApple Watch e basta
1,Unbrauchbar. Hat in einer Stunde 6% geladen und nach einer weiteren viertel Stunde 4% an Ladung verloren mit Hitzeentwicklung der Uhr.
1,La montre charge tr√®s lentement mais tr√®s lentement je ne recommande pas ce chargeur
1,Sconsiglio l'acquisto una volta attaccato apple watch dopo pochi minuti si scollega senza ricaricare lo smartwatch. Bisogna staccarlo e riattaccarlo per iniziare una carica che si scollega sempre dopo qualche minuto.
1,I brought as a give for my husband with the watch and Even if you can keep the watch overnight didn't complete the charge for 20%.Never recommend or buy again.
1,The item description says good for travelling camping but it‚Äôs not good for either as you always have to be connected to mains power. Easier to just have the usb lead that comes with the watch.Useless piece of kit!
1,Dieser Artikel funktioniert bei mir √ºberhaupt nicht. Ich bin entt√§uscht das war ein absoluter Fehlkauf!
1,Ne prend pas en charge la charge rapide je ne sais pas s'il est d√©faillant ou s'il est pr√©vu pour recharger aussi lentement mais en tout cas je le renvoi!je vais prendre un chargeur standard.
1,Braucht etwa doppelt so lange wie ein original Ger√§t jedoch sehr handlich und leicht zu bedienen
1,Rubbish sometimes it charges but most of the time it doesn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs just a watch holder ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1,Leider muss ich die schlechten Bewertungen best√§tigen. Jetzt mit meiner Apple Watch 1 mehrfach ausprobiert und mit 45% Ladezustand abends angeschlossen. Morgens 8% Ladezustand und knallhei√ües Geh√§use. Wenn ich die Uhr nicht lade bleibt mehr Akkuladung √ºbrig. Schade w√§re ein sch√∂nes und praktisches Produkt f√ºr unterwegs.
2,Scalda molto e non ricarica al 100% l‚Äôapple Watch
1,took an hour to charge 20%
1,Finger weg!
1,La charge semble commencer et s‚Äôarr√™te quelques secondes plus tard. Tr√®s d√©√ßue
1,Im Auto wegen Bewegung unbrauchbar ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ nehmt ein Kabel und gut ist üòâ
5,üëç
1,Totaler Fehlkauf. Das Ladeger√§t war ohne Funktion und ging deshalb zur√ºck. Lieber ein Ladeger√§t mit Kabel kaufen.
5,Super Ladeger√§t
1,Der Artikel der mir geliefert wurde entspricht absolut nicht der Beschreibung auf der Amazon Webseite. Es gibt keinen Akku und daher hat es auch keine power Bank Funktion.Dieser Artikel ist lediglich ein usb Ladeadapter  f√ºr die Apple WatchEs geht sofort zur√ºck.
5,ok
1,Non ricarica bene l‚Äôorologio.
1,L‚Äôho usato per un giorno e non funziona. Sono riuscito dopo svariati tentativi e con diversi caricatori a ricaricare l‚Äôorologio al massimo del 40%
1,Doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt buy it.
1,Also ich hab es gekauft wegen den guten Rezensionen aber das kann ich leider nicht best√§tigen das es gut ist warum das Teil wird einfach nur warm  da bleibe ich dann doch lieber beim Standart Kabel zum Laden .
1,Didn‚Äôt last a week
1,Il prodotto carica lentissimo e l‚ÄôApple Watch si sposta di continuo.
1,wird sehr schnell hei√ü
1,Uhr wird nur extrem hei√ü und l√§d dabei ungef√§hr 3% pro Stunde.
1,Charging surprisingly slow. Seems not supporting Apple‚Äôs Watch 6
1,non funziona
1,Das Ding l√§dt mit l√§cherlichen 2 Watt.Um die Apple Watch 4 damit vollst√§ndig zu laden m√ºsste man rund 65 Stunden Warten bis die Uhr geladen ist.
1,Da meine AppleWatch 4 beim Laden richtig hei√ü wird kann ich dieses Produkt nicht empfehlen.
1,Auch nach mehreren Versuchen ist es nicht m√∂glich die Apple Watch damit zu laden.Optisch sehr ansprechend.
1,Die Ladenstation ist das Geld nicht wert es brauch ein Ewigkeit um zu laden! Daher total ungeeignet!
1,The product was not as described. There‚Äôs no battery/powerbank. The reviews is for another product
1,articolo ricevuto difettoso
1,No cumple con su misi√≥n para cargar no es compatible
1,Ger√§t funktioniert nicht. Elektroschrott.
1,d√©connecte sans arr√™t quasi inutilisable
1,Ne fonctionne pas avec Apple Watch 6 connecte et d√©connecte sans cesse
1,No carga bien
1,Muy decepcionante. Se recalienta y carga muy lento. Para una emergencia y poco m√°s
1,Tarda much√≠simo en cargar. Tanto que es muy in√∫til
1,ne fonctionnent pas.  1% de charge prend plus d'une heure donc inutile.
5,L'Apple Watch √® lo smartwatch che indubbiamente preferisco tra quelli che utilizzo ed anche quello da cui raramente mi separo in viaggio e quando ho notato questo NEWDERY Caricabatterie USB MAGNETICO mi ha incuriosito ed ho deciso di provarlo.Il dispositivo arriva in una compatta pratica confezione del marchio e non appena rimosso ho riscontrato una discreta QUALITA' progettuale e costruttiva con la scelta di materiali validi ben assemblati nel realizzare un piccolo dispositivo che mi ha trasmesso da subito buone sensazioni di affidabilit√†.Utilizzo gi√† altri dispositivi per ricaricare in viaggio il mio Apple Watch da 44 mm della serie 4 ma che rispetto a questo NEWDERY presentano una propria autonomia ovvero una batteria interna che qui manca.Ammetto che inizialmente avevo compreso che questo caricatore magnetico fosse simile ad altri ovvero che durante un viaggio fosse sufficiente porre sopra l'orologio per avviare la ricarica mentre si tratta di un pur sempre pratico SUPPORTO DI RICARICA che per√≤ necessita comunque di una ALIMENTAZIONE con PORTA USB .Tralasciando le mia iniziali perplessit√† sull'effettivo vantaggio di avere un dispositivo da viaggio che sia esclusivamente un supporto e non un alimentatore "autonomo" se non giustificato dalla palpabile robustezza del caricatore e della assenza di un cavo messo alla prova questo NEWDERY ho da subito apprezzato di come l'innesto USB funziona con estrema sicurezza ed affidabilit√† non solo collegandolo ad un computer fisso o portatile ma anche ovviamente ad un alimentatore da muro per smartphone ed anche ovviamente nella porta USB della mia auto.A parte la COLORAZIONE blu molto piacevole assai pi√π maschile della versione rosa confetto mi √® piaciuta la scelta di realizzare il dispositivo in stile portachiavi e quindi dotato di un gancio che ne facilit√† la trasportabilit√† grazie a DIMENSIONI compatte.Il DESIGN non √® male semplice linea e pulito con un sistema di aggancio del TAPPO che evita la perdita della copertura dell'innesto USB oltre che per preservalo da sporcizie ed impurit√† o rotture sebbene devo ammettere che avrei preferito un gancio posteriore pi√π saldo magari in acciaio rispetto ad un laccio in pelle sintetica che sebbene risulta curato ed elegante potrebbe nel tempo logorarsi e tagliarsi.Alla prova della RICARICA posizionando il mio Apple Watch sulla base ho riscontrato una buona potenza magnetica paragonabile alla base originale e ad altri dispositivi di buona efficienza che utilizzo con dei tempi di carica che ho trovato sufficientemente rapidi in proporzione alla fonte a cui ho collegato il dispositivo ovvero computer caricatore ma muro oppure porta usb dell'auto.Nel complesso mi sento quindi di promuovere questo caricabatteria NEWDERY per la qualit√† ed affidabilit√† costruttiva un dispositivo utile e pratico per un utilizzo in ufficio in viaggio in auto che per√≤ obbliga ad avere una fonte di elettricit√† non essendo autonomo con una propria batteria interna; si tratta quindi di un valido aiuto ma che personalmente ritengo inferiore ad una base di ricarica per Apple Watch che pu√≤ essere indipendente e quindi utilizzato in qualsiasi condizione e luogo volendo anche in aperta campagna o sulla cima di una montagna.Per ci√≤ che riguarda il PREZZO di 14.99 euro a cui questo NEWDERY viene al momento proposto (maggio 2021) valuto che sia equilibrato per le caratteristiche del prodotto e la sua affidabilit√† operativa.In quanto alla spedizione e consegna da parte di Amazon sono state ancora una volta efficienti.Mi auguro che questa recensione possa esservi di aiuto e se avete dubbi o quesiti non esitate a chiedere.
4,Wie laden Sie denn Ihre Apple Watch und m√ºssen Sie unterwegs ggf. nachladen?Meistens komme ich √ºber den Tag doch da ich meine Uhr selten vollst√§ndig lade ich belasse sie √ºber die Nacht nicht auf der Ladeplatte geht mir manchmal am Tag der Strom aus. Meistens passiert es mir dann wenn ich die Uhr intensiv benutze beispielsweise beim Sport zur Aktivit√§tsaufzeichnung und ggf. auch Musikstreaming via Mobilfunk denn meine Uhr hat die Cellular Funktion. Ich benutze meine Uhr √ºberwiegend ohne das iPhone daher die Cellular Version die jedoch mehr Strom verbraucht.Auf Reisen nehmen ich gerne eine Powerbank mit integrierter Ladeplatte f√ºr die Apple Watch mit doch eben nicht immer denn ich habe gerne leere Hosentaschen und scheue Taschen und Rucks√§cke.Hier kommt das NEWDERY USB Ladeger√§t f√ºr Apple Watch ins Spiel ich stie√ü zuf√§llig als Produktempfehlung darauf und darf sagen selten hat eine Produktempfehlung meinen Bedarf so treffsicher bedient.Der Ladeadapter ist unwesentlich gr√∂√üer als ein g√§ngiger USB Speicherstick und er findet √ºberall Platz in jeder noch so kleinen Tasche.√úber den g√§ngigen USB Anschluss passt der Ladeadapter an jedes USB Steckernetzteil (nicht USB-C) jede Docking Station oder auch Powerbank. Einen USB Anschluss findet man fast √ºberall sogar im Auto oder in der Bahn doch es fehlt oft am passenden Ladekabel jedenfalls bei mir.Die Apple Watch hat den Nachteil dass sie ein spezielle Ladeplatte ben√∂tigt und nicht auf den g√§ngigen Qi Ladern f√ºr Mobiltelefone l√§dt. Geht Ihrer Apple Watch der Strom aus brauchen Sie eine spezielle Ladeplatte. Ich hatte f√ºr den Urlaub einmal das originale Ladekabel vergessen so musste ich im Urlaub auf meine Uhr verzichten denn ich konnte sie nicht aufladen.Jetzt passiert mir das nicht mehr das NEWDERY USB Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Apple Watch geh√∂rt nun fest zum Bestand meines Mobilsets (Netzteil Smartphone Ladekabel) damit kann ich meine Uhr √ºberall aufladen.Ist das nicht genial?Genial ist hierbei nicht nur dieser unglaublich kleine Ladeadapter genial ist auch der Preis. Vergleichen Sie gerne mal die Preise der Apple Watch Ladeadapter...Wo Licht ist so sagt man da ist auch Schatten und den gibt es auch bei diesem NEWDERY USB Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Apple Watch.Die Ladegeschwindigkeit des NEWDERY USB Ladeger√§ts k√∂nnte h√∂her sein denn sie steht hinter der des originalen Apple Ladeadapters deutlich zur√ºck.Ich habe die folgenden Ladefortschritte mit meiner Apple Watch Series 5 44mm Cellular an einem 2A USB Port ermittelt:35% Ladestand zum Beginn  der Aufladung und Start der Zeitnehmung38% Ladestand nach 10min Aufladung51% Ladestand nach 30min Aufladung67% Ladestand nach 60min AufladungGem√§√ü Spezifikation des Herstellers betr√§gt die Leitungsaufnahme des Adapters maximal 1A/5V also 5W w√§hrend die Ausgangsleistung zur Uhr hin maximal 2W betr√§gt.Sie sehen an diesen Zahlen dass man f√ºr eine vollst√§ndige Aufladung der Uhr allerhand Zeit aufbringen muss doch ich sehe das nicht als Nachteil an. Der NEWDERY USB Ladeadapter ist f√ºr mich eine mobile L√∂sung um bedarfsweise nachladen zu k√∂nnen und genau das erf√ºllt er ausgezeichnet. Ich strebe nicht an w√§hrend der Rast einer Wanderung meine Uhr vollst√§ndig aufzuladen.Die Verabreitungsqualit√§t des Ladeger√§ts ist robust und zweckoptimiert hinzu kommt die sehr kompakte Bauform und der kabellose Betrieb demnach die ideale mobile L√∂sung. Sehr praktisch ist an dem Adapter auch die magnetische Fixierung der Uhr an der Ladeplatte so kann der Adapter auch vertikal eingesetzt werden die Uhr bleibt an ihm h√§ngen.Bewertung:Im Fazit gebe ich dem NEWDERY USB Ladeger√§t 4 von 5 m√∂glichen Sternen.Der Punktabzug resultiert einzig aus der etwas reduzierten Ladeleistung in allen anderen Details bekommt das Ladegere√§t von mir die volle Punktzahl.

4,Dadurch dass ich meine Apple Watch 6 t√§glich laden muss und sie auch nachts tragereicht die Zeit oft nicht aus um sie ganz aufzuladen.Dann habe ich h√§ufig das Problem dass der Ladestand der Watch kritisch wird bevor ich sie zu Hause nachladen kann.Da ich nicht √ºberall das sperrige Original- Ladeger√§t mit der langen Leitung mitnehmen m√∂chte war ich schon l√§nger auf der Suche nach einer handlichen L√∂sung.Das Kriterium der Handlichkeit erf√ºllt das Newdery Ladeger√§t wirklich optimal. Kleiner geht es kaum. Das finde ich richtig toll!Ich kann das Ladeger√§t problemlos in jede Hosentasche stecken wo es kaum Platz wegnimmt und √ºberhaupt nicht st√∂rt.Auch macht es einen sehr robusten Eindruck ist gut verarbeitet und es gibt keine st√∂renden Grate.Nun habe ich endlich die M√∂glichkeit die Watch unterwegs fast √ºberall laden zu k√∂nnen da geeignete USB- Steckpl√§tze aufgrund des geringen ben√∂tigten Ladestroms fast √ºberall zu finden sind. So z.B. auch PC- oder Notebook- USB-Buchsen oder eine sogar kleine Powerbank.Das Design oder die matte petrolblaue Farbe sind kein optisches Highlight.Aber die Optik ist f√ºr mich auch nicht das entscheidende Kriterium f√ºr eine immer-dabei- Ladem√∂glichkeit.Mein einziger kleiner Kritikpunkt ist die Ladegeschwindigkeit.Um meine Watch von 16% auf 100% zu laden hat es 2 Stunden + 42 Minuten gedauert.Das ist nicht extrem langsam sondern bewegt sich auf einem Niveau das auch viele einfache station√§re Ladeger√§te haben.Aber mit dem Original- Ladeger√§t von Apple dauert eine Ladung nur 15 Stunden.Hier ist also noch Luft nach oben.Aber um meine Watch kurz nachzuladen um zu verhindern dass sie sich aufgrund eines niedrigen Ladestandes abschaltet reicht mir die Ladegeschwindigkeit aus.Diese bleibt √ºber den gesamten Ladebereich relativ konstant bei 1% Ladekapazit√§tssteigerung in 2 Minuten.Also um 10% nachzuladen dauert es ca. 20 Minuten.Ich werde mir auch noch ein weiteres kaufen um dies noch in meine Arbeitstasche zu legen um so auf jeden Fall eins dabei zu haben wenn ich mal vergessen sollte es einzupacken.Ich kann das Ladeger√§t jedem empfehlen der wie ich das Problem hat mit der Akkuladung oft nicht √ºber einen Tag zu kommen.Dadurch ist der regelm√§√üige Blick auf den Ladezustand f√ºr mich nun nicht mehr erforderlich da ich jetzt wei√ü dass ich jederzeit nachladen k√∂nnte.
5,Cargador USB para Apple es inal√°mbrico y port√°til presenta velocidad de carga r√°pida ligero y resistente nos brinda comodidad.
4,Ja die schnellste M√∂glichkeit eine Apple Watch zu laden ist das nicht √ºber das USB Ladeger√§t daf√ºr eine gute M√∂glichkeit f√ºr unterwegs.Meine Frau hat in der Handtasche eine kleine Powerbank und am Schl√ºsselbund das USB Ladeger√§tchen f√ºr die Watch ... Da kann sie immer mal wieder wenn sie die Watch gerade nicht braucht sie wieder aufladen. Unterwegs.... aber halt langsam. Aber immerhin es l√§dt und die Watch kommt so auch durchaus mal auf 3-4 Tage Akkulaufzeit oder gar eine Woche weil sie immerwieder zwischendurch Saft bekommt.Klasse Gadget!!!(Ja man kann auch ohne sowas leben!)
5,Il prodotto si presenta in una scatola di cartone metti finita con su stampate tutte le caratteristiche del prodotto una volta aperta sia accesso al prodotto in s√© ed al suo libretto di istruzioni a primo acchito il prodotto sembra molto ben costruito e bello √® finito mi piace la chicca del laccetto di pelle cos√¨ che possa essere utilizzato tipo portachiavi (anche se √® un po‚Äô grande per questo scopo)FINITURE:Le finiture sono di pregio l‚Äôassemblaggio e ottimo non ci sono sbavature la plastica sembra robusta e benfatta niente da invidiare a prodotti di marchi pi√π blasonati.UTILIZZO:A differenza del prodotto Apple questo prodotto pu√≤ essere utilizzato direttamente attaccato ad una presa USB consentendo la ricarica con il minimo ingombro se la presa √® in verticale il prodotto a un magnete potente abbastanza da tenere il Watch attaccato senza che questo cada.PRESTAZIONI:Il tempo di ricarica da test effettuati √® leggermente inferiore al tempo del caricatore originale ma questa √® una pecca che si pu√≤ perdonare considerando che questo prodotto √® concepito come caricatore di emergenza da tenere sempre con se e dalla qualit√† percepita del prodotto.Se avesse avuto anche le stesse capacit√† di carica del prodotto originale sarebbe stato perfetto.
4,Per quanto io non ami particolarmente il mondo Apple in casa abbiamo comunque un Apple Watch e quindi mi sono incuriosito nel vedere questo NEWDERY Caricabatterie USB.Se devo essere onesto alla fine il suo lavoro lo fa pi√π che bene.Decisamente molto compatto se ci troviamo nelle canne con la batteria e siamo sul lavoro o in posti dove non abbiamo a portata il nostro caricatore originale questo pu√≤ risolvere egregiamente il problema.Come in ferie invece di portarci dietro l'originale ci basta una fonte USB e con questo oggettino non abbiamo problemi.Ovviamente la potenza e quindi velocit√† di ricarica dipendono dalla fonte alla quale ci colleghiamo.La forma √® ben studiata per renderlo in meno ingombrante possibile.La parte magnetica √® pressoch√© identica alla base originale.Le plastiche sono di qualit√†.Se siete persone che rimangono spesso a piedi con il proprio Apple Watch allora credo che questo oggettino vi possa aiutare.In ogni caso √® un idea carina e interessante.Io ve lo consiglio.
5,Un bizzarro portachiavi o un utile strumento per la ricarica in mobilit√†? Scopriamo cosa Newdery aveva in mente quando ha fatto questo caricatore per Apple Watch1. Il packagingMolto fresh e molto young mostra una foto con il caricatore (del colore sbagliato) e delle informazioni del tutto irrilevanti per chi volesse comprarlo. Mi piace.2. DesignIl design probabilmente si rif√† a un portachiavi visto che il concetto √® proprio quello di avere un caricatore sempre con s√©. E di fatto √® un ottimo portachiavi compatto e tascabile con il cappuccio che non pu√≤ essere separato dal corpo principale per evitare di essere perso. Il blu notte √® anche esteticamente carino abbastanza elegante ma senza esagerare.3. Utilizzo e ricaricaIl cappuccio copri-presa aderisce bene al connettore quindi va tolto con un po‚Äô di enfasi. La presa √® di tipo USB-A (quella classica) ma √® curiosamente reversibile cio√® si pu√≤ collegare in entrambi i versi come le moderne prese USB-C. Un connettore pi√π unico che raro. Una volta inserito il caricatore basta appoggiare l‚ÄôApple Watch sopra di esso per ricaricarlo.La ricarica impiega lo stesso tempo che impiegherebbe con un cavo originale visto che l‚Äôoutput erogato √® di 2W (il massimo supportato da Apple Watch).Suggerisco di non posizionarlo in verticale cio√® lasciando il Watch ‚Äúappeso‚Äù: la presa magnetica del caricatore non √® molto forte (meno del cavo originale) pertanto c‚Äô√® il rischio che l‚Äôorologio scivoli via.4. Il prezzoCosto di ‚Ç¨1499 per questo portachiavi/caricatore. Non √® male considerando che il cavo originale da 30cm costa ‚Ç¨20 e che ci sono soluzioni simili a questo che costano molto di pi√π.5. Conclusioni√à ottimo sia come portachiavi che come soluzione ‚Äúda campeggio‚Äù. Il prezzo √® buono pertanto se puntate alla portabilit√† massima questo caricatore fa sicuramente al caso vostro. Consigliato.VOTO FINALE: 8/10
4,Da ich meine Apple Watch 6 t√§glich laden muss und sie auch nachts tragereicht die Zeit oft nicht aus um sie ganz aufzuladen.Dann habe ich oft das Problem dass der Ladestand der Watch kritisch wird bevor ich sie zu Hause nachladen kann.Da ich nicht √ºberall das sperrige Original- Ladeger√§t mit der langen Leitung mitnehmen m√∂chte war ich schon l√§nger auf der Suche nach einer handlichen L√∂sung.Das Kriterium der Handlichkeit erf√ºllt das Newdery Ladeger√§t wirklich optimal. Kleiner geht es kaum. Das finde ich richtig toll!Ich kann das Ladeger√§t problemlos in jede Hosentasche stecken wo es kaum Platz wegnimmt und √ºberhaupt nicht st√∂rt.Auch macht es einen sehr robusten Eindruck ist gut verarbeitet und es gibt keine st√∂renden Grate.Nun habe ich endlich die M√∂glichkeit die Watch unterwegs fast √ºberall laden zu k√∂nnen da geeignete USB- Steckpl√§tze aufgrund des sehr geringen ben√∂tigten Ladestroms fast √ºberall zu finden sind. So sind z.B. auch PC- oder Notebook- USB-Buchsen oder eine sogar kleine Powerbanken geeignet.Mein einziger kleiner Kritikpunkt ist die Ladegeschwindigkeit.Um meine Watch von 16% auf 100% zu laden hat es 2 Stunden + 42 Minuten gedauert.Das ist nicht extrem langsam sondern bewegt sich auf einem Niveau das auch viele einfache station√§re Ladeger√§te haben.Aber mit dem Original- Ladeger√§t von Apple dauert eine Ladung nur 15 Stunden.Hier ist also noch Luft nach oben.Aber um die Watch kurz nachzuladen um zu verhindern dass sie sich aufgrund eines niedrigen Ladestandes abschaltet reicht mir die Ladegeschwindigkeit aus.Diese bleibt √ºber den gesamten Ladebereich bei ca. 1% Ladekapazit√§tssteigerung in 2 Minuten.Um 10% nachzuladen dauert es ca. 20 Minuten.Ich kann das Ladeger√§t jedem empfehlen der wie ich das Problem hat mit der Akkuladung oft nicht √ºber einen Tag zu kommen.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†A compact usb charger for an Apple Watch ‚åöÔ∏è in pink.It can be plugged into any usb supply like a phone charger computer a usb mains extension mains usb wall socket power bank etc.The charger has a strap attached so you can connect a key ring to it to attach it to your bag belt loop etc. It‚Äôs small enough to just keep in your power bank box along with all your leads.It connects and charges my wife‚Äôs Apple Watch SE with no problems. Just as fast as a Apple charger. Plug it in at night and fully charged in the morning.Handy pocket size for visiting friends and family holidays or for use in the office even plug into your cars usb socket etc. Never have a flat watch again.A great price and I‚Äôm happy to recommend.
4,Handy compact Apple Watch Charger. Plugs into a USB-A socket and works well with a portable charging unit when travelling. Despite claim of ‚Äòoriginal charging speed‚Äô it does appear to be fairly slow but is a really good option to have in the travel bag or on a key ring for emergencies and as a back up to your main charging puck. The lid doubles as a support for the watch when used in a vertical position which is a nice touch.
4,Dieses kleine Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Apple Watch kam inklusive englischsprachiger Kurzanleitung.Das Ladeger√§t besteht auf Plastik f√ºhlt sich okay verarbeitet wenn auch nicht sehr stabil f√ºr mich an.Das Ladeger√§t hat einen Standard USB (Typ A)-Stecker der mit einer integrierten Gummi-Abdeckung gesch√ºtzt werden kann.Das Ladeger√§t kann direkt an einem Netzteil betrieben werden - so fern der USB-Stecker liegend positioniert ist. Ansonsten h√§lt die Watch magnetisch nicht wirklich ideal der integrierte Magnet scheint nicht besonders stark zu sein. Man k√∂nnte das Ladeger√§t auch mit einem USB-Verl√§ngerungskabel nutzen...Praktisch ist jedenfalls dass das Ladeger√§t wirklich sehr klein und leicht ist und man nicht noch ein weiteres Kabel mit nehmen muss dass ich verheddern kann...Also super f√ºr Unterwegs bzw. um es immer z.B. im Laptoprucksack dabei zu haben.Das Aufladen scheint mir nicht ganz so schnell zu gehen wie mit dem Ladeger√§t der Series 6 Watch aber ausreichend schnell.F√ºr mich also eine ideale Erg√§nzung als zus√§tzliches Ladeger√§t f√ºr eine Apple Watch.Man sollte bedenken dass neue Macs USB C-Stecker haben und das Ladeger√§t nicht direkt passt - auch bei Nutzung von aktuellen iPhone-Schnell-Ladeger√§ten k√∂nnte der USB C-Stecker praktischer sein.
4,This is a doddle to use and highly portable.You don‚Äôt have to worry too much about orientation of the port you plug it in to because the charger will hang on to your watch whichever way round it is. For optimum security though to stop it falling off if knocked you really want a port with the ‚Äòtongue‚Äô at the bottom. That way your watch will sit on top of the charger as shown in the second picture.Charging takes significantly longer than with the original Apple charger. Mine takes about 1¬º hours to go from 10% to 100% with the Apple charger but best part of 1¬æ hours with this. That might not matter especially if you‚Äôre in the habit of charging your watch overnight but it‚Äôs something to be aware of.I keep this in my laptop bag so it goes with me pretty much anywhere and I always have it to hand. I‚Äôd probably rate it a 4.5 or 5-star product even with the lower speed but it comes in a completely unnecessary plastic blister tray ‚Äì one star deducted and arguably it should be two or more deducted.
4,Mein originales Apple Watch Ladekabel wird in einer Ladestation fixieret deswegen muss ich einen Charger f√ºr unterwegs suchen.Der Versand von Amazon ist wie gewohnt schnell und die Verpackung ist problemlos. Die gesamte Verarbeitung ist sauber gut und die Qualit√§t ist in Ordnung gut.* Zum Hauptthema:Output 2 Walt. Die Ladungsgeschwindigkeit ist n.m.M. ein bisschen langsamer als das originale Kabel. Nach meinem Test l√§dt dieser Charger die Watch Serie 4 in 30 Mins ca. 15% (Mit einem originalen Kabel ca. 20% in 30 Mins). W√§hrend der Ladung bleiben die Watch und den Charger stets auf einer niedrigen Temperatur. Au√üerdem ist die Ladungserfahrung gleich einfach wie das originale Kabel. Also der Magnet klebt die Watch automatisch.*** Zwei Details muss ich den Hersteller HOCH loben. Sehr gut und praktisch gemacht!1. Zwei Weisen zur Ladung: Die Watch kann w√§hrend der Ladung je nach Bedarf "stehen" lassen oder "flach" liegen bleiben.2. Der USB-A Anschluss ist !NICHT! normal und NICHT traditionelle. Die Form ist schon neu verbessert geworden. Die Nutzungserfahrung ist wie USB-C sehr bequem und positiv!Es gibt gar "KEINE richtige" Richtung zum Anschluss. N√§mlich kann man die beiden Seiten(ober oder unter) ohne Denken am Strom anschlie√üen.Insgesamt bin ich damit sehr zufrieden. Ein sehr COOLE+kleine Ladeger√§t f√ºr unterwegs!

4,Ok... Ok so maybe i'm late to the party but the one thing that everybody complains about with USB A is the fact that it is not diverse and reversible like USB C... Well that fact just went out the window lol. This is a USB A dongle device that uses some type of white malleable material to give that versatility that USB A never had! The industry should take design cues from this concept as my head has just exploded (Insert exploding head emoji here).Not only small and incredibly portable this device coded to charge the Apple Watch even puts up the performance. I can achieve a full charge in around 2 hours which is the standard for my expectations.Incredulous little unit incredible 4 stars
5,This is absolutely brilliant.can charge my watch while using the laptop
5,Adoro Apple e tutti i suoi prodotti ma volendo comprare un secondo caricatore per l'apple Watch SE il prezzo √® sui 30‚Ç¨ circa senza considerare che il cavo apple non brilla per robustezza e durata in quest'ottica questo caricatore √® davvero straordinario per 3 motivi:1) Ha un prezzo davvero contenuto anche se su amazon ce ne sono anche di piu' economici2) Non ha il cavo quindi in effetti √® difficile possa sfilarsi e rompersi come accade sempre con gli originali apple3) E' compatto e super portatile sembra una penna USB eppure rimane stra-comodo da usare perch√© riesce a caricare l'apple watch anche sulle prese da muro verticali grazie al fatto che il Copri USB  andr√† a creare una sorta di supportino per reggere l'orologio oltre alla gi√† buona presa magnetica.Davvero un caricatore particolare e comodo
4,Meine Apple Watch (S3) funktioniert mit dem Ladeger√§t super. H√§lt magnetisch fest der kurze USB Anschluss hat sich am Ende allerdings als eher unpraktisch erwiesen. Habe das ganze nun an ein USB Verl√§ngerungskabel angeschlossen. So ist es f√ºr mich besser.Nun kann ich Abends am Nachttisch im Notfall fix meine Uhr anschlie√üen und in der Nacht runternehmen und muss nicht immer in Flur rennen wo sonst alle unsere Ladeger√§te h√§ngen.Die Farbe ist nat√ºrlich schick aber spielte f√ºr mich keine Rolle.Weil es so klein ist ist es aber auch schneller im Urlaub eingepackt. Praktisch aber den kurzen USB Anschluss sollte man bedenken wenn man es nicht gerade an den PC anschlie√üen will. Gef√ºhlt dauert das aufladen aber l√§nger als beim Original. Vor allem das Schnellladen am Anfang‚Ä¶ wirkt jedenfalls langsamer.
4,Firstly my mistake‚Ä¶.this isn‚Äôt quite what I was expecting as I thought it would be a portable power bank for Apple Watch charging.ie that I would be able to charge it up and then keep it in my bag to pull out on days that my watch battery was flagging and give it a little boost charge. Hence the term ‚Äòportable‚ÄôNo this is just an alternative to the original Apple Watch charger which has to be plugged into power/usb device reducing its ‚Äòportability‚Äô ??So if it‚Äôs just a spare to your Apple charger that you‚Äôre after it‚Äôs fine just a little slower and it‚Äôs neat and compact but that‚Äôs all it is.
5,Dispositivo davvero simpatico e utilissimo per poter caricare in mobilit√† dovunque ci troviamo il nostro Apple Watch.La confezione √® minimale e contiene esclusivamente il dispositivo di ricarica senza altri cavi o adattatori. Il presupposto √® che si possa utilizzare con qualsiasi porta USB sia direttamente ad un altro dispositivo (come un notebook la presa di ricarica della macchina eccetera) sia attraverso un caricabatterie da rete con attacco USB.Il corpo √® realizzato interamente in solida plastica e la presa USB √® protetta da un piccolo cappuccio in gomma che nel momento in cui si apre (e non si perde visto che √® agganciato al resto) pu√≤ essere ruotato e inserito all‚Äôinterno della struttura stessa per trasformarsi in un ferma orologio. In appendice troviamo un‚Äôasola in pelle scamosciata che pu√≤ fungere da portachiavi per agganciarlo ad esempio ai passanti della cintura. Design minimale e ultra compatto.Il dispositivo riesce a caricare nel giro di tre ore massimo un Apple Watch di qualsiasi generazione (anche la primissima serie) non scalda esageratamente e soprattutto si adatta ad amperaggi anche non elevati; ha infatti caricato l‚Äôorologio utilizzando anche la presa USB di una Toyota Yaris seconda serie dove sicuramente la presa non ha un amperaggio superiore a 1 A.15 euro sono davvero un ottimo prezzo se rapportato alla qualit√† e alla funzionalit√† elevata di questo prodotto.
4,Ho preso questo gadget perch√® rappresenta ci√≤ che io intendo per gadget utile. Se avete un Apple Watch la vostra preoccupazione principale √® come ricaricarlo quando siete in giro. Con il suo alimentatore in dotazione direte. Ovviamente si! Pensato per√≤ di avere a disposizione un caricatore wireless che potete tenere come portachiavi e che se avere un cavo chilometrico potete inserire nella vostra USB del PC e usarlo per ricaricare al volo il vostro smartwatch. Questo gadget unisce davvero la praticit√† di un daget compatto e carino da vedere a la funzionalit√† di un caricabatterie wireless tradizionale. Unica pecca che non mi ha permesso di dare 5 stelle √® la durata della ricarica che √® davvero un p√≤ lenta. Potevo aspettarmi di meglio? Direi di no. Se lo provate rimarrete stupiti dalla praticit√†.
4,Ich habe mir dieses Ladeger√§t f√ºr unterwegs bestellt. Die Farbe sagt mir nicht so zu da hatte ich jedoch keine Wahl. Es wirkt etwas billig verarbeitet bei dem Preis ist das aber ok. Es sitzt gut in einem USB Stecker und auch die Uhr h√§lt gut. Beim Laden k√∂nnte es etwas flotter gehen aber es ist noch im Rahmen. Es wird warm bei Benutzung aber auch das h√§lt sich in Grenzen. Insgesamt ist es ein gutes platzsparendes Accessoire.
3,This made in China wireless charger simply plugs into an USB 3.0 socket and is good to go.  The plastic dust cap fits tightly and protects the metal parts.  It is not particularly fast but is an adequate emergency stand by.  It takes about 3 hours to fully charge my Apple SE series watch.  I was a bit worried as the charger and watch was really warm to the touch.  This will be useful as a back up charger only.
3,This made in China small watch charger is compatible with my SE Apple Watch.  It is simple to plug into a USB socket on your computer and leave it to charge.  The whole unit is 6cm long and 3.3mm wide.  The cap fits securely to the metal part and is attached by short length of plastic so you don't lose it.  It took about 2 hours to to reach 40% and got really warm.
4,... aber f√ºr den Notfall oder f√ºr's Reisegep√§ck reicht es.Wir haben kein Apple aber unsere Kinder und oft kommt es vor dass der Akku geladen werden muss selten auch mal jener von der Uhr. Da kam jenes Teil wie gerufen. Komplett aufladen ist hier auch nicht n√∂tig aber ein paar Prozent wenn man zum Kaffee vorbei kommt reichen ja auch vollkommen.F√ºr mehr sollte man dann doch aufs Original zur√ºck greifen.
5,Ich war skeptisch doch ich muss nun konstatieren das mich dieses kleine Ladeger√§t durchaus begeistert.Das NEWDERY USB Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Apple Watch in meinem Fall der Apple Watch 6 ist angenehm klein und macht einen absolut feinen und hochwertigen Eindruck.Der USB Anschluss wird mit einer kleinen Silikon Kappe abgedeckt die mit dem Ladeger√§t.Verbunden ist damit man sie nicht verlieren kann. Am anderen Ende befindet sich eine kleine Lederschlaufe die aber wenig geeignet ist um das Ladeger√§t z.B. an einem Schl√ºsselbund zu tragen sondern eher ein stylisches Attribut ist. Die Farbe ist in eine sehr dezenten und elegantem grau.Das Ladeger√§t wird einfach in eine vorhanden USB Buchse gesteckt die Apple Watch Series 6 wird daraufgelegt wie bei meinem Original Apple Ladeger√§t und die Watch wird mittels Magnet daran festgehalten und induktiv aufgeladen. Das klappt sehr gut keine Probleme.Oder doch ein kleines Problemchen gibt es dann doch:Die meisten USB Buchsen am PC sind hochkant in meinem Fahrzeug habe ich vorne 3 USB Buchsen serienm√§√üig alle hochkant und da h√§lt die Apple Watch nat√ºrlich nicht richtig jedenfalls nicht sicher genug denn sie kann durchaus herunterfallen oder herunterrutschen. Das w√§re mir dann doch zu schade denn die Watch 6 hat √ºber 700 Euronen gekostet. Ich habe als L√∂sung einfach einen kurzen USB Kabel als Adapter genommen an dem ich das Ladeger√§t stecke und somit kann ich es dort platzieren wo ist es mag und die Watch nicht heruntergleiten kann. auch in meinem Fahrzeug liegt sie nun gerade in der Smartphone Ladeschale f√ºr induktives Laden √ºber der sich diese USB Buchsen befinden. Darunter ein Mikrofasertuch ‚Äì ja da bin ich pingelig.Aber das nur als winzige Kritik die aber eigentlich keine sein soll denn das Ladeger√§t macht ansonsten einen sehr guten Eindruck macht einen guten Job und ich bin v√∂llig zufrieden.Der Preis ist absolut der Wahnsinn wenn man bedenkt wieviel mehr das Original Mag Safe Ladeger√§t kostet wovon ich zwei St√ºck besitze damit ich unten und oben im Haus immer eines zur Hand habe und nicht jedesmalig abst√∂pseln muss.Ich kann es daher sehr empfehlen und vergehe aus √úberzeugung 5 Sterne.
3,Verpackt in einem kleinen Karton mit nicht unbedingt notwendigem Plastik-Formteil. Beiliegend das Ladeger√§t und ein Info-Bl√§ttchen (englisch) Abb.1.Wirklich viel zu beschreiben gibt es hier nicht klein mit einer kleinen Lederschlaufe und einer Schutzkappe versehen.Verarbeitung empfinde ich als befriedigend und nicht unbedingt zum Preis passend (Abb. 2).Praktischer Einsatz:Leider kann ich die vielen die positiven Beurteilungen nicht teilen.Das Teil funktioniert zwar und damit h√∂rt es f√ºr mich auch schon auf.Sieht man es als kleine Notl√∂sung oder als Reisel√∂sung an kann man zu dem Urteil kommen ‚ÄûOK‚Äú aber rund 15- ‚Ç¨ f√ºr die angebotene Haptik nicht mehr als drei Sterne h√§tte man wenigstens noch ein Kabel beigelegt so das man auch jedes Standard-Ladeger√§t nutzen k√∂nnte h√§tte ich noch ein Auge zugedr√ºckt.Denn so ist faktisch nur im Waagerecht-Betrieb der Ladevorgang m√∂glich.Kommen wir zum eigentlichen (meiner Meinung nach) Denkfehler der Konstruktion als solches. Aufladung prim√§r am Notebook (Abb. 3) denn es wird eine waagerechte USB Buchse ben√∂tigt oder eben doch noch ein zus√§tzliches Netzteil.Bei Letzterem geht es dann los denn es kann nicht jedes Standard-Netzteil genutzt werden denn je nach Ausf√ºhrung und vorhandener Netzsteckdose ist ein waagerechtes Einstecken in ein Netzteil nicht m√∂glich (vom Einstecken in PKW USB Buchsen je nach PKW-Typ mal ganz abgesehen).Von daher w√§re wenigstens noch ein Adapterkabel beigelegt w√ºrde ich ein Auge zudr√ºcken.Zusammenfassung:F√ºr mich faktisch uninteressant da zu unflexibel mir ist die Kabell√∂sung deutlich lieber da ich hier dann jedes Standard Netzteil nutzen kann. Daher f√ºr mich pers√∂nlich aus beschriebenen Grund maximal 2 Sterne.F√ºr den der es als Notl√∂sung ansieht das sind dann vielleicht die meisten vergebe ich auch maximal nur 3 Sterne aufgrund der Inflexibilit√§t. W√§re wenigstens noch ein kleines Adapterkabel dabei k√∂nnte ich mich vielleicht zu 4 Sternen durchringen so aber bleibe ich bei 3 Sternen.
4,Nachdem ich sehr oft vergesse meine Apple Watch zu laden und unterwegs merke das ich nur noch 10% an Akku habe kam dieses Ladeger√§t ToGo sehr gelegen. Nun kann mir sowas nicht mehr passieren.Was mir jedoch aufgefallen ist wenn man es so wie ich gerne mal am Laptop ansteckt wackelt die USB-A Schnittstelle vom Laptop ein wenig. Auf Dauer ist das f√ºr den Laptop bestimmt nicht so gesund. Daher werde ich es dort eher seltener anstecken was ich total schade finde weil ich es urspr√ºnglich f√ºr meinen Laptop f√ºr unterwegs gekauft hatte.
4,Das Ladeger√§t ist sch√∂n klein und passt in jede Tasche oder auch an den Schl√ºsselanh√§nger.An meinem MacBook funktioniert es einwandfrei. Allerdings ben√∂tige ich daf√ºr einen Adapter auf USB C. Die Schnellladefunktion  bleibt dabei erhalten.Das ist auch mein einziger Kritikpunkt: Warum wurde ein USB A verbaut? F√ºr ein Apple Ladeger√§t h√§tte ich es f√ºr stimmiger gehalten auf einen USB C Anschluss zu setzen. Bis auf die kleine Einschr√§nkung eine gut umgesetzte Idee.
4,Zuersteinmal f√§llt der g√ºnstigere preis im Vergleich zum Original auf. Die Qualit√§t und Verarbeitung sind top der Ladepuk ist etwas dicker als da Original dies st√∂rt aber nicht und f√§llt nur im Direkten Vergleich auf. Was mir allerdings aufgefallen ist das beim laden der Apple Watch Series 6 diese wirklich sehr warm wird. ja sogar schon hei√ü. Auf Dauer ist das meiner Meinung nach nicht gut f√ºr den Akku da dieser bei hohen Temperaturen schneller altert und verschlei√üt.Daher eignet sich dieses Ladeger√§t eher f√ºr den Notfall unterwegs oder im Urlaub.
4,Man glaubt gar nicht wie sinnvoll so ein kleines Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Apple Watch ist denn die Uhr l√§sst sich nur mit dieser Art von Ladepuck aufladen ist man aber unterwegs und die Uhr hat fast keinen Saft mehr so kann man dieses kleine Ladeger√§t in eine USB-A Buchse z.B. vom Laptop oder eines anderen USB-Laders stecken und die Uhr drauflegen.Dabei ist das Ladeger√§t auch magnetisch genug das die Uhr nicht sofort runterf√§llt wenn nicht alles gerade ist.Ich denke 4 Sterne sind f√ºr das Ladeger√§t angebracht.
4,Das NEWDERY USB Ladeger√§t f√ºr Apple Watch 6 ist gut verpackt und unbesch√§digt bei mir angekommen.Das Ladeger√§t macht einen gut verarbeiteten hochwertigen Eindruck.Mir gef√§llt es sehr gut da es wirklich √§u√üerst minimalsitisch ist.Man muss sich jedoch genau √ºberlegen wo man es anschlie√üt denn das Kabel ist auch kurz und je nachdem wie die USB Buchse ist hochkant oder waagrecht geht es mehr oder weniger gut.Bei einer Powerbank oder am Laptop geht es hervorragend.Ich hab eine Apple Watch 6 und da hat das Laden perfekt geklappt.Ein tolles Produkt das ich gerne weiterempfehle.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†A mi personalmente la bateria de el reloj de Apple tengo la version 4 me llega a durar dos d√≠as aproximadamente.Con este cargador de NEWDERY si te quedas o estas a punto de quedarte sin bater√≠a en el Apple Watch antes de ponerlo en modo ahorro de energ√≠a puedes usar este cargador movil que puedes llevar en el bolsillo mochila bolso o incluso en tu propio llavero.Su tama√±o es reducido es como una moneda de dos euros y tiene un conector USB-A el cual cuando no esta en uso lo protege de los golpes y polvo gracias a una capucha que este lleva incorporada al cuerpo del cargador.Como veis en una de las fotos yo he tenido que ponerle un adaptador USB-A a USB-C para poder conectarlo a mi MacBook Pro el cual solo dispones de salidas USB-C pero tambi√©n lo he probado con un hub y se carga perfectamente el reloj.Por el precio que tiene creo que merece la pena tenerlo y echarlo en la mochila junto a una power Bank as√≠ te aseguras de poder tener bateria para el movil y reloj.Espero que esta rese√±a haya sido √∫til.

5,Ich bin √∂fter auf Dienstreise (wenn es geht) und m√∂chte nicht unn√∂tig viel mitschleppen. Daher habe ich mir dieses Ladeger√§t besorgt. Wie auf dem Bild erkennbar kann man die Watch prima an einen USB-Adapter am Strom laden.Im Auto oder an einer Powerbank funktioniert dies analog. Super gemacht und ohne viel Schnickschnack.Fazit:+ kompakt+ sehr leicht+ Preis super+ f√ºr Reisen ideal
5,If you are anything like me there is always the moment - once a week or so - where my watch just dies whilst I'm out at work.  Annoying - because I want to count my steps and meet my goals and close my rings!So this is super fabulously perfect - i kept in my bag and it just slips into a usb plug and charges fairly quickly.  Usually I leave it for 20 mins or so and its enough to boost the watch to enable my day to continue.I love it.Good quality great value and highly recommended.
4,Funziona piuttosto bene ed √® stato risolutivo in molte occasioni.Si riassume in queste poche parole il mio giudizio complessivo di questo supporto di ricarica USB per Apple Watch in effetti lo sto utilizzando da circa tre settimane e pur avendo un comodo laccetto che ne consente l'aggancio al portachiavi preferisco invece utilizzarlo in automobile collegato ad un alimentatore da accendisigari nella pozzetto frontale della mia Nissan Qashqai.Lo ho sistemato innestato orizzontalmente ed alla bisogna appoggio sopra di esso il mio Apple Watch serie 4 che rimane in posizione grazie al magnete di cui √® dotato in pratica nella mia esperienza quando lo faccio aderire all'orologio alla partenza e viaggio per circa un'ora all'arrivo l'energia disponibile √® di circa il 51% ritengo quindi che con poco pi√π di due ore lo smartwatch raggiunga la piena ricarica.Leggero colore simpatico ha un copri USB in plastica gommata che rimane comunque connesso allo chassis quando rimosso dalla posizione di protezione questo per evitare di perderlo ovviamente nell'uso scalda un minimo ma nulla di preoccupante.Il costo √® pi√π che equilibrato e comunque popolare ma il suo fiore all'occhiello e la portabilit√† cosa che lo rende un accessorio importante per chi possiede un Apple Watch e che come me spesso ha necessit√† di ricaricarlo in movimento.
4,Yo soy de Android.Tengo todo Samsung entre tablet tel√©fonos reloj auriculares...Mi tel√©fono es un Note 10 Plus y me permite cargar mi reloj o auriculares con tecnolog√≠a inalambrica con carga inversa si le tengo que dar un chute a uno de ellos. Es una funci√≥n la mar de √∫til!Esto en un Iphone a d√≠a de hoy no es posible.Apple no permite que sus tel√©fonos carguen otros dispositivos. Bastante tienen ya con llegar al final del dia como para alimentar a otros equipos!Pues este aparatito tan sencillo permite que con cualquier power bank o con un port√°til puedas cargar el reloj en cualquier sitio sin tener que llevarte el cargador que trae por defecto.Es como llevarte un pendrive en el bolsillo y un power bank para tus emergencias y si te quedas colgado darle un empujoncito.La verdad es que esta bien parido la calidad es buena y el ritmo de carga es algo lento pero suficiente para el reloj. A raz√≥n de 2w con una entrada de 5v y 1A.Por el precio que tiene el tama√±o y lo apa√±ado que es es uno de esos accesorios que puedes llevar en el coche por si acaso y as√≠ evitar llevar el reloj apagado el resto del dia si no lo pusiste a cargar la noche previa.Incluso para tenerlo en la oficina y darle un chute para que te llegue al final del d√≠a...Yo se lo he dado a mi hermano que as√≠ como yo soy de Android √©l es Iphonero y le ha venido de perlas sobre todo porque no ten√≠a ni idea de que esto exist√≠a. Comprar√° uno m√°s para tenerlos repartidos entre el trabajo la casa etc...
5,This is so perfect for travelling no fidly wires involves plus it hooks on to your keys! Why did I just find out about this. I would 100% recommend this to anyone who owns an Apple Watch. Charges super fast and doesn‚Äôt effect the battery in terms of any permanent damage. I know it‚Äôs recommend by the company to use an original charger but this has been great overall.
5,This is a great little Apple Watch charger. I‚Äôve been caught out loads of times at work where I‚Äôve forgot to charge my watch up and now having this in my bag is great as it means I can charge it up pretty much anywhere that there‚Äôs a usb socket.It fits standard USB-A plugs without issue and you can also use a laptop or power bank to charge up your watch on the go. The little plastic end can be used to fit over the end of the plug to support your watch if you have it connected to a plug on its side. There are magnets built in just like the cable version so it‚Äôs easy to connect to.Overall I‚Äôm impressed with the size and quality of this charger and can recommend it if your after something  like this.
5,I never seen better idea for portable charger for apple watch. Every time i went somewhere on holiday i was carrying with me long charger which comes with my apple watch which wasn't comfortable and tidy since you had long cable dangling round. Here is tiny super light and very portable wireless charger which if fully compatible with apple watch. Nice cap protects USB and fill purpose of keyring as well if you want attach it somewhere. One downside of this charger is slow charging however it is understandable and doesn't affect that much considering positive aspect of it. Since i always have my laptop with me during travel it is very convenient for me to charge it directly from one of the USB from my laptop. Easy access rather than looking for adapter and socket somewhere in hotel or every time you want travel you have to unplug yours charger from wall. Very pleased with product.
3,Cargador Usb compatible con Apple Watch marca NEWDERY.Os dejo mi rese√±a despues de 15 d√≠as de uso.Se trata de un cargador port√°til con conexi√≥n Usb compatible con todos los modelos de Apple Watch.El tama√±o es muy reducido se puede llevar en un llavero perfectamente o como es mi caso en la funda del port√°til.Me gusta tenerlo a mano para dar una carga mientras estoy trabajando con el port√°til.Lo he probado ya varias veces y no produce calentamiento al reloj eso si la carga la realiza mas lenta que con el cargador original.Recomendable como segundo cargador para usos ocasionales.
5,The Newdery USB travel charger for Apple Watch is convenient and compact. When charging my series 6 watch It took two hours and 30 minutes approximately from 9% to 100% when charging from a USB Port on an extension lead. The genuine Apple charger usually charges my watch from 9% to 100% in approximately One hour 30 minutes when charging from my 90 watt multi 4 port charger So I decided to plug this travel charger into the same port as the genuine Apple charger and it still took two hours and 30 minutes approximately from 7% to 100%. The description does say it will take between 2 to 3 hours to fully charge your Apple Watch. Overall a perfect companion for those who travel with Apple watches or who wants to boost their charge whilst they‚Äôre at work with their computer or any USB charging point. I hope you have found my review helpful.
5,A compact usb charger for an Apple Watch ‚åöÔ∏è.It can be plugged into any usb supply such as a phone charger a laptop/computer a mains extension with USB ports a mains wall socket with usb sockets power bank car usb socket etc.The charger has a leather like strap attached so you can connect a key ring to it to attach it to your bag belt loop etc. It‚Äôs small enough to just keep in your power bank box along with all your other charge leads.It connects and charges my wife‚Äôs Apple Watch SE with no problems. Just as fast as a Apple charger.Plug it in at night and it‚Äôs fully charged in the morning.It doesn‚Äôt get overly hot and neither does the watch exactly the same as an apple charger just plug it in attach the watch magnetically and the charging icons come up on the watch.Handy pocket size for visiting friends and family holidays or for use in the office even plug into your cars usb socket etc.Never have a flat watch again.A great price and I‚Äôm really happy to recommend it.
5,This little gadget is absolutely brilliant in every way! It‚Äôs very small compact and highly portable. It has a stylish and modern design and the whole piece looks and feels like a premium quality product. It has a nice little soft tan leather hook on one end for attaching to a key ring. The other end of the USB is protected by a plastic cap when not in use. I plugged mine into my USB port adaptor and it was a simple case of plug and play. There is no need to download any software etc. You can literally plug this in anywhere there is USB connector. It charges with no issues too and I now take this with me everywhere I go. I don‚Äôt always need it to be fair but it‚Äôs useful for a quick top up. I will definitely be taking this camping and on holidays with me to save using my bulkier charger. Great product and worth every penny.
5,Wer kennt das als Besitzer eine Apple Watch nicht? Zum undenkbar falschen Zeitpunkt ist pl√∂tzlich der Akku fast leer und die Uhr geht in die Gangreserve. Dann ist sie einfach nur noch eine Uhr aber keine wirklich smarte mehr. Klar k√∂nnte man zum Beispiel im B√ºro problemlos nachladen Netzteile liege ja genug rum. Oder unterwegs wo doch die Powerbank in der Handtasche nur darauf wartet. Aber nein die Uhr braucht ja ihre magnetische Ladebasis. Und die ist nat√ºrlich nicht dabei. Jetzt k√∂nnte man sich ein teures Original von Apple kaufen oder aber f√ºr den gleichen Preis mindestens zwei dieser mobilen Ladepads von Newdery! Denn diese gibt es ja zu einem mehr als fairen Preis!Aber ist billig auch gut? In diesem Fall ja! Das aus Kunststoff gefertigte Ladepad mit USB-A Stecker an einer Seite wirkt wertig und robust. Eigentlich sieht es aus wie ein etwas zu gro√ü geratener USB-Stick. Und genau so wird es auch verwendet. Einfach an einen USB Anschluss der Wahl gesteckt die Uhr aufgelegt und schon wird geladen. Einfacher gehts nicht. Und danach verschwindet der Ladeadapter wieder in der Hosen- Hand- oder Laptoptasche. Das nenne ich perfekt.Von Qualit√§t Design und Verarbeitung bis hin zum praktischen Nutzen dieses Gadget hat einfach 5 Sterne verdient. Danke f√ºr dieses tolle und sch√∂n anzusehende aber vor allem praktische Produkt.
5,This Apple Watch charger is amazing a nicely packaged and well-designed little device that plugs into your usb socket with ease.The end protective cap can go over the device end when it‚Äôs in use (is a little tight) or on the usb end to stop dust getting in etc when not in use or travelling with it. Also another nice little design idea is the brown tag on the outer edge to make pulling it out of the usb socket a bit easier if you can‚Äôt grip all the charger pad.The changing pad for the watch is well sized and the watch magnetises on with a nice smooth motion to pull the watch into the right place to ensure maximum charging performance. I love this and it makes this work just like your apple watch changer but not all 3rd party chargers have this function.At ¬£13.99 this is a great and much cheaper alternative to a second apple watch charger.If you have found this review helpful please hit the helpful button as this inspires me to write more.
5,What a great idea. I can use this to give my apple watch a boost when I‚Äôm sat at my computer. My watch is 18 months old and only holds a charge from about 7am till 7pm. I need a touch longer than that sometimes especially if I‚Äôve been using it a lot that day and the charge holds for less time. This device simply plugs into your USB slot on a laptop. It‚Äôs magnetic so clips the watch on like all other Apple Watch chargers. The only thing you need to be aware of is that it will only work if your laptop is on and not in sleep mode. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs plugged into the wall or not as the watch seems to take charge from the laptop in either case. I prefer to have my laptop plugged in but it‚Äôs nice to know it will work if I don‚Äôt. Super portable and looks pretty good in terms of quality. It certainly works as I‚Äôve just used it. I‚Äôm very pleased and certainly recommend this.
5,Caricatore per Apple Watch comodissimo in viaggio compatto e con USB-A che entra in entrambi i versi con il tappo collegato al corpo con un piccolo cavo cos√¨ da non perderlo mai.Carina anche la colorazione blu per uscire dal classico bianco di Apple cos√¨ come il piccolo dettaglio in pelle per farlo sembrare pi√π premium.Nulla da segnalare riguardo la carica funziona benissimo forse non √® il pi√π veloce che io abbia mai testato ma usandolo di notte non √® un problema perch√© la mattina dopo il nostro Apple Watch sar√† sempre completamente carico.Io lo uso con un powerbank e lo trovo perfetto ma si pu√≤ anche usare direttamente su un caricatore a muro purch√© sia rivolto verso l‚Äôalto.Prezzo di 15‚Ç¨ decisamente contenuto rispetto all‚Äôoriginale Apple un prodotto da avere.

5,This Apple watch charger is small and very easy to use.  My husband is very pleased with it.  He plugs it into his laptop while he works then simply puts the watch back on his wrist when it is fully charged.  The charge rate is as quick as the normal Apple watch charger.  This a very useful addition to anyone's electronic accessories bag.

5,Ich durfte dieses "Ladeger√§t f√ºr Apple Watch iWatch Ladeger√§t USB-Ladeger√§t Reise-schnurloses Ladeger√§t mit leichtem tragbarem kabellosem magnetischem Schnellladeger√§t f√ºr Apple Watch Serie 6 5 4 3 2 1 SE (Blue)" von der Marke NEWDERY im Rahmen eines Produkttests ausprobieren wof√ºr ich mich erstmal bedanken m√∂chte und meine Bewertung im weiteren nicht beeinflussen soll.Das kleine Ladeger√§t wurde schnell und sicher in einem wei√üen bedruckten Umkarton geliefert und beim auspacken machte es einen soliden Eindruck ohne optische oder technische M√§ngel aufzuweisen!Dank der super kleinen kompakten gr√∂√üe l√§sst sich der Charger einfach wie einen USB-Stick in die Hosentasche stecken und ist an jedem USB-Lade-Port wie z.B. am PC an einer Powerbank oder an einer Steckdose mit einem USB-Netzteil bzw. einem USB-Port.Durch das Fliegengewicht der Apple Watch kann man diese wunderbar "im Fluge" auflegen ohne Sorge zu haben dass der USB-Stecker unter einer Last brechen w√ºrde au√üer nat√ºrlich durch au√üenwirkende Kr√§fte wie ein herunter dr√ºcken mit der Hand!Die Apple Watch von meiner Frau wird problemlos geladen und bislang konnten wir keine unnormale W√§rmeentwicklung feststellen!Fazit:Praktisches kleines Charging-Gadget f√ºr unterwegs problemlos in der Hosentasche zu transportieren und l√§dt einwandfrei die Smartwatch auf.Hier eine klare Kaufempfehlung von mir!
5,This little gadget has so many advantages:1) It's portable. I can easily put it on a keychain and/or in my purse when travelling. No long cord to carry;2) My watch easily connects to it. I have another type charger but the watch band gets in the way so it doesn't always lay flat on the magnetic circle; however that's no problem with this charger; 3) color choices make it easy to find it; 4) the price is low even thought the construction and ease of use is high.I'm very happy with this purchase
5,This is a brilliant idea and I‚Äôm so pleased I spotted it. This iWatch charger works perfectly with my Apple watch 5 and my husbands version 6. You can plug it into any USB slot including a USB plug laptop car or battery charger. When not in use it has a connector cover that remains attached so you can‚Äôt lose it.We took it for a short break at the weekend and it meant that we didn‚Äôt have to bother taking the larger watch charger that we have at home. It charges watches very quickly.There‚Äôs not much more that I can add apart from it‚Äôs great value hugely convenient and also looks good in pink! FIVE stars!
5,I think this is a really neat solution to having to take a power plug and a cable to recharge the Apple Phone. With many hotels now having usb sockets integrated into wall sockets this works superbly. We stayed in a hotel last week and the bedside sockets had usb sockets pop this in pop the watch on it and it charged just fine. And it is to hand if you need the watch during the night. The only nuance is that it is trickier to use if the usb socket in not horizontal. I have a usb plug through adapter but the USB ports are on the top so it is a bit of a balancing act to get the watch on to it. But that doesn‚Äôt really detract from its usefulness.
5,This USB charger for Apple watches is brilliant! It‚Äôs small and neat and can easily fit in a pocket or handbag or you can hook it on a keyring. It‚Äôs easy enough to plug into any USB supply like a computer a USB wall socket or a phone charger plug and it charges pretty quickly without the need for extra cables or plugs. It also has a built-in over-current over-voltage short circuit and over-temperature protection. It‚Äôs such a nuisance if my watch doesn‚Äôt fully charge because it hasn‚Äôt had enough time so it‚Äôs great to know I can just charge it up anywhere I go with this extremely useful little charger. It‚Äôs definitely worth the ¬£13.99 and I wish I‚Äôd got one ages ago.
5,Portable and wireless magnetic iWatch charger extremely convenient for travelling.It has a built-in magnetic charging which is compatible with Apple watch SE series 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 and comes with a USB so can be plugged into a wall charger or laptop.This charger is great to carry around as it is wireless and compact enough to put into pockets and has a nice keychain design allowing you to hang it onto a keychain so you do not lose it whilst out travelling.Furthermore it is completely safe due to its built- in over-current over-voltage short-circuit and over-temperature protection.Overall I think this a great quality product reasonably priced and makes charging my apple watch so much easier. Highly recommend.
3,Ein kleines Ladeger√§t f√ºr Apple Watch SE / Series 2 3 4 5 und 6. Einfach per USB angesteckt und die Uhr drauf. Dank des Magneten h√§lt die Uhr recht gut drauf. Leider dauert das Aufladen der Uhr je nach Akkuzustand bis 25 Stunden und Uhr / Ladeger√§t wird etwas warm. Nur leider keine Dauerl√∂sung da langsames Laden auf lange Sicht ein Akku sch√§digt.F√ºr eine Notl√∂sung zum Aufladen z.B. auf Reisen etc. sehr gut aber nicht jedes Mal. Das Design bzw. die Verarbeitung ist dagegen sehr gut da gibt es nichts zu meckern. Da es kein Original Produkt von Apple ist gehe ich damit Vorsichtig um. Das gleiche mache ich auch bei Smartphone (Ersatz)Ladeger√§te. Diese Ersatz Produkte kommen oft nie vom Original Hersteller und k√∂nnen gut laufen aber auch nicht.Ich gebe das Produkt 3 gute Sterne!
5,A volte ci si ritrova con il proprio iwatch in procinto di scaricarsi e quindi risulta prezioso avere a disposizione un accessorio per la ricarica. In passato portavo con me quello originale ma risultava piuttosto scomodo soprattutto per la lunghezza del filo (ed inoltre preferisco lasciarlo stabilmente a casa). Ho quindi molto apprezzato questo piccolo accessorio veramente molto leggero che si attacca alla presa USB anche del computer come avuto modo di provare e che risulta estremamente efficace per la ricarica senza dare alcun tipo di problema. Considerate le dimensioni lo si pu√≤ portare sempre con s√© in tasca o agganciato a d un portachiavi. Il prezzo risulta adeguato alla qualit√† del prodotto
5,This is a good apple watch charger really neat and compact design so is perfect for travel and keeping a spare in the bag or desk.  Works perfectly well absolutely no perfomance or compatibility issues.  The main USB connector has a small cap but doesn‚Äôt actually cover the socket head of the connector I would have liked this to have been fully covered to keep dust and debris out but this is not a big issue.¬£13.99 (at the time of writing this review) is acceptable a replacement original apple charger cable is over twice the price and this charges just the same.  There are some cheaper options out there but this is perfectly good and I like the compact design too.
5,Great little "pocket charger" that works perfectly fine.  I think I realised that it charges my watch a bit slower than the original one but it's good to have more options.It connects fine to wall charger external charger and laptop as well.Recommended
5,Note that this device does NOT include a battery. It's just a wireless charger that requires a USB port but does not have the cable with it. As such it's pretty good and charged my Watch just as quick as the charger that came with it. Build quality is nice and it feels durable. Handy for plugging into laptops or wall sockets when you don't want a cable draped everywhere.  Come with a handy loop so you can attach it to your key ring.This is ideal for travelling or just for places where you don't need the cable.
5,I got this for my daughter as she‚Äôs forever forgetting to charge her watchThe item arrives in a simple branded box removing the item i was impressed with the build quality its well made durable lightweight what i like about it is my daughter can simply attach it to her school bag and use it by plugging it into her portable powerbank allowing her to give her watch a charge when she forgets to charge it over night.At ¬£13.99 (at time or review) its defo worth its money recommended
5,No seriously I wont be. I love this anything to cut down on the amount of charging cables i leave the house with. it's brilliant and works very well with my iWatch 3. no issues at all and charges up just like it normally would. I can plug this strait into my power bank and I honestly like that is doesn't have a long cable. it's compact and theirs less chance of the watch getting knocked off it's charger if i can just set it down and leave it to do it's thing. you can even put this on a keyring.  pretty handy for plugging into a laptop even.  a great little handy iwatch charger to have on you.
3,Das Ladeger√§t wird gut verpackt geliefert.Die Verarbeitung ist gut keine Scharfen Kanten oder unsauberen Klebungen.Die Funktion ist gegeben es L√§dt eine Apple Watch Serie 6 ohne Probleme in 25 Stunden Voll auf.Das ist der Punkt der Leider 2 Sterne Kostet.Das Originale Ger√§t von Apple bei Verwendung des Selben USB Ladeger√§tes bei mir eine Steckdosenleiste.L√§dt die Uhr in 15 Stunden Voll auf.Wer die Uhr √ºber Nacht l√§dt hat damit keine Probleme.Ich jedoch h√§nge die Uhr morgens nach dem Aufstehen an die Ladung brauche eine Stunde zum fertig machen und dann ist Uhr geladen und es geht zur Arbeit  mit diesem Ladeger√§t nicht zu machen.Wen das nicht St√∂rt  der bekommt hier ein gutes Ladeger√§t ohne Kabel Salat.Diesen Leuten kann ich das Ger√§t empfehlen wer schnell laden m√∂chte Finger weg.
5,Das kleine USB Ladeger√§t ist super praktisch f√ºrs Auto wenn man unterwegs spontan die Uhr laden m√∂chte und noch einen Steckplatz im USB Ladeger√§t im Zigarettenanz√ºnder frei hat. Die Uhr haftet - wie gewohnt- magnetisch auf dem Ladeger√§t und l√§dt in gewohnter Geschwindigkeit. Ich bin zufrieden und wei√ü nicht wie die dieses Produkt ansonsten noch bewerten k√∂nnte ;)
5,I received this item from the Amazon Vine Program.I requested this item for my apple watch. I like it because it‚Äôs small and portable. It‚Äôs great for travel and it‚Äôs very handy. I can also use it to charge my watch using my laptop. Love that it doesn‚Äôt require a cable as I already have too much cable at home specially at my work station!It currently costs ¬£13.99 at the time of this review. Great value for money.This is by far the best charger I found for my apple watch. Highly recommended.
5,Impressive build quality and attractive design. In my opinion this is more convenient to carry around than a cable version of the watch charger. And I love the convenience of just plugging this into my laptop and having my watch charging within easy reach without the tangle of a cable.
5,Als das Laden durch einfaches Auflegen auf einer Ladematte so richtig popul√§r wurde gab es diese Technik von Apple zuerst f√ºr ihre Uhr die Apple Watch. Beigef√ºgt war immer nur der Ladeadapter mit langem Kabel und USB-A Stecker der als separates Zubeh√∂rteil richtig ins Geld geht.N√§chstes Problem bei der Uhr: Sie muss t√§glich geladen werden. Also muss man f√ºr jede l√§ngere Tour so einen speziellen Lader mitnehmen damit der Uhr unterwegs nicht die Puste ausgeht.Wer aber auf Reisen nicht das Originalteil mitnehmen will z.B. weil er das Kabel zuhause in einem Tischst√§nder fest verbaut hat oder Verlust bef√ºrchtet der muss Zubeh√∂rteile von Drittanbietern w√§hlen so wie diesem hier:Der Vorteil dieses Adapters ist seine Gr√∂√üe oder korrekter ausgedr√ºckt: Seine Kleinheit. Nicht viel gr√∂√üer als die Unterseite der Uhr sowie ein USB-Stecker misst diese Ladestation und sie ist auch sch√∂n flach. Sie bietet eine fest installierte Halteschlaufe in Lederoptik sowie eine Schutzkappe mit √ñse am Stecker.Wie auf den Fotos zu sehen gelingt das Laden der Uhr an jeder normalen USB-Buchse in meinem Fall sogar an einer Powerbank.F√ºr mich geh√∂rt dieses Teil ab jetzt in meinen Kulturbeutel der ja mit dem N√∂tigsten fertig gepackt f√ºr eine √ºberst√ºrzte Abreise parat steht.
5,This is simply a compact version of the original apple watch magnetic charger. The charging speed is the same but the unit size is greatly reduced with no more excess cable laying around. Perfect for a desk or multi charger device.
5,This Apple Watch USB Charger is so convenient for travelling and you receive a 'low battery' notification on your watch. It's so compact and fits well on a keychain having it as a keyring also means not having to remember to pack it in different bags etc. I received the light pink version and think it looks very stylish especially with the small brown label. The materials feel good quality and not needing to worry about the cable becoming damaged makes me confident it will last a good amount of time.
5,I got this to use when travelling. Some hotels don‚Äôt have enough sockets next to the bed so once you‚Äôve put your phone on to charge you have to swap over for your watch to charge but with this you can plug it in to any wall socket (I always take a front facing usb plug) and sit your watch straight on top. It‚Äôs a little slower to charge than the original but I can live with that.
5,Absolutely fantastic useful device i travel alot and i wish i had come across this sooner as my apple watch rarely lasts 24 hours and its a separate cable from the rest so I highly recommend this for practicality and effective storage. So In the photos I've attached this to my battery pack and it slides straight in and charges nicely with no issues then the watch rests on like a dream and is very responsive.You can hook this onto your keyring for safekeeping aswell and its a durable compact charger for the apple watch.Cant find a fault with it its that good and easy to use!
5,I like this so much! It gives you freedom and helps you stay calm even when out and about. I keep mine with my keys so I van charge the watch even in the car. It is perfect for travel no wires no fuss. You just plug it in a usb socket and this does the job. The magnet is strong enough and hold the watch well. I like the color too. Absolutely love it.
5,Wie meistens bei Amazon waren Lieferung und Verpackung sehr gut üòäAlle harten Fakten erspare ich mir an dieser Stelle diese stehen ja schon in der obigen Artikelbeschreibung.Ich bin der Typ Mensch der seine Watch gerne 24 Stunden durchgehend tragen m√∂chte...nat√ºrlich funktioniert das nicht wirklich.Nun ist es mir schon ab und zu passiert das meine Watch leer war und das Ladeger√§t nat√ºrlich nicht da ist schlie√ülich schleppt man dies ja nicht andauernd mit sich rum.Dieses kleine St√ºck hier ist f√ºr mich ein absoluter Segen! Ich habe es an meinen Schl√ºsselbund gemacht und habe es somit immer dabei. Nun ben√∂tige ich nur noch einen USB A Anschluss und schon kann die Watsch geladen werden. Selbst hochkant h√§lt sie daran fest. Richtig toll finde ich die Tatsache das der USB Anschluss das Prinzip von Lightning und USB Type C hat es ist einfach egal wie rum man es einsteckt!Die Verarbeitung ist sehr gut man k√∂nnte fast denken es ist ein original Apple Zubeh√∂rteil.Eine wirklich tolle Sache die sein Geld definitiv wert ist!
5,I have just received this Apple Watch charger and I‚Äôve been compelled to write about this wonderful little gadget. It works as a regular Apple Watch charger; with its magnetism keeping the watch in place except that it is only the size of a key ring with no cable. You simply plug the USB into a port and away you go. The charge rate is quick (2.5 hours for a full charge) and there is no case of overheating.A wonderfully innovative idea that is so simple yet practical. It is also very competitively priced which is even better.
5,Got this for my wife.  She loves it because..... it's pink :)But she also likes that it's a great travel charger for her Apple watch.  And it has a kind of a "lip" you can use to hold the watch in place if you're using this vertically so it's pretty flexible.It charges the watch exactly as you'd expect and it's super small and light for travel.  Very convenient and practical.
5,GAME CHANGER. The one thing I hated when moving to an Apple Watch from a Fitbit - super short battery life: it means that if you forget to charge overnight/in the morning you risk it dying through the day which is super annoying when working in an office every day. Enter this product: super small and easy to travel with; perfect for taking to the office in your handbag and easily charging your watch whilst there to ensure it never does again. Amazing price and charges quickly! Recommend.
5,I‚Äôm really impressed by this neat little charger.  It‚Äôs very well designedlight neat and very effective.  I charge my watch daily and this seems to charge a little faster than the lead and charger supplied.  The big pus is the size.  This is ideal for travel no plug required I can use it in the car to top up as I‚Äôm driving from the car USB port and it‚Äôs ideal with a small power bank.  Neat little gizmo and I‚Äôll be buying another so I have one handy whenever needed.
5,Dieses USB Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Apple Watch ist ideal f√ºr unterwegs. Es ist klein handlich und passt auch in die kleinste Handtasche oder zur Not sogar in die Hosentasche. Und das Beste ist dass man hierf√ºr kein Ladekabel braucht denn dieses kleine Ladeger√§t kann einfach mit dem entsprechenden USB Stecker in die Steckdose gesteckt werden.Das Ger√§t ist gut verarbeitet und die Funktonalit√§t ist absolut super. Auch der Magnet macht einen guten Eindruck. Ich habe meine Uhr vertikal zum Aufladen angebracht und die Haftung am Magneten mehrmals √ºberpr√ºft. Die Uhr hielt absolut sicher und ich hatte nicht den Eindruck dass sie von dem Ladeger√§t rutschen k√∂nnte. Dennoch w√ºrde ich immer die horizontale Auflage-Position w√§hlen wenn m√∂glich. Die Ladegeschwindigkeit ist leider etwas langsamer als bei dem Original von Apple was mich aber √ºberhaupt nicht st√∂rt da ich meine Uhr immer nachts auflade.Der Preis f√ºr dieses tolle Ladeger√§t ist zudem wirklich sehr g√ºnstig (1499 zum Zeitpunkt dieser Rezension). Ich bin absolut zufrieden und vergebe sehr gern 5 Sterne.
5,Really handy to keep in my bag if I need to charge my Apple Watch in the go. I like the pink colour and it‚Äôs quite compact
5,I really like how convenient this Apple Watch charger is for attaching to my keyring and bringing it with me on the go.It works great just plug it into any USB port and you have an Apple Watch charger ready to go.It‚Äôs made really well and feels strong and built well.
5,This is a brilliant charger to take along with a power bank on trips and gives the reassurance that you can top up the Watch battery - which lets face it isn't the best - when needed. It charges relatively quickly it's super-compact and the small leather pull is a nice design touch that hints at a much more expensive product. Overall a great option and a travel essential.
5,I was half expecting this product to be rubbish as it is only ¬£13 ish however it works absolutely perfectly. I plugged it into a power bank and put a completely dead Apple Watch on there and it charged it fully. It would be ideal for travel as it‚Äôs compact and means you don‚Äôt have to risk damaging or losing your official Apple charger. You can plug it into your laptop/usb plug/power bank. No wires to get tangled up. Would fit easily in a pocket or handbag.  I can see my family members wanting one each of these!
5,Dieser USB-Stick zum Laden der Apple Watch l√§dt die Uhr absolut zuverl√§ssig! Man steckt ihn bequem in den Laptop oder Desktop und kann sofort die Uhr auf die magnetische Ablagefl√§che legen damit diese aufgeladen wird - was wie erw√§hnt auch zuverl√§ssig geschieht!Ganz besonders toll finde ich die Art des USB-Sticks was ich vorher so nicht kannte (s. Bilder). Der  Stick l√§sst sich aufgrund der Beschaffenheit immer mit der Ladefl√§che nach oben einstecken damit die Uhr aufgelegt werden kann. Der Magnet ist zwar auch stark genug dass es umgekehrt funktionieren w√ºrde aber ich glaube uns allen als Besitzer einer Apple Watch w√§re das Risiko da zu gro√ü - muss man ja auch nicht so machen dank dieser Bauart des Sticks.Der Stick ist au√üerdem handlich und passt in jede Hosentasche au√üerdem l√§sst er sich mit der Lasche (s. Bilder) auch problemlos am Schl√ºsselanh√§nger befestigen.Von mir gibt es eine glasklare Kaufempfehlung f√ºr diesen Ladestick!!
5,This works well.I plugged it into my laptop placed the watch onto it and it charged.It‚Äôs great for travel or carrying around with you.Useful and good.
3,Mi mujer se pill√≥ este cargador para Apple iWatch y seg√∫n ella se trata de un producto de calidad media es verdad que es √∫til cuando tienes que ir de viaje pues ocupa poco es m√°s se puede usar como de llavero su dise√±o es peque√±o y la verdad que muy chulo pero lo malo es que si lo usas como cargador normal de diario se calienta mucho por eso ella lo recomiendo solo en ocasiones donde no puedes usar el cargador normal del Apple iWatch. Se usa mediante puerto USB y el color que eligi√≥ mi mujer es pink y a ella le gusta mucho es un rosa bebe as√≠ pastel.Seg√∫n la descripci√≥n del producto el reloj se carga en unas dos horas pero no es verdad es muy muy lento en cargarse y por eso el reloj termina calent√°ndose mucho. Se trata de un producto que para una urgencia o viaje que no puedas disponer del cargador normal se saca de un apuro pero desde el punto de vista de mi mujer el producto se podr√≠a mejorar mucho.üí∏El precio actual del cargador es de 1274 euros precio algo caro para ser un cargador.
5,A neat little device which is ideal for travelling. The magnetism is not mega strong but holds my watch reasonably securely and it does the job intended i.e. charges the phone. I am not sure about using it directly on a charger which has the watch rather precariously hanging on a wall socket but on my laptop it is great.Perfect addition to our travel kit and now one less cable to get tangled.
5,Dieses kleine Ladepad f√ºr die Apple Watch ist gerade durch seine kompakte Ausf√ºhrung ideal f√ºr unterwegs da es hier kein separates Kabel etc gibt sondern das Ladepad direkt in einen USB Port eingest√∂pselt wird.Aufgrund des Eigengewichtes der Uhr (egal ob mit Silikonarmband oder mit einem Metalarmband) w√ºrde ich den ‚ÄûHochkant‚Äú-Modus nicht benutzen da der magnetische Halt der Uhr viel zu gering ist als dass das so sicher h√§lt (Hersteller gibt hier 2 in 1 an aber eigentlich nur 1 in 1).Sicherer und sinnvoller ist also wenn das Ladepad waagerecht ausgerichtet ist also z..B. an einem Notebook und die Uhr und das Armband dann in der Waagerechten liegen oder man ein Steckernetzteil so in die Wandsteckdose steckt dass der USB Port waagerecht liegt (siehe Bilder).Von der Ladeleistung steht dieses Pad dem Original Ladepuck mit Kabel in nichts nach und bekommt entsprechend auch 5 Sterne von mir.
5,Sehr kleines Lageger√§t f√ºr die Applewatch. Pefekt f√ºr unterwegs. Bei horizontaler Anwendung ist das Auflegen der Uhr etwas fummelig. Ladezeit ist echt gut! Top! Ich habe inzwischen so ein Teil im B√ºro eins im Camper und eins immer in der Handtasche!
5,Un cargador super pr√°ctico y que funciona bien con el Apple Watch con el que hemos probado. Est√°bamos con miedo ya que a veces estos cargadores no suelen funciona nada bien pero este va fino fino. Lo hemos usado con una bater√≠a externa y con un cargador de pared y en √°mbos casos ha ido perfecto.La potencia de salida es de 5V-1A por lo que no sobrecalienta el Apple Watch aunque tampoco lo carga r√°pidamente; con esto quiero decir que en cuanto a velocidad de carga es como el cable original. Al tener la superficie imantada puedes ponerlo en una bateria u otro cargador en forma vertical que no se cae; muy √∫til cuando no est√° accesible el poder cargarlo en horizontal.Para finalizar un par de detalles muy interesantes: Primero que el USB de entrada sirve en ambos sentidos por lo que no hay que mirar en qu√© sentido se mete y segundo que cuenta con un peque√±o colgante para llevarlo en el llavero o colgado de alguna otra parte tanto es un parte delantera (junto a la tapa del conecto USB) como la trasera.Era un poco esc√©ptico sobre este producto pero despu√©s de probarlo me ha parecido muy bueno recomendable.
4,Se trata de un accesorio muy pr√°ctico para tener a mano y en caso de necesidad poder recargar el reloj. Como tiene un dise√±o tan compacto podemos llevarlo incluso a modo de llavero con las llaves de casa y utilizarlo con cualquier puerto USB disponible desde un ordenador a una cargador de pared o incluso una bater√≠a externa.Una de mis preocupaciones al realizar el pedido era que al conectarlo en el port√°til quedase en la posici√≥n adecuada para la carga y no del rev√©s. Esto lo ha resuelto muy bien el artefacto pues al contrario de lo que ocurre con un USB nomas no tenemos una posici√≥n correcta de inserci√≥n podemos introducirlo en las dos posiciones as√≠ siempre tenemos la placa de carga arriba.El √∫nico punto negativo es que se calienta m√°s que le cargador original u otros que he ido comprando a lo largo del tiempo y aunque la carga la realiza de forma correcta no deja de ser una peque√±a preocupaci√≥n.
5,Great for travelling as it can plug in to any USB charging device.  Works exactly the same as the regular Apple Watch charging lead - without the lead.  Lightweight and compact it can charge up a watch in a couple of hours.  Easy to use with a protector over the USB stick.  Great value for money.
5,Mit dem NEWDERY USB Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Apple Watch erh√§lt man eine gute und g√ºnstige Alternative zum originalen Ladekabel. MAn kann es einwandfrei f√ºr unterwegs und auf Reisen als Ersatz nutzen wenn man das originale aus dem Lieferumfang zuhause lassen m√∂chte oder eben fest in einem Uhrst√§nder oder √§hnlichem angeschlossen hat. Die Ladeleistung ist einwandfrei man merkt keinen Unterschied zum original Kabel. Manchmal hat man es bei Drittprodukten dass die Watch nicht richtig erkannt und geladen wird wenn sie auf dem Ladefeld aufliegt. Das ist nicht der Fall. Ich nutze das Ladeger√§t nun schon einige Tage und es l√§d sehr zuverl√§ssig ohne PRobleme. Es wird auch nicht besonders hei√ü. Klar W√§rmeentwicklung gerade bei dem kleinen kompakten Ma√ü ist vorhanden aber nicht √ºberm√§√üig. Ich m√∂chte das Ladeger√§t nicht mehr missen und habe es √ºberall dabei. Es passt ja in jede Hosen- oder Jackentasche. Genial!
5,Purtroppo l'unico punto debole dell'Apple Watch √® la batteria almeno nel modello 4 da 40 mm quindi questo accessorio diventa indispensabile:-) dimensioni ridotte circa 6 x 3 x 0.9 cm-) dotato di cappuccio che funziona sia da anello per agganciarlo ad un portachiavi sia come base di appoggio dell'orologio-) grazie alla porta usb-A √® possibile utilizzarlo su PC su gran parte degli alimentatori da smartphone e power bank-) esteticamente molto gradevole e tecnicamente ben fatto con ottimi materiali.Nessun problema di ricarica con una power bank con uscita usb-A da 5V e 2.4A nessun riscaldamento anomalo; i magneti sono buoni ma non ottimi √® possibile ricaricare l'orologio anche in verticale ma √® preferibile la posizione orizzontale oppure usare sempre l'appoggio creato col tappino incastrato sul connettore.Il prezzo 15 euro mi sembra ottimo per un prodotto estremamente utile e ben fatto.
4,Questo caricatore per Apple Watch √® comodo da avere sempre nello zaino cos√¨ puoi lasciare il cavetto della Apple sul comodino e sapere di poter ricaricare il tuo smart Watch in qualsiasi momento anche in viaggio. Non avendo un cavo pu√≤ essere scomodo in diverse situazioni. Inoltre il prezzo mi sembra un po' elevato per essere un'alternativa cinese.
5,Ich habe mir den LadePuk als Alternative zum Apple-Original-Kabel bestellt da er sch√∂n kompakt ist und das Ideal zum Mitnehmen auf Reisen oder zum Laden am Arbeitsplatz ist. Endlich kein Kabel mehr dass sich in der Tasche verheddert. Meistens sind ja Drittanbieter-Lader etwas speziell was das Laden der Apple Watch angeht. Ich hatte mir schon andere Exemplare gekauft die die Uhr leider nicht geladen haben. Dieses hier macht aber absolut keine Probleme. Getestet wurde mit einer Watch 4 44mm und einer SE 40mm. Die Ladeleistung entspricht in etwas dem des Originals. Was ich besonders gut finde: man kann trotz USB-A-Anschluss den Spuk in beide Richtungen in den jeweiligen Charger stecken sodass die Uhr beim Laden immer auf der Oberseite liegen kann. Ich w√ºrde es wieder bestellen.
5,Works well very hand to have!
5,This is great. Compact thoughtfully designed and well made. Plug into a usb and charge. Works well and like the thoughtful features like the cover for the usb plug and the little tag. Good quality plastic and finish - really happy with this.
5,Actually works. The last charger this size I tried to use didn't actually charge the watch.This is great because can leave in the car and grab when needed.Very useful when you need to travel or even just for a quick top up of battery.
5,Das schnurlose Apple Watch Ladeger√§t habe ich in pink bestellt und es wurde schnell geliefert.Das Ladeger√§t funktioniert einwandfrei und ich kann meine Apple Watch SE damit schnell am Macbook Laden oder mit einem Steckdosenadapter f√ºrs iPhone kombinieren. Grade f√ºr unterwegs sehr praktisch wenn man nicht noch zus√§tzlich zum iPhone ein Kabel mit schleppen m√∂chte. Man kann das Ladeger√§t einfach mit einem Schl√ºsselring an seiner Tasche oder dem Schl√ºssel befestigen und hat dieses so immer dabei. Die Farbe gef√§llt mir auch sehr gut und sie ist wie auf den Fotos abgebildet.
4,Mi capita di frequente di rimanere a secco con la batteria del mio Apple watch e di certo non mi porto in ufficio il caricatore magnetico originale. L'idea di questo caricatore USB che ricorda nelle dimensioni una pen drive √® davvero geniale √® leggerissimo e funziona perfettamente su qualsiasi PC o Mac. Quindi se ci si trova con l'orologio scarico qualsiasi computer o caricatore USB √® un perfetto alleato per ricaricare la batteria. Prezzo abbordabile per un dispositivo carino da vedere e ben costruito. Molto consigliato!
4,Todos sabemos que la carga del iwatch puede durar de un d√≠a a d√≠a y medio y el cargador que lleva de serie viene con un cable largu√≠simo. Yo almenos tambi√©n lo tengo puesto en uno de esos adaptadores para poder cargar varios productos de Apple iPhone iwatch etc con el que si me lo tengo que llevar de viaje o no he tenido tiempo de cargarlo pues que mejor que tener este peque√±o cargador USB. Lo podemos dejar tanto en el coche como en la maleta as√≠ usarlo en cualquier momento encima no ocupa nada de espacio y con cualquier adaptador USB o bater√≠a USB lo podemos cargar mientras conducimos o viajamos con alg√∫n transporte publico.El precio lo veo aceptable quiz√°s si fuese algo mas barato vender√≠a mas. Esperemos que no falle a los d√≠as la carga inal√°mbrica.
5,So practical! I will use when travelling but keep in my bag for an emergency charge - slots straight into USB. Great item.
2,This iWatch charger is great especially for travelling. This charger will take up the smallest amount of space and it slots securely into a USB port the watch sits on perfectly and is held in place with a magnet that is stronger than other iWatch chargers I have used including the Apple version. Of course this can be used at home as well as travelling and I'm really pleased with it. It seems to be well made and sturdy. I quite like that it isn't black or white too. I'd definitely recommend this and I'd buy it again.I am updating my review and reducing it from five stars to two. The two is because it does charge my watch but it is slow and the main thing that I have noticed is that my iWatch doesn't stay charged anywhere near as long as with my previous charger. So I have gone back to that. I will keep this to use for short term travel but I wouldn't buy it again.
5,Das Ladeger√§t f√ºr die iWatch ist sch√∂n klein und kompakt. Der Ladevorgang geht recht schnell und ist in sp√§testens 4 Stunden bei der iWatch 6 abgeschlossen sofern noch etwas Akku-Kapazit√§t vorhanden ist geht es auch schneller meist hat es bisher um die 3 Stunden gedauert. Die Uhr wird magnetisch festgehalten so dass ein versehentliches Abr√§umen nicht ganz so einfach geht der Magnet h√§lt sie sogar noch in der vertikalen Ausrichtung fest f√ºr den richtigen Halt sorgt da aber die Schutzkappe des USB Steckers der einfach abgezogen und dann mit dem anderen Ende auf den Stecker gesteckt wird. Nur wenn das Ladeger√§t vertikal in der Vertikalen eingesteckt wird dann muss der Magnet alles halten.Gerade f√ºr unterwegs ein super Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Uhr sch√∂n leicht und kompakt und vom Preis sehr ansprechend.
5,El cargador es en color azul oscuro precioso con una tira de pl√°stico que imita la tela de color marr√≥n para ponerlo en el llavero.Me gusta el dispositivo por dos razones fundamentales:- Tengo mi cargador oficial en una base con lo cual para ir de viaje es un aut√©ntico dolor de cabeza desmontarlo llevarlo y volverlo a montar al regresar.- A veces no me acuerdo de cargar el reloj por la noche y voy a trabajar con √©l casi sin bater√≠a estando inc√≥modo el resto del d√≠a ya que me suelo quedar sin bater√≠a a media ma√±ana.Este dispositivo es un cargador de llavero para tener siempre contigo. El funcionamiento es muy muy sencullo: Quitas el tap√≥n conectas el usb a donde quieras (ordenador adaptador de pared....) y colocar el reloj encima. Est√° imantado como el oficial de forma que puedes cargarlo en cualquier momento sin tener que esperar a llegar a casa.Adem√°s est√©ticamente es bonito carga perfectamente y lo he acoplado a las llaves sin ning√∫n problema. Me encanta y lo recomendar√≠a sin dudar.
5,Cargador Usb para apple Watch compatible con todos los modelos magn√©tico inal√°mbrico ofrece una carga sin cables conectando a un puerto usb.Velocidad de carga ‚Äúr√°pida‚Äù de 2 a 3 horas pero he notado que se calienta bastante y no me da mucha confianza.Tiene un dise√±o muy elegante y al ser ligero y compacto puedes llevarlo donde quieras sin que ocupe mucho espacio es ideal para llevarlo de viaje. No me da confianza este producto temo estropear mi reloj.
5,Me encanta el concepto un peque√±o cargador de Apple Watch para viaje.Te evitas llevar el cable largo y puedes usar el propio cargador (transformador) del tel√©fono a√±ades este accesorio y pones el reloj as√≠ de sencillo me parece una idea brillante.Es sencillo bonito lo puedes agregar como llavero a tus llaves no pesa nada y te puede salvar de m√°s de una ya que todos sabemos que el Apple Watch es maravilloso pero peca de una cosa de una cosa muy importante la bater√≠a hay que cargarlo cada d√≠a sin excepci√≥n por lo que si sales alg√∫n d√≠a y duermes fuera como no te lleves el cargador te quedas sin reloj al d√≠a siguiente y yo que estoy acostumbrado a √©l me molestar√≠a bastante.Este accesorio me permite tener un cargador de emergencia que siempre est√° ah√≠ en el llavero.No tengo absolutamente ninguna pega con este producto cumple con creces los que promete y no tiene ning√∫n defecto se lleva mis cinco estrellas.
5,Das NEWDERY USB Ladeger√§t f√ºr Apple Watch kam z√ºgig und gut verpackt an.Die Apple Watch h√§lt leider nicht immer den ganzen Tag durch und muss auch unterwegs mal geladen werden.Da bietet sich so ein kleines tragbares Ladeger√§t quasi an.An den Laptop angeschlossen beim arbeiten l√§dt die Watch nebenbei und ist zur Mittagspause wieder einsatzbereit.Zudem sieht das Ladeger√§t noch gut aus und kann mit dem Anh√§nger am Schl√ºsselbund oder so befestigt werden. Durch die Silikonkappe ist der Anschluss gesch√ºtzt.Ich finde das Ger√§t sehr praktisch und auch schick. 5 Sterne daf√ºr
5,Der Lieferumfang umfasst eine Bedienungsanleitung in englischer Sprache.Das Ger√§t ist so praktisch und immer mit dabei egal ob in der Hosentasche oder in der Tasche.So kann ich jederzeit meine Apple Watch aufladen.Einfach in einen Stromadapter den USB-Anschluss stecken oder am Laptop die Apple Watch auf den Magnet legen und schon wird sie geladen.Die Magnetfl√§che hat eine Schutzfolie es funktioniert auch mit der Schutzfolie das aufladen.Das Aufladen dauert etwas l√§nger aber das st√∂rt mich weiter nicht Hauptsache die Apple Watch wird geladen.Ich werde dieses Ladeger√§t immer dabei haben es ist eine Erleichterung im Alltag f√ºr jeden Apple Watch-Besitzer
5,Der USB Ladeger√§t f√ºr die Apple Watch ist super. Ich hab die Watch SE und alle Watches halten maximal 2 Tage ( da ich die Uhr ausmache und ablege √ºber nacht) aber was macht man wenn man unterwegs kein Akku mehr hat ? Da hilft das USB Ladeger√§t einfach an einer Powerbank oder an ein Notebook oder was auch immer anschlie√üen Uhr drauflegen und laden lassen. Klappt super und nutze es auch f√ºr die Arbeit wenn der Akku mal schlapp macht.Bin sehr zufrieden damit und ist wirklich sehr n√ºtzlich kaufempfehlung 5 Sterne
5,Me gusta el dispositivo por dos razones fundamentales:- Tengo mi cargador oficial en una base con lo cual para ir de viaje es un aut√©ntico dolor de cabeza desmontarlo llevarlo y volverlo a montar al regresar.- A veces no me acuerdo de cargar el reloj por la noche y voy a trabajar con √©l casi sin bater√≠a estando inc√≥modo el resto del d√≠a ya que me suelo quedar sin bater√≠a a media ma√±ana.Este dispositivo es un cargador de llavero para tener siempre contigo.

Est√° imantado como el oficial de forma que puedes cargarlo en cualquier momento sin tener que esperar a llegar a casa.Adem√°s est√©ticamente es bonito en color rosa carga perfectamente y lo he acoplado a las llaves sin ning√∫n problema. Me encanta.
5,Gerade f√ºr unterwegs TOP! So kann das eigentliche Ladeger√§t /-kabel zuhause bleiben und f√ºr die paar Tage kann ich die Uhr sehr problemlos mit diesem kleinen Ladeger√§t laden.Nicht ganz so schnell wie mit dem originalen Ladekabel aber ich lade die Uhr sowieso immer √ºber Nacht ... dann ist das auch egal ;-)
5,Cargador Iwatch peque√±o sin cables y puedes llevar a todos lados.Se puede cargar el reloj en Horizontal como en vertical. De peque√±o tama√±o que te permitir√° llevarlo a todos lados como si de un llavero fuese.Perfecto para cargar desde un PC o incluso con el cargador de mechero del coche.Le√≠ varios comentarios que el reloj se estropeo despu√©s del uso yo la verdad que las cargas que he realizado y bajo vigilancia no he tenido problemas con ellas.Un dispositivo de carga totalmente valido para cargar tu reloj mientras trabajas o conduces tampoco lo utilizar√≠a como cargador principal ni para una carga muy prolongada. Si no una carga entera y cuando llegue al 100% desconectarlo.Compatible con los iwatch desde la serie 1 hasta la 6.No note una gran diferencia en el tiempo de carga que con el original y as√≠ tienes un cargador PARA LLEVAR A TODOS LADOS.Espero que esta rese√±a haya resultado √ötil üëç
5,Dieses Ladeger√§t kann man z.B. an eine Powerbank anschlie√üen und seine AppleWatch laden. Ich finde super dass man ohne Kabel auskommt. Also eine gute Erg√§nzung f√ºr unterwegs da klein und handlich. Das Produkt ist selbsterkl√§rend und einfach in der Handhabung.
5,Apple-Original Zubeh√∂r ist ordentlich teuer wodurch sich ein gro√üer Markt f√ºr Angebote Dritter √∂ffnet.Das hier rezensierte Ladestecker (ein Netzadapter ist wie bei Apple nicht dabei) f√ºr die Apple Watch macht Apple vieles nach der Preis ist allerdings deutlich g√ºnstiger (bei etwa 35%).Die Ladefunktionalit√§t ist tadellos ich habe keine Unterschiede zum Original feststellen k√∂nnen.Praktisch ist seine kompakte Bauform die ihn ideal f√ºr‚Äôs Reisen macht.
5,NEWDERY USB Ladeger√§t f√ºr Apple Watch 6 Magnetisch iWatch Ladeger√§t Tragbares Kabelloses Laden Kompatibel mit Allen Apple Watch Series 6/5/4/3/2/1 f√ºr Apple Watch SEHat man mehrere Ger√§te (PC- LapTops - Auflader) braucht man das Kabel mit der kleinen Ladefl√§che nicht mitzuschleppen ein USB Anschluss  oder gar eine Steckdose wie der Handyauflader wird dann immer zur Stromquelle.Wurde schnell geliefert und dazu auch Preiswert
4,Buen cargador para el Apple Watch.Es un cargador para llevar encima se puede cargar desde un pc o cualquier cargador para usb.Es en color azul oscuro fabricado en pl√°stico y trae una especie de tira en tela marr√≥n para colgarlo en el llavero por ejemplo.El reloj se acopla bien y como en el original no se mueve mientras carga.Producto recomendable por tama√±o y acabados.
4,Al funcionar con USB estandar los voltios son poco potentes aunque por otra parte la bateria del Watch tampoco es de altisimos mAh. Puede tardar de 2 a 4 horas dempendiendo de los mAh tambien son comodos de llevar junto al llavero/bolsillo/mochilaSon muy practicos y si viajas puedes llevar una bateria externa para recargar
5,Me ha gustado mucho este cargador para Apple Watch resulta muy pr√°ctico ya que puedes llevarlo contigo en cualquier momento no ocupa casi nada y puedes cargar el reloj pr√°cticamente en cualquier sitio.El cargador tiene muy buen dise√±o especialmente el detalle de la etiqueta de cuero con el nombre grabado. Tiene un recubrimiento con un tacto gomoso muy agradable y podemos colgarlo f√°cilmente en un llavero o llevarlo en cualquier parte.Su uso no puede ser m√°s sencillo simplemente enchufarlo en el puerto USB de un ordenador o un cargador de m√≥vil en la pared. Gracias a que es magn√©tico el reloj se sujeta muy bien y no debemos tener miedo de que se caiga aunque lo tengamos "colgando" de la pared.Me ha parecido super pr√°ctico y de buena calidad. Os lo recomiendo al 100%.
5,Este es un cargador de reloj para Apple muy practico por lo peque√±o que es adem√°s muy f√°cil de llevar es muy c√≥modo ya que solo tenemos que poner el reloj cerca de la parte trasera del cargador para que este se pegue por medio de un im√°n y comience la carga de esta forma el dise√±o del cargador nos garantiza que el reloj se asiente perfectamente en la estaci√≥n de carga y no se deslice.El puerto USB directo es perfecto para mi puerto USB en el autom√≥vil y para usar en un PowerBank.Tambi√©n prob√© la estaci√≥n de carga en el enchufe de casa.El reloj demorara unas dos horas en ejecutar una carga completa por lo que la velocidad de carga es muy buena.Este es un cargador muy bueno para llevarlko de vaje  se puede llevar tipo llavero o colgado en la bolsa.
5,Todos sabemos que la carga del iwatch puede durar de un d√≠a a d√≠a y medio y el cargador que lleva de serie viene con un cable largu√≠simo.

Esperemos que no falle a los d√≠as la carga inal√°mbrica.
5,‚åöÔ∏è El punto d√©bil de todos los trastos Apple es la bater√≠a... los cables de carga de los m√≥viles se han democratizado y los encuentras incluso buenos por precios muy baratos. Pero no ocurre lo mismo con el del reloj... al menos yo no lo hab√≠a encontrado hasta ahora.‚åöÔ∏è No es exactamente un cable es mejor. Lo conectas en el puerto usb y listo ya lo tienes cargando.‚åöÔ∏è Es comod√≠simo tiene un dise√±o cuco y ocupa poqu√≠simo. Yo lo tengo en el trabajo porque me ha pasado m√°s de una vez levantarme y que no se haya cargado por la noche... asunto resulto!‚≠êÔ∏è Carga bien as√≠ que le doy las 5 estrellas. üôèüèæ Gracias por leerme!

5,Das kleine Ladeger√§t ist praktisch f√ºr unterwegs oder f√ºrs B√ºro. Man kann es per USB-Anschluss an den Laptop oder einen Wallcharger anst√∂pseln. So erspart man es sich st√§ndig das Ladeger√§t der Apple Watch mit dem langen Kabel mit sich herumzutragen. Meist wird es ohnehin zu Hause in einem Ladest√§nder ben√∂tigt.Das Newdery Ladeger√§t ist in verschiedenen Farben erh√§ltlich und funktioniert einwandfrei. Die Smartwatch haftet auf einem Magneten wie beim Original-Ladeger√§t.Man kann es mit der Schlaufe sogar am Schl√ºsselbund befestigen.

5,He podido pedir este cargador USB para mi Apple watch y la verdad que me ha parecido una idea muy sencilla original y¬†pr√°ctica. Es v√°lido para todas las series versiones y tama√±os de esfera.¬†Permite cargar tu reloj en cualquier puerto USB que tengas a mano y donde¬†m√°s¬†practico me parece es en el de mi¬†port√°til. Mi Apple Watch ya tiene alg√∫n tiempo y si lo uso en alg√∫n entreno no me aguanta todo el d√≠a con esto lo puedo cargar mientras trabajo con mi port√°til y lo tengo a mano.¬†Dispone de carga¬†r√°pida¬†que promete cargarlo completamente en 2 o 3¬†horas¬†aunque la verdad que nunca lo he usado para cargarlo completamente y no he podido comprobarlo.¬†Yo lo he podido probar en color rosa pero¬†tambi√©n¬†est√° disponible en otros tres colores diferentes: Negro azul y blanco. Su precio me parece bastante bueno.
5,Peque√±o cargador compatible con cualquier conector USB ya sea de ordenador enchufe de casa coche cargador de m√≥vil o el que sea‚Ä¶ funciona a la perfecci√≥n.Est√° imantado como el original del Apple Watch para que el reloj se quede pegado sin que sufra accidentes mientras se carga.  La carga es perfecta no he notado cambios en cuanto al original.Es ideal para llevar de viaje en la mochila siempre para as√≠ no tener que cargar con el cargador original. Para cargas de emergencia es perfecto por su reducido tama√±o y ya que no pesa nada.Llevaba tiempo buscando algo as√≠ y la verdad que estoy encantado. Realmente recomendable sin duda.
5,Eingesteckt an einen USB Anschub z.B. am Notebook oder an einer Powerbank und schon k√∂nnen alle Apple Watch Modelle schnell aufgeladen werden. Ich habe es mit der neuesten Generation (Series 6) ausprobiert und es hat tadellos funktioniert
4,El cargador funciona muy bien y carga mas r√°pido de lo que esperaba en realidadüòÖ.Tiene un dise√±o muy pr√°ctico y f√°cil de transportar y lo podemos llevar en la bolsa o incluso junto a las llaves ya que es muy ligero üëåüèº
5,Ideal para llevarlo en el llavero bolso o coche como cargador de emergencia y no dejarnos son bater√≠a en nuestro preciado Apple Watch tambi√©n como cargador de viaje es sencillo original ligero y muy √∫til lo recomiendo.
5,Este dispositivo es una pasada muy valido es peque√±o y lo puedes llevar en cualquier bolso bolsillo o incluso enganchado en el llavero y si tu Apple watch empieza a flaquear te proporcionara ese empuj√≥n de bater√≠a extra que necesitas hasta llegar a casa.
5,Pues me ha venido de perillas este cargador para el reloj de apple se puede llevar incluso de llavero ya que trae para ello y adem√°s carga igual de r√°pido que el original pero sobretodo lo que m√°s me ha gustado es su transportabilidady lo peque√±ito que es para llevarlo siempre encima yo lo estoy usando para el apple whatch 4 y me funciona y me carga perfectamente as√≠ que su relaci√≥n calidad precio no puede ser mejor
5,Cargador magn√©tico que nos permitir√° llevarlo a todos lados evitando quedarnos sin bateria en el reloj. Este disponed varios colores y se puede llevar f√°cilmente enganchado en las llaves o en la mochila. Funciona perfectamente y evita tener que llevar un cable y cargador en todo momento. No se calienta en exceso como otros cargadores.
5,Cargador para apple watch (compatible con cualquier serie) que por lo peque√±o que es puedes incluso colgar del llavero y ni te enteras qeu lo llevas.Lo puedes usar en el ordenador en un cargador de pared en el coche o directamente de baterias externas.Yo lo he probado con el orednador y en el coche y no he notado ninguna diferencia con los cables originales de apple con lo que diria que funciona.Una vez puesto el reloj en el cargador es bastante estable gracias al iman que lo mantiene sujeto sin dejarle moverse
5,Muy buen cargador para el watch lo puedes llevar en cualquier sitio al ser super peque√±ito standar usb-A y se queda imantado el reloj cuando lo colocas en √©l. Muy buen cargador por s√≥lo15‚Ç¨.Muy recomendable
2,Me ha decepcionado no carga bien y el reloj hace cosas raras cuando est√° cargandose a parte que se calienta bastante. No me ha dado buenas sensaciones el cargador. No lo volver√© a utilizar prefiero el de cable.
5,USB Charger for Apple Watch 6 Magnetic iWatch Charger Portable Travel Cordless Charger Wireless Charging Compatible for Apple Watch Series 6/5/4/3/2/1 SE is very good.  I got this for my sister as she has a apple watch.  13.99 is a great price as it makes it portable so you can charge your watch out and about.  5*.
1,Ten√≠a muchas ganas de probar un cargador que pudiese utilizar mientras trabajaba en el port√°til. Pues el inconveniente de este tipo de relojes es su bater√≠a evidentemente. Mi desilusi√≥n ha sido cuando tras cargar3 % de bater√≠a ha tardado hora y media. Por tanto mi valoraci√≥n no puede ser positiva. Su color es ideal   su dise√±o tambi√©n no pesa nada ...  pero en mi caso para mi  Apple Watch no me ha servido.

1,Hij wordt erg warm bij het opladen. Ik zal het niet vertrouwen als ik er niet naast zit
2,Meh. It works but it‚Äôs a very slow charger. The magnet barely holds on to the watch and needs to be perfectly lined up or it won‚Äôt work.
1,It‚Äôs. Was listed as a charger.  I did t realize it has to be hooked up to a computer or other source for your watch to sit on and charge.  Waste of money.
4,Works fine
2,While this is a handy little gadget it is EXTREMELY slow to charge
5,Th.is is compact and lets you charge your phone while working at the computer.  No cables!
5,Working as advertised
1,Doesn‚Äôt work at all
5,I work 12 hour shifts and my Watch doesn‚Äôt keep up. Bought this with my fingers crossed and it‚Äôs the best. A quick 20 min charge on my lunch break and my watch is good until bed time. Recommend it!
1,Didn't charge my iWatch. Didn't work at all
1,Doesn‚Äôt work!
1,Does not charge anymore after one week. I should have notice somethingwas wrong when I noticed that the watch was getting warm on the screen while charging. ANd now the charger does not work anymore.
5,I love it!

5,Product is exactly as stated. Good value for money. Quick delivery üòä
4,Het laat wel op maar voelt heel warm aan.
1,It‚Äôs too slow. 40min and only 20% charges
1,Expected this product to last longer.
3,I bought two only one worked.  I was away so couldn‚Äôt initiate the return of the faulty item.
3,THE watch is getting more hot than when it is charged on the original pad from Apple.
2,need to place the watch on the right spot to charge and sometimes not charging because of minor movement. not ideal for travel.
5,I charge my Apple Watch with this works great
5,Excellent item
5,Works great easy to travel with. Very simple. Great ides
5,A really convenient little dongle that's useful when I need a watch charger on the move.
5,Works like it's meant to - charging my Apple Watch Series 3 without fuss or delay (from a USB power-bank)...I have the read some of the other reviews and will keep an eye on it for the foreseeable future but in all fairness it fits the bill perfectly for me and I cannot complain at all.I note as well that it's probably more of an 'overnight' charger than something for urgent uses but again that's what I wanted so fair enough :)
1,tried to use in my truck and at home but would not charge my watch.
5,Works as advertised
5,Ce produit est tr√®s pratique car se transporte facilement est facile d‚Äôutilisation et fonctionne parfaitement bien!
1,Ordered and received because my original watch charger died. Plugged it in.  It would show charging and then uncharging. After 3 hours not even half charged. Not worth the time effort or money
5,Works great! Very pleased.
4,Good
5,TAKES UP MINIMAL SPACE
1,Takes too long to charge
1,Takes too long to charge
5,TAKES UP MINIMAL SPACE
5,I use this everyday to charge my Apple Watch. I don‚Äôt like cords everywhere so this is the answer. It‚Äôs neat and tidy.
5,Comes in handy when your Apple Watch is your Fitbit your MP3 player reminder GPS timer and your text messenger in the same use. You can charge it anywhere with this keychain version and the usb cap provides great protection against bending or unexpected contaminants
1,This product was great for the first couple of trips. But after my recent own it kept overheating. The last time I used it was with my Anker powerbank and the face on my iwatch popped off because battery had swelled so much. My iwatch was done for the rest of the trip - 10 days left.
