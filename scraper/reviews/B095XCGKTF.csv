4,Review of Amcrest IP4M-1041W CameraThis review focuses on initial impressions and setup procedures.Overall it is a decent product.  The setup process seems to be solid but not well-documented.  This review provides some details that may be helpful to future users.1. My use case: I have a FiOS router providing Internet access.  A Ti-Link DECO-series mesh Wi-Fi is connected to the FiOS router through Ethernet.  The DECO provides two Wi-Fi networks: the home network N1 and the guest network N2.  My goal is to set up the Amcrest camera on N2 network.2. Amcrest Cloud Access.  Following the quick-start booklet accompanying the camera I successfully set up the Amcrest cloud access.  This setup requires connecting the camera to my network through Ethernet installing the Amcrest cloud app on my phone setting up an Amcrest cloud account and linking the camera to the account by scanning the camera bar code with my phone camera (within the Amcrest cloud app).  I was asked to change the camera password (apparently I can keep the default user name “admin” but must change the default password).  Note that the camera log-in is separated from the cloud account log-in.  The cloud access is unstable (need to return to the “camera list” and restart “live view” every 10 minutes all so.)  The video has a significant lag (about 2 seconds or more).3. Amcrest Direct View.  The function allows viewing the camera image while the phone is in the same local network.  One needs to install the Amcrest View Pro app and set it up within the app.  The Wi-Fi setup did not work for me.  Ethernet setup worked with the following notes.  A) my iPhone must be on the home network N1 when set up.  B) When asked for a camera password use the new one not the default.  C) The connection attempt may fail.  I need to try multiple times.  After the direct view is working the camera ethernet connection can be removed.  The direct-view provides high-quality video without noticeable delay.  However the image disappears every hour.  One needs to touch the center of the screen to resume feed.  This is annoying for my use case.4. Web-based video access.  The installation guide points me to amcrestview.com.  That website wants me to download a plugin.  But after downloading and executing the file it still does not work.  However one can log into amcrestcloud.com and watch the video (with the same delay and instability issues as the cloud app).  There are other ways for web access including a P2P connection with the downloaded software and I did not try those.  Be careful that the manual misspells some web addresses leading to fake sites that want you to download software.5. Multiple phones can be set up for cloud access and direct view.  A new phone just needs to install the app and log in for cloud access.  Each phone needs to go through the same process for direct view which requires an ethernet connection.6. Camera installment.  The camera can be placed on a tabletop or mounted on the wall with provided hardware.  The camera has several degrees of freedom in choosing field-of-view.  The camera unit can tilt in one direction rotate and zoom.  The mounting bracket has a pivoting arm.  The mounting plate has two screws attached to the wall.  The viewing software can rotate and flip the image.  However they all have a limited range and need to work together to provide a satisfying viewing experience.  Especially software 90-degree rotation messes up the aspect ratio.  Therefore do not finalize your installation (e.g. the position of mounting holes) before you test out the fields of view.Overall: this is a solid camera with a relatively smooth installation and setup process.  The video and audio work well.  (However two-way audio does not work because of severer echo.)  The major problems are: installation tips are not detailed in the documentation.  The app does not clearly explain when installation problems occur requiring a lot of trial and error.  The video feeds require a frequent manual restart (every hour).  Cloud viewing has a few seconds lag unacceptable in some situations.Note after posting.  I contacted Amcrest support on the frequent disruption of direct view and asked whether there is a setting to get a continuous video feed.  The answer is: it's due to the instability of your WiFi network.  I don't believe this is true because I used the same network (same camera location) with a different camera before switching to Amcrest.  That camera did not have a stability problem.  What's more I can reliably resume the video feed by touching the screen on my iPhone.  So the system should be able to resume by itself after possible disruptions if designed correctly.Additional notes: After some back-and-forth with the Amcrest support the video stream disruption problem is resolved by setting the wireless IP address to static.  This change also allows me to connect the camera user interface (web-based) when the camera is on WiFi only.  Since this problem is solved (although the process could have been easier) I am changing the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.
5,I have bought many Amcrest wi-fi cameras over the years beginning with the oldest 640K models running all the way through to this 4 MP model. The oldest cameras I have not intentionally retired are still in service trouble free and some are more than 10 years old. In my experience one good PTZ camera can replace two or more fixed cameras but what I appreciate most about this model line is the robust built in web server. You can connect through Amcrest's P2P system or directly via HTTP or HTTPS (or both) via port forwarding. FTP and an email server are built in. If you use the free P2P service you can also choose to pay a monthly fee to store video and snapshots on Amcrest's servers or you can save them to a local SD card. Zone detection for security is good but about the same as you will find on some other cameras. It is fairly easy to set up the web server set and the options will also satisfy most advanced users. If you are not technically inclined but want a good PTZ camera use Amcrest's P2P service which is mostly automated and will require only a few decisions. The hardware itself is rugged. This model line is designated as an indoor camera but I have several of them running outside sheltered beneath eves; two have been running non-stop for several years. Night vision is good.While the new smartphone apps have automated installation the robust web server has not been completely dumbed down. For some users there will be a learning curve in mastering its deeper features.
4,Very good camera that has been around for awhile....The GOOD for some is that it can be viewed from the modern browsers like Chrome etc. No Active-X plugin.They have added AUTO TRACKING to the firmware BUT removed the Digital Zoom which it DID have.Took the ZOOM out of PTZ (pan tilt zoom)The BAD but not much it cannot be viewed with IE anymore....subtle but in Chrome many adjustment Icons are missing in Chrome that ARE in IE.....and possibly THAT is why they removed Digital Zoom.Unable to make that control function without Active-X.This is wordy but all true....The Motion Detect with AUTO TRACKING works exceptionally well and has to be seen to be appreciated..kp
5,I purchased this Amcrest 1080p PTZ (digital zoom on this specific model) for my 3d Printing and Lasering room. I installed this camera inside my self-built Atomstack laser enclosure to monitor projects while in other rooms.The package arrived quickly and was packaged in safe condition to ensure no damage would occur during transit.Setting the camera up is extremely easy depending on the type of setup you perform. The app "Amcrest" is available on iOS Android PC or Mac. I chose to initially set mine up within the iOS app.You can set this up completely wirelessly (wifi setup) by dedicated IP (IP setup) or via POE ("power over ethernet"). Although this is not actually a POE camera if you are using an ethernet cable but do not desire to setup the IP as a dedicated address you can still choose this setup option for dynamic IP addresses. This is the method I chose. Setting it up within the app was as simple as scanning the tiny QR code on the back of the camera (make sure you are aware of this before mounting the camera in a difficult location) and setting a new username and password. Ensure that you change the default username and password from "admin"/"admin".If recognized on your network the camera will appear immediately within the app.This specific Amcrest camera came with a 16gb microSD card however I saw nothing mentioned about it when purchasing it. When you record video footage a timelapse or take photos it can be stored to the microSD a NAS on your network (or a SSD/HDD on your network) or to the Amcrest cloud. Each Amcrest camera comes with 30 days free of Amcrest cloud. I chose to not utilize this as I don't like subscription services.I like the ability to pand and tilt the camera and the Amcrest app has several options to tailor the image to my likings. Specifically I like the options to flip the image horizontally or vertically and adjust the colors. There are also options to change the image quality from SD to HD if desired (for limiting bandwidth on slower connections). I chose to set it to the highest possible settings. For this camera that is 2560x1440p @ 8192 kbps (8bit). This is a little strange (but beneficial) since this camera is listed as a "1080p" camera.Overall I think this is an excellent camera with numerous options and at a great value. I would definitely recommend this to others.
4,Once you set this up you can watch on your device day or night.It helped me locate my lost cat in my backyard. Unfortunately the internal power connector corrodes at the slightest hint of moisture. Maybe the overnight dew was too much but beware it doesn’t take much.I dropped this unit more than once so it is semi tough just avoid doing that too.
4,Review of the Amcrest IP4M-1041WDecent value for not a lot of money and Blue Iris supportI've had the older version of these cameras for almost 3 years now and have used them in spots where mounting a regular camera would be problematic and they have worked well enough for me. This camera will be used in my kids playroom to keep an eye on them when we're not down there with them.Unfortunately this camera is NOT able to be used with the Amcrest Smart Home app which is a shame as (although not perfect) it is much nicer to use than the Amcrest View Pro app(maybe this will change in the future?).  I set this up via the Amcrest View Pro app but am not a huge fan of the UI in the app or the quirky issues it faces.  The app works but it's far from great. Instead I use Blue Iris and for anyone who doesn't know Blue Iris is a video camera software that supports most types of cameras.  It is what I use for my home and it allows most types of cameras to be added via ONVIF.For $59.99(price at time of writing this) this is a decent little camera for security or to use as a baby/kid monitor but honestly the ASH-21 might be a better choice for some people as it has the newer Smart Home app you can use.  If you use it with a separate software like I do then the app doesn't really matter and if you can pick it up on sale then it may be a more solid option.  It's still good for anyone that wants to be able to keep their video storage locally and not rely on the cloud as it has an SD card slot.  However it also offers cloud storage too so you have a choice either way. It can be wireless or wired which is nice for an easy install and portability or for someone that can plug it into their network to keep WIFI traffic reduced. Night time visibility is also pretty good same as most other indoor cameras with night vision so no problems there.  It has an auto tracking feature which is pretty cool in theory but I think I will turn it off as it needs a little work software wise.  It tends to jump around a lot to center a subject even when they're still in frame and I don't see much (if any) adjustment you can make and it doesn't self center when the motion stops.  I've seen cameras like the Yi Home cameras that do this very well in comparison.  I think auto-tracking is kind of gimmicky at this point anyways for lower end cameras and ends up being a nuisance instead of a good tool.  It's better most of the time to get the camera far enough away to capture the entire area you need or have two angles.  In the end it is a solid camera and my other two have lasted without issue for over 3 years so I can't complain.
4,One of my older Amcrest cameras crapped out so I needed a replacement. I could not get the 4mp with 120 degree FOV so I got this one. The only one in stock right now. I like it is 4mp but the FOV is not great.I also seen reviews that bashed the camera for have no micro SD port...IT DOES HAVE ONE. Some people cannot read it is under the ball of the camera but it is strange they move it from the base to the camera area. I kind of thought the same thing at first then I looked at the pictures on the Amazon website. It is as plain as the nose on your face it shows it in one of the pictures.Amcrest cameras seems pretty good. I know they have better 8mp outdoor cameras but then I would have to run ethernet/POE to it. Kind of a pain. That is another reason I like these cameras you can put them anywhere in your house hit a household outlet and connect them to wireless. I have 9 around the house. I have 4 mounted to the tops of the windows sills and pointing out the windows. I have a great view of the neighborhood.
5,-The contents in the box are very much appreciated. It's nice that a short ethernet cable is included in the box. It really does help. Also the bracket is nice and sturdy.-The auto-tracking is nice but I find it overcompensates the movement when a subject is entering from the edge of the camera's view. This probably works better in a larger environment but I found it didn't work well in my living room.-There is no way to access the events/stream/snapshots through the Amcrest View Pro app while on LTE (not wifi). I always get 'Failed to Connect'. Once I connect to any wifi and it'll work. The only thing that works over cellular service is notifications. I have already discussed this issue with Amcrest support and there was no solution in the end. This issue goes to ALL of the P2P products.-Privacy mode is an awesome feature but mine doesn't point all the way down (I've attached a picture showing this).-My model takes ~45-50 seconds to reboot. (just stating this)-So I noticed when the camera tilts up/down it's really quiet and practically unnoticeable. But when the camera pans left/right it definitely has a noticeable sound.-I really like how the red IR LEDs are not super bright and noticeable.-Something I don't understand is the fact that the Privacy mode tilts down a lot but when controlling the head you can't position the head that far down.-Something I tested was Worst-Case Scenarios. Here are my results:-Loss of LAN will switch to the Wifi signal. When LAN is reestablished the camera switches back to LAN connection. During this time the streaming is interrupted but the recordings are uninterrupted. This is awesome!-If power is lost the head will go back to its last position once the power is reestablished.-In the HTTP you're able to control the PTZ by clicking on the arrows OR by clicking on the preview itself. That extra PTZ control feature would be appreciated in the Amcrest View Pro app because right now the app only supports the standard arrow controls.-The ads state it has a 90 degree tilt but it looks more like 110 degrees in my opinion.-I have my Pack Duration set to 5 minutes and I'm recording full-time. What I've noticed is that I can't view the latest 'General' footage until that Pack Duration has completed its 5 minutes. I don't have this issue with my Amcrest PoE cams.-PoE would have been appreciated but if it was removed to bring down the cost I could understand that.
4,I have two of these set up in the house and have had good luck with them.They are stable play well with Blue Iris via RTSP feed and don't mind being firewalled off from the internet. They are fully capable of streaming with or without a card in the MicroSD card slot. I also appreciate that they come with a generously long USB power cord (and brick!).My only real gripe is that there is no 5gHz WiFi capability built into these units. Despite close proximity to access points these cameras routinely experience loss of connectivity (sometimes for minutes at a time). I chalk it up to the moderately-congested 2.4gHz airwaves of my suburban setting not a hardware defect.
5,Chris p was very polite in showing me how to get my cameras up an running..he knew what to do an how to tell me that was so easy and does not upset the customer when explaining everthing to me... i thank him so much for helping me with my problem... amcrest has the Best Customer Service...this was not the first time i have called for help with my cameras.. they are always ready to help me... Thank again Chris for your time spent with me.... jackie
2,Ok I really wanted to like this camera but there is a lot to be not liked. See below.First - The image quality is lacking in my opinion. It's OK but nothing special. Not what you'd expect from a 4MP camera. My EUFY and Arlo cameras (that are only 1080P) have MUCH better quality.Second - When the IR kicks on there is red lights around the lens that you can not turn off unless yo go onto the web site and use the user app there. Silly.Third - MAJOR pain to set this up. Had lots of issues from the app telling me the serial number was invalid to the camera not finding my (Excellent Wifi) network. I had to call their support line (because after waiting for live chat as 40th in their que for over 40 mins I found out their live chat is for SALES only and the person of course had to direct me to call their 1-888 number for Tech Support.) to get more information. And their tech support was NO help... the person tried (I'll give brownie points there) but couldn't figure out why my phone would not start their app. I even watched a couple of their videos on-line (worthless) which still did not help. LOL ... finally figured it out on my own after some trail and error... It should not have been that hard. None of my other Cameras I have ever gave me so much grief.Fourth - Documentation for use and features is worthless.Fifth - Motion detection isn't very accurate. I have cats; they are constantly running around; it has caught them maybe half the time.Sixth - The app is VERY cumbersome and not user friendly. Example. You want to view any videos the camera caught so you go to My Album and there are 4 windows. ((Why 4 windows I only have 1 camera. How to you get rid of the other windows... YOU CAN'T. If you can someone needs to explain it to me.) Ya I know multiple windows for multiple devices I DO NOT HAVE MULTIPLE DEVICES.) ) You have to choose which window you want to view then choose the camera then choose the channel then find the time/frame to view. Then once to find the feed/video you want to look at it only shows up in the SMALL window. You can not make it one single windows to view. HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED to be able to see any DETAIL in a small window on your phone. REEALLY??Seventh - Still have not figured out how to save any videos/pictures to anything other then Amcrests own folders. ????? You can send yourself a video or pic via text but what good is that if the video is large; you CAN NOT send it to yourself cause of bandwidth limitations of most phone carriers. Why can't I just save the vid/pic to my phone in the DCIM folder? Why can't you just save to video/pic to my phone album and be done with it. I can with other cameras I have. Oh cause Amcrest wants to make it difficult and be proprietary. Stupid.Eighth - Delay/lag is WORST then any camera I own or have owned. And this is at my house on my 1 GIG Network. ????? Are you kidding me. Can't imagine how slow it will be viewing when I'm not home using phone data.I think I've SLAMMED this product enough.... You get the drift. BUY SOMETHING ELSE. Find a different camera/company for you camera security needs. THIS IS NOT THE CAMERA TO BUY! I personally will never buy anything from Amcrest again. ShameUPDATE 25 May 2022: Still hold true to everything I wrote above. This camera is one the WORST ones I own out of 4 different manufactures.  Buy something else.
2,Was pretty disappointed in this camera - biggest problem was that the picture quality was VERY poor even in high definition mode.The significant issues are as follows:Installation:  The manual says that installing the camera in wired mode is "more stable"  in practice - trying for a long time I could not get this camera to install over 802.11.  If you are going to buy this camera make sure you have a wired internet connection that does not have a proxy between you and the outside world.  Once configured it does work over 802.11Cannot zoom in PTZ mode:  I accepted that this camera had no optical zoom but there was no meaningful method to zoom in on an image - not even digitally while PTZ. You have to switch back and forth and as soon as you go into PTZ to pan it drops the digital zoom.  An additional problem with this was that the viewing angle was very narrow so you couldn't see much of a room without panning around.Autotracking / motion detection:  1. The motion detection and auto tracking is absolutely absurd on this camera.  To begin with it found the ceiling fan and would not quit pointing itself straight up in the air.  The zone inclusion/exclusion features made absolutely NO difference.  The autotracking was terrible.  It would zone in on the part that was moving combined with the narrow field of view - what this would do is focus the camera on the feet and legs of someone walking in the room.  Completely useless in this application.Pan/Tilt:  Pan tilt function is EXTRMELY slow.  Because of this it is very difficult to target the camera where you want without overcorrection.Image quality:  It had very poor low light quality.  Picture was grainy and the focus was slow.  Camera did not reliably switch between IR and normal illumination.  In normal lighting the imagine also looked almost fish eyed.  Even in high resolution (which took ~500k / sec of bandwidth)  and normal lighting the image was VERY poor and NOTHING like decent image quality. It feels much worse than a normal 1mp camera and absurd for 4mp model.  This is the most significant flaw I experienced and the primary reason I returned it.Software:  The mobile / android software is VERY poorly written.  Very hard to scroll around without accidentally hitting something you did not intend to when you do click on items there are often menus selections (like ACCEPT) that show off the screen or are unavailable.  Software crashed several times (Android warning AMCrest viewer has repeatedly crashed) etc.  Once you picked multiple camera viewing mode there was no easy way back.  I have set up at least 100 cameras and this  Configuration was anything but intuitive.Benefits:  It was cheap with quick shipping.  It did successfully read the QR code on the camera so while 802.11 setup was impossible wired setup was pretty straightforward.  the AmCrest viewer appears to actually be free and once you set it up on your 802.11 network it appears you can access it from anywhere (as a live view)
4,I use Wi-Fi cameras to monitor properties.  Several are Amcrest Wi-Fi PTZ cameras and I am purchasing more.  I monitor them from anywhere through the Amcrest View Pro app on my iPhone which supports multiple cameras.  I am investigating using BlueIris on a PC to save video footage.In short being able to see the properties is valuable and saves me from worry and having to travel needlessly.The camera setups would be more valuable if Amcrest would better address....Included instructions are generic.Each new camera has presented different challenges connecting to my Wi-Fi network.  Typically the app not being clear on having to type-in your network SSID and password and phone volume needing to be turned up.  In my most recent install (of this camera) I had to resort to physically connecting it to my router to get it to connect (I was then able to monitor the camera through Wi-Fi).Default is standard resolution.  Once connected (and film over the lens removed) you may be underwhelmed by the video quality until you select a higher resolution.I find the app allows for digital zoom on this camera.Biggest disappointment is the lack of control over alerts and getting events saved to SD card.  I can't use these features because every time field of view is affected I get an alert but nothing gets recorded on the SD card installed.  (For reference Ring and CloudEdge apps do a good job on setting area sensitivity and pushing meaningful alerts.)When all is operating properly I like that PTZ motion is smooth and quiet.  Low-light image quality (without IR) is good.
4,General:The camera comes in very good packaging is protected during shipping etc.It includes a Micro USB Charger (and the charging brick) all the hardware that is needed to mount it to the wall or ceiling an Ethernet cable and the camera itself.Hardware: 5/5The camera feels nice to the touch it seems to be made out of a high quality plastic.The rotation pan and tilt all seem very high qualityIt does not feel like it will break if it's dropped and doesn't feel like the hinges are flimsyAll the mounting hardware is appropriate and will hold though full disclosure I didn't mount itSoftware: 3/5I'm not a huge fan of the Software...Sometimes it fails to connect to the camera (I tried both Ethernet Connections and also Wireless)There is a significant lag between what is happening and what shows up on the monitorThe cloud based recording requires some payment to keep recordings etc. as expected. I did not pay for that service.The camera includes a slot for a MicroSD Card which it can use to save some video (limited by size)Video Quality: 3/5The video quality is okay... to use for monitoring kids or pets the quality is decent.Unfortunately because of the lag (see Software notes) I wouldn't recommend it for baby monitoring... baby monitoring requires quick reactionHowever I would recommend it for monitoring automated devices small kitchen appliances etc. I would use it to monitor my 3D Printer slow cooker laser engraver etc.Audio Quality: 4/5The audio quality is good in both directions considering the form factorThe audio is well synchronized with the videoYou can speak through the phone to the camera (i.e. for baby or pet monitoring)Overall: 3.75/5
4,Unboxing of the Amcrest IP4M-1041B 4MP ProHD Indoor WiFi Camera.The packaging is good. Everything is well protected and wrapped.The camera unit doesn’t feel cheap. It’s a nice looking camera.Everything required to install is provided.Directions are clear and precise.InstallationInstallation was quick and straight forward.Once up and running everything works well.I haven’t tried it as of yet but directions state it will work with Blue Iris. I have Blue Iris for all my home surveillance.I’ve used this camera to monitor the room where my dog stays during the day while I’m at work.  I was able to clearly interact with the dog using the built-in audio and microphone. Audio was clear. Panning took a little getting used to. It wasn’t as instantaneous as other cameras I have. There is no zoom but I could zoom in well enough just by using two fingers to pinch and spread the picture.The negativeThe auto tracking doesn’t work well. If a person walks by slowly it will follow that person. But if they walk by and suddenly change direction it loses them.Doesn’t integrate with the Amcrest SmartHome app. That means having to install Amcrest View Pro another app to control the camera. I use the Amcrest SmartHome app with my Amcrest Doorbell Cameras. I should be able to use a single app to control all my Amcrest cameras.Night vision as marginal. I have other cameras including my Amcrest doorbell camera the have better night vision.It lacks a zoom which I’m realizing I could use. I tried the camera focused on a smoker I use for smoked meats. With a zoom I can zoom in closer to the smoker and see that there is smoke coming from the smoker. Without the zoom it’s difficult to determine.Overall it’s a nice unit that works well provides a clear picture during daytime use and looks nice. I wouldn’t use it in an area that I need to monitor 24/7 as night vision isn’t strong enough.
4,THIS IS A GOOD CAMERA FOR THE PRICE.IT SURPISED ME AT THE FOLLOW ME FEATURE A GOOD ADD ON.IT WORKS FARILY GOOD.IT BARELY CATCHES MY HUMMING BIRDS AT THE FEEDER BUT THEY ARE SMAL.MY $ 200.00 CAMERA FOR THE STREET WILL FOLLOW AND ZOOM 6 X TIMES BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
5,This camera will replace one of the other 6 Amcrest cameras I have in my home setup a mix of 1080P (2MP) indoor cameras a pinhole indoor camera and an outdoor 5MP POE camera all connected to a Camect hub.I will therefore compare it with the existing Amcrest 1080p IP2M-841W camera it will replace. I positioned them side by side in the same location and used them for a bit over a week comparing performance in different times of day and situations. Note that since I am using an ONVIF-based solution I did not have a chance to test the people tracking feature on either camera.Both cameras look very similar to each other the only visible difference is the printed camera resolution on the front.Packaging is also very similar for both cameras: minimalistic good looking and does its job of protecting the product and informing the consumer about the key features. The box does a great job calling out the main selling points of the camera and the box contents are great including a long power cord and a mounting bracket and hardware to attach it to the wall. On the other hand I am not a big fan of that bracket. It is an eyesore. Amcrest could design a camera/bracket set which would look better inside a home. Another suggestion is to switch to an inbox flat network cable opposed to the regular cylindrical one.Configuration is close to none with the Camect hub. Plug it with the provided cable then set up the WiFi credentials using the Camect Hub web interface and the camera is ready to go.I have compared the performance of the camera to its 1080p sibling and found out that as expected the image has more details and less sharp processing all good (see comparison below). There is also slightly less delay in video and audio but that is very small almost imperceptible.On the flipside there seems to be a lot more aggressive image cropping on the 4MP camera resulting in a bit less visible area compared to the 1080p one. That’s probably done to avoid edge distortion but I believe this was a poor decision from the product team.And obviously there is a lot more data traveling from the camera to the router. This is not a camera for anyone with a weak router setup.In summary I am very satisfied with the upgrade just disappointed with the ugly bracket and the slightly aggressive image cropping. If one’s network setup can handle the heavier traffic the upgrade to the 4MP option from its 1080p sibling is well worth the added $15.
3,The camera comes nicely packaged and is protected to prevent any damage during shipment. The package has a charging brick micro-usb mounting hardware mounting bracket lan wire paperwork and the camera.Camera:- The form factor is decent considering the camera has pan and tilt- the picture quality is decent- the camera can be easily connected to the app and wifi (although very 1st time I had issue which I will explain in the section below)- has a lan port and comes with micro sd card slot as well- the camera makes slight noise while using the pan and tilt feature - which I can hear from 2 feet away as well- The camera has auto tracking but it does not work efficiently- There is privacy mode which when turned on keeps the camera facing down so that it doesnt record anything. When you disable the privacy mode the camera does not point in the same direction as it was doing earlierApp:- I have the Amcrest Smart home app however I was not able to add the camera in that app and had to install Amcrest View pro after which I was able to add the device (however this is lame)- While adding the device you can scan the bar code on the bottom of the camera and it recognizes the device which is convenient and goes into add device wizard- In the setup menu you need to be on 2.4G wifi else the wifi setup will fail (you can choose between ethernet and wifi setup after you scan the device)- In the wifi setup I provided the camera user name password for admin account and the wifi network password. I got a notification that camera was added however Live view failed as the system complained that it cannot connect. On debugging further it seemed like Username and possword doesnt match however the system doesnt tell you if that is the Admin account issue or the Wifi issue. I reset the device and added the camera again - this time however I did not change the Admin password (do not change the admin password)- The camera will be added and you can go to LiveView. This is when app will prompt you to change the camera password. When I did that the camera password was changed and I was able to check the live feed from camera- The app features are decent and you can tweak soe settings. The app also gives a wizard to walk you through the app settings to control the camera- The pan and tilt screen is not smooth and the camera pans and tilts very quickly- The app skews the live view footage in Portrait mode however it is fine in landscape
4,This is our third one. Very happy with them.
4,At first the Amcrest View Pro app wouldn't work on my Samsung S9. It appears to install correctly but when you ran it it locked and did nothing. (See attached picture.) Tried restarting the phone several times. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app several times. After about a week I finally receive useful info from Amcrest support. The trick was to use the Samsung Settings > Apps > Amcrest View Pro > Permission to enable location and storage. (The app's own permission window was off the screen and unreachable.)I was able to get it running with the browser interface and Surveillance Pro pc app.Surveillance Pro demands it be run with PC administrator privileges. That is a security risk.On the plus side you can download video files using the bowser interface or Surveillance Pro.
4,This camera is a nice camera for indoor use it has motion detection night view and two way audio which is nice for communicating with pets or kids in a different room / when you are not home. The motion detection aspect of it is really nice because it does a decent job of tracking motion in a large room to ensure that whatever you are attempting to record is mostly in frame. They offer a lengthy cord and there are screw mounts so if you want to mount it you have that flexibility.I was a bit nervous when I was there was a "cloud subscription" but Amcrest offers a refreshing "local" option for storing video through a micro-SD card so you aren't to a subscription just to access something you already purchased. It's nice to have local functionality and I would purchase from them again just for this factor.Setup was relatively easy you can setup through Wifi or Ethernet. I chose wifi and had no issues getting online in a few minutes and start looking through my camera.The mobile app leaves much to be desired it looks like a "90s UX designer" tried to crunch a Windows 95 interface onto a mobile device and it does not work intuitively at times. There's a lot of options and I am a IT Pro and still spend too much time trying to navigate the interface. It does ofer motion recording / notifications in here and access to the recorded videos and manual pan/ tilt options. There are many unintuitive features in here that I have not fully explored and most options indicate they are on in a binary format "1" or "0" not "on" or "off" bizarre choice.Also lack of smart home accessibility is inexcusable at this point if it's supposed to be an in-home device but I was able to hack it into Homekit via Homebridge and RTSP streams.Ultimately I would buy again.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The following is the crime footage of our dog Riley eating our entire box of Cheez-ITs that my son had left on the side table in the living room. As you can tell from the attached video the camera does a great job of capturing Ultra high quality resolution of Riley eating Cheez-ITs out of the box getting the box stuck on his head as well as hearing the recorded criminal sound footage from the camera's microphone.You'll note that Riley gets the box stuck on his head on many occasions but the camera picks up ALL of the footage via wireless using the motion detection. There is also a brief moment after he pushes the box under the kitchen table where he went back into the living room to eat Cheez-ITs that fell onto the floor from knocking the box off the table and it continued to record for the 10 second default delay time in the camera's motion detection settings. You can also see that the first few frames from 16:00:47 to 16:00:51 are a few seconds before he enters the field of the camera recording and continues recording after the motion stops. In our case Riley comes into frame with the Cheez-IT box before the motion detection stops thus continuing the recording.While I do not have the new Auto Tracking feature turned on I imagine I would have gotten even better footage of him getting the box stuck on his head with that feature. For those who don't have any cameras currently the motion detection is used to detect pets who get into Cheez-IT boxes as well as other criminal activity but then the Motion Detection feature turns off recording to save the camera from capturing footage that has no action.He continues getting the box stuck on his head and pawing it off his snout for about 4 minutes until he goes over to the far side of the kitchen not moving much except for his jaws in the box turning off the motion detection. Then after the box is empty the motion detection is kicked back on when he quickly runs out of the kitchen hearing me come down the stairs.Not even the Green Lantern could have prevented him from getting that box of Cheez-ITs. However the Amcrest IP4M-1041W 4 Megapixel UltraHD Indoor WiFi IP camera was there to capture every moment.This is my eighth Amcrest camera and all are loaded into the Amcrest Pro app. I have it recording onto one of my PC's using the PC-NVR feature within the application. I highly recommend this product.
4,I've purchased numerous devices from Amcrest and I have a whole bunch of variants of the indoor wifi camera. This was what seemed like a hybrid between their old 1080p wifi ones and their latest wifi which contains a slightly higher viewing angle. It has the form factor and field of view of their old camera but the resolution of their latest. Overall it's a really solid WIFI camera and the price is at the right spot. In some cases I have needed the extra field of view but in this case the 90 degree field of view was perfectly fine and doesn't distort the image like I've seen in some higher field of view cameras. The other benefit is this has auto-tracking which eliminates a bit more of the need on the extra field of view but doesn't work great for cameras that you expect to be stationary. I like the more simplified back compared to the old 1080p cameras but I also admit it took me a while to find where the SD card went (back of camera eye). My only complaint is that there are a bit too many variants of this wifi camera to the point where as a consumer I'm not certain which one I should get. I also struggled to find out what else has changed compared to their other 2 flavors still on the market. My ideal would be the form factor and FOV of IP4M-1051B so it can be stationary but with the auto tracking that this one has and at the same price point of this one. I think that'd be the best option if you had to reduce to a single option of the indoor wifi.
4,My bad I should have read it does not have an internal slot for a memory card.
3,I bought a few of these cameras and they seemed to be great so I got a few more... now a couple months later when they are having issues sending video all the time while in night vision mode... they work great most of the time. But I think the processor in the camera starts to bog down and becomes unresponsive at times. I tried rebooting them and the problem is only fixed for a short period of time then starts back up with it. I even scheduled a daily reboot hoping that would help it didnt. I have 4 cameras and they all have this behavior so it's not limited to just one device having an issue.  I hope this problem gets fixed in a firmware update; they are great cameras otherwise...
4,This camera works pretty well for me.  I wish it was 4K and I wish it supported PoE but for what you get at this price point it's pretty good!
4,The humanoid tracks is junk. Tracks everything. Every motion.whish it would only track humans.  I bought a cheap one from China and works great tracking humans
3,I purchased two of these Amcrest cameras along with a 3rd camera from another manufacturer that was half the price.  I typically use Wyze cameras but wanted to get a few non-Wyze that had more pan/tilt range for larger rooms. I purchased the Amcrest cameras because they were recommended by a multi-camera application that I like to use (tinyCam) when home.  I figured I'd use these pricier cameras in the house and the lower cost camera in the garage.  I unboxed 1 of the 2 Amcrest cameras and was surprised to see that the directions specified that it needed to plug it into my wired LAN before I could get it on the WIFI.  I've never had to do that with a wireless device before as the mobile app takes care of it. That aside the setup wasn't terrible.  The mobile application for this camera is very poor quality.  Several times I could not connect from the mobile app to the camera.  The app was extremely slow to respond and I could barely get the camera to accept pan or tilt commands through the mobile app. When running the multi-cam app it worked as expected and pan/title was fine.  What troubled me the most was when I couldn't connect from the mobile app to the camera at all.  I knew the camera was working since I could connect to it through my multi-cam app and I was able to connect to all the other cameras in my house with their respective applications (meaning that it wasn't my internet the mobile apps from the different vendors could all go out to their servers and provide me with video from their cameras).  Overall I'm very disappointed with the Amcrest cameras especially since they are twice the price of another camera that I purchased. The picture is good but the app is rubbish it doesn't have two-way audio and the required wired LAN setup is absurd.
5,Camera works very well. Dale at Amcrest Customer Service was very helpful getting it set up on the computer. Thank You
5,This is the 8th Amcrest Camera that I have purchased since 2016.  I now have 2 interior cameras and 6 outdoor bullet cameras.  I have placed these cameras throughout my farm so I can see my horses and donkeys grazing in their fields by just opening the app on my phone.  Perfect.  I have to give a shout out to Colin M. in tech support as I had difficulty setting up the last camera.  I had just hooked up a new router which was not changing to 2.4Gz which is required to connect to the camera.  Colin got everything to work perfectly including setting it up on my pc so I could view it there.  Thanks Colin and Amcrest.
4,Amcrest Pro/HD series 4MP Pan/Tilt camera.I don't know cameras but I do know I should have purchased this Amcrest camera first.  We all try to save money yet for the couple extra dollars spent here are way worth it.The image quality is far superb to other cameras I've tried.Setup was very easy and the little quick start guide included gives you plenty of options to get started.Download the Amcrest View Pro app and be ready to be amazed at the included features.The Amcrest Surveilance Pro (free download for your p/c) really opens up the possibilities for security cameras. This is an Indoor camera.. however pointing it out a clean window is amazing too.  When set to full HD the digital zoom really is sharp.  I can read license plates across the street.  Couldn't do that with any other camera I've tired.If you get confused or just need a confirmation Amcrest has a ton of support and information that will easily get you going. (I know I had to get a bit of help myself)What's in the box?The Amcrest CameraOptional Wall mount including screwsUSB cable and wall power adapterQuick Start GuideI hope you enjoy your camera as much as I do.
5,This is our third one for interior security. Very easy to setup especially if you're using constant recording and the night video is phenomenal.
4,Installed this in my 4yo's room to see when she's not in bed upgrading from an old Foscam PT. Image quality is great web configuration and controls make sense and are in line with my other Amcrest cameras. IR illumination wasn't tested at long range due to this being indoors but is more than adequate to cover the opposite corners of the room. Tinycam support via ONVIF or the IP4M-1051 model works fine with the exception of 2-way audio (1-way only).People tracking works well and the camera follows people around the room (nice since the FOV is only 90 deg) BUT the pan motor on this is so loud that I had to disable it completely. I tried sleeping under it one night and it was impossible as it kept trying to follow my movements causing this grinding sound every time my foot twitched. If this is going in a more public or loud place for security like a garage or playroom or something that would be fine but for a nursery you should plan on disabling the feature altogether assuming I didn't get a defective unit (the tilt motor is much quieter).
5,This product is used by the front window to snap an image of anything moving close to the front door.  Thanks to google's updated email security measures it has become more difficult to set up email images and alerts.  Called tech support on Sunday afternoon and shelly P. got it to work
5,Great wifi camera to monitoring my pets inside home in working hours
5,Súper liviana pequeña y compacta! Perfecto para colocarla en la oficina o en lugares de vigilancia para niños o cualquier lugar de la casa en general!
3,Overall disappointed with the product I bought this because my cat went missing and I only had a camera set up in the back out of the house and needed one for the front. Night vision is awful motion sensor lags and the live video takes SO long to load! Thank God my cat came to the back door with the blink camera and I was able to see her right away.
5,This is my 4th Amcrest camera so I have been able to try out a few different models.Initially this is really easy to setup as long as you have the Amcrest Pro app on your phone. Connect the camera to your router/switch open the app and under device manager select add device then scan the QR code and follow the steps from there to add your wifi. After you add it to the wifi you can unplug from the router and you should be able to see it in the app.You have the option to mirror or flip the image so that if you mount it upside down on the ceiling you can still have the photo display correctly.There are a few new features on this camera I haven't used on previous ones that were interesting to try. The first is Auto Track where the camera will attempt to pan/tilt to track a person or object moving through the room. It works OK the few times I tested it I'm not sure if I would leave it on as an everyday option.The other feature is Privacy mode in which the camera points directly down at it's base so that it won't see or record any video. This would be helpful if you have guests staying in your home and they don't want to be recorded.The Microphone and Speaker seem to work well I don't generally use these on my other cameras.One thing to make note of is that this camera does not have an optical zoom however the picture quality is excellent so using the digital zoom still produces a quality photo.Overall I am very pleased with this camera so far and don't expect any issues as the other cameras I have had for a few years and work great as well.
4,Setup was a breeze after hardwiring the device to my network. The video stream is much stronger than IP2M-841 cameras which is a welcome improvement. The picture quality has improved which is great.Like previous models this camera still provides limited visibility for viewing below the horizon. Having to tilt the camera down because of the limited movement of the lens leads to irregular mounting or having to balance the camera on the bracket.I really wish that the camera came with a USB type-c connection as that seems to be where the industry has been moving toward. I do like the fact that it comes with a USB charger rather than a direct power line adapter. I would much prefer that the microSD slot was on the back of the device rather than on the head as in previous models.
4,FOV is not 90 degrees it is closer to 87. I mounted this camera in the same location as another camera with a 90 degree FOV and this camera came up short of covering  the same FOV. This was verified by using to points known  to be 90 degrees apart
4,i've had a chance to test out this camera for about a week now.  overall after setup it works really well.  the resolution night vision mic and speaker are great.  i like how it has an optional sd card for storage.  i like the multiple options for viewing as well.  i use tiny cam on my phone to view and the webui on my desktop.  i don't have much to say about the amcrest app to view since i only used the app to set up the camera.  the only downsides i've noticed are that the webui freezes at times and i'll have to refresh the browser to connect again.  also i was unable to set up the cam with wifi and had to use an ethernet cable to get it working with wifi.  i don't understand the need for multiple amcrest apps on the play store either.  it seems unnecessary when they can be combined into a single app.
3,Out of the box camera seems built well enough. Its powered off USB micro and comes with a USB charger and 10' cord.  After that user experience was bad and I'm going to blame it entirely on the App.  I already own an Amcrest doorbell uses Amcrest Smart Home but this camera uses Amcrest Viewer Pro. Neither app works with the other camera.Picture and audio quality are nice.It took me 20min to get the camera setup kept failing trying with Wifi and Wired and back to wifi.Using the app I found the pan gestures to be opposite what I expected and they are fairly coarse movements making it hard to center myself. There is an "auto track" that work fairly well a little laggy but does follow you well--I did not find that feature my wife did...I had a hard time navigating the app menus.  I never got the motion alerts to push to my phone.  The 2 way audio worked pretty well on wifi and on 5G but there was a 4second lag on everything on a phone with 2bars LTE. App crashes most of the time when I switch from Wifi to cellular or back.  There are a lot of features on the app that this camera doesn't support like Zoom but the app lets you try to use them with no result leaving you confused.I was able to hook the camera up to my BlueIris NVR pretty easily however I was not able to figure out how to set my static IP address. I found I could make the address Static but not where to define it or see it. I had to get the address from my router.
5,I have 4 of these cameras three of which are more than 2 years old.  The older ones never disconnect from Wifi but the last one I bought disconnects about once a month.  I swapped locations thinking it might be a weak Wifi area but the camera still disconnects and the older one works fine in the "bad" location.  Once you power cycle the camera it goes back online and is good again for a few weeks then drops off again.  The newer camera looks just like the older ones but is a little different design internally. ( different power connector is the only thing visible outside)  I don't have model info available at the moment because they are in a remote location but it is a different model number than the older ones yet looks identical on the outside.  When it works it is great but I set it up with a Wifi power block to cycle power to it when it disconnects!  When I get back to the remote location in the spring I will address the issue again with Amcrest.  I had sent them a support request before leaving the site last fall but the issue was not resolved.
5,Easy to set up and worked out of the box without having to be a scientist.
4,1-la cámara es difícil de configurar pero cuando lo haces funciona bien2- todas las configuraciones en app y web son en inglés3- la aplicación es lenta4- buena resolución 4 mepixeles5- soporta memoria 256 gb
3,I tried to update/add to my review and it's not getting posted so I'm starting over.1 -- If you create your own Admin Account (like lets say MyAdmin) it doesn't have access like the built in Admin account does.  I think this is a bug.  I should be able to create my own named admin account and use that.  I opened a ticket with Amcrest Support but I basically figured this out on my own.2 -- Tracking -- The new unique feature of this camera is the tracking.  My camera kind of acts like its afraid to look at me.  When I walk up to it it turns away.  Now that's exactly of the opposite of what you want it to do.  I thought this was because my camera is mounted towards the ceiling and pointed downward (the image is flipped 180 and mirrored to make it look right).  I'm not really sure though because I have seen it track meI had originally given it one star but I think that's too low.  This camera has all of the features that you would expect an Amcrest Camera to have if you've been using them (Email Setup Alerts/Events Daylight Savings Time DDNS ....) and they all seem to work (aside from #1 above).I would think you would buy this camera over another because you want the tracking feature and that doesn't seem to work right.I still have a ticket open with support.  I hope Amazon lets me update this review later.
3,Like:inexpensive relativelyfairly easy to configurevideo goodDislike:force me to have a password.  Chrome tries to fill it but cam apparently overwrites it so mus always enter a password..Why does password have to be strictly enforced; e.g. 8 chars and letters and numbers.  It's my risk not theirs so I should be able to use whatever I want or none at all.  Especially on my intranet.And this one is a showstopper for me buying any more of these and using their android app.  If you are accessing from outside wan and using port forwarding to get to multiple cameras  YOU CANNOT DO IT.They check the domain/IP address only for being the same and don't allow it.  They should combine the domain/ip with the port number to see if duplicate.  Severe BUG.
4,This is my 5th Amcrest camera to add to the house and overall a great addition.  Picture quality is pretty good as we have this pointing towards a window so the backlighting is strong but was able to adjust the settings to compensate.  The privacy feature (camera rotates down to the base) and the person tracking movement work well but will probably not use much in its current position.  It comes with a long power cable put is micro-USB powered so you adjust if needed.  My only reason for docking a star is occasionally the camera seems to have a week WiFI connection even though it's only 20ft or so from the access point.  I have three other cameras twice as far away that never have issues of not loading the live stream.  I also really wish their cameras would upgrade the chipsets to support 5Ghz.
2,This camera does not support two way audio despite saying that it does in the description.  There is no microphone on the web interface and the android app gives an error if you try to click the microphone.  The camera itself has holes in the back that look like a speaker might be in there but the firmware does not support it.  There is also no external speaker jack.  It does have a microphone in the camera which is controlled by a speaker icon on the web interface.Another thing is that even though this is a 4MP camera the firmware wont let you zoom so the highest displayable camera resolution is whatever screen resolution windows uses.  It is possible to get the android app to zoom but I don't think it will go to the full 4MP.The firmware is very wimpy compared to other versions but it does have the ability to work on some browsers without the need for downloading a plugin.The bottom line is that this is a very disappointing camera and if you require two way audio look elsewhere.
4,I replaced two older Foscams I had with these Amcrest 4MP cameras. Very easy to set up. Nice web GUI for changing settings. I did not subscribe to any pay plans for online storage but just put my own micros cards in the cameras to save video on. Really the only ding I have about the cameras is that the pan / tilt speed is too fast and its hard to make precise adjustments to where the camera is pointing. All in all a good camera at a good price so far though. Recommended!
5,Camera has very nice video quality the amcrest Android app pro has a few bugs also I'm not sure if it was just my SD cards but I burnt up two SD cards and just two days the unit camra head itself gets a little warm which can't be good for MicroSD cards. I tried to use PCnvr with these cameras and you can the biggest downfall is you cannot record to a network share drive which I am very disappointed I have tried a few different third-party softwares with this camera and they work great and they are able to connect to a network drive share for recording amcrest needs to step up their game and get some new updates rolling out. As far as longevity of these cameras I don't know off and this is my first set the auto track in my eyes is not very good and what I mean not very good I mean it's disabled now lol
5,I have several IP2M Amcrest cameras in my business and have been very happy with them. The IP4m-1041 has superior video quality and has a few additional features like auto tracking. I am able to use Amcrest Surveillance Pro software to view the cameras from home or anywhere on my phone using Amcrest View Pro. They both work well although I do sometimes have issues connecting with my phone which is probable due to my connection.I found the setup easy. Some of the software was a little tricky the first time I used it but support was easy to get ahold of via phone and very helpful. Once you’ve used the software it becomes easy to use and is very powerful. There are several different ways to configure record and view (IP config Surveillance Pro View Pro Web View. Amcrest cloud) and it would be nice if they were more similar to one another. You also have the option to use an NVR or third-party software if you’d like.The camera has 2 way audio and pan and tilt which work good. The night vision kicks in quickly and also works well. I like that you can record and view off an MicroSD card or computer with no monthly charge.I was able to set up motion detection and sensitivity with ease using the web interface.Overall I have been very happy with Amcrest and their cameras.
3,Picture quality is great but I've had a lot of problems with the date and time resetting to 2001 after a few days.  I have had tonget on my computer and go into the software to reset it each time.  Also several times when I was away and didn't gobintobthe phone app everyday the screen went black even though it said the camera was running.  I had tonhave someone go to my house and unplug it for a few minutes and then plug it back in to get the camera working again.  I have reset the system to factory settings a few times but that only seems to help for a little while.
4,I already have a few Amcrest 2M cameras. Good deal on the 4M and I was able to cover another room. I was surprised that the low light image was extremely grainy. Trying tweaks now via controls on Camera and Blue Iris. With IR on it's great.  Daytime quality seems great as well. Motion detection seems to be the same as with the 2M cameras and works well. As I'm already somewhat familiar with the setup of these cameras and Blue Iris it wasn't too bad. Not using any of the cloud features so I cannot comment on them there. Next step will be POE versions when I wire my home up and get a DVR. Came with relatively new 2021 Firmware out of box.
5,I have been using this product for almost two weeks now. Overall this security camera has lived up to my expectation. Here are some more detail feedback:1. Setup: setup is very easy and I never had to read the instructions.2. Video quality: The video quality is great. I liked the fact that it allows to select the video resolution and  offers 6 levels of resolution with the highest being 2560x1440. I have been using 1920x1080 and this gives a very good video quality. 1440 gives amazing quality but also takes more bandwidth.3. Two-way audio: The audio catches very nicely. It is easy to hear on the other side of the camera even from 15-20 ft away. However I still haven't figured out a way to do 2-way audio. I couldn't find a button or way to do so as it claims.4. Pan/Zoon: This is the feature that I like most. You can move the camera up/down and left/right. This is typically not available in most of the commercially available security camera.5. Time zone: It seems like there is a bug in the timezone settings. As I write this today a day after time change the time is reflecting fine. But last week the day light saving time was not enabled and it was always off for pacific time zone.Overall the camera is very good for indoor use or limited outdoor with covered area usage. I haven't used outdoor so can't say much about it.
5,After making some mistakes during the set up I called Amcrest Technical Support and Brent helped me reset the camera and solve the issue. Although it took some time he was patient and supportive. Finally the issue was solved. Thanks Brent.
4,Very easy installation. You really open the box and plug in the camera. The overall quality of the camera is good both at night and during the day. It also has expandable capability for the USB without the need to pay for a subscription.Overall good product. You have the ability to zoom in and out pan and tilt as well as hearing through the camera.The biggest area for improvement is that I have other devices that are Amcrest products and are part of the Amcrest Smart Home app but this camera runs on another app called Amcrest View Pro. I wish there was a way to integrate this camera on the Smart Home App.
4,N/a
5,Works as expected great indoor camera easy setup and use great video and audio quality for the price.
5,Happy with this camera so far. I use it with my Milestone system - the video quality is great and it offers some nice features. Ive found the performance on 2.4ghz wifi to adequate. Its not perfect but it works well enough.The camera does support ONVIF although I had some trouble getting it connected in Milestone at first. Oddly enough when I used the "Address Range" option to add it to Milestone it worked.The device has a Speaker and Mic that enables 2 way communication. This works in milestone but im having trouble talking from my phone on the mobile app into the camera. Still messing with that.The setup via App is easy. I used an ethernet connection and the P2P app to program it.I do wish the camera used a USB-C rather than Micro USB.  Ive found I am able to run it off a portable battery for quite a bit. Useful for when I have a party and want to monitor who is in certain rooms.The little plastic adjustable screw mount that comes in the box is handy. I like that it uses the Universal standard Camera mount that you might find on a tripod.Im always happy with the affordability of these Amcrest cameras and the fact that the App does not require you to use a cloud service or sign into some account to setup the cameras. Configuration is very easy.
4,The features and quality of the camera itself are a great value. 2k video streaming IR noise reduction motion detection and movement controls all work well. The main problem is the poor-quality software which you need to use to set the camera up view the stream and record to disk. The software is clunky with poorly-translated text throughout. It will even occasionally crash when just displaying the livestream feed although the disk recording will continue. Still at this price it's something that I can put up with given the feature set.
5,I decided to order this camera to keep an eye on my older cat while I was away. I received it on Aug. 23rd. Setting it up using the Amcrest View Pro Android app was straightforward and I had it connected to my Blue Iris software in just a few minutes. I'm a little disappointed that there is no 5ghz support as I believe there is a bottleneck with the 2.5ghz and video resolution. I had to turn the bitrate and fps down in order to get a reasonable stream outside of my home network. However for the price we can't really complain. The pan and tilt feature is what I really wanted as my cat hangs out in a few places while I'm away. I really like the preset locations feature. Set a few locations and let the camera automatically cycle through those locations. I tried to use the motion tracking feature but wasn't able to get it to work reliably. I'm sure it's just operator error and when I figure it out I will update here.  I'm still trying to convince my wife to let me mount it somewhere up high for better coverage. As it is now I just have it on a partition wall in our family room area. All in all I am pretty happy with the camera. It is a reasonably priced wifi camera with a decent resolution.
4,All of the features of the cam seem great so far. The software for someone with virtually no experience with setting up & configuring this type of thing has been challenging. Everything I have downloaded & set-up so far works great. Getting it paired with the right mobile app & desktop app was a bit of trial & error at first as there are several software & app options & some work with this cam & some don't seem to. Overall though I am pleased with this purchase & will likely purchase additional cams in the future. I have been quite pleased with all of the Amcrest products I have purchased to date.
4,I bought this as an indoor camera and possibly a baby cam in the future. Set up was straightforward enough but I was confused since I thought it requires an sd card but it doesn't look like it. Subscription plans seem affordable enough for me but I haven't tried it yet. Night vision is cool so as the tracking but it kinda films on 30 fps I guess but I don't really care.
2,The mic and speaker are unusable due to feedback on all of the 3 cameras I bought even if I only use talk or listen one at a time. Just turning them on causes a feedback loop that screeches and reverberates so loudly that my voice can't be understood and I can't understand what my Mother is saying either. I bought these to keep an eye on my elderly Mother but we can't talk back and forth...that function is useless even with all the research I did into fixes from other people who have had the same problem with theirs.Putting the camera into HD view causes the video to be choppy and slow and honestly I can't tell any difference in the quality of the video from one to the other on my Android smartphone so I leave the HD off. This 4MP camera costs more than the 2MP but without the zoom feature. At least on my smartphone I can zoom in on the video.I tried to make these work on my PC but after hours of watching videos and tutorials I still couldn't get the cameras to even show up let alone work on the PC version of the app. I've been using computers for 30 years so I'm no novice but I imagine it would take an IT Expert to get these working on a computer.I am keeping these 3 cameras in spite of the inability to get all the features to work because they do follow my Mother around pretty well and the night vision works great. Since I put in all the time to get them to work on my smartphone I'm not sending them back since I need them now...but if I had it to over again I would buy something else. I can switch from camera to camera to keep an eye on her as she moves throughout the house I just have to call her if I need to carry on a conversation.
3,*Update*The camera disconnects from WIFI every couple of days and must be power cycled to reconnect. I have this camera mounted 12-feet from the floor so I had to add a WIFI AC switch to allow me to cycle power regularly to keep the camera functioning. Because of this I would not recommend this camera.The image quality is decent but with no zoom and only a 90-degree view there are better options. I also have an IP4M-1051 which is a much better camera. The 1051 has 120-degree viewing vs this cameras 90-degree as well as a zoom feature that this camera just doesn't seem to work even though it is a digital zoom. The 2-way talk works but the sound quality is nothing great. It works with BlueIris and just like the Amcrest app there is no zoom functionality. WIFI and the wired connection works as intended. The iPhone app leaves a lot to be desired. I always use the web interface to setup Amcrest cameras as it is more intuitive and has more options. The camera has been stable and works well. Just know that for the price the IP4m-1051 is a better choice.
3,While this is a good camera with a good clear picture it constantly loses connection with the camera after you exit out of the app. Even if I leave it running and minimize the app so I can do something else on my phone it loses the feed and you have to refresh it which can take up to a few minutes to reestablish it. This may not sound like too big of an issue if you're using it for security or a baby monitor it's a big deal.
5,I use this indoor camera mainly as a baby monitor. It previously replaced an older camera which worked fine but left a bit to be desired in video and audio quality. This camera works great! Set up was quick and easy. I did a wired set up by connecting it to my router and did not have any issues. After getting it set up for my wi-fi I then set it up on my network. I have it connected to an NVR that is running on a NAS on my network. Adding it there was problem-free.As far as actual camera quality I can't complain. The IR at night is more than enough; I turned it down to about 20 and it still is more than I need. The video quality is nice and clear. Controlling the camera is also very quiet. My previous camera that I replaced this with made a bit of mechanical noise when moving; this one is silent. The only thing I don't like (but ultimately not a big deal) is the glossy white finish makes it feel a bit cheap.All in all very pleased with this and it's definitely better than the camera this ended up replacing.
5,Phone app was easy to setup.  Work good.
5,As you can see on the title I am a big fan of Amcrest! I've had 8 of their cameras for the past 3 years now and I've pretty much installed one in every corner of my house. I am no techie by any means but I found them easy to mount and install. And their app is user friendly intuitive and easy to navigate. I won't bore you with the specs but the resolution on this thing is pretty high defi (2K-4MP)! The one feature I especially like is that it follows you around and tracks your every movement. Now I know some people may find this a bit creepy but not me. It follows my dog around wherever I'm at work and I can easily track his movements any time I want. The other thing that is a plus for me is I can install a micro sd card to record videos without having to pay a monthly subscription. This is by no means my last camera from Amcrest. I have a second home for short time lease so I will be installing some security cameras on that property well! I will be posting updates soon!
5,Good quality picture even in the dark microphone seems to pick up very well also. This camera does seem to have a very wide range of motion for the pan/tilt functions. I would note though with any PZT camera you really have to have a good idea where you placed it and what position is what. From my experience with any PZT camera it can be easy to get things disoriented. This camera has such a wide range it can see behind itself which makes causes the controls to flip around from what I can tell. So up is down and down is up.The only thing odd I found with this is sometimes the PZT adjustments don't show up right away. This could be an issue with my phone or the speed of my internet connection. If you do a move on the PZT you may have to close the full screen and go back in for it to refresh. Probably not a huge deal but including should someone run into this also.
5,1. This is a very good camera and I am very happy with it. The video quality is great. Specially in the 4K mode2. The pan/tilt was also helpful as I was able to zoom and pan/tilt through the entire room and see everything clearly.3. The notification feature is great. But I didn't use this much on this camera because this was placed in a location where there is lot of movement and I was getting notified too often.4. When setting up for the first time direct Wifi connectivity didn't work but after I connected through the Ethernet it connected to my wifi right away without any problems.5. Will there be a Youtube streaming feature? I like that feature so that I can make the stream available to my family without having them to install the app.6. Now a days the USB-C is a standard way to connect to power source. But this camera had the typical micro-usb power connectivity which was included with the camera.7. The mount that is provided was useful to mount it on the wall in the corner so as to view the entire room.
5,This is a good camera which I put in my dorm and it can record to the cloud or to a microSD card. For the price this camera is great and it can view my whole room with the pan and tilt feature which is easily controlled in the app. The night vision is good but could be better; it still is able to detect a person in night vision however some details are lost at a distance. During the day the quality is great and there is a digital zoom in the app. The microphone quality is about average for security cameras and is great that one was included. Also the ethernet port is a great feature as some devices have trouble connecting to the WiFi in the dorm but hooking it up to the ethernet ports is an easy fix. The one area of major improvement is the app. It works and gets the job done but it could be better designed for the user. Overall I was impressed with the camera and would purchase again.
5,Order process was quick and delivery very fast.  Camera setup very easily using the included instructions and the app to download to the phone.  picture quality was good even in low/no light situation.  camera pan and tilt worked well.  Talk thru app to camera and hear sounds from camera also worked well. Zoom was an option on the app but does not appear to be available on this camera model.  Motion detection and following worked well and was a nice feature.  Only thing not included in the instructions was where the micro SD card slot is on the camera and how to use it.  instructions do say that camera images can be stored to local SD card but not where it is.  Camera comes with a nice long USB cable (micro usb format not usb type c) and ac power brick and a mounting arm to mount the camera to a wall with.  If you are looking for a nice indoor camera for security or monitoring this will be a good choice.
5,Fred V. Helped me to get my cameras on line. Did a great job.
5,I'm slowly replacing my DLink cameras as they wear out. Tried the Reolink and LongPlus cameras. They required a phone app to set up (neither worked well). They also don't have the API I need to easily pull snapshot images over http. The amcrest camera provides a nice API for programmatic control and doesn't require a phone for setup (you aren't locked to your phone to use it). Nice value for the price. I'll purchase more to replace my DLink cameras as they stop working.
5,This is the best Ip Camera for me. I was using my previous camera which had to buy 10 years ago still working perfect.New one has upgrated specs and works flowless.Great product.
4,This is a decent camera for the money. Some pros and cons:PROS--Beautiful 1080p video--Good video quality in both the day light hours.--Two-Way Talk.--IR Night vision--Super-Wide 90° diagonal viewing angle.--Very easy setup--Intelligent motion alertsCONS-- Uses only the 2.4 GHz signal-- Not weather proof (might not be best for areas exposed to humidity etc.)
5,A really great camera. I liked the fact that you don’t have to use the cameras software. I hooked them up to a NAS and used the security software on the NAS to run them. Could set the schedules and settings of the cameras through there and have them record to your NAS. Sound and video quality are great too. If you’re looking for a nice cheap camera that doesn’t need its own storage device or a small SD then this is your camera.
3,Would not purchase this item again. Will opt for other Amcrest cameras.
3,I like the auto tracking but it seems to want to go away from the motion half of the time.That being said If the auto tracking was better (which I believe can be fixed with updates) this camera is well worth the money.The picture quality is as advertized. The app could do with a little better with instructions but it seems quite solid.  I suspect there are features that I haven't learned yet.  Updates to this review may follow once I learn about this camera.I haven't been able to connect to my 5G wifi.  The quick setup failed so I was forced to do a manual setup and 5G wasn't an option. Again hopefully a firmware or software update can resolve this.
5,I'm using this camera to monitor our family room and have been getting great picture quality both daytime and nighttime.I use it with Blue Iris software and it integrated with that very easily.There were a few snags with getting it set up using the phone app but was able to get it on the network and configure it using a web browser quite quickly.I have been having a few problems with the camera losing ability see video (Web configuration phone app and Blue Iris) even though it was still present on the network. So I configured the camera to reboot once a day and it seems fine now. It's probably something that will be resolved in a firmware update at some point.It was definitely a good upgrade from the lower resolution camera it replaced.
5,Amcrest 4mp indoor cam.(IP4M-1041B)I own a few Amcrest outdoor cams but this is my first indoor cam. Very pleased with this one as well. Amcrest makes good products for their price range. 4mp Indoor cam works great. Comes with all the goodies you would need. The app is easy to use. And the cam features and pretty standard and work well.Really no complaints here. 4mp is a nice picture. Night mode works great. The tracking is really nice. Really the only minor thing I could think of would be that the tracking motor does make a little bit of noise. It's not loud but in a quite room you can here it move. Not that big of a deal.Works great in my living room for a pet cam.Like my other Amcrest cams no real complaints. Great product at a good price. 5/5 stars. I would definitely recommend.
2,This wireless cam produces some of the best video that I have seen.  Very sharp and color true.  But the audio is just horrible.  It is so bad you can not tell what is recorded.  If you don't need the audio then this is a good buy.  Otherwise look elsewhere.
3,The camera is ok the picture quality is not bad but not great either.  The viewing angle is good but not great. Depends on your use case.  The camera was easy to setup looks good and functions great.
3,I am a fan of AMCREST however this camera seems to have some features that could be improved. The app doesn't have full control of the settings I cannot set up the correct date/time I need to use the PC interface to adjust it. In the control of the motion of the camera... the interface needs to be improved because with the finger is hard to move exactly what you want... or at least to have a function to move to the center automatically. I still cannot setup to records the motions without a notification ASH model has nice features without issues. I still don't understand why these cameras cannot be used in the app as the ASH models.Average I am giving 3 stars because not fully works as expected.
5,Residential quality Amcrest cameras are solid.  This one performs commensurate with it's specs.  I did not focus on that in my testing as it was almost guaranteed.Instead I focused on its integration with the Amcrest NVR which ended up being superb.  It basically turned into a plug-and-play device when paired with an Amcrest NVR.  While I did tweak network and security and quality settings to meet my needs after the fact none of those changes were required to get the unit up and running initially.  Camera setup went from an irritating hour long process with multiple connections and disconnections to various routers in various locations to a one step endeavor that was and I do not say this lightly user-proof.While the initial setup of an Amcrest NVR is not simple and NOT user-proof this camera is when paired with one.
5,Have tried several brands for home security. This is the best. The App is where it's at. Super solid and stable with many camera views (using multiple cameras) and tech features available. Have tried Foscam and ReoLink - neither app worked fully to integrate and solve my needs. Amcrest is made in the US and is very solid. This product is highly recommended. Amazon accidentally (I assume) sent me an open box Amcrest instead of a new one. Had a devil of a time trying to set it up. Returned it and instead of moving on got a new one to try out. Super easy setup as advertised right out of the box. It simply works.
5,Philip was a great help. Didn't take time in setting the camera and we are set to go. Thank You
3,I have about eight of these cameras and they're great when they're working but to set to set up continues to be very difficult.  Despite the barcode and it quickly scans it connecting via Wi-Fi or even using the ethernet cable takes on average of about 5 to 10 minutes if it works or you have to reconnect and go back and reconnect and go back so amcrest really needs to get that figured out.
2,I don’t want to dance with a tambourine for that kind of money a separate connection is required to connect a second device it’s not possible to do this!  I wrote to the support service they respond with templates they do not solve any issues!  I returned my camera and got my money back!  Bought another - normal!
4,Setup with Ethernet easiest. But Wi-Fi setup difficult.
3,When I started using Amcrest they were the best.  Cameras had PTZ zoom POE the works.  Really loved them and got a bunch.  Well I have one of their new 4mp cameras.  No zoom no POE (I asked they have none) and picture quality is not near as good as my older ones.  Too bad.  Need to seek out an alternative.
2,I have installed dozens of Amcrest cameras over the past 7 years as well as Amcrest NVR's.  Never a problem.  I decided to try the IP4M-1041 for it's higher resolution.  The camera can be viewed on the network and on the iPhone via the Amcrest View Pro app.  However it will not connect on an iPad with the same app.  Amcrest has a problem as evidenced by others on the official Amcrest forums having the same issue.  Too bad but back it goes.
5,Philip did a great job in connecting my cameras and was really patient and knowledgeable. Thank You
3,I've had several versions of this camera the 1080p 2K and now this 4mp version. Thought I was getting a deal so I got 2. Turned out the price was reduced because Amcrest decided to remove the zoom capability. Over all it's the same as the older versions I had but with a clear(er) picture. All the settings software and such are identical. So... If your looking for a cheaper camera and can do with just pan and tilt this is a good buy and it supports ONVIF for us Blue Iris users. What happened to the zoom Amcrest?
5,With it's narrow 90 degree field of view this camera is great at focusing on a small area like a door or driveway.  It won't go e you the panoramic view of a 160 degree camera.It works great with the Amcrest View Pro app.  The pan and tilt are very responsive with minimal lag.  The Amcrest Cloud App isn't so great if you want to control the pan and tilt.  It is very laggy whichakes control difficult.The 4k image quality is great even in low light.Setup was very easy but keep in mind that initial setup requires a wired connection to your router.  On e the camera is configured you can add it to your WiFi network and unplug the network cable.
5,very good quality
5,Colin M was very helpful for setting the cameras online.
2,Mine stopped detecting motion stopped notification and I will need to unplug it every day before leaving the house if I don’t unplug it I will not view anything once I leave the house. The two way talk doesn’t work. It’s frustrating. I wish I can get a good camera for my house. The picture quality is good but the camera does not do all they listed.
3,I own two of these cameras only to find that the email alerts don't work on either of them.  Enabling alerts doesn't work the software disables it when I log off.Edit:  I recently discovered that you need to log in as admin in order to get the email alerts working.  If you log in as another user with admin privileges you can't change the settings.
1,I bought this camera because it says it can work directly with a local PC or NAS for storing video.  The issue I have is what it doesn't tell you is to initially setup and configure the camera you have to either use their smartphone app (which is the only setup the included instructions provide) or you can supposedly use a cloud service they have.I don't see anywhere in the description where it says that to setup and configure this that a smartphone app or cloud service will be required.I don't use smartphone apps so that was a no-go for me.  I am also setting up my camera system on an isolated secure network without any internet access.  This is why I wanted something that works with a local PC or NAS on the same subnet because I can't use a cloud solution for this.Because of this I'm returning the camera.
5,Testing this newer model against my other Amcrest cameras. The new 4MP clarity is much better than my 3MP cameras. The night vision is less grainy than my others. Great picture is a plus.Getting this camera up and running was easy as all my others. Was able to add it to my NVR and change settings via my view pro app on my phone.My only hangup is they ditched the optical zoom on this new model. So it’s a Pan/Tilt instead of Pan/Tilt/Zoom. It still does “digital” zoom.I’ve learned to trade the optical zoom for the new auto tracking feature which is really cool.All in all it’s hard to beat the quality of this camera for the money.
4,Camera was slightly difficult to set up but works once you figure that out. (Had to plug into the router instead of through wifi like other wireless cameras). Definitely gives the "I have a camera installed" look as it is not very discrete but functions as described.
2,I'll start off I am a really big fan of Amcrest cameras I have several POE and web cams from them witch lead me to pay a little more for this camera. There are cheaper options that have better functionality.ConsThe easy WIFi set up was anything but easy I had to wire it to my network and use onvif tool on PC to get it online. The app is clunky don't work the great at all.Picture quality isn't all that great for the price. Tracking mode is the worst I have seen from a PTZ camera. It offers no type of analytics. The setting up of a tour or scan is extremely non intuitive I have better functionality from these features from a YI camera that cost $30 5 years ago.ProsThe only one I got is it is an Onvif camera and does work with NVR like blue iris.Although I'm not going to hold my breath because Amcrest sucks at updates I really am hoping Amcrest sends out some updates for this.
3,Overall the product did what I wanted it to do for the price.  Could have spent a bit more to have it follow motion and outline the detected motion.  I shouldn't really complain about the picture quality as it decent but spend a couple bucks more for the 2mp+.  As I said overall the product did as it described.
4,The hardware is perfect high-quality picture and perfect night vision. Smooth rotation and a very good motion tracking. The only bad thing with this product is the software it needs huge improvements to make the camera highly efficient. Finally the price is slightly high.
5,I was looking for a camera that would allow me to record security video to my computer without paying for a monthly service. This camera does that. It is easy to set up and use. The video quality is excellent. I would recommend using the rtsp protocol versus https because it is much simpler to set up (at least it was for me).
5,I’ve tried a lot of these wifi cameras and overall this is the one I like the most. The picture quality is awesome and the ability to move the camera from your home is a game changer.My only complaint is around the setup process. Of all the wifi cameras I’ve had/tried (at least 5) this is the only one that needs to be plugged into the router in order to set it up. Once set it up if can be used wirelessly but you can’t set it up over wifi which is a slight inconvenience.My one wish for the camera/software is for the option to be able to switch on/off the camera from the app.
5,I bought this camera because something is running around in my attic.  Picture quality is fantastic. Adjustments were more than ample to dial it in. I found the critters.I had written another review on an Amcrest camera a while back.  I needed to go on the web create an account add an app login logout dedicate my wife and children in the will just to get it rrunning. This one no. Found its IP and got it up in running in minute's. Nice camera.
3,I needed support and spoke with Dale at Amcrest Support. He was very patient and did an excellent job solving my problem.  The cameras are somewhat confusing to view and operate from a computer. All of the writing is very small and difficult to read.
5,Philip was excellent in getting the cameras connected. Thank You. Recommended.
5,Work greatly in all areas connect to iPhone fast to see intruders. Great picture. Best of all cameras we have 8 Amcrest. 4 older models still works great just don’t connect as fast. I think I read about an software update I need to do.
5,I have been using a Foscan camera for about 5 years and this was the perfect upgrade. The ease of setup and quality of the product is obvious right from the start when you open the box and walk through the steps to get the camera set up. Once it is set up it delivers a quality image and provides all the bells and whistles that anyone could need from a camera like this. This is one of many Amcrest products that I now use. Dating myself a bit but just like Sony was my go-to for TV's back in the day Amcrest has become my go-to company for home security.
5,I love these cameras but I really wish I would of done more research because I can't check them when I'm outside my house and not connected to my home wifi other then that they are great
4,Excellent camera wifi
2,We have 3 of the older units which clearly have much better build quality. This unit feels very cheapend movement is not as nice. This unit seems to be a fail compared to the better units they once made. Probably will return next week.
5,It's pretty good! it definitely gets the job and worksWiFi seems pretty reliable so far.No issues as of yet. Night vision is good.My biggest and probably the only issue with the camera is that it over-turns when tracking motion.Aka if somebody walks left it turns sometimes past the person.Otherwise good camera functions and you can disable the tracking. For me it works fine enough tbh and I don't see any reasons to disable it as camera seems to always reset back to original position after a bit of time so all good.
5,I've been using this camera for a couple months with Blue Iris. Overall it's great and compatibility is great. Only thing I haven't yet gotten working is the push-to-talk using the speaker on the camera. Not sure if it's a config setting or deficiency but I haven't played too much with this. I will be adding several more of these to the inside of my house to complement my 8 MP outdoor Amcrest cameras.
5,I had previously purchased Amcrest's 2MP PTZ so I just assumed that you use the Amcrest Smart Home App to setup the camera.  I got frustrated because it wasn't working saying "invalid serial number" until I actually read the instructions and saw that you needed the Amcrest View Pro App. Once I figured that out getting the camera was a breeze.  Once it was configured on my WiFi network I entered the IP of the camera into Blue Iris and selected the camera make/model and I was done.I now only buy Amcrest camera's for my home setup because Blue Iris works so well with this product.
3,In the description I read this said it was Alexa compatible through the Cloud App.  When I went to the Alexa App it says it is incompatible due to 'Geographical' limitations. If you have other Amcrest devices that use the same Pro app as this one then it might be useful. I personally have an Amcrest device that is Alexa compatible so it is not as useful. The LiveStream through the App appeared clear but I couldn't get any notifications or motion control to work. It appears the camera is of good quality but the implementation of the software is very poor. If you can't use it's capabilities what is the purpose?
2,This model works OK once it is rebooted but requires often rebooting.If you want to use it as a remote camera then it needs to be plugged into a wifi switchto enable remote rebooting.I have 5 of these and this new model is the only one that requires rebooting.
2,I thought I had set this up properly.  I was able to watch live streaming and recorded events.  Still under warranty when the Motion recorded events would not save to SD Card.  After working on it with Internet Troubleshooting for a week I finally gave up and called tech support.  They said it was fixed and to wait for camera to start working and hung up.  Changed SD card and rebooted nothing.Purchased a Reolink and set it up in 5 minutes and working great.
5,This is a great indoor camera!The picture quality is absolutely stunning!The motion on the camera is good sometimes it freezes on the app but you just restart the app and it works!The PTZ part does make a bit of noise when it moves but other wise it is a great camera!The night vision is great it's super bright!The sound from the mic sounds pretty good it could be a little more clear but it still does the trick...We used this to check up on our animals I am sure they were not amused!
4,Nice camera for the price.
1,Pros:- Excellent video quality- Nicely laid out web browser interface.Cons:- No auto logon option you must manually enter the password every time you connect.- 'Anon' login does seem to log into the camera correctly w/o password but the video is just a black screen.- Live video hangs all the time while running camera via browser from Chromeyou have to continuously re-login (see above)- Camera is advertised as having digital zoom but there is no option for this via web browser interface.- I have not managed to use video recording features.I would not recommend this camera
5,The Amcrest Camera is great for those hard to reach areas or areas that you would like to have video coverage. It can be operated via wireless internet or wired with an Ethernet cable. The picture quality is great of my driveway (camera is in a window inside my house) and the motion detection works anytime something moves outside. The night vision works very well as well with no issues or a grainy picture. I would highly recommend this camera for any security needs you may have.
3,The app is for lack of better words "clunky". It's difficult to use at times not necessarily user friendly. I wish Amcrest would make one app to view multiple different camera's the Amcrest Smart Home app is much better. Now in terms of picture quality I'm satisfied HOWEVER the zoom feature is basically pointless. For the price I would recommend as a mid tier camera don't let the "Amcrest pro view" app fool you! Stick with something that works off the Amcrest Smart Home app!
3,Overall the camera is on par with its specifications.  The one major letdown is the poor quality of switching between day and night (IR) modes.  The adjustment options do not make any difference and it is hit or miss as to when/how much light/darkness will cause it to switch.
5,The camera works great and is clear in the space that I have it in.Sound is hard to understand as it has a lot of background noiseSame with the mic I just can just understand what is being saidthe Motion Detection is jerky and if the person is sitting but dancing while sitting the camera keeps movingit keeps them in the picture just moves from them being the center to the edge and then back every few seconds
5,I was looking for a indoor camera that would make us feel more protected while we were out of the house. This camera does everything we needed it to do. You can control the camera from an easy to use app and you can also talk back and forth through the microphone. We also like to keep an eye on our dog to make sure she’s not going through the trash can or getting in to anything. The app will alert you when it notices any movement. Another great feature!
5,Tech support Dennis Was awesome and helped set up the camera. I am a novice and he was able to walk me through the setup with ease. Very good explanations and help.I would recommend this camera.
5,The product overall is very good and dependable. After a week of using it I have not faced any problem with it except for this minor one: the camera rotation had a little lag one time only. The hardware is perfect but I think the app needs some updates and improvements to make the camera much more efficient. And one last thing I hope the app supports the motion detection recordings over the cloud at least for 10 seconds without subscription.
3,The overall quality and picture of the camera is pretty good.  Seems to work good enough in low light.  My biggest complaint is that both of the apps are not that great.  They look very dated and are clunky to get around.
5,I'm not a big fan of the way the app is but don't be afraid of these cameras. They work just fine. No guarantee that you'll get 10 years of use out of them but they are not bad for the money.
5,Amcrest cameras work well.  The motion detection takes some time to get right.
5,I'm very pleased with this camera. Sharp image. Responsive movement. Great value of features for the price. Love the new auto-tracking! I wish my existing amcrest could do that!No complaints so far after 2 months.
5,This camera has a good picture and was easy to setup on Blue Iris
5,I have three of these in my house all local connect to Blue Iris running as an NVR on my always-on media server.  I even have PTZ controls in HOME ASSISTANT!!  Easily one of my favorite devices.
5,Mounted this camera in my garage on the included easy to use bracket.  Used a splitter (found on Amazon) to allow me to power via POE.  Have it connected to my Blue Iris server.  Very clear picture Night/Day is great and PTZ is awesome.  Also like that it has 2-way audio though I haven't had a chance to test that yet.  Overall I like it.
3,Very bulky and when moving with remote it's jumpy ans jerky.
1,For first issue. I tried 3 different SD cards different brands and sizes and this camera would not write to them. It sees the cards and even allows me to format them but it simply will not write. I tried many different scheduler settings and even a factory reset with a tech and it will not write.Now the BIG problem. Note this is anecdotal and I cant prove the camera makers were involved however...When setting these up I gave them one of my obscure passwords that I generally dont use any more. Well... as it turns out my very old Walmart account was still using that password and low and behold on Nov 24 and 25 (2021) I got 3 fraud charges on that Walmart account. This is only a few days after I set up this camera and mind you that password is something like 20 year olds. It has never been discovered before because its a pretty hard password (I work in tech so I use random gibberish for passwords).Again that is anecdotal. I cannot say for certain it was the camera maker who is the culprit however this is one heck of a coincidence.
5,This seems to be working well! Amcrest needs to work on their software in the app though!
1,I think something was wrong with my camera as I have other Amcrest cameras (different models) and their night vision are all fantastic. This wasn't even viewable at night when the IR was enabled. When disabled it was as you'd expect completely black.Additionally I wasn't happy with the field of view only being about 90 percent. It's too focused and I wanted a wider FOV.
5,Great camera for the price. Very easy to install.
1,The software is written in a font 3 size - it's horrible!  No way to increase the font so that you can read it.The software did recognized the camera but I couldn't see anything via the camera.  I sent to the web page no support tab.  After days of trying I got utterly sick and tired of trying to get this thing to work while trying to read their screens that are in such a small font that I had to get super close to the monitor (no way to zoom no way to magnify). VERY poor / cheap design in my opinion.  I returned it to Amazon.
2,It won't work I don't know if I need more to go with it or what but it's definitely not easy so far
5,Easy to install great picture  even app works well!
1,Buyer Beware.  The Pan Feature Doesn't Work Properly. I purchased this Camera because it Rotates 360 degrees.  Here is the problems I have encountered. Setting up the unit I had to call Technical Support because the app would not go past the Agreement page.  Technical Support told be I had to make the Font Smaller on the phone then I would be able to see the "Agree" Box and the button to proceed.  Once I paired the unit and mounted the camera on the wall I tried panning the room.  This Is a Nightmare.  The Panning is not smooth and does not move in Real Time.  I was able to set it up where it would show my Hallway.  But if I tried moving the camera to take in more the Camera would not respond.  There are other Camera's out there that are easier to operate.  I would Give this Negative Stars if I could.  Do Not Buy.
2,Camera worked for a while. Problem is with the app. Lost connection and have reset the camera and reloaded app several times. Failure to connect doesn’t recognize user name or password which I have verified. After multiple attempts over several weeks I gave up.
5,The set up was confusing but overall it was amazing
2,I got it to connect. I looked at my router to see what the ip address was I was able to view OK on my PC and my iphone. Several hours later it quit working and I noticed that the ip address changed. It changed several times so I used the web interface to change the ip address to static. This worked until the next morning when nothing seemed to work. I did a hard reset and that did not work. It was no longer reachable. I have configured networks since the early 80's when I did a beta test connecting WANG computers to Dec. At my current billing rates I wasted several hundred dollars on this. I returned it and will consider a different option.
5,This is my second Amcrest camera and I like this better than the last does everything it’s supossed to and well!
5,The picture quality is really nice.  I did have an issue with the setup of this but is was an issue with my computer and not the camera.  When I called tech support the fellow logged into my computer and set it up in about 10 minutes.  Love Amcrest!
5,I have the IP4M-1051B as well which I like that one a little more for the extra viewing angle and the 5ghz capability. This is a really nice option that allows you to look around the house and do some 2 way audio if needed. Quality is great and the ptz option works well.
5,Dennis was very helpful getting my remote viewing setup.
2,Pros: it is functionalCons (to name a few): video stream is NOT real-time -- there is a delay of a few seconds which is easily seen by waving your hand panning the camera is also delayed and often moves in random directions app is poorly written difficult to bring up on-screen controls pinching to zoom in and out is very wonky where the image enlarges in random directions and requires the user to re-center the screen the app rescans wifi networks and resets the selected SSID and password textbox every time you switch between screens.
5,
2,I bought this camera to keep an eye on my elderly farther but the shifting light from his television contstantly triggers the motion detection... No matter how much I lower the sensitivity.  Additionally it won't let me change the date an time. Just says "failed to connect" every time I try.  Had issues getting the camera connected initially as well.  Had to do a 30 second reset to get it working properly.  Really don't want to have to do that just because now it won't let me set the time correctly.Regardless the device is essentially rendered useless by the overactive motion detection.  Therefore I'm 99% certain I have no choice but to return it.
5,Camera was easy to setup like the other Amcrest cameras I have. Images captured were great. I was able to save the video to my in home NAS.ONVIF support is nice and a bonus.2 way audio communication works as advertised.I am happy with this purchase.
5,Had some chicks hatch right before we had to go out of town. We used this as a remote chicken monitor until we returned. Was very nice to be able to pan and zoom to check on them.
3,The menus are a bit awkward but it's a good value.
5,Very nice camera with good resolution.  I have several Amcrest cameras and really like them.  For a wifi camera the configuration and installation on this camera couldn't have been easier the mobile app made it super simple.  It was practically automatic.  I have been having fun playing with the PTZ functions.
2,They have to redo the software on this its so clunky . It works most of the time but its just slow and outdated --  won't be purchasing another amcrest camera until they do.Also why do they need to cut off recording audio when the camera is moving?  A lot of things bug me with their software.
5,Price capabilioties amnd support
1,Will not connect to my ipad. Amcrest is no help  Will return to Amazon for refund.  I have 27 cameras working but this one is junk!
2,While not stated in the description and so shouldn't be expected but the lack of any kind of zooming function is a big miss considering similar but older Amcrest cameras with lower resolution have the feature.
1,Set this up and hardwired it to my local router.it will work for a while then when you look at it days later it's just black.This is sitting in my living room.  A power cycle will bring it back to usefulness.Otherwise the application connects to the camera and the picture is always black.Go get a real camera and save the money.  This one is nag-ware to get functionality
1,My surveillance camera system is Amcrest they have very good HD video quality.  But this camera disappointed me it seems to be 1MP the video is blurry and poor quality no HD.Amcrest's quality control is no more.I have another Arenti brand 2MP camera and it has much better quality than Amcrest.Don't buy this camera model.
5,Easy to setup via the app (no computer required no configuring a router all straight forward). Incredible quality for such an inexpensive camera. Can’t wait to purchase another one!
2,The picture quality is good but the software is really holding it back.The setup could be easier. There are two different apps. One that only works if you purchase cloud storage and another that rarely loads. If you do install and SD card the process for scrubbing through recorded footage is so inaccurate it's almost impossible to find relevant events.The motion detection is ok and the pan/tilt works fine. Zoom isn't a feature in this camera. Hard to recommend this when Wyze sells cameras for the same price that are vastly better and better supported.
1,I've used Amcrest for over five years.  Love the product. What I noticed first off all was the label affixed over the serial numbers of both boxes.  Opened the boxes to find out different serial numbers.  Neither one would set up either wifi or ethernet.  I tried three different routers. Sending back for refund.
5,Camera works great. I had trouble with my network.  Susan S. at technical support  was great knew all about networks and Macs was very patience helped me through the set up.
1,First camera delivered and working fine now for 6 months or so.  Second camera was delivered in an empty box.  I returned the empty box.  Replacement was a refurbished by Amazon Amcrest camera. Not ordering any Amcrest cameras from Amazon any more.
5,Works well for the price.  Setup wasn't the way I wanted but the image is nice and the overall function of the camera is what I was looking for.
5,Setup is easy but be sure to select static address for both wired and wireless connection.  Instructions not clear.
5,Motion detection not as robust as expected basing my thoughts on outdoor cameras. Still very happy with the purchase!
2,I am always happy with Amcrest cameras. Never an issue.They work great with Blue Iris including pan and tilt.UPDATE: Seems I need to reboot these cameras every few days or they go stupid. Slow framerate and pan and tilt issues. I've reached out to Amcrest. If I don't get a satisfactory response I'll just return these cameras.
5,The video quality is very good consider the good price compared to the competitors. Daylight and night pictures/videos are both great.  I also like the motion detection feature as it works fairly well.
5,Working good Thanks
2,Camera would not ZOOM byUsing app feature nor the other adjustments! Night pixies fare! Would not write to "FORMATTED MICRO SD" card! Could not get push video after alert!  I say the Chinese are working their labor camps too hard!
5,Works as expected.  Have three of these.
5,This wifi camera works great! The night vision does a good job at finding my cat sneaking around after hours
1,The WiFi camera will not connect to WiFi... The whole reason I bought it was for the WiFi capability but during setup it would not connect.  I would say if Wifi isn't important to you and you can plug in a LAN cable then this will work.  Be aware too you have to pay for cloud storage if want to save video.
5,Great camera HD video during day and night clear night vision usb power connection in addition to regular power plug.
1,Doesn’t work with Wi-Fi. When the camera works it’s nice but every 8 to 24+ hours it drops Wi-Fi (it’s within 10ft of router and it is the only device on my network that randomly drops). Once connection is lost the only solution to get camera working again is to pull power plug and restart. Unreliable unworthy and unusable. Weeks of back and forth with customer service with no resolution. If I would have kept original box Amazon would be getting it back.
5,Works great. Everything as expected. No complaints. Would love to see Google Home integration for Amcrest Cloud in the future.
5,Camera was easy to setup and integrated perfectly with blue iris. Not bad for $50
1,This arrived three days ago as a B-day present.  Nicely boxed and packaged but there it ends.  The unit DOES NOT work as wi-fi and must be plugged into the ethernet with even a hope of working.  The software is non functional on my computer.  Camera would not set up and work.  Tech support is a joke. The problems were clearly defined.  After TWO DAYS the response was "is your camera plugged in".  How insulting.  They offered no help and response is ungodly slow.  I DO NOT recommend products from Amcrest since instructions are not clear are confusing the software does not work and there is no technical support. I'm certain there are better products for half the price.
5,Easy to set up and good quality video and controls for the price
5,Easy to setup on my Synology NAS system.
2,WiFi Not working right
1,First of all I am a big fan of Amcrest and own several (9) of their 4k security cameras. That said I have four of these PTZ cameras that are dead. This one would be number five and it started going off line a week after getting it. Reconnecting became impossible using all possible approaches. On set up this camera was set with a static IP so it should have reconnected after going off line but no way. Attached is the collection of nonfunctional PTZ cams and this one is going back while it is still covered by the return policy.
5,The app can use some improvements. But the camera is pretty good
1,night mode is grainy the worst amcrest camera ive ever bought dont waist your money stick with the others the 4mp is only good for days nightvision is horrible
1,* Other reviews indicated a lag of about 2 seconds in the cloud view. I guess it’s gotten worse because it’s now about 5 seconds.* Motion detection alerts don’t seem to work at all and that was the main reason I bought the camera.* Horrendous software experience. One error message asked me to email “hello@example.com”. Clearly very little effort was put into any of it.I seriously regret rolling the dice on this brand.
2,Constantly times out and needs a reboot. Everything else is fine for the price. You just can’t rely on it which is a terrible quality in a security camera!!! I’m an IT professional if I can’t make it work nobody can. Garbage!
5,SUPER EZ SETUP
1,I would be sitting in the same room with the camera and the app wouldn’t connect.
1,This camera sucks!!! We have to unplug and plug it back in for it to work for a day takes forever to load never works when you want it to!!! DO NOT BUY
1,So I should have listened to the other reviews about the complex set up of this camera. But I thought…I’m pretty tech savvy I should be able to handle this. Umm no. Too many unclear steps. Their App is horrendous. And why is a new technology camera still only detects a 2.4 wireless bandwidth? Ridiculous. Tried three times. Gave up. Sent it back and bought the Reolink. Connected in 7 minutes all same features and much better App.
1,I purchased the 24hr cloud recording for a year from amcrest after buying this camera. 75% of the recordings are a solid black screen with no audio. Live view works sometimes. Camera is 19ft from wifi router with line of sight. And i still get solid wifi on my phone 80ft away in my detached garage. I have other amcrest products and services that i am perfectly happy with. Just not this one.
1,I had read reviews about this security camera and that's why I purchased it. But after receiving it I've found out that the one I received is veryCrappy. When someone enter the field of view it is a approximately a 10 second delay before the subject appear on the camera. The auto tracking lose where it's tracking and it's delayed also. Overall I would not recommend it to anyone. I guess I'll pack it up and send it back after 2 days of unenjoyable performance. I wish I could give it zero stars.
2,very nice but would not finish it to work
1,Night vision is excellent. Two way audio Does not work unless you pay for pro version. Which is extremely expensive. False advertising. Would not recommend if you are buying for audio purposes. Disappointed to say the least.
1,I have 2 other exact models of this camera. This camera did not work. I even took the power supply from one of my cameras that works and still nothing. The power light does not even work.
1,Camera picture and video quality is actually pretty good. However user interface is not simple and the mobile app is extremely laggy. I would pan the camera and it would take generally 3-5 seconds to see it on the app. This was consistent every time. I gave up trying to update the firmware given how many steps and technical challenges installing and using another app on the computer trying to connect. No function to update firmware from their app.
1,I couldn’t get the unit to join my wifi network. Tried different security levels just to see if that was the problem or not. Just never would connect after finding my net.
1,This camera requires two different apps for basic operation. If you want to hear and speak through this you are required to get a second app. Makes no sense. It also has to load each time you try to view and it takes a few minutes.
1,While this camera has good performance there are many issues with remote connectivity and their cloud software.  After frustrating hours with their customer service team we opted to return camera.  Apparently I am not the only one.  Did some research that I should have done earlier and found that there are many issues with this software.
1,Just like all the other cheap nanny cameras I've tried the app barely works.  There was only one of these cameras out of 4 different brands that actually worked well and they don't sell them anymore.  Most of the time I'll log into the app to a black screen that if the camera does finaly work lags so bad its not even usable.
1,All my other cameras are either Foscam or ICamera2.  Those cameras are simple to setup.  This camera seems like it should've been simple but it wasn't.  The app was absolutely terrible.  The app kept reporting an error during the network phase.  Couldn't get past that so I had to return the camera.
1,No supportApp doesn't work1980 picture quality
1,Very low quality image. It is quite difficult to connect to a Wi-Fi network. It only worked out after a few tries. Does not accept memory card. I do not recommend to anyone.
1,I read instructions and is so confusing!
1,You get what you pay for. Don’t waste your money on this and then have to return it or just never do
1,This camera is a complete waste of money. But the bullet and buy a better brand!
1,I’ve tried 2 cameras with NO luck. There is No S/N on the cord to scan as the instructions state and the one on the bottom of the camera does not work!  No way to get through to support. I would not bury this camera!!
1,I have no use for a security camera that can't tell time it goes back to 12:30am after setting it.You can't have motion detection without a schedule you can't have a schedule without a clock.Not to mention the app is a complete dumpster fire the schedule changes itself randomly.
1,Like other reviewers I had the issue with the software working fine the first evening I set up the camera with my home internet but I have been unable to get any video feed since.  Will probably return it unless there is a simple fix.
1,I have tried to work with their tech support people and no one returns my call. Very poor quality and I'm extremely unhappy with this purchaseproduct doesn't work well wish I never bought it
1,Returning this camera. Number 1 reason I cannot set the thing up. For some reason my user name and password continues to fail. Another thing is- $50.00 a month more than I can to spend for the cloud service.
1,Does not stay connected to wifi.  I have a Laview also purchased from Amazon on same wifi does not drop.  Would not recommend thinking of throwing it away.
1,Description in large text is inaccurate.. it is not a 5Ghz camera. Bait and switch trick.  In small info in the product description it states only 2.4Ghz. Sending back. Buyer beware
4,Royce did an excellent job restoring video to my desktop. Thanks.
1,disconnects randomly from your phone you have to be in range for it to reconnect.
1,Don't buy this.  Good luck getting it to work or canceling the very expensive cloud service.  Rip off.
1,It takes forever just to load the video.  Ring has it beat in price and quality go get one instead
1,HARD TO INSTALL!!
1,The motion has a lag long enough for anyone to walk by without getting caught by the camera.
1,Picture is very grainy.  Hard to control . Not worth the money.
1,Amazon ad says 2.5 and 5ghz wifi connectability.  This camera doesn't support 5ghz
1,Piece of junk. Setup instructions worthless. Sending it back.
1,Set up was easy. The app is horrible. App wont playback
1,Never hooked it up
5,philip did good in connecting the camera. Thank you
1,Won’t connect
1,dthe
3,Well. First I bought a different wifi camera that would not work at all with Amcrest Pro. Spoke with nice rep for  about an hour and finally came to the conclusion it wasn't designed to work with AmcrestPro app and or software was buggy. He recommended this camera. The camera will only work about 1 foot from the router. Go to another room and no signal lock. This is with reliable 500Meg wifi in all rooms in the house. Even have the ability to dedicate the 2.4GHz signal to one SSID. No luck. Taking it back and very frustrated as the wired cameras have been working fine.
2,software is just so 90s and their online help is misreable cheap labor who font really care and just want to end the call
2,I have had 3 of these cameras. All three were fairly easy to connect using the included cable. After installation they no longer need a cable (other than power) and work OK. Slow response at times but OK. May take a long time to show a picture but usually will in under a minute. One failed after a year or so of use and I ordered this replacement...twice...but neither would connect no matter what methods I tried. Something seems to have changed with the latest version of this camera. Not sure but returned the last two of these. Maybe they will connect and work for you...maybe not. If they work they seem OK...but now adding a replacement was not possible and just frustration...and not worth the troubles. Your results may be better...may. Good luck.
5,The most valued aspect of this purchase was the customer support. I was having difficulty with getting the camera set up through our wifi. A wonderful customer support agent Brent made set up a seamless process. He was patient kind and able to get the job done!
5,Fabulous and very knowledgeable support from the Amcrest technician Ben.  Much appreciated and valued.
1,Stopped connecting to router after 30 days. No wifi or ethernet connection.
5,Very nice camera!.  Easy to use web interface works in chrome works with Amcrest view pro on android and talks to my Amcrest NVR as well all with sound!Panning is very fast.  Picture quality is right on spec!There is a lot of settings you can adjust to fit your needs.I am using ethernet so I cant comment on the WiFi capabilities.
5,Following change of my network I reached to Amcrest support. Got Fred which was very helpful clear and effective in resolving the problems in setting the cameras again.
3,Physical installation was quick and easy. Software portion was not as clean as I was expecting. Using the Amcrest View Pro application the setup process was not as streamlined and straightforward as I had hoped. The most disappointing part is the motion detection which doesn't seem to work at all. As soon as I turn it on it would immediately focus on the wall which had no moving shadows or anything that would trigger the motion detector to move in that direction even when there are clearly people moving in front of it but a little bit farther away it would not detect that at all but it would detect a wall that had nothing. This renders the motion detector completely useless. Another issue is coming out of privacy mode during low light or no light situations. Even when night vision is configured to be on coming out of privacy mode does not seem to turn on the infrared lights for it to work in darkness. So you would have to manually turn off and then turn back on the night mode. The software functionality seems more like a beta version rather than a fully functioning release product so the quality isn't as good as expected.
5,I am so impressed with this camera.  We installed 3 cameras a year ago when we became caretakers to a precious aunt.  I was easily able to set them up myself and they worked like a charm.  They gave us countless hours of freedom from worry that our loved one was safe.We recently were given a new Verizon router and needed to reconfigure all 3 cameras.  While it wasn't possible to do this reconfiguration ourselves Daisy from customer service was a godsend while remotely reconfiguring all three cameras.I can't comment on the motion detection because I haven't set that up yet but plan to do so shortly.I will post again to comment once this is accomplished.
2,I have worked for hours trying to synch this up wireless (with my iPhone).  I even called Amcrest support and spoke to a rep... did not work.  I had it going for a few months ago and then I got the dreaded "failed to connect".  Now it only works when plugged into my router and desktop computer.  What a major PAIN.  Very difficult to set up.  Cannot get the wireless to work at all.  Do not waste your money on this POS.
1,Buy a Wyze camera for half the price and none of the hassle of setting up. My camera is several years old. Perhaps the new ones are better. But I would shop around.
4,This is my second camera by Amcrest. My previous was an outdoor camera and I have been happy with that one so I thought I'd give the indoor a try.Once again a great camera. I love the pan and tilt feature. And the motion follow is very nice as well.My only concerns are the multiple apps needed to use all features (one to setup picture flip and one to control pan/tilt). Also no zoom.Overall still a great camera for the price.
4,This camera works great minus the fact you have to rotate your camera to see the full video which also makes seeing what buttons do very difficult. I have also struggled with setting up the time and date. There is an option to set it based on your phone and every time I do so it doesn't work. There is a little feedback at first when you enable the mic and speakers but a majority of the time it works perfectly fine.|This camera was very helpful when I was away from my house and needed to check on things. I would purchase this again in the future if I added more cameras to my apartment.
3,This camera can't aim downwards far enough to work from a high shelf. Other cameras I have owned have had the ability to look downwards at a much greater angle. If you mount it high it must be mounted upside down or it won't be able to look down.
5,Good vision easy to install Good and quality product
2,Arm crest is an Australian company. I purchased an IP camera several years ago and it worked well for a while. Not all the features worked as described. When I went to reboot the camera this year the serial number was not to be found.  I will stick with American made from now on !!
5,I have these all throughout my house in windows. Love the easy set up and having the ability to look on the cameras at any time when I am out and about.  I even have 2 inside my home to check on my dog.  Setting up for emails is pretty easy but if you have any issues there tech people are great and very helpful.  I have been using this companies cameras now for 9 years.  I use to have a different company cameras but you could no move the cameras thru the app or anything lots of issues then they stopped making them and shut down that part of selling.  Amcrest stands behind there cameras with tech support and all.
5,I have been a loyal Amcrest product fan and utilized the most of their cameras including the indoor/outdoor PTZ the fixed cameras the dome cameras and the PTZ indoor model. This model improves the resolution from 1080i to 4K and is really crystal clear in full light.  As with most night vision cameras the visibility always will depend on the availability of light in the area but also the amount of IRs that the cameras have but otherwise night vision is good.  I love the fact that this connects via ethernet and wifi and would love it if it also could be PoE as well to eliminate the cord.  Good value for what you get.
5,I am very happy with the Amcrest 4MP Pro HD Indoor wifi camera and the Pro Mobile App is also great. The overall configuration initial setup and usability was very easy.Its video quality and night vision are great (Since there are options to setup the resolution based on requirements)The motion detection and controlling the camera via mobile app is easy.Tried connecting through Cloud app as well as view Pro app. The cloud app has little delay in processing. works very well through the view pro app.Excellent pan tilt functionalities very easy to use and the mounting bracket was also useful
5,Philip did a great job
5,This is my first security camera. I needed help installing and later troubleshooting. Amcrest customer support has been very helpful. Susan got me up and running in no time.
5,excellent customer support from Dale.s. camera works perfect
1,This camera is simply terrible.The processor on this thing is so weak that none of the advertised features work as expected. I have disabled everything except one 1080p RTSP feed at 15 FPS and this thing is still lagging. Any time PTZ is used the camera needs several seconds to buffer an otherwise blurry image. By the way even at full resolution the picture is no good.With my reduced RTSP settings the camera still struggles to keep up and frequently drops frames.Several settings are inaccessible via the mobile app and only via the camera's IP address so be aware of that if you decide to ignore my warnings and buy this anyways.Despite disabling audio recording I noticed it was somehow reenabled.I also suspect that the camera is not truly ONVIF compliant because ONVIF PTZ commands cause the camera to tilt up more and more each time.I have a POE Amcrest camera that is fantastic but they really missed the mark on this one.
1,I think I got an item that someone used or returned. Because I found a fingerprint on the inside sticker. (RED circle on the photo)Thank you so much.
1,Buyer beware!!! This camera is horrible please!!! Don’t buy it
1,Purchased camera for security. Camera does not recognize or record events. It only works in live view. Spent numerous e-mail exchanges with technical support without resolution. Useless.
5,This camera was just what I was looking for. My company is looking at going back into the office part time and with recently adopting a dog I was worried about leaving them completely unattended. This fits the bill especially with the PTZ functionality so I can monitor basically two rooms at once with the click of a button. Another super neat feature is the audio on it so I can keep an ear out if they bark or get into something and I am able to talk to them. The image quality is great even when it gets cloudy out in low light levels this thing "shines" quite literally! I will be looking at getting another one of these soon to be able to watch another room
5,The video quality is amazing.I love the follow-me feature where you can select a person or object to track and the camera will rotate to follow it.Near 360 degrees motion is awesome.Setup was a piece of cake with the android app.I did not opt-in for the cloud recording features.Highly recommended if you want a good camera. This camera replaced an old but still functioning 1080p camera and the image quality has improved substantially.
5,I've been using the camera for several weeks now it seems to be good quality like the rest of my Amcrest cameras. With WiFi support I was able to mount it in a location where it would have been nearly impossible to install an Ethernet cable.  Image quality is excellent.  I'll update this review if my long-term experience is different.
5,Good overall camera device for a 1 camera need situation but where this camera shines is in a situation where you would want multiple PTZ cameras with ease to transition from each. In case you don't want to yam up your wifi with PTZ camera traffic you have the option to either plug-in an ethernet cable or connect via wifi 2.8 ghz to each camera. Ability to hear audio where camera is located and to also "Talk" via camera. Snapshots are easy to take via app and share.
4,So I thought the setup would be easy since it was a wifi cam but it took me longer than expected to get it going. Wifi initially didn't work so I tried the ethernet cable and that worked but obviously it's not practical. Eventually got it working on wifi.Overall once you get past the tedious setup stage the picture and audio quality are pretty good. I liked the SD card slot and it will definitely come in handy the more I use it. The tilt feature was awesome and worked great.The app was an easy straightforward setup. I liked the barcode scanning option that was cool.  The fact that I could scan the bar code at the bottom and it was recognized by the app made that step easy. The rest was pretty basic.
4,The video quality is very good the two audio has a slight delay but that is normal for streaming.Out of the box the setup was very simple and the quick start guide was easily followed.The App is user friendly and intuitive. I did not setup the cloud storage for this ptz and instead installed a microSD card. Pulling up recordings is very quick and the search function is like every other camera manufacturer. The PTZ movements are a bit extreme and getting a fine tuned placement can be time consuming. Going through the settings I did not see a place to adjust the movement speed.nearby motion tracking is strong but motion tracking in excess of 30ft is 50/50 at best.Overall a good camera with a decent picture.
5,The camera I received had an invalid serial number when trying to get it register via the QR code. I had to type the serial number in manually into the phone app and then it took. This is my 3rd Amcrest camera and the camera works pretty well. The PTZ  is a little shaky when tracking movement in my garage and moves choppily. The two way sound is very nice and the mount was perfect for mounting up high. It works very well with the app and I have no real complaints aside from not being able to use the QR code to register it.
5,I’ve used quite a few different models of wifi cameras and I have to say this camera is one of the best! The setup is SUPER easy and takes no more than 2 minutes. The picture quality is very clear and the movement is very receptive from the app input. The only drawback I have with this camera is that it is not able to be set up with the Amcrest Smart Home app that I use for a different camera I have. If Amcrest could get all of their cameras to work with the same app then that would be perfect.
5,I love that I can watch my dog while I am work! There is sound and the camera moves so you can see a larger area!
5,I set this in a new building and I can see the entire place just by moving it remotely. This is a large building and I can see everything ant time day or night. The picture quis very good.
4,The video quality from this camera surpasses the video from my 2MP IP2M-841B cameras from Amcrest.  The reason I gave this camera an overall rating of 4 instead of a 5 is as follows:1 - There is no slot to put a micro SD card and2 - This camera will not link up to my NVR.Without the ability to do either of the above you are being forced to subscribe to the cloud if you want to see recorded video which makes this camera only available to use if you want to see live video.
5,Great camera great price. Search Google for Amcrest API to find the documentation needed to integrate these with your home automation / scripts. No crazy web browser plugins unlike Foscam. Better camera at a better price. These are easy to set up via their web user interface and a wired connection (to start). No problems connecting to WiFi or using static IP addressing. I picked up four cameras when they were on sale (15% off) and very happy I did. I think a lot of the problems people have are WiFi issues; cameras send a lot of data. If your WiFi is not up to snuff you will have issues. We have three Ubiquiti UAP-AC-M in the house with 130 WiFi devices and it's rock solid.
5,I am a big fan of Amcrest cameras they are cheap easy to setup and do not require the cloud to use them.  They offer RTSP which is a huge must for any one in home security and home automation. This camera has a wider viewing angle and much better quality during day and night when compared to the 1080p model. I highly recommend this to anyone.
4,Easy  to setup for a novice patience is called for but after about 10 minutes up and running on my wifi network.Clear view of my pet cages.  Great zoom also
5,Like: picture quality ease  speed of setup  cloud storage and reasonable cost.Dislike : too many cloud apps motion detection is good but doesn’t have motion follow like some other amcrest models.
5,Loving our new cam so far. Easily set up using the app on my cell phone haven't tried to connect via PC yet but looks like it had a ton more features to work with.. Just need the S/N and wifi to get it going.We mainly just use it to check in on our newer pup while he's not in his crate. Can hear sounds if he's barking or anything going on in the house. I still haven't figured out how the two way voice works via the app yet. Read the guide today and didn't have any info with it.The movement feature works well just a bit slow depending on your connection.Night vision gives a great clear picture and would be a perfect baby cam.It doesn't working with the Google home app but it will work with Amazon Alexa. Though sometimes a bit laggy to pull up. Had to open it on my phone first and then tell Alexa to pull it up.For a quick reference of what's going on at home it works great.
4,I previously purchased an Amcrest camera and was surprised by the quality so I decided to purchase this one as I have always wanted one than could pan around inside my house. I like the smaller compact size of this camera. I was expecting something much larger/bulkier. It has a nice sleek design. It is powered by a micro USB cable. As others have stated getting it setup within Amcrest apps can be tricky and somewhat frustrating. I was never able to get my camera added via WiFi. I had to use the ethernet cable which wasn't too big of a deal in my case since I already had an ethernet port near where I was going to install it. However I could see this being a major problem for others who do not have an ethernet port in the area they want to install it. Eventually I decided to see if this camera would work with my Lorex Fusion NVR since I am not really a fan of the Amcrest app interfaces. It connected flawlessly and all remote control features for the pan/tilt and microphone work great! It even works great via my Lorex remote viewing app! I do wish the camera had a slower and smoother pan and tilt speed; it is rather quick and "jerky." I also wish this camera had a remote zoom option. Nonetheless the picture quality on this camera is excellent for the price. Night vision is okay. All in all this is a decent camera for someone looking for a basic indoor camera.
5,I been using this camera for a while now and I haven't had any issues. I did run into a little quirk were I have yet to get it auto track movement but it's nothing that I'll fuss much about. I've been running this camera with my BlueIris setup & I'm can still use all the PTZ functions with no problem. Just wish it was outdoor capable.
5,dennis  did an amazing set of procedures to get my Amcrest cameras working Thank you very much
4,I purchased this camera because I wanted a camera that would activate when it picked upmotion of sound. this camera does both plus you can activate it over LONG distances whichis awesome!! The problem is the setup software setup on a Android phone is easy the problemis setting it up on a laptop or pc you have to download the configuration program first and set it up then you download the program for the pc or laptop and set it up. You need the information offof the configuration program to setup the laptop program then you setup the laptop program to make adjustments to the camera which include saving pictures and or video of the motion or sound detected.rHighly sensitive to sounds you can setup the camera for 50db's basically a whisper the camera sent anotice every time a loud car or truck  drove past my home. 70db is about right. I couldn't get the laptopprogram setup which made it impossible to save anything to the micro card. I have up after 4 attemptsto setup the laptop program the laptop has Windows 10. I sent the camera back if I could have gottenThe laptop program installed and working I would have kept the camera.
5,Great product! Had an issue and customer service representative Susan helped me until the problem was solved. Great job Susan! Thank you!
5,I ordered two of these to use as baby monitors. Very easy to set up on the Amcrest app. They also were very easy to set up on Blue Iris. Outstanding clear picture and night vision. PTS works well. Quality cameras for a good price.
5,We recently got a puppy who is 6 months old and likes getting into trouble! We need to supervise her every moment she's not asleep and this camera is a great solution to help us with that. I have it set up in the living room where she hangs out so I can watch her while I'm working at my desk or in the kitchen making lunch. If she moves around the room the camera can follow her so she's always in view.Getting it set up with the app was a little tricky at first but after a few minutes I had it connected to my wifi and streaming to my phone. It has a speaker and microphone so I can listen to her and if she's being ever being naughty I can tap the microphone button and tell her to stop. It seems almost more effective than when I talk to her in person because she is curious about a voice coming from the camera :)
5,This is a great camera! with storage flexibility and motion trackingI love that it is not a closed system and you have the ability to choose your storage medium and have direct access to your video stream . I also have an Amcrest NVR and this connects seamlessly to it  to have all my recordings in the same box. Also has pan and tilt functionality giving you more area to view.For the price and functionality I would highly recommendWhat I like1. Set -up/installation  : Set up is easy and straightforward  I needed to add some additional length to the power as the one provided was not long enough for my needs.I have been pleasantly surprised with the wifi connection  ZERO dropouts to my NVR . I reused the hooks I had on a previous camera although one was provided2.  Paring : After downloading the app finding the camera is quite easy using either the search feature or using a fixed IP address which is recommended  plenty of guides for this depending on your router type.3.  Motion detection : This is customizable for regions so you can eliminate areas that are not of interest . It also has motion tracking which works well  although it sometimes gets lost4.  Quality : its 4MP with great picture quality also had adjustable settings as needed. Night visions is also great if you are extending the power source  do make sure to provide adequate power otherwise the IR will flicker5.  Storage: You can use an SD card or connect rtsp stream to a dedicated NVR . Cloud backup are available a lot of options which I love !6.  IOT: If you are a DIY smart home integrator like I am  this will work great as the system gives lots of flexibility like RTSP/ONVIF  it also have an API for integration with other smart home products what not to love!7. Smart home hub: integrates with smart home hubs  so you want easily view streams on that Alexa or google screenWhat I don't like1. The APP (Amcrest pro view) needs some improvement  if functions for what it does but could be a lot better
4,The camera gets 5 stars! It does all the things we want it to do. I deducted one star because of the app. It's not very intuitive. I consider myself pretty tech savvy and it took me almost two days to figure out how to watch the recordings!  Also we have an amcrest video doorbell that uses the Amcrest Smart home app. We couldn't utilize that app for this camera. It's frustrating to have two different apps for our home security. The new app Amcrest Pro View is not my favorite. I did reach out to the company regarding the new app and they said they would convey my info to their R&D department so maybe some day I can just have it all in one app. So I would give their customer service 5 stars too!
5,Great camera. easy to setup. very modern phone application.Long electrical wire provided which is awesome. various way to setup (wired wireless p2p etc...)Would buy again
5,I got this camera as I currently work from home and recently moved into a new home with my home office in the basement. Due to being in the basement I rarely know who is at my home while I am downstairs and we often have visitors workers or family throughout the week. This camera had been the perfect solution to being able to see who is at my home while working without having to get up to see. The 4MP camera is clear enough in standard definition but really crisp and clear in HD. The pan/tilt function is very easy to use and responsive. An added bonus is the 2-way audio which allows me to speak to my unassuming wife or 1-year-old son when I catch them off guard. Ultimately it is added security and peace of mind which is the goal of any home security camera. If looking for something simple multifunctional and additional cameras can be added to then this camera is definitely the ideal choice!
5,The Amcrest 4MP ProHD Indoor WiFi Camera Security IP Camera is reliable and at the right price. Highly recommended with options for connection & software.
5,This WiFi PTZ camera just works. I don't have to keep resetting it it's easy to setup and add to Blue Iris and comes with everything you need. Adjustable mounting bracket decently long power cord and USB brick a network cable (if you don't want the wifi) and some basic instructions.Since it has a network connection it'd be nice if it also had PoE when using it that wired connection.These cameras are solid and reliable. I have six of them now including some 'indoor' models that are outside under the eaves and haven't given me any trouble.
5,Great camera supports ONVIF and RTSP.Doesn't support POE (Power over ethernet) but if you have POE you can get a POE splitter to POE/micro usb and this will work with that.Very quiet panning motor.Its really nice this Amcrest camera doesn't require the Amcrest NVR or mobile app. You just plug the camera in go to the IP address and you can use the RTSP stream for Frigate or Home Assistant or use the ONVIF through blue iris.The image quality is superb with a great sensor that works well in the day and the night.Comes with a great camera mount so that you can mount the camera on the wall/ceiling/desk and you can adjust the camera to many different angles.Great affordable camera!
5,So far so good. Like the Micro Usb charging. Picture quality is good. Connected to DVR. Using WiFi. Pan tilt slightly laggy. But solid cam. Recommend.
5,good camera and amcrest support are super
4,Pro:360 Degree - The built-in motor allows you to rotate the camera 360 degrees remotely with the option of zooming in and out.Connection - This camera can be connected to all leading platforms such as IOS Android Windows Mac and Web Browser.Installation to the App - Very smooth scan the QR barcode download a FREE app and just follow step by step after the instruction in the app. Took me less than 3 minutes.Installation to the Software - Amcrest provides free downable software for both Windows and Mac. I Will note that it required a beginner level for the setting but still was quick and easy to set up.Mount - The kit you receive gives you different options: put it on the desk or mount it to the wall.Quality - Both the image and the video is giving you a fantastic image. Also you have the option for sub-stream which can reduce the bandwidth if needed.Night Vision - The camera can identify nighttime and switch automatically to night vision.Price - Comparing other brands this camera coming at a low cost with many advanced features. Also unlike other security cameras that charge you for all cloud services this product comes with a FREE cloud that saves the last four hours of recording online and free cloud use for one camera for all remote options (IOS Android PC).Recording - Different storage options such as SD-Card Cloud and Amcrest provide free software to convert a regular PC to an NVR recorder.Security Detectors - This can be easily configured to the motion detector and noise detector; the second the camera notices something (motion) you can receive notification through email an app on the phone and text message.Con:Data transfer - I noticed that sometimes the rotation is delayed when I send a command to rotate the camera.Connectivity - I did notice that the network connectivity isn't stable on WiFi.In Sum:This is the six Amcrest cameras I'm ordering and once again no regrades! There are plenty of pros for this camera (see above) and many others that you be glad to found. The two cons I mentioned may cause difficulties but for the price are mountable. This product comes with many different FREE cloud benefits. Therefore I recommend this product to all.
5,Prior to this camera I had an older style Amcrest camera. While the reliability of it was great the image quality wasnt as good as I've seen in other cameras so it was time for an upgrade. This camera day or night has excellent video quality. I was especially happy with how clear the day time video is. Set up was relatively straight forward. Since I dont use their cloud support I opted to punching a hole in my firewall for remote access. One thing to mention at the time of writing this review the firmware on their website was not current. They currently have posted a version from 12/18/19 however there is a much newer update. If your camera ships with a firmware update newer than 2019 stick with it. If you've accidentally downgraded Support can provide the latest version. Overall this is another quality camera by Amcrest. I'm happy.
4,I've owned nearly a dozen Amcrest cameras of various models and this is a good quality one for indoor use and limited outdoor use where no water can get to it (I place it up under my eaves).  The pan and tilt work great and this image is very clear.  Amcrest software for this camera is a bit finicky so I don't recommend it for novices. With patience it will work well and does not require a cloud subscription as you can store the images locally on an SD card for just a few dollars 1-time cost. It works with the Amcrest View Pro application on phones and an aging Amcrest Surveillance Pro on PC's (this really needs updating as it locks up frequently when used as a monitoring station for multiple cameras simultaneously).  The micro SD card is located under the lens on the bottom side of the turret.  Prior models had it located near power connection.
4,Amcrest has the best customer service agents.I was having trouble to set up my camera and contacted them and was assisted in a timely manner.The camera has a very nice clear image.The App is a little complicated for me and the image is compressed when in portrait mode (with the phone upright). The image is better (stretched)t in landscape mode turning yhe phone to the side.I also wished that I could connect my Amcrest doorbell camera to the App. But it is not possible.The camera is great. I loved the image.
5,I have been very happy with this camera specially the picture quality has been great. This is the first time I am using a camera with auto-tracking feature- it works great! When I move and the camera follows my move- I feel like it's the 'Wall-E' character sitting in my living room - really cool!The well-developed AmcrestViewPro app super-handy to control every feature available in this camera.I got this camera as a replacement of my old camera which did not have auto-tracking. And I think it has been a great pick.
5,Unfortunately we live in a time where we can not leave our doors unlocked. We also like to know what’s going on in our homes whether for security or to check on the kids. Wireless IP security cameras help us to achieve these goals. This is a very nice wireless security camera. You can rotate pan and tilt. You can also zoom and it has two-way audio. I am able to use this camera with my IPhone via the Amcrest Cloud App from work school or out of the state. This is a single-camera system with surprising capabilities usually found on larger security systems. For example the camera has a wide angle lens that can provide a high definition view of an entire room at once while also allowing the user to pan and tilt the camera and get tighter shots with the digital zoom. The customer support is outstanding and helped with any issues we had with the camera. You will not find a better support that can assist you with any issues on the same day or even on the weekend.
5,We upgraded from a Foscam FI9821W to this Amcrest unit and boy howdy what a night and day (pun intended) difference. The 4MP quality and night-vision are great. We added it with no issue to our Amcrest NVR replacing the Foscam in no time. Very happy!
5,Have had Amcrest cameras for years now and updating a couple. Had a question and called Amcrest and was quick to get Jaden on the line and was awesome! he was able to get past the issue of internet explorer which was closed since bing came out and took care of the issue and can't say enough positive things about his expertise. He is a 10 Star Tech Support rep!
5,This is an impressive camera for the money. It has a wide field of view yet maintains good clarity. Night vision is good. WiFI function has a respectable range. There is not much that needs to be improved.
4,The sd card option makes it really easy to use this as your first camera or stand alone system. The tracking is better than other cameras I’ve had as well. Would definitely buy another one.
4,Camera works fine but I could not believe how itwas delivered. There was no wrapping around the camera box and it could have been stolen very easily. All items should be wrapped so that people cannot see what the item is.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have had quite a few Foscam and now Amcrest in-door WiFi cameras and currently have two WiFi bullets and a WiFi spotlight camera up and running (along with two Defender bullets that I am guessing Amcrest makes for them as OEM). The 4MP UltraHD Indoor WiFi Camera is by far the coolest. Resolution is great night vision superb set up was easy (that is once I discovered that it did not work with my SmartHome app - unfortunate but forgivable given how good the camera is). One item I was a bit iffy about is illustrated in the accompanying video - person tracking. Since I believe that the AI uses facial recognition I held my phone a bit away from my face - consequently the camera never points directly into the phone camera lens. But as you can see it's not super smooth but it finds you. Understandably I was a bit concerned during my review testing time that it would be noisy as it moved (as previous Amcrest cameras have been) - it is not! It's almost completely silent.The app is OK - I think I like the SmartHome app better - but it works on my iPhone 11 just fine.This is an excellent camera and well worth the money.
1,I was looking for another camera to install in my home to monitor the entrance to my back patio. This Amcrest looked promising at a decent price point so I decided to give it a try. Big regrets.Likes:- Image quality and live view was okay. I’ve seen and used much better products from Nest Ring and eufy.- Option to use microSD card for recording to local storage.- Honestly there is not a lot to like. Only thing remotely close is price point but it’s really not worth it. You get what you pay for. See dislikes section.Dislikes:- Horrible and ugly mounting solution. You’re supposed to screw on the main camera unit to this strange mount piece. It feels cheap and seems like it’ll break with some force.- Awful app and connection experience. I used the Amcrest View Pro app for iOS and it’s so outdated and really bad. It’s like a junior iOS developer created it.- The motion tracking is really slow.- Did I mention the app sucks? Cause yeah that’s honestly the deal breaker. If I cannot easily use the camera to view the live feed or recordings then what’s the point?
4,Not the worst not the best video quality. Does the job for a indoor camera
4,It's definitely great if you have a complete security custom made system with NVR + more.However I wouldn't say it's great as a stand-alone item just to keep an eye on the front door.The desktop program is nice but it's definitely not a plug and play. The ethernet port socket helps enhance the response time and reduce the lag significantly.The mounting solution can be improved. It looks like it could easily be moved by unwanted guests.Motion tracking can also be improved and smoother. The servos move a bit too slow to track someone/something actually moving.
5,The Good:  • Excellent day and night picture (2688 x 1520P @ 30fps).  No complaints here clear picture both with light and in night mode (black/white).  No out of focus areas (like with some of my cheaper cameras).  • Speed of camera movement (pan / tilt) - PTZ.  With my slower cameras it’s easy to overshoot area I’m trying to see because they’re so slow I over estimate how many times to hit the pan button but with this one it’s right there no overshoot.  • Quick and easy configuration.  Plus multiple paths to configure (Amcrest View Pro App browser and NVR).  • ONVIF – works great with Blue Iris (2 min to configure).  • Microphone sensitivity (2-way talk).  • Wi-Fi (2.4Ghz) and Ethernet connectivity.  5Ghz would be a “nice to have” but 2.4Ghz is the norm in this segment.  • H.265 compression  • Good long power cord / adapter (reaches from power outlet to 10 foot ceiling where camera is mounted). The Bad (areas of possible improvement):  • Weak speaker and a little grainy (adequate but could be louder).  • Noisy camera movement (pan / tilt).  Louder when camera is mounted with the camera lens above the based (i.e. sitting on a flat service) quitter when camera is mounted with camera below the base (i.e. upside down mounted on ceiling).  It’s a grinding kind of noise but isn’t affecting functionality and is working fine.  • Video shakes when camera moves.  Movement isn’t as smooth as my other camera but is by far the fastest (guess that’s the trade-off).  • Micro USB power connection is a little loose but hasn’t popped out or been an issue.  A barrel plug or USB-C connection might be a better choice. Over-all an excellent camera to add to my collection.  I wanted one specifically for my office so I’d be able to check in on my multiple 3d printers when I’m away as well as see who’s going in and out and this has been perfect for that.  I can center camera on whichever printer is going at the time.  The 2-way talk function is fun when the kids try and sneak candy from my stash.  I have a number of Amcrest cameras in my collection  appreciate the features at an affordable cost.
1,This is hands-down the worst PTZ camera I've ever used. If you want to adjust the viewing angle get ready to play the lottery. Sometimes a command to tilt or pan in any direction will result in a tiny movement and sometimes it will result in an extreme movement. It is completely random. There is no way to accurately adjust the angle. In low light no details are visible at all. I have a few other cameras and this is by far the worst of them. The image quickly turns to a mushy blend of noisy pixels. Save your money and go with something else.
5,this is the quality I come to expect from Amcrest. low price high quality. setup was easy and the quality of the videos are fantastic. worth checking out!
5,Great daytime security camera.  If you mount it inside a window glass the night mode reflects off the glass to show whatever is behind the camera i.e. curtains blinds etc.  I have a motion detector spotlight outside so when it lights up the camera records what is outside just fine.  Past experience indicates that if I mount it outside the infrared light attracts bugs therefore giving a lot of false motion alerts.  For now it seems that my indoor mount along with the motion activated security lights achieve my desired result.
4,This is a wonderful camera.  I was able to add this to an existing DVR system without any issue due to the open ONVIF.  The camera has a wonderful picture quality and a great interface on the app and the web interface.  I did update the firmware first thing but didn’t really see a difference.  I would have liked to have seen this be POE so that I would only have to run one cable and not be limited to the length of the USB cable but it is what it is.  The motion detection and person following feature is OK.  It isn’t wonderful but it is decent.  I have decided to disable this feature due to it being a bit hit or miss.  However this is a feature that can easily be improved with a firmware update and can be a wonderful feature.  Overall for the price you cant beat this camera.  It is a great camera for the price that could easily cost double and still be worth it.
4,Great little camera. Have it placed in the living room so it can view most of the house when rotating. Picture is fantastic. Only downside was it was a little difficult to set up and required a different app than there video doorbell.
4,I just bought this camera and I went into setup to try to get the latest firmware.  Security on IP cameras is a big deal especially given the various horror stories with strangers talking to kids.  In the camera I can see my firmware was built in 2021-05-18 which is good.  However if I go to the Amcrest website for their firmware the downloadable firmware is from 2019!  I have concerns about the software given this - how do we make sure the software is secure?Picture quality seems good so far.
5,I am replacing all of my Yi 360 Cameras with this unit from Amcrest.  Setup was a breeze.  It was nice to simply connect to ethernet to set the wifi but you can just use wifi as we.  Picture quality is good and best part it is fully compatible with most IP camera software.  I tested with Amcrest software and third party software.  Both worked and allowed me to control using PTZ.  Best part is that clould storage is optional.  I can record locally on the camera or using a software based NVR.  Night vision performance is good.  Very nice unit at this price.
5,It has great quality videos both during the daytime and at night. The videos are stored in the cloud. You can access the camera via your cell phone through a mobile app. The setup process is fairly easy it works both on wi-fi and via Ethernet. The tilt and rotation of the camera are adjustable and if the motion detector is on it can track the object. Tech support was great and very helpful!
5,Good price/product.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have been using Amcrest security cameras for years and they just keep getting better.  This 4MP camera has extremely clear resolution and the camera can also be set to track on events!  I have a few 2MP models that work the same way.  It’s an easy integration into other system such as Synology Surveillance Station to take full advantage of all the camera features.  Installation and setup were a snap as well.  I’m using a hardwire situation but was able to configure the wireless as well as the hardware using a static IP addressing configuration.  The PTZ on this is quick and responsive as well.  When it comes to night vision this is also a far better product than many other brands at this price point.  I would highly recommend this model especially for high traffic area’s such as a front door or driveway.
5,The Amcrest 4MP Indoor Camera performs very well.  One of the features I really like is auto-tracking; this allows the PTZ functions to track movement automatically.  This has increased the viewing field because it now can look down two hallways based on movement.  The 4MP picture is clear HD quality with the storage expense of a higher resolution camera.  For my needs indoor I really like the construction performance and robust design of this little camera.
5,This is a good wifi camera with not pricy budget. I like the way how to pan the camera to the left right up down with a finger on the screen buttonless it’s smooth. The feature night vision is working great I can see the things in the night time not nothing in the dark. Also I love that there are microphone and speaker which I can talk to the app. With the price compares with functions that the camera has it’s totally worth.
5,This product is another great one from amcrest! Its quiet pan and tilt is great for stealth spying on the pups unless you speak to him through the camera then its kind of funny to watch him be confused as to where my voice is coming from. Its easy to setup through the app with nothing extra to buy to watch live footage. You can insert an SD card to record files locally but amcrest also offers a cloud solution if you want to choose that route as well. The video quality as well is really decent for the price of this camera.Pros:Easy Setup and viewingGreat video qualityEasy app to manage the cameraMotion tracking(For the price)Free to use unless you want to use their storageSmall footprintCons:Motion Tracking(Its a pro and con because it doesn't like multiple separate direction motions of course and cant choose one thing to follow)Mounting has to use the big bracket to put anywhere if not sitting on something.
5,I've had a number of different styles of these cameras over the years. My first move into this format of camera was when I purchased a Foscam FI8918W 10 years ago as a baby monitor for my first born... These little cameras have come a long way! I love that this camera connects to power using a standard USB connection compared to the wall wart power adapters of my older cameras. It would have been a nice plus to have POE however for this price point there is probably a limit on just how much tech one can pack into this small package.As a pro user so I setup and use the camera with the Amcrest View Pro app. The instructions start with the camera on a wired network first before connecting it over Wifi. The setup and beginning configuration was super straightforward and easy to follow. This is my 7th Amcrest camera at my house and I have recommended them to many others in my extended family and friends. Hardly a tour of the View Pro app however two way audio worked great and the PTZ controls worked okay as well. The View Pro app made it very straightforward to review the footage or watch the camera live on my smartphone.The camera's web interface is similar to Amcrest's other offerings and I am pleased to see like other newer Amcrest cameras the image stream did not need any additional plugins or settings and displayed straight away. The web interface I felt was consistent and easy to use from the other cameras I have. I set up the camera to detect motion and record to the SD card internally using the web interface. It had no issues recognizing the 64gb micro SD card I grabbed off my shelf and put in it. For some reason I could not get the detection sensitivity graph to work correctly on my current release of Edge or Chrome and would also be nice if the PTZ function was slower when set to speed "1" even with a rapidly short click of a mouse the camera would move farther than I intended.For my use I also connected it to my Milestone DVR system. For some reason the Milestone camera wizard was unable to find the camera over my Wifi connection however I found it on the first go through the wired connection... having the Milestone DVR software set the camera up through the wired connection and then updating the address to the correct IP address when connected through Wifi. I was able to test the microphone through Milestone and listen to audio from the camera however I was not successful in getting the speaker to output sound on the camera or get the PTZ function working. I figure that's a configuration issue on my end. I do not recommend connecting the camera to a dedicated DVR over Wifi as it takes up a lot of bandwidth with either H264 or H265.I have had the camera now a couple weeks and my wife and I use it primarily to watch our fur-babies (cats) go around the house while we were away. It worked excellent and the IR night vision had no issues illuminating the space the camera was pointed at. I highly recommend these types of cameras over traditional "baby monitor" style devices available at big box stores costing well over $200 as these cameras are accessible while at home or out and about through your cellular data.  As an IT professional recommend Amcrest cameras to people in my organization who ask for guidance for kid/pet cams where this camera succeeds or other Amcrest offerings if something with a more security focus is needed.
5,This indoor camera is very easy to setup. It comes with wall mount lab cable and power adapter. The AmcrestViewPro app is very easy to use and easy to connect to the camera. The night vision is very good. The camera can be rotated and moved easily through app. You can use this as a baby monitor as well. It has mic and speaker as well for two way communication. Good camera at good price.
5,Great video quality and very nice features. Love the color and the flexibility and how easy to operate it is. The app needs some work and fine tuning but it gets the job done.The device has a Speaker and Mic that enables 2 way communication. Good quality. Not best but for the cost its pretty good.Definitely great little camera that allows me to keep an eye on things around the house when needed!
5,Got the camera for about a week and the picture quality is great versus past Armcrest cameras I’ve owned. Set up was fast and simple. The SD card is on the bottom of the camera ball.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This new camera is being used with a new app Amcrest viewpro. The camera is super clear day and night with excellent hd quality. The auto tracking feature works as described and the upon opening the app the live video loads quickly. Also the app is pretty simple to use as any other camera app!!
5,Purchased this indoor cam to keep track of our cat when we're out. Sometimes she goes after the Christmas tree so she can't be trusted.Camera was easy to setup. The box contains everything needed including a long USB cable power adapter and even an ethernet cable. I didn't use the ethernet and instead set the camera up using my cell phone. Image quality is very good. Note that you can change the image quality in the app so you can conserve bandwidth if needed.Moving the PTZ is also easy in the app and pretty smooth. This makes locating the cat easier too.Overall very pleased with the device. Works well!
4,I have both the 4MP version and the 2MP version of this camera. In my situation I find the 2MP version works out much better. under the same lighting (or lack therof) the 2 MP version does a far better job. As far as clarity I see no difference. If I digitally zoom in with the 4MP the video gets grainy and not so with the 2MP. Note that I compared the 2 cameras under the exact same conditions. I am not condemning the 4MP version it is just that the 2MP version suites me much better and for less money. I had these cameras set up in a family room and the comparison was made all throughout the day and night . If using for a baby monitor there would be absolutely no reason to go with the 4MP.note: there is a corralation between the cmos sensor size and megapixel count. particularly with regards to available light. In other words more megapixels is not always better.
5,I own several products from Amcrest … I find all to be of good quality and easy set up with my NVR.I would highly recommend this as well
5,Got this camera to replace an older Amcrest model and the difference is day and night. this clip was at night with one light on the difference between the two was amazing. The price was great for the features and I highly recommend this camera for any interior use. Setup was a breeze and it just works right out of the box.  You can't go wrong with this camera.
5,All my footage is stored in the Cloud. I love the remote access monitoring and other features. Great buy!
3,The pix quality is good as long as you set to HD . Sound quality is good but the 2 way speaker very poor quality.
5,The quality of this camera is great.  The picture is clear in both daylight and low light conditions.  I can always access it remotely.  I'm really happy with it.
5,This camera has been great so far for me. I put it in my garage to monitor my new Amazon in garage drop offs and it has been flawless. I love that it takes an SD card internally and can record to my NVR at the same time.Night vision is great and it even has two way audio. I can imagine I wouldn't need anything more if I had kids this would be a fine kiddie monitor. It's also pretty easy to get the camera set up to have motion detection notifications.
5,Decent for using eith Surveillance Station on a Synology NAS. It’s affordable has a decent deature set and is compatible
5,I added to my network with the older cameras and it has a much wider and clearer view.  I am very pleased with the new camera and I may replace my older ones with this version.
5,I use camera for hone security.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I purchased this camera to replace my Foscam R2 camera which is another wireless 1080 camera that has served me well for years. Once I had this Amcrest replacement setup in it's place which really took no time at all other than finding the IP address and connecting it to wifi via the web-UI I was stunned at the picture quality. My wife was as well as we use it to monitor our points of egress/ingress in the house and check on the cats.This camera blew all my expectations of wifi-based cameras out of the water and realize I have been missing out thinking the Foscam was as good as it was going to get. Their must be a better video processing chip or more computer power in these cameras because they don't stutter-lag and pick up sound clear as day. These are far better than your average PTZ wifi camera's. I am going to buy a second to replace the foscam in my kitchen and probably give the foscam ones away.Now full disclosure I DIDN'T even touch the amcrest software to manage these since I use Blue Iris for all my home surveillance but I did see some other reviews where the auto tracking was turned on and that looked SWEET how quickly it followed a subject. I am going to try and get that working with Blue Iris but not sure it will work or not. Either way the Amcrest software is easy to use and setup I have used it in the past and it will makes things simple. This is the camera to get!!
5,I’ve had this IP4-1041W now for a few weeks. I have it sitting right next to a IP2M-841B. The picture quality of the IP4-1041 is far more superior to the 1080P. It’s brighter and clearer.The setup was easy and fast as with other Amcrest cameras using the Amcrest View Pro. My Amcrest NVR found the camera with no issues. I was able to change the setting from dynamic to static through the Android app but unable to specify the desired IP address. I had to use the Amcrest Web View to specify the IP address.The pan tilt functions are very responsive compare to the IP2M-841 but the IP4-1041 lacks the optical zoom and you loose the ability to have zoomed presets. And with only digital zoom available the picture is a bit grainy at best.The auto tracking feature is also very good and responsive. I had to turn off this feature because the push notification will drive you crazy. Auto tracking can be turned off/on using the app but ONLY when viewing a single camera. I was unable to toggle auto tracking when in multi-view.  The camera view returns to the home position after every few seconds in my case it returns to the #1 preset.
5,Great affordable wireless camera. Definitely would recommend buying a SIM card for onboard storage will save a ton of money in the long term. Wireless connectivity and installation was a breeze. Testing the quality it does seem to be able to pick up detail at a short distance. The human activity sensor picks up just about everything human or not so you may get some false positives (but comes with the territory). Could definitely be used as an indoor monitor for other things (basement etc.)My only improvement would be added security features (like a remote alarm) to turn on if an intruder is detected. Just capturing something doesn't really do much to stop them if you are using this for security reasons.
5,Camera does a great job giving a good view of the room. The wide angle camera and has great low light view.The mount although adding to the bulkiness of the camera does a great job providing multiple positions and angles to mount the camera.This camera support h.265 which makes your compressed recordings smaller in size. I love seeing this on more cameras today.This camera supports both 2.4 and 5ghz wifi which is awesome.I would knock a star off this camera for the amcrest view pro app being poorly built but I use this camera with Blue Iris and it works perfectly in there.
5,I have been a long time Amcrest customer and actually used this purchase to upgrade an OG Amcrest PTZ camera that has served me faithfully for years.  The HD video quality is excellent and I had no issues integrating this camera with my Lorex NVR.  Even if you don't have an NVR the Amcrest View app does a good job to manage and control the camera remotely.  Adding a 200GB MicroSD card was plug and play.My favorite new feature with this model is the Auto Track.  This will detect movement and follow it as opposed to being locked in a certain frame.  I can cover way more area and have the video be more relevant when it detects motion.Overall this is a great PTZ camera at a great price!
5,The camera was easy to setup. I bought this mainly to keep an eye on my precious dogs. The best features are that it has built in mic/speaker and PTZ. I can move the lens around to see where my dog is at. It also records so I can see which dog was misbehaving and causing a mess :D
5,Cindy G  was very helpful in helping with the set up. I am please with it and will be recommending it.
5,for Auto Tracking turned on.  Log into Cameras IP Address then go to  Setup then go to Event then goto Video Detection.  put a check on the Auto Tracking.
5,The camera comes packaged will with all accessories needed for set-up. Construction seems good the power is supplied with a micro USB cable which is great since it is easily replaced if needed. An ethernet cable is provided but I did not use it since I set it up with my wireless network. Also included is mounting hardware for the camera. I have the camera sitting on a table but the mounting hardware looks like it will provide plenty of options for camera placement. Connecting to the wireless network was straightforward with the Amcrest View Pro app on Android. Getting started is easy and getting to the point of being able to view the camera on the app is easy. Other than that the app does feel a little clunky. The image looks stretched or squished if viewed in landscape mode or portrait mode. Some settings such as time didn't apply when using the app but does work when using the program on the computer. Overall I am very happy with the camera and it's performance. I hope it sells well and the experience using the app improves.
5,To begin with I'm replacing a much older Amcrest WiFi camera similar to this model.  Here I damaged the QR code and had no interest in researching how to obtain a new one and also preferred an updated unit.  Note it is a good idea to take a picture of the QR code for future reference.The camera was very easy to set up.  Initially I tried to set it up using the Amcrest Smart Home app but this camera is not recognized on this app.  I then reinstalled the Amcrest View Pro app and the camera connected the first time.  I also tried the Amcrest Cloud app.  I assume you get one free account with the cloud app because I tried to add another and received an error.  The camera honestly has everything packed into that you would need.  I installed it in my living room to keep an eye on my dog while the family was out shopping etc.  The pan tilt zoom works flawlessly and came in very handy when trying to find my dog in the house.  He finds unique places to sleep when we are not home and somehow this full grown German Shepherd managed to crawl under our small coffee table.  Another feature that came in handy when watching the dog from afar was the voice.  Calling out to my dog to calm or confuse him (not sure which one) stopped him from barking like crazy at the neighbors.  I also used the listen feature to listen in on him and make sure no alarms etc. were going off in the background and the reason he was acting up.  And finally the night vision works great to keep an eye on the pup at night.  Next on my list to test will be the motion alerts.  I've used this feature with other Amcrest products and it's worked great.  Overall it's a great little camera.  I would love to see the Smart Home App work with this model but everything else works great.
5,Easy to set up and configure using the phone app or the desktop application.  Picture quality is very clear.
5,2nd camera from amcrest no surprise at all. clear lens easy to manage by the app.
5,I use this as an indoor camera to watch my entryways and it is set up through Blue Iris camera software.  This is the third camera I bought and the only that actually connected easily to my network and to the recording software.  Picture quality is excellent.
5,This camera is rock solid.  It was incredibly easy to setup and get going.  The picture quality is quite fantastic and really crisp.  For the price you cannot find much better.  The PTZ works incredibly well along with the two-way audio. You can use this is a personal intercom in your home if you would like to.  Motion detection is spot on with the amcrest app.  The card slot is built right into the back of the camera and is very easily accessible. I give this camera a 5 out of 5 just due to the quality feature set and attention to detail.  Build quality is phenomenal as well. Will buy again !!
5,I have used Ring products Wyze and now Amcrest. I love the image quality in low light and the frame rate is excellent considering my home internet connection is far from the best. The pan and tilt option is beneficial and isn't common in cameras this price. I also like the expandable storage option. I do wish that it included a small memory chip but that is forgivable. If you are looking for a reasonable 4MP surveillance camera with a lot of bang for your buck I recommend this product.
5,I was always hesitant to put a camera in the house for privacy reasons but with an aging dog that has severe separation and thunder anxiety I needed something to check in on him while away from the home. My first camera was from Simplisafe that came free with a full alarm package. It did the job well but it only covered one of the two locations my dog goes when stressed. Enter the Amcrest camera!I placed this camera in the same location the Simplisafe camera had been and began the install. It was so intuitively simple to setup. The software on iOS is absolutely feature packed. It has features I didn't even know I wanted (saturation brightness image quality). The main feature I was most looking forward to was pan/tilt. I can now move the camera as needed to check my pet's hiding spots which makes this camera infinitely more effective for me. The video feed while mobile is totally real-time and smooth and I can turn on audio and even talk through the camera if needed. Best of all when I'm home I can set it to Privacy Mode and the camera tilts straight down.Don't hesitate to pick one (or several) of these up!
4,Auto tracking is not very good. Picture quality is ok but not much better than my 1080 cameras. Seems yo be well built and setup was easy.
4,I was surprised to find a cat5 cable was included; it was a nice touch.The camera was very easy to set up and use. I just configured it through the IP address and then set it up in the Synology Surveillance Station.  The camera worked with Surveillance Station with no issues.  This is my 8th camera in my setup in my NVR.The day and night performance has been good. A zoom function would have been nice. Audio is good.One of the best features I like about this camera compared to a Reolink and Foscam cameras I have is the included mount. I was about to adjust this camera exactly as I wanted.This camera is priced right and will definitely be one of my recommendations for friends.
5,This camera is a great value for the money. I love the ability to remotely pan and zoom the camera. I use it for watching it on my animals while I’m gone so it’s helpful to find them wherever they are hidden. It was easy to set up using the app. No complaints and would recommend!
5,It’s super easy to set up. The app is easy to use. Beware that other Amcrest cameras don’t use the same app. Which is VERY annoying.
5,This IP4M is my second one and works great.  The setup was pretty easy once I resolved an issue with a dead-on-arrival camera.  That gave me the opportunity to test customer service with Amcrest which was excellent.  They sent a replacement unit quickly and it worked with no issues.  They didn't ask any questions; I just told them the original arrived dead and I had followed the directions.  They sent the new one with an RMA and shipping label.The picture quality is great.  I like the webpage interface.  The iPhone app works but isn't the best.  It's not bad really just a little dated looking.I use this with Blue Iris and it integrates great.  One note to get the PTZ controls to work with Blue Iris:  That app uses HTTP to send PTZ controls.  I had to update my router to forward the HTTP port to the camera and that got the PTZ controls from Blue Iris to work.  So make sure you check that if you have issues.Great camera great price great service.
5,Really easy to setup very clear image and no issues.  I was using an ASH21 before this and this is definitely a step up. I did notice that it picks up light changes in fog as a motion trigger but other than. That I'm happy with it.
4,So far seems to be a decent little camera.  There's no lag in live mode which is cool.  It seems a little slow catching up to movement.  We haven't been able to get it to record to the SD card yet but that's per unusual from our experience with another Amcrest product.  It's a little annoying that you can't use just one app for all Amcrest products so our doorbell and this camera are controlled through two different apps.  If they fixed that I'd rate it higher.
5,I purchased this camera to replace a lower resolution Amcrest camera in my home security setup.  I thought that the 1080p looked great but moving from 1080p to 4MP was a huge increase in video quality.  I am using a Synology NAS with Surveillance Station and have never had any issue adding Amcrest cameras and this one was no different.  This specific camera model was not listed in Synology's software but choosing a similar camera model worked and all features are available.  You can also connect using RTSP if needed. I especially appreciate that this camera has a web interface which is my preferred method to set up a new camera but the I actually used the Amcrest android app to initially set up the wifi and that worked well also. I was a little skeptical using wifi instead of ethernet especially with the increased video quality but like everything else it works flawlessly.  In summary this is a great camera for your home security.
5,Luis V is wonderful and patience with me and spent 2hrs to help to fix the problem.  He is the great tech support.  thank you
5,I have had an Amcrest camera in my home for 3 years prior.  The camera just started to go bad.  This new one has an amazingly crisp picture and all the features I loved before.  It's a great way to peek in on my puppies during the day!
5,This is a great little camera. Nice compact size and can be rotated in almost any angle. It can connect to Wi-Fi so you can view it from your phone while you are away. You can also talk to the camera in case you want to communicate with someone at home. I use it to keep an eye on my dog at home and it’s very useful. Picture quality is also very clear. My only complaint is that the app isn’t very intuitive to use but it just takes getting used to. Setup was relatively easy because you can just scan the QR code on the camera for a quick setup.
5,I was not familiar with the brand and my first look didn't impress me but after setting it up and using it for a while I'm truly impressed. The video is excellent and works with several different video viewing software packages. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another or recommend it.
5,A nice camera with good range and picture. I really like the auto track functionality that can follow a person this seemed to work really well. The app is a little complicated and has a lot of options but if your main goal is to be able to see what’s going on in your house it does that part well and fairly simply. Would love to see google assistant support in the future!
5,This is a great camera. The picture is clear and easy to adjust. Recording is easy and well as playback. Once I understood how to use the 2 different apps and online view it was simple and I like checking in on my animals when I'm away. This is a 5 star product.
5,Keep them dry they work anywhere
5,I think this is a great value. The software/app isn't very polished but once you figure out the navigation and settings it works very well. I have no issues with the quality (I'm using it to keep an eye on my aquarium).
4,The app allowed for multiple cameras so I now have my outdoor and indoor camera in one place.While the picture quality of this camera is clear it seems to be out of proportion stretched vertically and I couldn't see how to fix that. The app allows you to pan tilt zoom snapshot listen and talk. very useful. However I could not get the camera to link to the amcrest smart home app so had to get the Amcrest view pro app and move my other camera to that app.Overall a good camera with many features easy to set-up and use. Price is in line with other cameras.I would recommend this for home use.
5,So I was looking for a baby camera but I was not comfortable with the audio only ones and on the other hand video monitors are super expensive!I came across this camera for indoor cameras and I realized I could use this as the baby camera. The setup on app is a little clunky and can be made easier but once I had it setup it has been very convenient. Would recommend parents to try this camera as a baby monitor if you're worried that baby monitors are too expensive.Pros:1. Low Price2. Ability to rotate the camera around3. Good picture and sound quality4. Ability to mount the camera (hardware included)Cons:1. Unpolished app and setup
5,I'd highly recommend this for a hallway or darker area like a garage or storage area. It has amazing night time vision and the follow feature is perfect. I put this in my garage and even though I have other products to allow people into my garage to drop off packages I still like to see who they are. I've already got the doorbell camera from Amcrest and I just enjoy the fact that the product is stable and does exactly what it's supposed to do. If I had any complaints it would be that the zoom feature is a little on the iffy side but you don't REALLY need it with the clarity. I'll continue purchasing Amcrest products to add to my lineup. Overall definitely a 5 Star Product!
4,I got the wifi cam to add to my other security cameras throughout my home including 3 other amcrest cams (different products) and a few other brands.This one Amcrest 4MP UltraHD Indoor WiFi Camera Security IP Camera i am using for my upstairs hallway.  I mostly use my cameras when I am travelling to monitor my pets.  However it also has a view to see my washer/dryer so if there was ever a leak detection from my water sensor i could use the camera to see what is happening.The quality of the image is excellent!  There shouldn't be a camera these days less than 4MP in my opinion.  Images are crisp you can identify people clearly.  Even night time images using infrared are very good and usable.  Control to pan/tilt are very intuitive.The software for this (using ios AND android) is so so.  The default resolution is always with HD turned off.  I have to turn on in live view to see this.  I could find no way to make it open as default as HD.  However the recordings are all in HD so that is a good thing (on a local microsd card).I highly recommend the camera and wouldn't hesitate to buy again.
5,1. Nice quality of the camera as always.2. Good quality of the picture.3. Night mode with on/off the light.4. Dimensions: I thought it's a little smaller4. Waterlogo on the screen and it's not turning off.5. I don't know why but for some cameras I have to use one app for another model - another app. That's not convenient.6. Pretty hard to find out how to activate recording or something like always record mode.7. High sound/talk volume.7. Silent if you turn it by the app.8. Some issues (reset date) if electricity suddenly turns down.9. Power cord should be a few feet longer.
5,This review is coming from the standpoint of a user who has installed and used multiple wifi and wired camera setups in his home over the course of 10+ years. Note that I have cameras recording to an NVR as well as cameras that just record to an installed micro SD card. For the purposes of this review an NVR setup was NOT used and a micro SD card was used.1. Assessment of installation of Camera and Ease of use of the Amcrest ViewPro App:Ease of installation using provided hardware and cables: 5/5Installing SD Card: 5/5Ease of installation comparison to other security cameras: 5/5Installation Instructions: 5/5Amcrest ViewPro Android/iOS app: 5/5Overall the installation is extremely easy. Realize that this camera can be used with an NVR setup as well as many other options. However I chose to use it with the Amcrest ViewPro App (WiFi) as the majority of users will go this route. Regarding the camera functions on the app it is extremely intuitive and very easy to use. The PTZ options are the best and smoothest of any other PTZ camera I have used and the Auto Track feature allows the camera to pan and tilt automatically towards the direction it detects motion. By far the best PTZ Camera and App combination I have ever used!2. Assessment of Camera Performance:Day Performance: 5/5Night/Low Light Performance: 5/5Clarity and Contrast of objects and people: 5/5Clarity and Contrast for graphics and text: 5/5Clarity at close range (5 ft) and long range(15-20 ft): 5/5The camera overall is very clear in extremely low light conditions. I am currently using this in my 2 car garage to keep an eye on things and when it is pitch black in my garage I am able to clearly see everything due to the cameras night vision feature. One thing to note however is that license plates tend to reflect alot of light back and are unreadable in these pitch black conditions. This is not a problem though as anytime there is movement in my garage the garage lights turn on and the camera is quick to adjust out of night vision mode automatically.3. Camera Scoring:Overall Score made up of weights below.Assessment of installation of Camera and Ease of use of the Amcrest ViewPro App (40% of total score)Assessment of Camera Performance (60% of total score)Calculation is as follows:0.40 * (25/25)=0.4000.60* (25/25)=0.6000.400+0.600=1.00=> 100% which yields a score of Excellent per my grading table below.Score of 0-45%- PoorScore of 45-54%- BorderlineScore of 55-69%- OKScore of 70-79%- GoodScore of 80-89%- Very GoodScore of 90-100%- ExcellentOverall this is by far the BEST PTZ camera at this price point I have ever used! You can easily spend double or triple of what this costs and get nowhere near the performance of this camera. For the reasons above I give this camera an overall rating of 5/5 Stars when paired with the Amcrest ViewPro App.
5,I purchased this camera because I've used amcrest in the past and they've been pretty decent quality. I grabbed this one to keep an eye on my pets while I was out of town for vacation and keep an eye on the house when I had somebody come in and check on the pets. Motion sensing works great I don't use the cloud service but I grabbed 256 GB SD card for it and it seems to be working just fine. One thing that annoyed me is that I couldn't use the same software as my other amcrest camera on my Android device. I ended up having to use the amcrest pro app instead of the amcrest smart home app that I use for the other cameras I have.  Both apps work great so it's not a huge issue it's just annoying that now I have two apps to see cameras from the same company. Haven't tried to log in from a computer yet but it says that it works with same computer software as my other camera which doesn't make sense why the Android app wouldn't be compatible but who knows?  Night vision is actually really decent switches over quickly when lights turn off and on. I'd say this is probably better than the other amcrest cameras I've used in the past as far as night vision. The app allows you to set schedules something I would need but might be useful for quite a few people using it for a business or something. All around very solid camera also came with a nice mounting system. One of their small annoyance was that I actually had to plug it in with an ethernet cord to get a program to my Wi-Fi for some reason over the wi-fi system at the location it's in has always had issues so it could be a problem with the router instead of the camera.
5,Great product!
3,Setup was similar to other models. For some reason my unit fell off the network after 2 weeks of working well. Awaiting replacement.Otherwise the firmware update process did not work and the time stamp would not update so I was stuck in 2000. Not sure if this is related to this faulty unit or if it was a firmware issue.Detection tracking and night vision worked well. Connected to Synology NAS.
4,The camera comes with great packaging including an ethernet cable and a power cable. I downloaded the Amcrest View Pro app and set up the camera using the on screen instructions. Overall my experience with the app was mediocre. The UI appeared to be slightly outdated however everything worked as advertised. When reviewing footage from the camera I was blown away by the 4MP quality. Additionally the night vision (IR) performance was above average. Overall I would definitely recommend this camera as the image quality is amazing.Pros- Image quality- Night vision (above average)- Privacy mode to turn off (the camera angle changes to point down)Cons- App UI (could be improved)- Auto tracking (however this is an issue with many indoor wifi cameras)
4,I was anticipating setup to be pretty easy and straightforward but it took me longer than expected.  I initially downloaded the wrong Armcrest apps (this is on me not Armcrest – make sure that you download the Armcrest Cloud app).I thought because it had a QR code for pairing that it would be quick and easy to setup but it took me almost 20 minutes.  First off you need ethernet for initial setup.  Then when trying to connect to the camera it took several attempts before it would actually connect.Once connected I felt that the interface was a bit clunky.  Compared to the Wyze apps things were just a little less intuitive.  Also you need to pay in order to view anything recorded.Image quality however was very clear – much clearer than the Wyze cameras that I have.  Also pan and tilt was relatively quiet (compared to Wyze pan).There is a couple second lag with video but nothing horrible and to be expected.The camera is powered through micro-USB – would have been nice if it could have been USB C but not a huge deal.I tried to connect the camera to our Alexa Shows but was not able to get it to work.  The skill connects and I can see the camera in the Alexa app but when I ask a show to display the camera I get an error messageOverall I think this is a very solid option for the price.
5,This is my second Amcrest camera. I’ve had one for 3-4 years in our house in FL and it’s been very reliable. So I decided to add a camera in our main home in CT. I need to spend more time tinkering with the new one since it has an SD card and the older one doesn’t. But so far I am happy with it.
1,I wanted to like this product. But overall it seems that someone at Amcrest just threw few parts together and called it a product and by comments on the App Store could care less what users say. The product functionality/usability has not changed much since it's inceptions.Dubbed as a WiFi camera you actually get a short Cat5 cable you are advised to use and connect to your router to setup it up. There's a search option too in the App but based on the "success" I had with the wired connection (see below) I had very low expectation for that feature.Why the waste? When I can get my Alexa's devices connected to my network without such archaic contraption this was a warning for things to come.The camera only works in the 2.4GHz range there's no 5GHz (Why?) and even with direct connection to my router it took several tries to get the ViewPro App to connect to the camera. Ugh.Everything runs and controlled by the app. It's over 4 yrs old and last updated 5 months ago. It has 1.8K reviews with a combined ratings of 2.8 out of 5.Overall if all you want to go it tap into the feed and maybe move it you'll be fine.However if you are looking to use any of the other features it presume to offer you are in for a disappointment:- The sensitivity area triggers even if the movement it outside.- The tracking feature tracks imaginary objects when triggers.- The live feed notification on movement is blank. You'll get the push notification but that's it.- It is aware of the time of day and has night vision feature but it would not turn it On in complete darkness.Overall mediocre performance.
5,This camera is made of a gloss plastic. This is totally an indoor camera and cómannos be used in adverse conditions. Compared to the Amcrest outdoor dome cameras this has good picture quality and ptz features. I would have liked to see PoE power. The power plug is mini usb further indicating the camera is for home use and not commercial. The camera does come with an adjustable wall mount which is useful. All in all a good little camera that is easy to set up and has good quality picture and sound.
5,This camera is one of the best I have tried so far. The picture quality is very good it has great night vision and I like the fact that it can be used over the wifi and via ethernet. It has motion detection can operate with or without a micro SD card. It has cloud capability but I don't use it it is a paid subscription. It has full 360° motion. It comes with a wall bracket and all the needed wires like power and ethernet and the power adapter. In general works great the app is very responsive and easy to use. I definitely recommend it.
5,I bought this Amcrest camera with the hopes of accessing the RTSP stream and adding it to Apple HomeKit (most cameras don’t work natively in HomeKit) and it was super easy to access and integrate. *disclaimer: I run this on my own home server and does not work out of the box. Do not buy this camera expecting it to work with HomeKit *The app is very straightforward and it’s easy to control. The motion tracking is great…however I’m using it at a window inside looking out so the reflections at night can be a problem. I ended up turning that off. Motion detection on the other hand is good…but can be a little behind at times. This hasn’t caused me any issue though. There are a lot of little settings you can change though so it’s great.2-way audio is fantastic with only a slight delay and camera quality is reallyyyyyyy good. Good colors and pixel density. Way better than Wyze.Setup process was a little tedious…took me many different tries over both Wifi and Ethernet but eventually got it (over Wifi I believe).Overall this camera is solid especially for the price. I may be buying another.
5,To start off the camera was very easy to setup and use. I found the app easily added device scanned the QR code and connected to wifi. It took maybe 2 minutes including unpackaging and plugging it in. I was surprised to see a mini-USB for the charging port not exactly a bad thing since I have like 10 cables to use but everything is going the way of USB-C so I hope they will upgrade that in the next iteration. Nice shade of white simple and modern enough. Operates easily and smoothly. Listen and talk features are very useful and work well. Zoom pan and swivel are all very responsive to touch on the app with little delay. You can even make longer strokes to move the camera farther or use little strokes to move only slightly. This is helpful when trying to line up the perfect angle. Very long power cord. Also came with fixtures to affix it to a wall/ceiling but I just have it on a side table. My only negative note is that the box was damaged it looks like someone spilled coffee on one corner. It is discolored about 2 inches from the corner on the 3 faces. Nothing inside was damaged so I kept it.
4,I've been using this camera for a few days and all in all it seems solid. We have 3 of the UltraHD cameras and recently purchased this one. As far as I can tell they function in essentially the same manner except that this camera has slightly lower resolution and does not support a memory card.My only complaint about this camera is the same complaint that I have about the other Amcrest cameras we've purchased. They seem to be finicky when setting up. My wife can almost never get them setup using her Android phone. Generally I succeed. However with this camera for example it took me several tries. I do not know what the cause is and it's not the worst thing in the world but it is annoying.As I said though it is all in all a good camera. I would recommend it.
5,Luis V spend an incredible amount of time with me today! I had some older cameras that I needed to connect to my Fios network and he helped me connect them all! Super patient and helpful! A+++
5,After testing the camera for 2 weeks I am thoroughly pleased with this camera.  For reference the IPM-1041 4 megapixel camera was used to replace an older IPM2M-841 1080p camera.  For the price this is a lot of camera for the money.  The camera includes pan tilt and zoom and I will say the responsiveness is better than the older IPM2M-841.  The picture quality is certainly a step up from the 2 megapixel 1080p capabilities of the 841.  With a 4MP sensor the quality and resolution of the video is great and allow you to view at longer range than with the older 841 camera due to its limited and older sensor.  Brightness and color rendering are excellent with this newer camera.I did test the auto-tracking feature which uses AI-based human detection to follow a person in the range of the camera and while it was amazingly efficient and able to track and pan/tilt as a person moved around within the field of view I just don’t know how much I would use this feature in my current setup.Setup of this camera was very simple using the app to add it to my existing network of cameras.  I use SD storage cards for recording my camera footage and I will say that it took some effort to find the SD slot on this camera.  Older style cameras had the SD slot on the back panel where the power and networking cable plugs are located but not on this camera.  Additionally the quick start guide and the online manual that I looked at did not identify where the SD card should go.  Only after searching online was I able to find an image on the Amazon website that showed where the SD slot can be found.  I think this would be a nice detail to add to the quick start guide and user manual.Again for the price point and number of standard features I would highly recommend this camera for those looking for a security camera for indoor applications in medium to larger size rooms.
5,I have four Amcrest cameras to monitor my apartment and my pets when I am out of town. Amcrest camera is light reliable and easy to set up. I can access all cameras remotely. In addition with sound and built-in mic I can talk to my pets anywhere. The night mode makes me easy to find where my pets are in the night. Really like them!!!!  These cameras make me feel good when I stay in a hotel for business trip!!!!!
5,It does not work wifi connection directly. It work with a lan cable. My mobile is iPhone (i dont know it is related just fyi). you should prepare a lan cable to setup wifi for this camera.
4,Feedback:Pros: Love the auto tracking! Definitely scares unwanted visitors. Notification has 1-2s delay which is not bad at all. Love that I can connect it to my alexa echo show.Cons: Can't move pan or zoom in on amcrest cloud or on the echo show. Amcrest View Pro doesn't give a clear screen but the Amcrest Cloud gives a clear screen. Since the cloud gives a clear view it'd be better to be able to use the different function and keys on the cloud instead of the View Pro. The View Pro was grainy for me. Wish I don't have to download the amcrest cloud to use it on my echo show. Would be better to use only 1 app instead of 2.
5,Now that I am returning to the office full time I wanted to get a camera to monitor my dog while I was at work. I had gotten another brand on here and while it was okay there was one glaring issue - the camera was fixed and my Queen would move around all day!With this camera I am able to track the Queen throughout the living room and ensure that she is okay and doing well! I love the ease of set up and the use of the app super easy intuitive and fool proof! Needless to say this is one of the better purchases I have EVER made on Amazon.Super happy!
4,Pros:The initial setup of getting the camera unboxed setup and connected to the Amcrest View Pro App was simple and quick. I had the video feed going in less than 10 minutes.The pan and tilt feature is good and really responsiveThe video and picture quality is goodGood auto-tracking featureCons:The live viewing experience can be laggy even with solid connections on both endsI had many issues with the playback from my microSD card and it took me a lot of time to figure out the issue. I could see the camera was recording to the SD card because the storage was going down but i couldn't view the footage. I resolved the issue by removing the card and reformatting on my computer. There should be a reformatting option from the app. It does work well now that it's setup correctly.I couldnt get the correct timezone to sync from the app. It would throw an error. I had to sync from amcrest ip config desktop app
5,I am a long time Amcrest cameras user and really happy with their device quality and customer service. Since I use Amcrest cameras for my outside of the house I might as well try the indoor camera too. I have been using Blink and Wyze camera indoor and pretty happy with it. So here goes my comparison between Amcrest and Wyze Pan Tilt.Pros-Amcrest camera is definitely looks big looking at the pics but to my surprise the actual camera is about same size as wyze cam pan.-Set up is easy since I already have amcrest view pro app. I wish I can use this in Amcrest smart home app but it is what it is. It works just fine.-The set up was quick and easy. This is what amcrest is great at.-The camera immediately connected and worked just fine with my wifi. No need to do any troubleshooting.Cons-The camera likes to use 2.4ghz instead of 5ghz. With wyze cameras 2.4ghz is fine but for some reasons amcrest pan tilt is really slow on my 2.4ghz wifi and lose connection intermittently.-The setting for setting up SD storage recording was buried in the setting. I was confused for a moment until I found out I have to enable each day with schedule to record non stop instead of motion only.-Using the amcrest view pro which is heavily based on NVR set up fiddling with settings are a bit everywhere. I was used to the app and found a bit difficult but overall it is manageable.-I cannot set up the waypoints through the app. I have to do it through web interface and it's very hard to do.-I would love it if it has some kind of wide dynamic range setting. Sometimes with harsh light the color can be washed out.Set up- I decided to connect the camera with cat5 wire instead of wifi. Now the camera is absolutely amazing at view response time. All the pan tilt track commands work flawlessly with no delay of whatsoever. This set up blow the wyze cam out of water.-the motor on the amcrest is really really smooth. I cannot hear it when it's tracking the motion during pan/tilt. With wyze it is loud. The controls are quick and intuitive.-The picture quality is fantastic! I can zoom in and still see all the details.Overall it is a great camera. I just wish the app is as good as wyze. The hardware is great. I would recommend this camera to anyone who's looking for a security camera that can cover wide area with great tracking capability.
1,The mobile app is just horrible. The instructions are terrible or nonexistent and the one I got won’t connect to my WiFi and only works if hooked to a lan.  Honestly it’s the worst app ever.  Buy any other brand of camera like this just so you don’t have to deal with this app
5,PROSAffordable.Excellent 1080p image quality.Pan tilt and zoom functionality.Onboard and cloud storage.CONSConvoluted configuration procedure.No integration with other connected devices.Pricey cloud service.The Amcrest ProHD is a relatively affordable home surveillance camera that delivers sharp image quality and offers motorized pan and tilt functionality but configuring some settings is complicated.I have been looking for an indoor security camera for some time and this one did not disappoint at all. The app is a nice feature of this camera really simple to use and set up and the micro SD card gives you a free record and playback opportunity.The picture quality is superb even in the night vision mode. Also motion detection works very well and controlling them via your mobile phone is easy. The ability to move the camera left/right and up/down via your phone is very useful.
5,This is an awesome budget indoor camera. Performs a full 360 horizontal rotation with close to 180 vertical pivoting. It can only go so far down so I plan on installing it upside down with the included mount for better visibility underneath the camera. Night vision comes on quick when needed and motion detection does well as long as you're not running past it and trying to juke it. Haha. So for the purpose of checking in on my dog while I'm out it does well in tracking him. For a 4 MP camera the picture quality is as expected. The Armcrest app is nicely designed and the setup process to link the camera to the app was a breeze. Overall this was a great buy and I will be looking into Armcrest's other products because of it.
5,This little camera does everything we need it to do. It captures great video in low light along with sound and records continuously or when motion is detected or both at the same time. You can record through an SD card in the camera or through the Amcrest Surveillance Pro software via ethernet or wi-fi.We love this little camera! We can view the "live" or "recorded events" remotely. Comes in handy when the alarm goes off and we can "get eyes" on the inside to see what we're getting ourselves into. We haven't run into any issues or problems with this camera.I've tried other cameras and "big name brand" systems but Amcrest always seems to work. I love how easy it is to "plug and play" set it up through my computer or smartphone and review footage whenever we need it. I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking to make a purchase. Cost effective great quality and reliable.
4,Review: I recently replaced one of my indoor Amcrest cameras (bought in 2017) with this - the same model just four years newer. It uses the same old Amcrest View Pro App - I wish it would use the new Amcrest Smart Home app as my other new Amcrest camera. Install I thought would be as straightforward as the others and it was except for one hitch. Maybe this was mentioned in the instructions but having installed dozens of IP cams up to now I didn't look at them. The hitch was that I couldn't input the new admin password during setup I needed to leave the fields as default admin/admin even though I had the option to change. I kept trying to change the admin/admin to my own UN and PW and the camera would keep failing. Once I left it as default it did install and then I could go in and change the pw after that. So - heads up for that. Other than that it works the same as my other Amcrest cameras with a bit of an outdated interface but overall everything I need there. The pan and tilt works to see most of my living room the auto-track works very well if a bit shaky during movement. The recording works and I can communicate to and from this camera with my family in the living room. 10/10 for value and reliability 8/10 for app - much like most of us at work it could be better but it does the job as it is =p
5,HiVery good camera with an incredible quality in HD mode.Easy to setup and easy to use.The app on iPhone is pretty useful.A good camera !
5,My husband is getting very forgetful and these are very helpful for me to check on him if I have to leave for a while.  Also very helpful support by Dale.
