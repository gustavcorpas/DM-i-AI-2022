5,I have a pretty tight working area but desperately needed a monitor instead of using my iPad as my second screen. This monitor is the ideal size for my desk and makes it so much easier to edit and create my graphics  without straining my eyes. I should have purchased this months ago.
4,Not as sturdy as one I had received earlier and this one cost more.
4,It was worth for $80 that I paid for it. there are better options for the original price. the stand is very poorly designed. it is angled downwards so you have to put something underneath to prop it up for the screen to face you properly. it is also very light so if you want to wall mount it you don't have to worry about bringing the wall down hahaOverall it is OK.
5,otra oferta que encontramos y supera con creces la calidad al precio que pagamoscalidad nitidez excelentes
5,Great size was very easy to put together.
5,I use mine as a second monitor for work and it is the perfect size. Easy to connect.
5,Easy to set up..used for home security
5,My son chose the screen for his first self built computer. Good price the pictures looks clear it’s worth to buy!
5,Working remotely I needed an additional monitor to hook up to my laptop.  The high quality of this monitor makes it very easy to do my work and to have a clear image of what I'm working on.This is my 2nd LG monitor; the old Dell monitor work had provided me wasn't doing the trickNow I have 2 clear crisp LG monitors.
3,Your average monitor.  Nothing to write home about.Assembled easily and was up and running in no time.Not the greatest picture quality or contrast ratio but its ideal for a POS environment which is what it was purchased for.  Definitely not for photo editing or gaming.
5,Bought this for working at home.  Very light and screen is very good.  Don’t know about gaming as it’s strictly for work.
3,Power saving good.
5,This LG monitor exceeded my expectations. Color rendition is nice and the large screen makes doing graphics and CAD a snap.  I debated going with a 4K monitor but this monitor has the screen resolution and sharpness I needed.  It works.
1,This screen does not easily turn off.  When u try to turn off it goes to other functions that are not understandable. Would not buy this agan!  No instructions to help
5,Got this as a second monitor at work. Very happy with it. I hooked it up through HDMI. I had to download drivers after that it worked great. I really like the sharp picture. I recommend this monitor. also It is great price.
5,Great product
5,Needed this while staying with relatives to work remotely. Good basic monitor that did what it needed to do.
