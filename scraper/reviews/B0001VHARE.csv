5,Installed these on our boat and so far they are excellent!
5,outstanding bright sound for under $100!!  Do not listen to negative posts.  I would consider myself an audiophile and these speakers truly exceed my expectations!
5,After browsing outdoor speakers for over a year I took a stab at the Yamaha set. Reading some of the reviews I was really worried they would be lacking in bass. But I just couldn’t find 6” or bigger speakers for under 150.I’m doing this on a light budget and the speakers have to be mounted on my shed so I really couldn’t do a large speaker. Turns out these 5” Yamahas are fairly small so they are the perfect size and don’t look goofy on the shed.I paired them with a Fosi 100*2 BT20AS baby amp and I’m literally blown away how great they sound. For under 200 I have a fantastic backyard sound system. I took an old Echo Dot and fed the audio into the Fosi and I can control the music with Alexa.If you’re a reasonable human you’ll understand these speakers are not going to sound like a night club. But I’ve heard some nicer and much more expensive outdoor speakers and I could not justify spending that kind of money after hearing these.To reach his own I guess.
5,Had these installed on the outdoor patio at the old house. Moved to a new place and had to get another pair for the deck. Great boom for the buck. Would and have purchase again.
5,Are they serious? Don't believe any of the less than 5 star reviews you read on these speakers. For the money alone they're an incredible value. Had these been $150 speakers they'd still easily justify a 5 star review. Add to that the fact that the overall sound is very clean clear & defined. Well balanced. And very adequate output level for what these speakers were intended for.I've been buying high end audio gear for almost 30 years - these speakers sound amazing!! And the fact that they can stay outside 8 months of the year without any worries makes them even more incredible. I live in the northeast - who sits outside on their deck in Nov Dec Jan Feb anyway??? In other words as others have mentioned don't leave these out in the extremes of winter.Here's some tips for better sound -*Have the speakers at least 8 to 10 ft apart preferably against a wall with the speakers aimed slightly inward towards your seating area.*Some have mentioned that these speakers don't have good bass response. If at all possible mount the speakers so the back is facing a wall. This will make a huge difference in sound reinforcement. A cornered wall even better. I didn't mount the speakers at all - I simply have them against the back wall of my house laying directly on the surface of my deck - which also helps the bass. The more direct contact any speaker can have with a floor will greatly enhance the bass sound.*Don't cheap out on your speaker cable!! Anytime you're considering an outdoor speaker arrangement you have to consider pretty long runs of speaker cable. Mine is 100 ft (50 ft per speaker). Anytime you're talking about cable lengths of that kind of magnitude you HAVE to get high quality cable. Otherwise you're probably losing half your power output along the long runs of cable. This is also the reason the speakers are rated at 6 ohms instead of 8 ohms (8 is pretty much the standard for most indoor speakers )  The lower ohms means lower resistance. This means the speakers will "pull" more power from your amp to compensate for the longer cable runs. Very smart on Yamaha's part. Shows they know what they're doing.For the most part you just really need to be realistic about what you're expecting to get from a $60 pair of 3 pound bookshelf sized speakers. Use common sense. These are not built to rattle your walls. These are not PA speakers that are going to cover 2 acres of ground with wall to wall "live concert" level sound. They're for sitting on your deck with a few friends and listening to conversational level music. If someone wants more pounding bass for outside I'm pretty sure someone makes an outdoor subwoofer. I've actually got 1 acre of property behind me and I can hear these quite well at the back end of my propoerty if I crank them up.
5,Great sound for the price point bigger speakers then I expected. Worth the purchase!
4,This speaker is good value.  It won't blow your mind but it's perfectly adequate for outdoor use where utmost audio quality isn't critical.  Mounts fairly easily and blends in to an eave corner pretty well.  I have a pair of the larger versions that are still going strong after about 10 years outside FWIW.  Recommend.
3,These look good very easy to set up and sounded great….while they lasted.  It’s been two Sunmers and one has completely stopped working.  I live in cold weather and even brought them inside during winter months for storing.  Typically I’ve had great luck with Yamaha speakers but a bit disappointed given these only had two summers of use.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This product has amazing sound quality! Easy to install
5,Theses produce great sound for there size
5,The install wasn’t super easy but they look and sound amazing. These replaced older and larger speakers for a fraction of the cost - and far outperform them. They are driven by (frankly) a very low quality stereo that I had every intention of replacing. That said given how they sound I’m keeping my old stereo. I have two in my kitchen and above 1/3 volume is simply too much. The other two are outside and power my pool area (roughly 50’x75’ area) with absolutely no problem. No these are absolutely not audiophile quality - but that’s not why I bought them. They are great backyard party speakers that don’t distort until they are more than 3/4 up and the reality is less than 1/2 way up is more than sufficient for my space. Again I’m certain the limiter is my stereo and not these speakers - I love these and they look great.
5,I've now purchased 3 sets of these speakers.  I bought the first set a few months ago because I wanted inexpensive waterproof speakers to get some music to our outdoor pool area.  These speakers had good reviews and for the price I figured I couldn't go wrong.  I was right.  They have excellent sound and look great mounted to the side of the deck.  The speakers have both great bass and treble. The sound quality stays clean even when pushed hard or at least loud enough that it would annoy the neighbors.I was so impressed with these I bought a second set for my sister and brother in law as a gift.  They were looking for a good sounding outdoor speaker as well and I knew they'd like these.  The speakers have a 5 star review from them too.So last week I ordered a third pair to install in my boat.  I knew the speakers sounded great and since they are waterproof it was an easy decision to get these yet again. I have an inboard tournament ski boat with the engine at the center of the boat.  I thought the bass would get muffled by the sound of the engine and I'd either need a second set of speakers or a sub to get the sound I was after.  I'm happy to say that after installing them (hooked to a Jensen MSR-2007 from Amazon also) they sound so good and have so much bass even loud that I won't need a sub or second set.These are by far the best pair of outdoor speakers for under $60 you will ever buy hands down.  I'm sold on these for good!
5,So I have been in the market for some outdoor speakers for awhile now. I got sick and tired of an extension cord and a boombox for my patio area.Based on the reviews I decided on these. The "rock" speakers based on reviews do not sound as good.Let me just say these speakers are great. My patio is 20ft away from my house (where they are mounted) and the sound is excellent. My fire pit is 55ft away from the speakers and if you turn them up enough the sound is still good. These speakers can get pretty loud for the small size they are. Which I was kinda surprised on I thought the sound would be so horrible at 55ft away by my fire pit - but oh no its great. Bass isn't the best but what do you expect for a 5 1/2 inch speaker? It is more the suitable for me. The sound is great and clear especially for an outdoor setting. I highly recommend mounting these against your house - as it improves sound - waves bounce of the house towards your listening area.Overall I am very satisfied with them. I got them for $55 - from Amazon warehouse deals - it was an open-boxed item - someone just opened the box and returned them - everything was still sealed in plastic wrap so I know the speakers were never used. What a great deal let me say! $55 for these speakers was a grab!I highly recommend these to anyone looking to spice up an outdoor area. It brings great entertainment to your patio / deck etc. I haven't really cranked them up yet as neighbors are pretty close but once I have a party these things will be heard all over the yard.
5,A few weeks after installing these on my back porch my house got hit by a tornado.  My back porch was literally in bits and pieces.  It was a wood framed covered porch.  Half the porch was in shambles behind my house and the other half was two houses down in my neighbors front yard.  One of these speakers was under a pile of debris in my yard and the other was with the other half of the porch two houses down laying in my neighbors front yard along with porch debris.Instead of tossing the speakers in the trash I decided to toss them in the shed (which had moved but was still standing) just in case they still worked.Fast forward three months and my house is pretty much repaired with a new porch.  Tonight I decided to hook the speakers up to see if they somehow managed to survive a tornado.  The brackets were still attached and only one of the side screw knobs was broken off but could still tighten since only the actual screw was still in place.  The grills were slightly dented and they both have lots of scuffs.Anyway I plugged them in cranked up Spotify and hit power on the receiver.... and booming crisp sound pumped out of both speakers sounding just as awesome as the day I bought them.I'm normally pretty lazy when it comes to posting reviews but I felt like this was worthy of a quick post. If durability is your concern then these speakers should certainly get some consideration.  I'm also impressed with the sound quality though I admit I am no expert and have not owned other outdoor speakers to compare them to.
5,Great for patio.  Understand that these are not going to rock your world but for what they are they sound great. Not much bass but the frequency response doesn’t advertise that it would deliver much but for background music or sporting events for the patio they are great.
5,Mounted these on our sunroom facing our pool and hot tub about year ago.Took about an hour to install and wire. Connected them to a Keiid compact receiver and I have to say the sound is superb! Left them out all winter and they survived a tough Cleveland winter without a  problem. Sound and look just as good as last year. Going to buy a second set of speakers for the other side of the sunroom facing our patio and fire pit. Would highly recommend this set up to anyone without second thoughts.
5,We bought 4 of these for our patio surround sound. They are hard-wired (not Bluetooth) and need to be connected to an AV Receiver (we connected them to an Onkyo - TX 7.2-Ch. Home Theater Receiver). They took some work to install and hook-up correctly but it was worth the effort. All four of ours are covered by the patio roof so they have minimal rain and sun exposure.We sit outdoors on our patio here in Phoenix 9+ months of the year and these have helped make our covered patio (15'x25') an outdoor living room. We connected two right under our outdoor TV and then 2 more behind and above. The receiver allows you to set an appropriate coordinated sound level and true surround sound. Great for watching shows during dinner or listening to music while grilling or in the pool.
5,I am very happy with these speakers. I installed them about a month ago and have used them every weekend. They put out an impressive amount of volume for their size. The highs are clean and clear even at volume and the lows are acceptable for a speaker of this size. No speaker this size is going to pump out bass (especially in an outdoor setting) but they do put out a clean low frequency sound. They lows do not have that plastic sound that you hear out of cheaper speakers and they have never sounded overdriven or distorted. I contemplated buying a more expensive Yamaha set but am glad I didn't as I can't find fault with these speakers.
5,These Yamaha speakers are worth it for the price. They are environmental speakers. Their build quality is great. I can feel they could last for 10 years in the weather we have in Stockton.Mounting system is great. Brass nuts excellent quality plastic and solid construction. All I'm in love and I highly recommend them.Make sure your amplifier has enough power to produce bass you need. I have started recommending these speakers to my friends as well.
4,For around $70 for a pair of outdoor speakers for the patio how can you go wrong?I have a wide variety of yamaha speakers and while these are probably my worst sounding of the bunch they are only the only ones that would work in my outdoor lanai area so I take the sound with a grain of salt. For the money and what they are used for I am very happy with them. I can easily angle them to put a variety of directions the set up was very easy and combined with a volume control switch they do a great job of providing tunes on my patio.If you need outdoor speakers these are a good choice. Granted I don't have them in a totally weather exposed area where they would get direct rain or anything so I can't speak to that but in the humid outdoor of a florida lanai they have held up well.I would NOT use these indoor or anywhere that you can safely put 'indoor' rated speakers because the sound for these would pale in comparison to true indoor speakers but for the outdoors these work great.I would buy again
3,Yamaha's customer service needs to take a lesson from Amazon. I was on hold for over an hour and their Chat relay that 714.522.9105 mentions is nonexistent. As mentioned before the speaker started to malfunction with this low volume tinny sound. The other speaker works fine (fingers crossed) I'm on hold for a RA number and send it from Orlando fl. to California for repair or replacement. Part 2 of this situation to follow. Part 2. The 1 hour and 34 minutes of being on hold was worth it. Yamaha's customer service sent me an email to upload my receipt to and in about an hour and a half I was approved for replacement speakers and was not required to return the broken speaker unless I needed Yamaha to dispose of it. I was given an order number for my replacement speakers that were sent from California to Florida and arrived 7 days from the day I filed my grievance. The speakers sound great! Just ask my neighbors ; ) Thanks Yamaha !!
5,I bought two pair of these for indoor use. Love the overall design and look. These speakers come with a mounting system or can sit on a shelf.  I am not disappointed with the sound quality.
5,I bought two sets of these and mounted them on the outside wall of my house out on my deck. As far as the sound quality goes I’d say it’s decent. I’m not trying to put on a concert so the volume is usually kept to a low level. I definitely wouldn’t call the music crisp and clear but that could be my settings. As far as bang for the buck I’d buy them again. The one thing I didn’t like was the mounting. I wish it had more flexibility. I wanted to mount them horizontally tucked high up in the eaves at a downward angle but that’s not an option with these. The strange part was that they came with a nut that’s part of a mounting system that doesn’t come with the speakers. When I searched for that mounting system I couldn’t find it anywhere.
4,These speakers are at a great price almost too good of a price (however I am angry because at crutchfield they are currently cheaper!)Please pay attention these speakers are not 100% outdoor proof weather proof speakers. The insurrections included during unpackaging specifically state that they are FOR USE UNDER A MOUNTED OVERHAND FOR PROTECTION FROM DIRECT WEATHER ELEMENTS.I did not know this upon purchasing and am using these on my open exposed no overhang pool deck railing. I have for the time being placed  several  layers of plastic bags over each speaker to keep direct rain off of them and to prevent the speaker from filling with water. It's been a few weeks and a very wet spring in Saint Louis and they still have decent sound quality with no rain damage YET.I purchased the dirt cheap extended warranty just in case and I plan on bringing these speakers inside after the pool season is over.I plan to update the review at the end of the summer pool season.
5,Purchase for our camp up North. So far they rock
4,These are wonderfully priced and sounded great.  I'm not trying to re-play Woodstock in my yard just enjoy some music.  For that they do just fine.  I didn't sense the lack of bass others have said bothered them.Of particular note is the ease of installation.  These come with a single large threaded fastener that looks like it would fit a third-party bracket.  I didn't use it (not having the bracket) but the brackets that these come with were easy to install.  The safety cable is small and quite useful while hanging these.  Hang the bracket with two wood screws mount the safety cable (which is really quite discreet) with the included clip dangle the speaker by the safety cable while making the speaker connections mount the speaker and then crank up the volume.It didn't make five stars because a.) at some point it's just a speaker and b.) I think they're just a tad funny looking - a little rounder on the front face than you can see in the pictures.All in all recommended as a great value.
4,I ordered these speakers just under a week ago and they had already arrived at more door last night. Overall packaging was just as new with all parts manuals and packaging in tact. They were beyond simple to mount to a wall as I did in my garage last night. All of the required mounting brackets made ease of that job. The only thing I did was run down to the local hardware store to pick-up some drywall anchors to make it easier on myself. This also allowed me to place the speakers where I wanted instead of looking for studs. Overall the sound is what you would expect from a set of $60 speakers. I have them mounted as I said in my garage which has roughly 13 foot ceilings and is a 2 1/2 car. The sound fills the space nicely without any need to crank them up. Although I did of course turn them way up and the handled that well (no crackling or distortion) Again overall great speakers @ a great price I would recommend them to anyone needing an indoor outdoor speaker solution. (I'm already thinking about where I can mount another set!)
5,Just finished our second pool season with these.  I built a small enclosure to keep direct rain off of them and put them at near pool level.  Perfect performance so far.  Recommended.
5,We mounted these speakers outside under the eaves of our house and so far have been impressed in their sound quality and ability to project sound.  We have not turned on the volume on our tuner/receiver to the point where the speakers have distortion because the volume is so loud that we don't try to turn it up louder.If you're looking for inexpensive speakers for outdoor use (in heavy rain storms these probably get direct exposure to rain but for the most part they stay dry) then these are a good choice.
4,EDIT one year later - Amazon finally fixed the description to reflect the correct woofer size - 5" versus what was originally described at 6.5"They have been in bathroom for almost a year with constant steam and have had zero issues. Pricing seems to have risen by 15 dollars since purchased but for 85 bucks a pair including shipping still a good value.By the way Cerwin Vega's XLS 6 (CLS is discontinued) is a true 6.5" woofer with a much meatier wooden enclosure but it's not for outdoor/weather use but still a good speaker.Old review....The woofer is a 5.25" NOT 6.5" - large difference. The price of these speakers are very good (~$70 USD free shipping) BUT only if they had 6.5" woofers. At 5.25" they are overpriced have too small of a driver/magnet and feel cheap. Eh for the price you get what you pay for but I use them in my bathroom. As for home theatre forget it! Cerwin Vega! CLS-6 cost ~200 for a pair but they are HEAVY made of wood and have a much better brand name behind them. If you really want to go crazy try EAW.
4,I have been using what I thought were a good set of out door speakers (Wolverine  VC24-SP). Well these Yamaha NS-AW150W are far better I can hear them 50 ft. away and still not at full volume. I am also using the Yamaha WXA-50 MusicCast for my music playback. all well worth the money I paid.
5,I bought these 4 years ago for our porch.  Took me a year to find the time to run the wires but I've had them up for a few years now and just now got around to writing a review.  For the money these things have outstanding sound.  I'm not an audiophile but I'm picky about my 7.1 surround sound and hearing the little sounds you dont really notice otherwise.  These speakers have that kind of range.  The bass is good.  They have crisp sound.  There is a noticeable improvement when I walk from my inside speakers to the outside and hear the same song in these speakers.  I'd buy them again in a second.  If I gave expensive gifts I'd hand these out to all my friends.
5,I bought these speakers to mount above my deck.  I already had the wires run during the construction of the home and installing them was very much like putting in curtain rods + attaching a couple of wires (basic stuff).  Screw them in attach the wires (simple clamps) and away you go.  I attached them to a standard stereo/radio in my house with a couple of 99 cent radio shack switches so that I could control whether I played the sound inside outside or both.  The sound quality is great but of course it's reliant on the stereo pushing the sound.  They were easily much higher quality than what my stereo could put out but the price of the pair was too good not to pass up.  If I upgrade my stereo anytime soon I know that the speakers will be able to keep up with it no problem.  The fact that they are white is awesome since all of the trim on my house is white vinyl.  Black just would not look right but the white speakers blend right in.I spent many afternoons on the deck with the radio or a CD playing in the background with a corona in hand.  Truly good memories and the speakers helped set the atmosphere surrounding those memories.
4,We bought these as friends of ours was very happy with their pair used at their home.  They are great speakers for a medium sized patio.  I wish the base would resonate more than they do but they do the jab and are great for providing background ambience.
4,I went up to the Yamaha's from the low end outdoor speakers given some of the feedback on the lower end speakers.  Basically it is about a $10/speaker premium that I think is worth it.These Yamaha's don't disappoint.Pro's:- Speaker teather that connects the speaker to the mount while you deal with wiring and final mount.  Wiring is easier and you can't drop your brand new speakers when installing.- Build quality robust plastic and brass mounts.  Appears will do well outdoors.  Mine are under eaves so I expect long life.- Sound quality is good mind you these are outdoors so my expectations were low but the sound is good thus far- Bookshelf or wall mounts capable.- Good value for the money.Con's:- wall mount allows for adjustment up/down or left/right depending on which way you mount the bracket.  I would have been nice to have both. I had to choose which would be most useful though I could have used both.  This is typical so it is a con shared by most speakers
5,We have a couple of pairs of these now. Live them. Best value you're going to find in outdoor speakers.
5,Once I found a decent small amp to power these they have performed perfectly.  I live in the Southeast and despite all the rain and humidity so far these are showing no sign of rust or other deterioration.  Sound is excellent (for speakers that I use for my pool area) and reproduce great sound that can be cranked up plenty loud enough to be heard over the ruckus in the pool with out distortion.
5,bought these speakers in 2011. Installed them on patio under eve of house and left them there. Never took them down. They have been through freezing temps very hot temps snow rain etc. and today in 2017 they are still sounding as good as when we put them up. If you are looking for a quality outdoor stereo speaker I would not hesitate to purchase these again which I am doing now as we have moved to a new home and need a new pair. Our speakers are hooked up to my Onkyo receiver so we have stereo music on our patio via receiver cassette deck cd player and evenvinyl. Yes I love my music and have lots of music media. There are a lot of higher priced speakers out there but these sound great and have lasted the test of time so far 6 yrs so I believe these are a great value.
5,Great for adding sound to the sides of our yard. They are a little larger than expected but it grows on you. The swivel option is nice and sound is great.
4,These things get loud. Range is Ok. Getting on the lower end the speakers begin to crackle if you pump the bass too much. Otherwise great range and clear sound. Paired with a Fosi Audio BT10A 2020 version and these things get loud. Can only handle the volume turned up half way.
5,So I have never written an Amazon review but I use them (the reviews) alot to help with my purchase decisions.  I had to let people know what a great speaker these are.  I had my hot tub installed about 2 weeks ago and while it is great it's too quiet where we are at (read; BFE).  I needed a little music.  Enter these babys!  They are a great speaker.  I had them mounted wired and sounding great in under 2 hours.  They are very clear and loud (120 watts).  I use the 'bass boost' on an older Pioneer receiver ("man cave edition") and  1/4 volume is enough although they could take alot more.  I put them up under the deck (walk out) where they will be just about completly out of the elements.  If they hold up to the Michigan temp changes I will buy these speakers again and again.  I used 14ga wire I picked up at a big box hardware store.  Don't hesitate to pick these up.  GREAT DEAL!
5,If you’re looking for a pair of decent outdoor speakers then these are definitely it.
5,I bought this as part of an outdoor sound system and it was a win.  At first they were bigger than I expected (my fault for not measuring) but I placed them on the white columns of our porch and they blend in effectively well so much so folks keep asking me where the speakers are.But that's not what you care about.  "Does it sound good."Yes.  The sound is amazing.  Given I use it more in "chill mode" than dance party mode so I can't speak to how loud you can crank it but it's clear rich and sounds like the musicians are right there.  The placement has led to an amazing immersive soundscape during fire pits.  They've withstood rain snow and tornado warnings.Recently I've noticed a slight rattle but that could be the security wire.
5,These are high quality outdoor speakers. I am a audiophile and use very high end Paradigm speakers indoors as well as another Klipsch system for my indoor theater setup so I have a reasonably good perspective backed by decades of music experience to rely upon for judging these Yamaha speakers. Construction is solid and they have been on my patio for a year with absolutely no sound issues.... they sound just as they did out of the box. I have them positioned under a patio cover so I cannot speak to their durability in direct rain but they have held up quite well through the winter and heat. They would be just average for indoor use with an expensive receiver but that is not what they were designed for ..... they are for outdoor stereo sound and for that they deliver quite well. I would definitely buy again.
5,I replaced some old Infinity Outdoor speakers that my daughter destroyed by pushing full volume to them with distorted music.  Aargh!  So I was looking for inexpensive but good sounding replacements.  I found these Yamaha's and all the reviews were great so for $60.00 with free shipping I couldn't go wrong.I will tell you they sound absolutely fantastic!  I am pushing them with a Panasonic SA-XR25 digital amp and also using a Sony subwoofer.  My garage is rocking once again!  Incredible sound at a great price.The wall mounting brackets are included and they take banana plugs or bare wire.  They were up and making music in less than 10 minutes.There is even a lanyard so that if they somehow got unscrewed they wouldn't fall.  Pretty nifty.  Also nice for installing the speaker wire since you can let the speaker dangle while you use both hands to connect the wires.You can't go wrong with these speakers!
5,These are very nice. The sound is good - especially for this price point. They look nice. Install was easy. I have them connected to a Pyle 120 watt amp I also go on Amazon. The music source is my echo dot which I usually listen to a SiriusXM station through. The nice thing with this setup is I can listen to local talk radio on tunein or satellite radio or any song on demand with amazon music unlimited. I can change the channel and volume from the patio with the Alexa remote I also bought.This has made a great setup for music outside. Give these a shot I’m glad I got them.
5,Well i was doing a lot of research looking for a cheap way to add great sound to my home theatre. Based on the number of reviews and what everyone said about these i went ahead and purchased them. They sound phenominal they fill up the whole room with accurate highs and punchy mids. I have a couple of Bic speakers including the 62clrs dv-84s polk psw10 onkyo 7.1 reciever insingias 61/2" bookshelf and now the yamahas for the rear. The highs are very crisp out of the box and i am sure that they will mellow out after some use like most tweeters do. I was thinking if these speakers are designed for outdoor use and rated for 200 to 400ft i knew they would fit the bill as rear surrounds. Thanks Amazonupdate 1/02/09 speakers are working great still i got rid of the bic dv-84s and got a pair of Ascend acoustics sierra 1s now those are speakers! I love the yamahas as rear surround they work great.
5,These units offer easy mounting flexible emplacement and good sound quality for the price. We use them in multiple locations in cluding constantly high humidity places including bathrooms.Mounting is easy and any balance or leveling issues may be compensated for by the multi-adjustable bracket. (Note that the easiest option...the super-mount...is only possible if you have the main bracket likely a component of costlier Yamaha systems.)Upper and mid-range frequencies are handled with deftness and are characterized by the usual Yamaha sound in this price range: general favorable with just a touch of brightness. The lows are a bit boomy but that can be throttled back by emplacement and making sure your receiver's bass control is down a few ticks at 100Hz which is very close to the speaker enclosure's resonance frequency.With minimal installation time and effort reasonable emplacement determination and a few adjustments to your receiver these are a great choice for any location where background music is desirable.
4,This is my 3 pair. Sounds great for the price. Be careful not to blow the speakers with excess volume. Works great.
4,Just installed these today. Very pleased with the clarity and separation. As others have noted the low end comes up a bit short but not a deal breaker. They really fill my deck area with sound. Based on other reviews I have my fingers crossed on durability specifically the grills staying attached.My only real disappointment is how they mount horizontally. They can only face straight out and not be tilted down. I wanted to mount them horizontally under the eave tilted down. With the mounting system they use they had to be mounted vertically so I can point them downward. I don't really care for the look of them mounted like this.
5,I bought 2 pairs of these back in 2015 and 5 years later they still play well and sound great. I cannot say a bad thing about these cabs. They are a great product for the price. Oh I used these as spa speakers home theatre speakers and as computer speakers at different times since I bought them.
5,Sounds Amazing!
5,Great speakers! They are very well built and seem like they will hold up for quite some time in the elements. They provide a clear sound while also being compact enough to mount discreetly in many locations. The lows aren't overly powerful but I didn't expect them to be so I'm not disappointed. The only flaw is the mounting system which doesn't allow the speaker to tilt up or down then mounted horizontally. I understand they sell an adapter to accommodate this but I was hoping to have the ability without purchasing additional items. Other than that this is a great buy!
4,I have the larger version of these speakers in another location and that is why I bought this smaller set for the front porch. For the money these sound good and if cared for should last 10 years or so.
4,Speakers are very good sound and good at Pool the weather and rain etc. use very good during outside cabana at all kind of weather.
4,I"m no stereo guru ... average guy that wanted music for the pool deck.  Went to radio shack and bought some (what the guy called average wire) 16 gauge indoor/outdoor wire which fit onto the screw-together connections for the speakers.  Also I found an old Aiwa speaker system (only 40 watt) but connected these and it sounds good (decent base/treble) sounds like any other radio if it were outside.WARNING: I did do a little homework and you have to know what ohm your speakers are.  The system I was connecting to were 6 ohm and so were these speakers :-) there are some other that look just like this that are 8 ohm so you have to know what you're connecting (even though I really didn't)
5,These speakers sound really good on my patio.  When I first received them I hooked them up indoors and they sounded boomy and weird.  I put them up outside anyway and I'm glad I did outdoors they sound fantastic.  I don't run them very loud so I can't tell you what they sound like if your amp goes to 11 but at moderate volumes they sound really good.  I've got them installed under the eaves of a porch facing out to the patio with about 20 ft between the speakers.  It is probably 15-20 feet from the  speakers to the normal listening area.  With just a few watts the volume at that distance is enough that you have to raise your voice slightly to talk over the music.
4,I didn't want to spend a lot on outdoor speakers because I only had outputs from my receiver to two speakers and I needed to hook up at least 4 speakers outside. So I purchased the Sima SSW 4 Speaker Selector to split the audio signal between two pairs of speakers. I know that these types of devices have loss and that the sound would get degraded somewhat. However when I hooked these speakers up and started turning up the volume I was afraid that the neighbors were going to call the police.I don't know at what level the speakers might start clipping or sounding bad but I wasn't able to keep going long enough to find out.These speakers are perfect for what I was looking for.
4,Overall these speakers do the job.  The quality of sound is not the greatest but I am not sure if that is because of my receiver the height of the speakers or the speakers themselves.  Otherwise for the price they are just what I wanted.  I suppose the quality of sound is not as important especially when you have a lot of people outside.  I am happy with my purchase they were easy to install and the construction is very good.  It is nice to have music playing when I am in my backyard and these do just that.
5,So far these speakers are doing an excellent job. They are connected to my outdoor TV and installed on a brick wall with absolutely no awning above it. Its rained quite a bit so far in NY and they are still playing my music and movie sounds. Previously I had these connected to a Lepai LP-S60 4 x 25W Desktop Amplifier but this amps size was a bit big for where it was going so I changed it to a Lepai LP-168HA 2.1 2 x 40-Watt Amplifier. The sound was great on both amps but there was minimal distortion at max volume.For the price of these speakers and holding up to the elements outside I am very happy.
5,These are great. I'm not an audiophile by any means but these get LOUD. I have them set up on my deck and they have held up well. We actually had 2 REAL bad storms in the last couple months since I installed them and they didn't budge and still sound great. This was the cheapest option I could find and was concerned they wouldn't be any good since they were so cheap. I was wrong they're real good. I can't really compare them to other products because I didn't buy other products. I bought these and that's why I'm telling you about them.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Great speakers. Had them up in under 2 hours after wiring and what not. They sound great. Live on over an acre and can hear them from the back not even turned all the way up. I have 4 installed. Really like them.
3,I've had these for a few years.  They are easy to install and have held up well.  The problem is that they always sounded "hollow" to me.  So for the money I guess they are just ok.  I just replaced them with a pair of Polk Atrium 4's and the difference was amazing.  Bass separation so much better for not much more money.  Kick myself for not making the change earlier.
5,Easy to install and with all 4 going it is really nice even sound! Don’t need a lot to power them but can get loud if I want them to...but I like my neighbors. So nice relaxing on the patio with great sound now!
5,Love them
5,My old JBL speakers were blown so I had to replace it but didn't want to spend $200-$300.  When I saw this I had my doubts but I said what the heck? It's great price and got great reviews.  So decided to gamble and ordered.I've been a big fan of Yamaha considering they started out building pianos I assume they know a thing or two about acoustics.I hooked them up and mounted them where the old speakers use to be.  Turned on the music and it sounds great.  Now it's not going to provide you with super deep bass and full range of sound to fulfill the audiophiles but it definitely fits the bill if you want to play some music outside while grilling out doing yardwork or just relaxing.
5,The good:  Surprisingly good sound solidly constructed/heavy/substantial.The negative:  While the speakers include a base to allow use on a bookshelf and a bracket to mount them to the wall the wall bracket only allows tilting in one dimension.  In other words if you mount them on the wall so that they are taller than they are wide then the bracket only allows tipping them (angling the speakers) up or down.  If you mount them on the wall so that they are wider than they are tall then the bracket only allows you to adjust the angle of the speakers left or right (not up and down).
3,Speakers are ok definitely could be louder. I have these set up in my outdoor patio under a wooden awning and it sounds really clear under there. It sounds faint in the rest of my yard even at full blast. However there is no distorted sounds are crackles and everything sounds very clear in the 20'x20' box that it recommends the speakers to project. Another thing that kind of irritated me at first was that i did not realize that a receiver did not come with it nor does the speaker wire so that was kind of annoying to have to go out and buy another one. If you have a receiver already set up and you have extra wire lying around (or dont mind spending more money on them) then this is a good product and worth the money. otherwise for a poor post-college kid like myself it was kind of a let down upon first opening the box and should be made more clear in the description.
5,Got a couple pairs of these for sound reinforcement at our church.  They work great sound great for the size and have lasted about 5 years so far.  And the price is right.  They come with all the mounting hardware to hang them from a wall or a rafter and you can pretty much aim them any direction you like because of the built in adjust-ability.  You won't experience gut busting bass from the small woofers but the sound is clear and undistorted in our sanctuary and we have a separate sub woofer for the bass notes anyway.  They don't draw a large amount of amplifier power either and don't overload our amp.
4,These speakers have been awesome. Out in the elements at our marina for over 3 years now and they still sound great. Good deal for sure.
4,I'm hesitant to rate these as I've yet to really blast them due them being in my backyard and not wanting to annoy my neighbors.  But as outside speakers on my deck they are working out great.  The music sounds really good.  It's a big jump up from a boombox or portable iPod dock/speaker system.  They were easy to install with the included mounting brackets and I like that they come with mini stands if you just want to set them up somewhere in the house.  I'm sure these aren't the best speakers out there so that's why I'm giving 4 stars.  But for the price I'm 5 stars happy and would recommend them.
5,After 7 years one of them is blown probably my fault and the other is still going strong. Awesome quality at great price
5,Straightforward install and great sound out of these reasonably priced speakers. I have them powered by a 2 channel yamaha and the sound is great out on our patio and pool area. No complaints at all just do it!
4,I had problems with these speakers' binding posts breaking but Yamaha replaced them under warranty.These Yamahas are solid outdoor speakers.  They are well built but are not particularly efficient. I am powering them with a Pyle 2x75W amp but wish I had more power or a more efficient speaker to drive a mid-sized church meeting room.  We use this system to show movies or for background music during small social events.  Sound quality is very good.  My guess is that I'll get a bigger amp over time but the Pyle 75w is fine for now.
5,I was looking at Polk speakers at the time I ran across these. I started reading reviews. I'm pretty picky about speakers and sound quality. I was very surprised how great and crisp these speakers are. The most impressive aspect was the sound projection. They project well to the sides as well as forward. I mounted them under the eve of the house over looking the pool. They are mounted 10' apart and face straight out. The loudness is the same at 15' in front as 5'. The loudness at 90 degrees to the side seems almost the same too. I have recommended these speakers to several friends since I have installed mine. I have only had them for a few weeks so I can't comment on how well they will last. I don't suspect there will be any problems with them any time soon.
5,When I first pulled these out of the box I was disapointed at how light in weight the speakers were. Lets face it small magnets small sound. Instead of drilling holes in the wall I bought wall tracking at Home Depot that allows you to run wire thru it concealing the wire & sticks to the wall. Drilled a small hole in the corner of the window and ran the wires outside(16 gauge speaker wire). Hung them at 10ft spread about 15ft apart. The receiver in the house had to be placed on the "2 Channel" setting (stereo only) for them to work (did not work on Multiple Channel Setting). When I fired them up I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THE SOUND. Excellent quality for the price. Tweeters are crisp bass is just strong enough. The tracking from home Depot was just barely good enough to keep the wife from barking. You will be very pleased with these speakers.
4,As per most of the reviews they are worth the money. What makes this a four and not five star for me is that in the description when it come to the "What's in the box" section it clearly says "two lengths of speaker cable" and there is not. Not a big deal to some people but I wanted to do a bench test before I installed them (In a meeting hall with wire pre installed) and I could not. If that's not an issue for you then these will be fine.That's just my experience.
5,These  meet my needs for working out in the garage. I especially like that you can mount them like a spot light with the outdoor cover. It includes the fittings. Excellent for the price!
5,I installed these around the corner from a set of more expensive speakers to extend my outdoor entertainment area. They sound better and require less power. I will be replacing the other speakers with another set of these soon.
5,Inexpensive outdoor speakers that sound great (not at high volumes).  I have two sets of these: One in our backyard and one on our vacation house at the river.  They both perform perfectly.....and the ones at the house are well over a year old and we live at the beach so they are constantly exposed to the salty sea air!  They aren't the most expensive and I'm sure when you turn them up REALLY loud the sound isn't great but if you're looking for good medium volume speakers these are them! :) (and when I say really loud I mean so loud you can hear them a block over!)
5,Needed to new outdoor speakers and these are very clear with no static. They also can be loud if you need something with more power.  Compact and very easy installation.
3,I bought these speakers to use outside for a pool area.  Based on the reviews I read I thought they were a steal on sale for 69.99.  When I hooked them up they were fine and the high pitched sounds came out pretty clean. However the speakers didn't have crisp sound as the volume increased and the bass was non-existent.  I ended up returning them.  For about 250 dollars II would suggest a Klipsch KHO-7 and I have been told that Definitive Technology AW5500WHI are excellent for about 200.  For a bit more money (350) the Paradigm Stylus 270 are fantastic speakers.  For about the same money I would try the Yamaha "Natural Sound" speakers (NS-AW190WH) - their sound is better at higher volumes and a bit better bass (the bass is lacking compared to the other models however).
3,A little better than OK however....the Energy speakers sound better and the Yamaha mounts are more combersome than the Energy Take 5 speakers. The Yamaha speakers get in the way of their own mounts and you can only effectively mount them straight up and down as on a wall or stud. You CAN turn them a bit to try to get the right listening angle for example on a deck however mounts connected to the short sides would work much better and you can turn the speakers to nearly any angle you choose. The Energy speakers are fully turnable and can mount on the ceiling and be adjusted etc. The speakers sound pretty good however the Energy Take 5's sound much better. Compared two brand new sets side by side. Energy outdoor speakers by Klipsch are much better!
3,I bought these because I was looking for new outside speakers and they had great reviews and a good price.  After putting them up and using them I'm underwhelmed by them.  Sound is ok but doesn't seem as great as everyone thought - but then again I was just looking to have some music on the deck - not a complete system.  Was also disappointed that speakers have to mount flat on side of house and can't be turned in towards each other.  My fault for not picking up on this at time of order but sure would have been nice with either a different mount or having the mount on top and bottom so speakers could be put on ends of deck and angled in towards center.  As they are now can only be angled a littel downward until bottom of speaker hits house. Oh Well.
4,Fantastic speakers as I ran almost a hundred feet of wire from the computer to them using a Lepai LP-2020A+ Tripath TA2020 class T Hi Fi amplifier. The sounds was crisp and clear and the bottom sound was out of sight. The only thing the package didn't include was mounting screws which should be included. Sounded as good as the Bose speakers I had before at 1/4 the price. Easy installation was also a great factor of these speakers. Would recommend them to anyone!
4,I am no audiophile but for under $150.00 I hooked these speakers up to an Audiosource 50 amp to the back of my computer and put them on my deck and was very surprised with the sound quality.  I never have to turn the volume up past 1/2 and they fill the deck with sound.  These speakers could put out a little more bass but they are acceptable.  I will say that both Pandora and Rhapsody sound great.  Maybe I will hookup a subwoofer to complete the package.  I also give thumbs up to the amp that was very simple to hookup and use.
5,I bought the 4 set so I could use a pair indoors and my friend could install outside.  I was very happy with the ease of installation and how they looked.  Sound quality is very good with no issues at high volume.  I'm no expert so I can't make a technical assessment.  I have listened to many speakers and these seem equal in range to me - though I do like the bass up high :-).
5,I just needed a decent pair of outdoor speakers for my patio out back. Considering the price I don't see how these can be beat. They're relatively small but the sound coming out of them is excellent. Strong bass clean treble...nice.Also these are easy to mount with several options. I just drove a 3.5" deck screw into the vinyl siding under the eaves of my house and hung the speakers using the bracket provided. Easy money....This may or may not be temporary- but for now it's certainly good enough.I power these speakers with a   Pyle PTA2 Mini 2x40W Stereo Power Amplifier         and I use an iPod Touch to either stream Internet radio or to listen to tunes from my library. These speakers definitely fill the bill- and then some.
5,I purchased these speakers for my outdoor patio at a new house.  The house was wired through a zone to an outdoor covered patio.  I highly recommend these speakers for four reasons:  1) The PRICE!  Hard to argue with a great bargain.  2) The sound quality is great (highs bass and mid-range are all great).  3) Ease of installation.  4) They look great. I run them through a Zone 2 with an Onkyo TX-SR508 and SpeakerCraft S4dc Multi-Room Speaker Selector.  I get great results.  The house was also wired with high end speaker wire that is well shielded.  I purchased the Onkyo through Amazon as well.  Their prices are unbeatable especially when you combined the free shipping and no tax.
5,i purchased this item over 1 yr ago and now i can review them correctly i set them up on our porch up under the eves i wired them with "monster wire" less distortion than other wires based on past exp.  they produce a great sound throught the whole front yard when i am out there its clean crisp and very clear they have held up very well look and act as new i would highly reccomend thease to anyone  and also the system i have them on is a high powered yamaha component system with amplifier and lots of extras i only mention this to say they work very well even in a "high powered" system unlike many others that can not take the watts from the amp..
5,Good speakers for the money. Says outdoor however mounting instructions want the speakers installed under a soffit to protect from rain and snow. Not too confident that they will last outside long term
4,I installed 4 of these on my deck powered by a small amp. They're fine. For the price they're great and they do the trick for ambient music. I wouldn't buy these to really crank high volume. They come with a hanging wire which I really appreciated - You can hang them while you wire the speaker wires and you get an extra hand to work with as a result.
3,I would say these are decent for the money but if you want good sound and any bass these wont cut it. My last pair were 229 wish I would of got them again. I would probably return these if I did t throw away the box
5,I ordered 8 of these ones to pair them up with my 7.2 Yamaha receiver and God was I pleased.The price is just right and they fit in perfectly on the ceiling add to that mix a projector and a screen and you have yourself your own movie theater.They are for sure loud but great sound for patio speakers.Mine are outside but covered so not sure how they would handle the weather but it is humid in Houston and these ones are still going strong.
4,These are a great set of speakers clearly well made as compared to some of the cheaper ones. Be aware you cannot mount these on a ceiling and control the direction. I replaced a cheaper set on my shed where I had them mounted on the sill and had to mount these onto the shed siding. Not a big deal just be aware of it.
2,Had these just over a year. I wired them to my Yamaha WXA-50 amplifier. The set up was easy and they look nice. But the sound quality is terrible no bass at all. I've also had issues with the build quality. The screens are glued on and the glue they use sucks! The glue melts in the summer heat and the screens fall off (see pictures).If you like bass I don't recommend these.If you get high temperatures and need something for outdoors I don't recommend them.If you want loud speakers I don't recommend them.I would not purchase these again.
5,We use these in our outdoor bar and they work great have a great sound and provide hours of entertainment.
3,The sound quality was quite good on these but ultimately they are so large that I ended up returning them for something a bit more dimunitive.  I was adding them to the back yard for a sound system and their size just made them to obtrusive and noticeable even when mounted at the roof line.  If you are okay with the size they will work well but I suggest that you find something similarly sized and mock it in place to understand what it will be like. I read the sizes and thought I had a good idea of what that would be but I was surprised by the reality of it.
5,I paired these speakers with the Damgoo amp connected to my laptop and projector for movie night in the backyard.  Sound is great!
5,Had a pair from 10 years ago that I replaced easily. These are totally sweet if you have a wired system.
4,I gave this to my husband as a b-day gift to replace some raggedy old outdoor speakers. Since we already had the wires it took 5 minutes to install. The sound was great!  I only give a 4 star because I don't know if the sound is really that great or if it's because I was used to listening to the old speakers... which weren't so great. We may purchase another pair. We do have some other wireless outdoor speakers to compliment these so all around good!
5,I bought these Yamaha outside speakers for the deck and they were easy to install and look really nice out there. They have a nice stereo sound for soft background music and sound pretty rich for playing it loud. I even played a movie through them and they were so good that I bought another set from Yamaha to put on my garage for our outdoor movie nights (one step up to get bigger woofer and tweeter since movies are played pretty loud to fill my yard). They aren't going to give you clean surround sound since they are small speakers remember but for your deck or yard they are perfect for eating breakfast to or having a party with.
5,We purchased 4 of these (2 sets)to put on to the back of our garage for winter activities on our pond. They give off great sound.  We installed the receiver in the garage and drilled the holes through. To make installation easy we installed outdoor light boxes.  The brackets supplied screw directly onto the boxes. Installing all 4 took only about 1 hour and the sound is great.. we have had several rain and snow storms since and there doesn't appear to be any issues. Time will tell how they hold us to our harsh Maine winters.
5,These speakers sound great for the price and definitely would recommend for an outdoor speaker.  There is one confusing item in the manual for the mount they talk about a mega mount which is said to be sold separately.  Doing a search on Yamaha website didn't bring back any results for 'mega mount'.  I found a review for another set of Yamaha speakers that resolved this mystery mount.  http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EHJPL3VWXE7T if that link doesn't work then do a google search for 'yamaha mega mounting plate' and the second link should be 'Amazon.com: Doug Dittrich's review of Yamaha NS-AW350 2-Way..' which will give you the information.  It is a $3.59 mounting plate you can purchase at Home Depot.
4,These speaker gave awesome sound in our backyard. I purchased the speakers 3 years ago and at the end of last summer one speaker was not working. I took that speaker apart and there was moisture inside the speaker compartment. They sounded so good that I ordered another pair and would recommend that you store them away for the winter.
5,I had to replace a set of (cheaper) outdoor speakers that just didn't hold up to the elements.  While I haven't gone through a winter with these yet I can tell the Yamaha set are better designed to deal with rain snow sun etc.  In addition the sound is much improved.  They won't rival my nicer indoor speakers but the music on the patio sounds great.  The mounting brackets are also well done as the installation under the eave of a roof was simple and quick.  All I could wish for is that the price goes back to where it was when I bought these (June 2012 - $58) and I'd get another set!
5,These speakers sound good in my new gazebo.  I bought four two that will replace a couple of old Bose speakers (one that is deceased! and the other is probably on its last leg).  I shall install the remaining two speakers in the spring when the weather is warm.  They were very easy to hang and the set up makes it easy to install them (they screw on and have a safety wire that you attach so that you cannot drop them!).  Easy/breezy!  Thanks for a great setup and for a great sound.  I highly recommend these speakers.  And they look good!
5,I installed these speakers on my back porch under gutter to prevent direct rainfall.  For the price and size these have been used nearly every week and definitely at all of our parties and get togethers. They can get very loud and do have more low end bass than I thought they would. They definitely help prevent any awkward silence at get togethers.Install specifics: drilled directly into the side of my house and ran speaker cable into the soffits into the attic and into a closet with an old amplifier that was "left over" from an old 5.1 surround system that was retired. I ran an airport express into that amplifier and these became AirPlay speakers!
5,Easy to install. Installed within a couple hours. We have gotten a ton of rain since and they are holding up fine. We have purchased a few sets of these speakers for different locations because we know they are good quality and we can rely on them.
5,My wife and I live in Riverside California. Where we live the winters aren't too cold perhaps getting to about 30 degrees at night. In the spring and summer the temperature can jump up to the 90's and 100's. Regardless of the weather these speakers can withstand all variations in weather. They are weatherproof and give off a good sound. The have ample bass however if you're looking for exceptionally loud bass then a subwoofer would be required.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase and these speakers do seem like they're going to last a long time as they appear to be well built.
3,OK SO IM ON MY SECOND SET OF THESE SPEAKERS. THEY ARE GOOD SPEAKERS AND JAM. BUT THE ONLY LAST ABOUT A YEAR. I HAVE 2 SETS OF THEM. THE ONES INSIDE HAVE BLOWN TWICE IN COLD WEATHER. MY SHOP IS NOT HEATED AND I THINK THAT IS THE PROBLEM. THE ONES OUTSIDE  IVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH YET BUT WE DONT PLAY THEM IN THE WINTER EITHER. HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE IN THERE PURCHASE OF THESE SPEAKERS. LIKE I SAID THEY ARE GOOD UNTIL THEY DIE.
5,I have had these speakers installed for a few weeks now. They are exactly what I expected for the price. While the sound isn't equal to my home stereo I wasn't looking for that. The sound is still great for the price and better than some more expensive speakers I heard in stores. They are installed under a deck which is a patio area and have survived a 12 inch deluge heat in the nineties and very high humidity so far. I'm waiting to see how they do with the Iowa Winter and will update if there are problems. I was very happy with the shipping. Amazon had it to me in a few days.
5,I purchased these speakers after much research. I was only looking to spend about $100 for a pair so these fit the bill. I trusted all the reviews and the fact that they are Yamaha's so I purchased 2 pairs (for deck and yard). Amazing sound! Incredible sound stage and imaging tight deep base solid/detailed mids and highs. Running 4 channels (A&B) from an old Sony receiver (110W/channel). I have DBFB switched on to enhance base and these speakers soak it up and reproduce flawlessly.  Sound fills my yard like an amphitheater. For the price and size these are very efficient and sound great at any level. Best $130 I've spent in a lomg time!Highly recommended!!
5,I wasn't expecting too much for outdoor speakers at this price but these speakers sound great. The mid range is clear and the high end is crisp. There isn't a lot on the low end but it isn't missing either! You cannot expect too much for 5" drivers. If you crave more bass add a sub. The volume level is more than sufficient when I combined these speakers with a  200W car audio amp for an outdoor stereo system.  Car stereo amps can be obtained at very low prices and do not take up much room.  Just take a switching power supply from an old/unused computer for the 12V-- wiring is straightforward.
4,Installed outside to replace a pair of Bose outdoor speakers. Work great.  Have connected to a Bluetooth receiver so that we can pair phones/tablets and stream music to them outdoors. Works well.  Update - it is now April 2018 and speakers still working great.
4,I ordered 4 of these.  Three work great.  The fourth has an issue.  The sound is not the same as the other three on the same system.
4,This is the second pair of NS-AW150W that I have purchased for under my patio. Had one of the speaker in the first pair go out after several yrs. of service so I picked up another set! Enjoy the sound quality its loud and clear with no distortion even at higher volumes. they are small and blend in very well with the surroundings. They were very easy to install as well. I highly recommend this set for a qualtiy affordable outdoor speaker set! Great job Yamaha!
1,Went with these for the price point and for the good reviews. However after a little over a year of use they are now junk. They continuously cut out will not play at all sometimes. They don't receive much direct rain at all as they are on the backside of my garage opposite of the prevailing weather. In fact one of them is under the eave and get no direct rain at all.Pretty disappointed because I always thought Yamaha was top of the line equipment and would receive a couple more years of use. Wasn't expecting a life long product here for the price but more than a year being as protected as they were.
5,Was so glad to find these. Have Bose speakers on the back of the house from 15 years ago and loved them but they are 4 times the cost of these. We added these to the front porch and have been throughly happy with these and find the sound to be just as good.
5,Great speakers used the pair for a party and they were more than loud enough!Used with Pyle mini amp
5,I have had these speakers since 2011 it's 2019. They work great. I have never disconnected them or really did any maintenance on them at all. They still work great. They are in campground area so lots of dirt and moisture and after all these years they are still awesome.
5,I bought these speakers last year and they stayed outside all winter long (and we had a BRUTAL winter in New England as did everywhere else I guess). Anyway the speakers worked fine all winter and are still going strong. The white plastic has yellowed a tiny bit. I'm not sure if that's the case all the time or just because my back yard gets direct sun from dawn until about 3 pm so they really take a beating. In any case I'm pleased with the product and glad I didn't go with something cheaper that wouldn't last.
5,was looking at Boise outdoor speakers and found these after reading reviews thought I would take a chance on these and I'm glade I did. I have heard a lot of Boise outdoor speakers and in my opinion these sound just as good and for the difference in price you can't go wrong with these Yamaha outdoor speakers Mounted these under my eves on the back porch and they sound good all around the back yard.
4,For the price that I paid the speakers sound good but they do lack a full richness of sound. Dont get me wrong they do sound good and I use them for my covered patio. If I would have known what I know now I might of kicked it up a notch and bought the 190s. I do feel that they do lack some Bass qualities for that full rich sound.
5,Speakers are as advertised.  Look good and easy to install.  It is easy to install the bracket and then easy to install the speaker into the bracket (the latter by hand without any tools needed).  Of course the bracket fasteners are not supplied because as noted EXPLICITLY in the instructions fasteners must be selected for the application (to what the speakers are being mounted).  The instructions should give some common answers for the speaker weight and wood masonry and stucco anyway.  All the other hardware was provided even a bookshelf stand.I am not an audio expert but the speakers sound fine to me.
5,Good product
5,Very easy to install.  I placed these directly onto siding with plywood backing and wood screws and they held firm!  I ran speaker wire under the siding to the hole were I pre drilled for the wire and down into the basement where my receiver is.  I placed these under the eaves in my backyard and the sound is great even attached to a receiver that is more then a decade old!  I'm sure once I upgrade the receiver these will sound even better!  Well worth the money easy to install and they look good out back with the PVC railings on my deck.
5,Great sounding affordable speakers. Mounting system included is easy to use and instructions are simple to read. Def would recommend.
5,I've had these speakers for about 3 weeks now. I installed them in backyard and connected them to an old stereo receiver I had down the basement collecting dust for 10 years. Thankfully the receiver still worked and the speakers sound fantastic!! I wish I had bought them years ago. I added a Logitech blue tooth adapter (also from amazon) so now I can sit in the pool or work in the yard while streaming a playlist from my ipad/phone. Love these speakers and would buy them again in a second.LOVE THESE SPEAKERS!!!!
5,I bought these speakers for our camper knowing that if I ever sell my camper I can put them up on our deck. In our camper they are powered just by a car radio. These speakers aren't made for this type of power but they still sounded great. I think they would be amazing powered off of a home stereo. The sound is great and I was very impressed. Another great thing is they are not real big so they can fit in a nice spot. Plus you can hang then or put the "standing" bracket on them and just sit them on a shelf. I love them.
3,I didn't expect much for bass but I was a bit disappointed in the midrange.  The speakers seem well built and rugged for outdoor use and they do sound very good.  I have some Klipsch of similar size and they sound much better with a fuller sound however I paid a fair amount more for them.  For the money I think it's a solid buy for some background music on the deck while talking with friends. (4 or 5 stars from that point)  But...  If you want more midrange and bass you will need to move up in price.
5,Using these in a home gym in the garage. They've been plenty powerful for streaming music / workout videos / YouTube / Amazon Prime videos. It [the garage gym] is an enclosed space and there's no other ambient noise so I can't speak to using these in a true outdoor setting.
5,Nice speakers good sound have been installed for about 2 weeks ... I am happy with these speakers.
5,I purchased the speakers for my outdoor open patio I am very impressed with the sound quality the clarity is awesome even at higher volume. The entire neighborhood knew that there was a party going on when I cranked these up. As other reviewers have noted the bass is not thunderous but I feel that it is adequate. I ran them off of my Yamaha RX-A700 receiver in zone 2 90w output mounted them on the wall under the eave about 12 feet apart. Overall I am extremely pleased with these If you buy 'em you'll be happy you did as you can't beat these for the price!!!!
2,I purchased these speakers to broadcast the music for my Christmas light display.  I have a light show synched to music each year.  I have tour buses that come by and sometimes the folks like to get out and dance in the driveway.  So I figured I'd try these as the reviews were great.These did work awesome for about a week and were extremely easy to mount under the roof on the garage.  However they broadcast just as much static as they do tones.  Now with that said for my specific needs these speakers do not work.  However my family and friends also tailgate in the driveway each Sunday for football games.  We broadcast the game on the radio over these speakers and I do not hear any static. I'm no speaker expert but it seems that for talk radio and sports broadcast these work just dandy.  For Christmas music...not so much.  All in all for the price I'd buy them again.  I'll just need to upgrade them for next years Christmas light show.
5,These speakers were so easy to install.  They were a great buy and sound amazing! We have one in the back yard and one in the side yard.  You will not be sorry with these speakers!
4,At $60 these speakers are a good value.  The sound is not spectacular but it is reasonable and "wide" which is important for outdoor or other odd spaces.  I can not speak about their outdoor durability as I am using them inside a garage.  The mounting is fairly standard - works fine and the addition of plastic stands for using them on a shelf is a nice.Overall I would recommend these speakers at $60.
5,Love these speakers. Easy to install. Great sound quality. They are replacing older ones from a different manufacturer. I did build little roofs over them so they not in the direct elements.
4,The mounting hardware is very simple this was the first great sign. It's been sturdy in heavy Midwest winds this summer/fall 2011.The sound is rich with just the right amount of bass and clarity of voice in both song and talk-radio. I have a large yard and the sound carries better than I expected at this price (~60 dollars). Most importantly I haven't noticed any distortion when turning it up while I work in the yard.
5,Had a pair of these I have been using over a year and had no issues.  They are outside under a porch so I can't speak to how well they will hold up to direct rain but they sound great for the price and can be played loud with no distortion.  I am using them eith Yamaha receivers putting out 90-100 watts rms.
4,Great speakers for our outside patio area. Nice sound quality. Can't beat the price.He have them hanging under our eves of the house. Not too hard to install. My husband said there were two brackets for mounting missing. He rigged it another way to create a stable base.Ran the wires through our attic so you do not have to see any wires.Again - great sound running from our Denon receiver :)
5,The ease and adaptability of mounting is “eh” but they sound great! My neighbors definitely hate me
4,These speakers sound very good. I installed them outside earlier this year to stream Alexa on my deck.  They feel durable and sturdy to boot.
5,Happy happy happy with these Yamaha's. I have them hooked up to a JVC PC-X250 shelf audio system/box (radioCD player& input in ). I don't know the watts per channel but it can't be over 5 wpc. The speakers sound very good. I paid about $60 and in my opinion these speakers could pass for $100 speakers. For the price quality seems above average & mounted to the side of my house easy enough. If your poor like me and you want outside mounted speakers and you don't need bose 901 like sound levels these work out nice. I would do it again !
5,Easy to mount excellent sound. Quality built. Well worth price. Would highly recommend.
4,Good sound for the size and a decent size for the power they have.  My only complaint would be the limited mounting options.
5,I had two of these and bought two more. They last forever.
5,Fantastic speakers. Sounds very clear and the build quality is excellent. I use it with a Yamaha receiver for an outdoor movie theater. The speakers are in a covered area but humidity is high. I've been using it for a little over a month almost every other night. I'm not sure that the sound would be as good if it were not used in conjunction with a remote subwoofer but still great for the money.
5,We added these speakers to our Sonos amp wired to the pool area. We already had two other expensive outdoor speaker connected to it. The quality is just as good as our indoor Sonos speakers and the other outdoor speakers. Amazing quality for $89. Highly recommend. No need to get an extra bridge unless you want to separate the zones.
4,These speakers for the money are the best outdoor speakers you will find anywhere they were pretty simple to mount all mounting brackets were suppled with them. they sound great hold up to rain just fine I have a  large area they cover it ok If your doing a very large area i would suggest using four of them the sound Qualty is awsome you wont go wrong with these
5,Bought them to replace my jbl destoyed by the hurricane  I was a little skeptical as my old speakers lasted me 25 years and were loud and exellent sound these were very easy to mount and the sound is perfect will they last ? We will see but for now very happy.
5,These speakers sound great.  For a patio or deck they are excellent.  Once you start to get farther away the bass drops off so don't expect to have a party in a big space.  Not the speakers fault.  I have them out by the pool and if you're more than say 20 feet away you really lose the bass.  I may supplement these with a subwoofer or put another pair at the far side of the pool.  I'd definitely buy them again.
5,$69 for a fantastic pair of speakers is hard to beat. These speakers provide crisp and clear sound even during the rain (outdoors). The mounting hardware it comes with is easy to instal and very durable. This is my third set of these speakers as I've slowly been installing them around the house and outdoors and I can say they last a long time! My oldest pair is now three years old (outdoors) and has been through quite a few hurricanes; no rattling or hissing to be heard!
4,This is my second pair of outdoor speakers.  My first pair were Advents that rusted out after a few years.  I have had them installed about a month now and so far these Yamaha speakers work great.  Sound is full and installation was easy.  I think for the money this is a good buy.  We will have to see if the wire terminals rust like my other set.
5,These are a re-order as we've had them before (over 5 years if not more) and we love them! Perfect outdoor speakers for our deck. Have lasted through rough weather (rain stormsand frigid winters) -- and have even used them in the winter at Cmas time! (out sledding/playing in the snow). I just wish we could find covers for them to help last longer. Very satisfied though!
5,$69 for pair of 120 watt out door speakers!i installed this in my deck to listen to jazz and soft musicbut i believe this will be very noisy house when the kids comes home!i used all the included parts other then the stand because i mounted it on thewall.  make sure the wood screws you used are outdoor screw.i also bought this speaker wire:Menotek Speaker Wire Spool 14AWG 100FT CL2 Rated (In Wall Installation)i am happy with both purchase.
3,This speaker can provide good background music to parties and other activities with the ability to crank up to decent a volume level but if you're looking for solid audio reproduction look elsewhere - this is an outdoor speaker after all. Also you only have 1 axis of rotation once mounted - you can't swivel sideways *and* up/down to aim the sound.  Overall good value.
5,Good speakers.  Range is good with clear tones and enough bass to be heard though not as much as I had thought would be there given the sixe and specs.  Still so far so good.  Using under eaves of house to provide desk music.  They do the job very well with a powerful amp and zone slider controls.  Mounting is nothing special and they are fairly forgiving of wiring gauge.  Overall I'd buy them again.
5,For the value I don't think you could find better indoor/outdoor speakers.These were installed on the pool deck for listening to music and watching tv while outdoors. They perform very well and have a good clean sound. The included mounting brackets allow for vertical or horizontal mounting which is a nice option to have.While the sound is very enjoyable if good bass performance is a must I'd suggest adding an indoor/outdoor woofer (which I'm planning to do).
5,I was looking for a reasonably priced pair of outdoor speakers to mount under my patio cover that would deliver a quality sound.  My son (who knows much more about these things than I do) looked at the specs and said that these should perform as well as other speakers of twice the cost and he was right.  I tied them into my surround sound system and am very pleased with the quality through out the range.  They offer a couple of different installation options and I found them to be an excellent value.
4,They are ok for the money they look nice and were easy to mount. They sound crisp at low levels but can't handle bass or higher levels. My advice is to spend more and get better ones while your at it.
5,Sound great and very straightforward easy to install with provided brackets.
5,I  wanted outdoor sound for quite some time.  I found these to be inexpensive  for outdoor quality speakers. i installed these under the eave of the house 10 feet apart so the sound would be heard for 50 feet to the deck and the pool area connected to the "b" front speakers of my  receiver. WOW we have  Music! Good sound for 150w speakers. really impressed . They look great in white contrast to the house  . We now spend more time outside. Best speaker for the dollar $
5,These really are incredible speakers!  Obviously the sound is the best part but they have a nice hefty feel to them the mounting was easy and they seem like they will be around for a long time.  I have them powered by an Onkyo receiver and 75' feet of 14 gauge wire out to my garage.  Last week I accidentally woke everyone up in the house while washing the car on the driveway to my favorite tunes.  I highly recommend these speakers.
5,I have had a set of these on my outdoor deck for two years & they have worked great.  I just purchased these for my indoor entertainment room right below the deck & the speakers continue to perform well.
5,Mounting the speakers was simple with many flexible options. I mounted these speakers in the soffit above a deck that overlooks a backyard. The sound from the speakers is clear and strong with good sound throughout the volume range. I have a pair of Bose speakers mounted nearby and find that the Yamaha's have better dynamic range (The Bose speakers are 10 years old now).
5,I was a bit skeptical when I saw the great reviews on such inexpensive outdoor speakers.  However I couldn't be happier.  I live close to a freeway and these speakers have plenty of power to rise above the ambient noise and provide great sound.  They seem to be made very well.  I would highly recommend them.Sure you could probably spend more and get better speakers but these sound great regardless of price and absolutely fantastic for the price.
5,Another satisfied customer! Installed 4 days ago on our back deck that was prewired. Paired these with a Yamaha rs202bl receiver. Sound great at low to medium levels. We have neighbors in close proximity so we don't crank it outside. The mounting brackets are nice and sturdy. Took me longer to find my step ladder and tools than it did to mount these.
5,I have four of these installed outdoors tucked under the eaves of my house on the back patio and the porch. They have worked flawlessly so far (about six months.) The bass response is great for such a small speaker. Would definitely buy again.
5,Installed these in a screened-in porch (approximately 12'x12') pointed down (mounted to the ceiling) so we didn't need a ton of power to fill the space--nor did we want to offend our neighbors.  We use them mostly for "background" music and they fit the bill nicely.  Everyone's experience will vary depending on the receiver driving the speakers but the sound is crisp and surprisingly full with our Pioneer VSX-1020-K (connected as the B Speakers).  Have only had them for a week but so far we're extremely satisfied with these!
5,Sounds great for the cost.  I have these speakers installed outside under the roof overhang so they are not in direct contact with rain/snow.  Music is clear throughout the available volume selection.  Note depending on how the speakers are mounted (vertically or horizontally) they can be adjusted up/down or left/right respectively i.e. in one axis only.  I thought I would be able to have more adjustments after mounting but you need a different bracket for that.
4,I bought these to complement some other speakers in my backyard.  These are smaller and definately do not have the horsepower of my other speakers.  However they are very clear and and at low-mid volume sound as good as my higher cost speakers.Install is very simple and the the quality of the enclosures is suprisingly good for the cost.
5,I have these on my screened in patio.  I placed them high on the wall pretty close to the soffit.  I felt this would direct the sound downward rather than out.  I did not try any other placements.  They sound very good considering the poor acoustics of an outdoor environment.  Very enjoyable.
1,Bought another Yamaha outdoor speaker set that I love so I thought I would try these. After about a year the sound started breaking up and now they barely make a sound.
5,I installed these on my patio and they’re working great so far.  Decent sound for the price.  Still testing them for durability.  We’ll see how long they last
4,These speakers sound great. For the money they are the best I've heard. I luckily had in wall surround sound speakers so I just pulled them out drilled through the brick behind them ran another set of speaker wires and then mounted the speakers using a standard drill and a masonry bit. Had to buy some brick/concrete screws also. Easy install great well rounded sound.
5,This is the third set of Yamaha Speakers I have purchased and the sound quality is amazing. These speaker rival my in-door Advent bookcase speakers at about a quarter of the price. I now have these speakers on my patio deck and garage. They are very easy to install and the weight is light enough handle on a ladder with no problems. I prefer them to a set of Boise Speaker that I have on my Dock because of the full range (much better highs and bass).
5,appreciated quick delivery
5,I had an old set And that lasted me like 10 years. I just bought this new set and they were so nice they sound is great and the price is right.
4,The speakers arrived quickly and were a great price.  I'm not done with the addition on my home where these will be mounted yet but a quick test was encouraging.  I have always liked Yamaha equipment and these meet my expectations.  Bass is a bit lacking but that's no surprise.
4,First off  the speakers arrived 4 days early and in perfect shape. Although mounting hardware was non-existant I had no problems installing them to my garage wall. They have a great sound quality..... for the money I have no compaints. They easily blow the doors off other exterior speakers I have heard. Listen to other speakers then decide for yourself.
4,I've just installed the speakers on my deck outside and so far so good. The install wasn't very difficult my only complaint is that the mounting brackets should come with the appropriate screws. Otherwise The speakers are good for outside and since I got such a great price on them I don't have to worry about them getting damaged or stolen.
5,I mounted these under roof on my back porch. They have a great range and actually produce decent bass. Sound quality is impressive. I'd recommend these to anyone needing outdoor speakers and wanting a great sounding AND affordable speaker.
5,These worked EXCELLENT! We bought them for a party we were hosting to be able to have music. It can be tricky to position 4 speakers so there aren't any weird overlaps echoes or dead zones but once we got it we got it. Our family and friends couldn't believe we had it set up all by ourselves with pandora.
5,These speakers are an incredible buy.  I bought two pair for my parent's patio and deck as a Christmas gift.  They sound great and are a breeze to install.  Construction feels solid like most Yamaha products.For the size of the speakers (and price) you get a good amount of bass and an overall great sound.  I'd highly recommend these speakers to anyone looking for a good pair of outdoor speakers but not wanting to break the bank!
4,I have them on my boat
5,These are excellent outdoor speakers.  Sure you could spend more and get more power but who would want to be your neighbor then?  These are mounted on my back porch with a slanted ceiling.  The slanted ceiling pushes the sound down to the patio area and keeps it from projecting too far.  If you did want to annoy your neighbors with these speakers you still could...  They're great.
5,We were really torn between these babies and the higher priced Bose brand. In doing our due diligence we discovered that these were more powerful and hoped that otherwise the quality would compare. We were blown away by the quality and power and would highly recommend. We live on 2/3 of an acre and the back 1/2 acre is filled with music when we turn these speakers up. Love it!
5,Great value I got these speakers and had them up on the back patio in about an hr.  You can't beat the sound for the price and it definitely adds to the feel of the patio having permenant speakers installed.  Much better than bringing an iPod Dock out and worrying about the kids getting it wet or knocking it off the table.
5,These are the best value in an outdoor speaker you can find. Perfect for out at the pool or under the eave on the porch. Good sound quality with enough bass to please most folks easy mounting brackets and holds up well to the elements.
5,Exactly what I wanted. My house sits 150' from the road and I can clearly hear the music from the road. Speakers are mounted to the opposite side of the house facing my back yard. No reason to spend more. Ordering a second pair for th front of the House very soon so I can really piss off my neighbors.
5,Sounds great well worth the price!Havnt had it long enough to test it in brutal weather but so far so good.
5,I purchased these for my outdoor patio area and I must say I was extremely impressed by the quality of the audio and how loud they get luckily I don't have any neighbors but if I did they might be complaining. I will definitely be thinking about purchasing a second set for my garage.
5,I purchased these speakers last month and hung them next to our pool. In late April we had a hail storm come through and cause thousands of dollars of damage to our home & vehicles.  However the Yamaha speakers had ZERO damage to them even though they were exposed to the storm.  I would highly recommend these speakers to anyone shopping for outdoor speakers.  They put out great sound and can hold up to anything mother nature throws @ them.
5,Well made excellent sound and good mounting hardware.  After a couple hours of play they started to break in and are sounding fantastic.  I mounted these under the eve about 8-9 feet above my deck and they fill the backyard with sound without being overly loud up-close.  The bass response is great for any outdoor speaker but especially for their size.  I can't imagine needing the larger version with the 6" woofer. For @ $60 it's a steal.
4,Make sure you have adequate power for these.  I tried running these on a less expensive receiver and they sounded horrible.  Then I hooked them up to a high power Yamaha received and they really kicked in and you can hear their true sound
5,I'm no audiophile but I wanted some outdoor speakers to play some music in my backyard.  Mounted these two guys and ran two 100ft 16AWG Amazon speaker wire to connect them to my Pyle Home PCA4 Mini 2x120 Watt Stereo Power Amplifier.They pump plenty hard enough for me and were a great addition to my birthday party.  Sounded fantastic for everything from sinatra to 50 cent.  Not heavy on the bass but nice and punchy.
5,I have to say I wasn't expecting much with a set of outdoor speakers but im very happy with the sound and and the size of these speakersI and using a Yamaha 7.2 sound system these are my Zone 2 speakers and sounds very nice outsideI would recommend these for clean crisp sound but dont expect them to put out a lot of bass outdoor speakers don't  do that very well with the acoustics of the great outdoors
4,Sounds good on the dock.  Not much bass but kinda what I expected
5,I bought these for my boat. Clear sound OK base powerful enough to hear over engine noise. They are great quality feel sturdy. They come with several mounting options so they can fit almost anywhere. They are in a covered pilot house so do not have direct exposure to the elements. Time will tell if the resist rust but seem to be well presearved.
1,These were easy to set up and worked very well for the most part. The sound became muffled at higher volumes but I could get over it for the price but after owning these for roughly 7 months (2 months of semi heavy use during the warmer season) I got back out in the yard and wanted some tunes and to my surprise they kept setting my receiver off and making it pop a code of check speaker wire. I hooked them up with new wiring and same thing. I found out they both had already went out after only 7 months so I just replaced with the Polk audio set and I have to say the Polk speakers are a must have. They sound better volume much higher bass is out of this world and for 120 bucks more I feel confident in my replacements. Spend the extra money and stay away from these cheap duds.
5,if your looking to turn your backyard into a rock concert these aren't for you... nothing in this price range is. If you're looking for good speakers to fill your yard with clear good sounding music at normal to slightly above normal levels than these fit your needs.I think they are fantastic for the money.
5,Went up easy sound great!
5,this is my second pair.  had the first pair for a year and decided to add two more to my set up.  They sound great especially for the price.  mounting them is easy too great hardware.  they stand up to the weather too.  i took them down in the winter but left them out for fall summer and spring in new england and no problems.
4,Great chill speakers for around my outdoor hot tub. If you want them for a party to rock out I suggest another. Limited base response but great mid & high.
5,I put these speakers on the side of my house on the deck where the previous owners had 2 cheap speakers and what a difference.  These sound so much better.  I live in a cold climate so I took them off and brought them inside during the winter but they've been solid and great sounding through every other element.
1,UPDATE: Speakers seem to have blown? or something after about 5 months of use. Nothing but muffled quiet sound comes from them and they are useless now. We don’t even turn them very high since dogs have sensitive hearing. They have been used for light calming background music (classical) in the dog area. Not sure if these were duds or what. : (Original Review just after install. I run a shelter and needed a hardy speaker to mount in our newly remodeled dog building. These worked perfectly! It's a 60' building and I used a speaker on each end. It's just about perfect. I was thinking maybe one more in the middle but I think the two will be ok. Sound is great and I don't turn it up much - the sounds travels well. So far so good. Easy to mount. Sturdy and very easy to install. Hard to find a decent white/grey set.
5,Great quality sound and easy install.
5,I have been listening to them Outback behind my house for the past week. There is no way that you can get Better Sound for the price. They sound great.
5,I am using these as spot monitors for a church group.No more  monster speakers on the floor.Driving them with a four channel (100 Watts each) ampliphier.Could not have asked for more.
4,Nice unobtrusive look on my deck.  Sound is decent but it's pretty directional.  If I  get off to the side of the house I can't really hear them which isn't a bad thing when you live on a tiny lot in a subdivision.
5,We purchased these speakers to replace some off-brand we had for a year which had to be replaced 2X.  We decided to try these instead and WOW the sound is fantastic (we thought the off-brand sounded good-but nothing like this) We have only had them 1 season but so far they have survived  extreme heat drought and now  torrential rains.... We'll see how they handle a Nebraska Panhandle winter!  All in all they are a really nice pair of outdoor spearkers. A real Bargin for the $$
4,These inexpensive speakers sound great at 10ft height casting audio across my 75-ft deep back yard. Considering the size and price the bass sounds great. Vocals come through slightly muddled.These speakers are good for someone who wants an inexpensive all-weather product. Just don't expect a premium audio experience. Installation was easy.
5,These were satellites to larger Yamaha's we have in another are of the patio so I was a bit concerned about whether they woudl have enough bass but they sound great.  crisp treble and very little distortion even with deeper bass.  They look great too.
5,GREAT SPEAKERS. GREAT SOUND FOR THE PRICE/SIZE OF THEM. I HAVE THEM HOOKED UP TO A SMALL AMP FOR MY BACKYARD PATIO. I TESTED THEM AT FULL VOLUME AND DISTORTION WAS MINIMAL IF ANY.
5,nice sounding speakers I have a nice yamaha stereo amp with 80w of clean power going to them. The speakers sound clean crisp and clear. You can never really expect a lot of bass out of smaller speakers so I would recommend a subwoofer to complete the system however my neighbors are probably happy i havnet gotten a subwoofer. good price and I would buy them again given the choice. amazon  shipped item quickly and well packaged.update 5 years later speakers still work great.
5,Speakers work and look great. I have a small amp and it drives them fine. The base is not much but I can't stand boom-boom music anyway. If you want a lot of base get a power woofer.These were supposed to be a used pair but all the hardware was still sealed in the manufacture's plastic bags.Not marred in any way and work fine. Must have been a return I guess.
4,Great sound powering them with an inexpensive Yamaha amp and they sound just great for the backyard pool area.  Just wish the mount was a little more flexible when mounted vertically you can only swivel them up and down not sideways like I needed them to.
5,Bought these speakers to install on my deck. I have them connect to a Yamaha 300w receiver and they sound great. I really cant imagine a better deal on a set of speakers and I will be purchasing at least two more sets.  I'd llike to test some of those rock speakers as well. My neighbors are lovin it too.
5,High quality sound and very solidly constructed.  They are intended for outdoor use have metal cases and are therefore considerably sturdier than indoor speakers in wooden cases a factor which should be taken into consideration before ordering.  All in all very pleased.
5,Great sound easy installation quality brakcket included strong speaker wire terminals 50% price of Best Buy same speaker. What’s not to love.Looking forward to longevity described by other reviewers.
4,the speakers sound really good. the mounting brackets only allow you to mount them vertically. i need to hang them from a over hang. that was my only issue.
5,Incredible sound for the price.
5,As always with Amazon the delivery was quick.  Installation of the speakers was relatively easy - the most confusing part had nothing to do with the speakers but with figuring out which speaker wires were which of the ones installed prior to us owning the house.  The sound quality is good and the mounting was easy.  We'll see next Spring how well they weather the winter under a wide overhang on our deck.
5,I purchased these speakers to hookup to my receiver's zone 2 connectors for use on my back porch.  I have been very impressed with the sound quality of these.  I have not cranked them up too much (in respect of the neighbors) but the range that I have used them in they sound tremendous.  I know some would like more bass out of these but I am really not noticing a lack in this area.  They work great for my needs!
5,Super fast delivery  item arrived as advertisedafter months in rain and HOT Arizona sun works as newand sound is great by my poolupdate:after 3 years of Arizona's hot summers (115 f.) and monsoon heavy rains  winter freeze temps by outside pool speakers still work like newWOW A++++
5,Very impressed with the wide range sound and physical manufactured quality of these speakers. Set them up as surround back speakers on my home entertainment center system and was very impressed the power capabilities as well. Can't wait to set them up out on the patio..
4,Awesome sound quality however i had them for a year and a half and they are turning yellow already!
5,Sound is amazing. Use it outside by firepit working in the yard. Can clearly hear it volume at 1/2 capacity up to 50-75 yard away
4,They sound great. I have an inexpensive Sony STR-DH130 (90 watts / channel) bought at Best Buy driving them. I have to turn it up considerably to get much sound outside but hey I kinda expected that.I would love to hear them with a quality amp driving them.
4,On my second set of these - the last ones stayed with the house I sold. Nothing special about the sound - good clarity very neutral but lacking any kind of real low end depth. In other words solid outdoor speakers. But what a bargain for $70!
5,Outdoor speakers have 4 in full contact to Florida outdoor elements - hold up great and decent sound quality for the price
4,Great speakers good sound wish they had a WiFi product
4,Awesome loving my speakers by pool side
3,Purchased in 2010 and are worthless at start of 2017 season.  These have been mounted in a garage subject to heat and cold.  I gave them 3 stars because they lasted 6 seasons.  My KLM speakers mounted on the deck are years older and still going strong.
4,Mounted in my garage and wired to an older receiver... Really easy to install and sound great.  Pleased with the purchase.
5,Sounds great. Great price!
5,These speakers are awesome!  I installed them outside on my back patio and they work and sound great.  I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality and sound for only $75 for the pair and they were easy to install.  I would highly recommend these for either an exterior or interior application.
5,Can't beat the price for the quality of sound these speakers produce.  Surprised at the fullness of sound.  The bass & Mid are important for me in terms of outdoor use.  Because of the sound quality in these two areas you are not forced to turn the volume up to a higher level thus no distortion of the sound or a screeching treble sound.  I would definitely recommend these speakers.
5,These are great speakers. My husband put them up over the weekend and wow what spectacular sound. It was packaged well and came with all the mounting necessities. We love listening to 50's jazz and the crispness of the cymbals and the brushes on the snare give you chills. Never again will we go back to large bulky speakers. These are on the wall and out of the way. The seller got them to us quickly and we want to thank you Amazon for being there yet again. Sincerely The Escondio Macs
5,It took my husband about 15minutes to get both speakers installed under our deck.  I would imagine it didn't take that long because the wires were already run.  However the directions were easy to follow and I am so glad that my research paid off.  They sounds great too (minor buzzing but we determined it was from the safety wire and fixed the problem).  Love them!!!  Great value!!!
5,These are great speakers.  Purchased for our outdoor patio and pool area.  Sound is exceptional given the price of these speakers.  The housing is also very durable.  Easy to mount and install.  The mounting brackets are well designed and allow for easy repositioning when necessary.  I've been using them all summer and would recommend them for their quality and value.
4,Great value. Not hi-fi obviously but a solid pair of outdoor speakers for the money.
1,Be wary when ordering through Amazon Warehouse deals. Turns out that "A small cosmetic imperfection on the top and side of the item." could also mean...  "One speaker has been sunburnt so badly that it has transmogrified into an overcooked lobster and looks a bit silly next to its pasty white partner."I know I know. "You bought a used item what did you expect? A pristine glossy white work of art in speaker form?"I actually considered not giving such a harsh 1-star rating for a used warehouse item but then I realized that if this speaker was sunburnt that badly before Amazon's 30-day return policy kicked in for the previous owner then the speakers weren't properly manufactured for "outdoor use" and actually deserve the poor rating. I'll be looking for something in black...
3,Had these speakers for about a good 2 weeks. I cranked them up about half way and they blew out. I replaced them with the bose 251 outdoor system. In my opinion if you have a small backyard these will do the job. I prefer to go with good quality but these are decent speakers.
3,They probably sound good but the mounting bracket didn't work in a corner up on the ceiling. After looking at it go a while I decided not to build a mount so I returned them.  Check the docs on the mount before you buy These.
3,While the speakers do 'look' like great quality speakers these speakders do not sound good at all.  We bought them for an inside project and were planning to buy more however will have to move these outside (where sound quality isn't as important) and purchase something different for inside the house.
4,Great price and the sound is good. Would have liked a little more base but I'm happy. Will probably buy another pair for the rear. Have them installed under a 900 square foot porch. Easy install.
5,These set up and install on a wall outdoors in a snap.  Sound quality is great.  I returned teh Bose speakers my wife got me for christmas ($$$) and was able to purchase these a new receiver all the cabling and speaker wire I needed combined for less that the Bose.  I don't miss the difference in sound quality for a pair of outdoor speakers.
5,Excellent sound for outdoor speakers.  I bought for my patio and I so happy because they have a great quality of sound and power.
5,These speakers are exactly what we were looking for. Great sound size and easy to install. Great buy!
4,Had these for about a month now. They are just what they say they are. I had higher end Bose speakers before but for the money these are great. I got mine for $53.00 a pair. Surprising bass out of these speakers. I would reccomend them to my friends.
4,Bought these for zoning music listening and television on our back deck while in the hot tub. Easy to install and sounds fine! Looks good. I am a little worried about the white yellowing after time but the black ones were not available for this price.
5,I hooked these up under my deck to my onyko 818 on zone2. I was amazed at how well they sounded. I live on a lake and I placed the volume about 50% up on the other side of the lake (1/3 mile) I could still here make out the words to a song!!! I will have to be careful with these...
5,I chose these speakers to replace some outdoor speakers on my pool house.  Man these have way better sound than the ones that were up there.  They look good stylish and the sound is awesome.  I think I saw the same ones at Best Buy @$99.95 a pair.  You cant beat this price and this quality.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
1,I have ordered these several times for our neighborhood pool. Sadly they do not seem to last very long. So I have to agree with the other one star ratings. I though the guards were turning up the sound system too high but I am coming to believe that it is truly the speakers after all. My public apology to the guards! I am using the speakers which are rated at 150 watts on a Yamaha R-S202BL Stereo Receiver which is rated at 100 watts  per channel so they should not blow. Will try something else for next season. One would think that going with Yamaha for both would be the best alternative but apparently not. Yamaha please feel free to chime in...
5,Sound good for the price. They look good and Yamaha is a good brand so they show well. Good bang for the buck.
5,They are great.  I don't blast them super loud...so I can say how the do when cranked up.  Not a ton of bass but really nice for ambient music on my deck.  One month in and I'm happy so far.
5,These are Great Speakers for the price. I just installed them replacing my old speakers what a big difference these speakers made. Bring on the Party!!! The sound was crystal clear and these speakers can deliver some power.The installation was a piece of cake it only took 20 minutes to install them.I highly recommend these speakers for anyone who is looking for good speakers at a great price.
5,This is my second pair of these speakers they do what you need them to do without question. May not be for the audiophiles out there but at the price you can't beat them!
5,Very nice speakers i bought 8 put them all outside sound very nice and great size
4,Sounds good and easy install
5,Sound is perfect just make sure you pair these with the proper receiver for the necessary power
5,So far so good. Sounds better the the old Bose speakers I had which blew after 2only 2 years if light use. Definitely recommend these soeakers.
4,The speakers are great if you're next to them but they don't project well over large spaces.  I will buy 2 more to put by the pool so the sound isn't blaring from the house to be heard.  Sound is fair.
4,I attached these speakers to my house under an overhang and they service my new deck. Good sound clean look and seem well built. They get some exposure to the rain/snow and work in the freezing temperatures this winter while using my hot tub.
5,My go-to outdoor speakers.  I own two other pairs and they work flawlessly and have for years.  Incredible sound.  Highly recommended.
4,I was very impressed how these performed for their size and cost.  Great value.I love loud music with plenty of bass.  These are not for that but they are great for out by the fire for background music.
5,After a deck remodel I wanted to upgrade the sound . These are driven by a Sonos amp and sound superb .  I Demo'd a 175 dollar pair of polks on the same amp and these are on par all the way through the range . Highly recommend .
5,I have these both indoor and outdoor mounted throughout my house.  So far I've loved them.  There were easy to interior wall- and exterior-siding mount and the brackets are doing a great job holding them up.  I made sure to put them directly under exterior overhangs so I'll never have to test their direct waterproofing but so far so good!
5,Not a lot of base but you don't always want a lot either.  Bought these for the front speakers for a television in a 2 only setup and they are perfect.  Because they are carrying the speech portion as well as everything else I didn't want a lot of base.  I replaced a $300 pair of speakers with these and like these much better.
5,Se instaló en una terraza. Es decorativa.
5,These speakers are great! They have much better bass response than my KLH speakers they replaced. They have nice brackets for mounting them also. It would be nice to have brackets that swivel in more directions than these but they are good enough. They swivel either up and down or side to side depending on which way you mount them but not both directions.
5,outside quality very good.
3,Chalking this one up to a factory dud but only one of the speakers was 100% functional out of the box.  The other played at (guesstimate) 30% of the other.On a positive note the look really nice seem well constructed (aside from functionality issue) and come with a ton of mounting options.  The banana post/screw-down connection in the back is a huge bonus.
5,Great sharp speakers i have an older 200W onkyo amp driving them outside. While they have an good midrange bass they really need a sub-woofer to do them justice. I have a screened in porch with a hollow wicker end table that contains the amp and sub-woofer (and a bluetooth adapter for my phone) and they have sounded great.
5,Everythings great so far. Paired with a cheap pyle receiver and theyre clear sounding.
5,These speakers were/are exactly what I had hoped.  We actually have them in our kitchen against a white wall.  The sound is excellent for their size.  The mounting was easy and I liked that I could turn them downward since we have them against the ceiling.  I would highly recommend these speakers for a small to medium room or patio.
5,Very nice speakers all accessories included I used the wall mount brackets but standalone brackets were included too.
5,We love these speakers. Over the past 8 years we have purchased 5 pair of them. They are on the front porch the back porch in the master bathroom the kitchen and over our fire pit! Great quality and sound!
5,very loud and clear.  my wife complained the second day I grilled outside and was jamming!  easy installation....especially if vertical.
4,Great delivery time product as advertised. Only issue was that I coupled this order with another that Amazon fulfilled and that item was crushed under the weight of the speaker box. Didn't care much for that.
5,These are great speakers for the price! Sound is very good for outdoor listening. We have them on the ground by our planters across from the pool. Love them!
4,Basic outdoor wired speakers.  Good sound quality.  Easy to mount under the eaves.  Small safety wire attaching speaker to mounting bracket is a nice addition.
5,GOOD SPEAKERS! Mounted 4 in a fellowship hall at church. Put out good sound for the room. Better than our little sound bar did :)
5,We bought these to go out side our garage and the sound id great
5,Excellent outdoor speaker n sound!
5,I'm glad I'm the one with these speakers not my neighbors.  I bought a pair 2 years ago for my outdoor stereo.  I finally got around to adding another set.  These are durable and sound great.I play some really bad music ask my wife and friend and it all sounds great on these speakers.
4,Great value for outdoor speakers we installed by deck and they are wonderful out there hooked up through some speakerwire to an amp and Spotify and Music on Computer Sound qulaity is perfect for back yard areas campgrounds ext.
5,Not as loud as I hoped other than that it’s great.
4,Bought 4; to hang outside around pool.  Only have two up so far and they sound great.
5,These speakers have great quality sound for outdoor use. I have them under the eaves of the house so no too much to worry about weather. Just have to watch for birds nesting on them.
4,The sound is fine my my use but for any one wanting to really entertain these speakers don't have much of any "thump" to them. You can always add a speaker for this though.
5,Very pleased with the sound from these speakers. I installed them under the eaves on my back porch. They are a little larger than I expected but they blend in and arent even noticeable. The included brackets allow for a decent range of motion for installation. My only complaint would be the lack of screws for installation - 4 wood screws or sheet metal screws would have been nice.
4,Better price than most outdoor speakers and have stood up to weather well so far (not fully exposed but am in Florida so moisture/humidity is a given and heavy at times). Would recommend.
5,I bought these as  a pair to accompany my Polk Audio speakers run with a Sub Woofer for my work area. I can crank them up and no distortion only clean clear sound. I am powering them with a Sony 200 watt per channel amp mostly using FM and my I-pod.
5,Great outdoor speakers for a small area like our porch. We've had them a couple of years now and still working great! We bring them inside during the winter.
4,Very nice quality and look great above my deck. Puts out a nice sound even when volume is up high.
4,These sound good not great with bass...not to bad. I would buy them again.
4,These are under a cover but outside at our dock.  Great sound for application.  No base (as expected) so if you are looking for a good beat get an amp.
4,Have them connected to a Sonos Connect Amp.  Sound is good but the Sonos is a little under powered for them. Gonna switch to a Connect Pre-amp & 2 channel Amp.
4,Speakers have a nice stand base option that allow placing the speakers on a table or shelf.  The sound quality is good for the size and price but requires significant volume from a 110 watt surround sound Yamaha receiver which was not expected.  Overall a good performer.
4,More than met my expectations. They have a clear great sound with a lot of depth.
5,The whole backyard is surrounded with these speakers.  I bought 2 sets one for each corner of the back yard.  The sound quality if superb!  Perfect for summer BBQ's and parties at our house!
5,first of all for the price this speakers are REALLY good. i mean bass treble all seems to be fine. I use them on an Yamaha amplifier and installed them on the porch. very happy getting 2 more
4,These speakers provide a much higher sound quality than you  are paying for. That being said these speakers are not very expensive. Overall they sound good and if they hold up they are very much a good buy.
4,Look and sound good. Yamaha includes brackets stands and safety straps. Heavy-duty terminals. The only thing I would have liked is a bit more bass but the sound is nice and smooth.
5,Bang for your buck.
2,I bought these based upon what other reviewers said about their great sound quality.  Unfortunately I'm not hearing what they're hearing.  I listen to mainly hip hop electronic and soul.  The bass is entirely inadequate for hip hop; it sounds roughly like a boombox's speakers turned way up.  The sound is also very hollow with vocals seeming to come from behind drywall.  Also I'm using these indoors in a small room so I can't blame it on the sound being washed out by outdoors noise and wind.  Simply speaking they just lack that crispness tightness and depth that I expect from decent speakers.
5,These have worked great on my deck. They are compact but have good sound and coverage of most of the back yard. The rain doesn't seem to matter. I recommend them especially at the price.
5,Excellent value. They replace a $400 Klipsch speaker that failed. Good sound quality at a great price.
2,I was very disappointed with the AW150's and have now returned them.  They simply don't produce enough volume or bass that is adequate for outdoor listening.  These speakers were to go outside along the wall by our pool but as soon as we turned them up loud enough to hear them as background music they got extremely fuzzy and just sounded terrible.  if the volume is turned down they are ok.  but nothing more.  just ok.  i was optimistic after reading other reviews but these AW150s just didn't' live up to the hype.  I got the polk Atrium 5 as replacements and am very satisfied with them.
5,Man these speakers are GREAT!  Used them in conjunction with a lil Pyle amp so I could hook up my Sirius satellite radio boombox to outside speakers via the headphone jack.  These speakers sound FANTASTIC!! Plenty of bass crisp treble and everything from Buffett to Zeppelin sounds great and fills the yard! 100% happy with these!
5,excellent sound excellent size not TOO BiG  and not tiny either  I installed my self female 5'3I connected the speakers to a old RCA sound system I was not using and its just great! enough sound for the party I had I'm sure all the neighbors heated me that night :)
4,Purchased these speakers for 70 bucks didnt expect alot they are well made light easy to handle and install. used them for about 2 weeks fill an average yard with a clear sound; perfect for an inexpensive backyard solution.
5,love the product.
5,Great Sound. Great quality. A very sound buy (Pun Intended). Easy to install. I have them mounted under my garage eaves next to my pool. The speakers are very clear and the white color blend in well against the color of my garage. I highly recommend.
5,I've had these up through just a few rainy days and seem to work great still. It wasn't my idea to leave them exposed because I was a bit concerned water resistant or water proof? Mounting was very easy without needing any instructions
5,I bought these speakers after reading reviews on here.  I wasn't disappointed.  I have these mounted under the eave of my house facing a gazebo.  The bass is better than I expected.  The item description says speaker wire is included but there was none with mine.  I'd definitely say these are well worth the money.
4,While we have not installed them yet I know they work well because our neighbor has them and we always enjoy the tunes coming out of them when we are there.
4,These speakers work really nice out around the pool. We had to replace the ones that we had because they didn't work anymore. We chose these and they are great.
2,We bought these in summer 2018. At the beginning of the year they started failing and are now dead. What a joke. These are under a covered patio.
5,Nice
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Fantastic sound and exceptional housing. SO much better than the cheaper off brand speakers
5,So far we are enjoying these speakers on our deck.  The sound quality is good.  They were easy to install.  We mounted them under the eves on either side of our patio doors. We have a pretty large deck area but the sound has been good wherever you are sitting.
5,Bought these for my dad to put out by his pool.  They were easy to install and sound GREAT.  I then ordered another set of these speakers for my boyfriend.  He raves over them.  And ocassionally turns them up too loud jusst because he can.  ;-)
5,These speakers pack a serious punch for the size. I have four on my patio (which is probably over kill) and they sound amazing. I didn't even need to purchase a subwoofer.
5,I've connected two pair of these speakers to an older Onkyo 717Pro AV receiver for use by our pool. The sound is great with plenty of volume. I either use my laptop or an iPhone for streaming from Pandora. It took longer to run the speaker wire than to mount the speakers. I am very happy with the product.
5,I purchased these in the summer for my outside screened porch.  They are perfect and sound great.  My brother who is an engineer told me to buy them after he purchased them.  He did all the research and found these to be the best value for the product!
5,Sounds amazing with my Onkyo TX-8050 Receiver.  These things rock for the price! I have hard wired on my porch and after the summer and now winter they still rock. I have them about 7 feet apart and this seems to be the perfect distance.
5,Great speakers for my huge party room...The 4 of these fill my space with rich sound....
3,I have had these speakers mounted under my eaves facing the pool area for the last two seasons.  I noticed one stopped working at the end of summer.  Sounds was always decent.  But plastic sun fades.  I expected them to last longer than two years.  Hence my three star review.
4,These have worked well all summer on the deck - don't have the base that my old Bose did - but doesn't have the price tag either...
4,nice sound and still works after years of exposed weather.
5,Performs as advertised. Easy to assemble and hang. Benefit of several mounting options with hardware included. I have these outside on my patio and they produce very good sound. They are weighty but that in my mind is a good thing (shielding?). At any rate definitely recommend these.
4,We like the sound of these speakers. Could only purchase (5) sets needed about (18) maybe I need to speak with someone because we have several more classrooms to do in schools.
2,Bought in September 2020 and already one speaker quit working
5,These replaced a pair of 30 year-old Bose speakers which I'm sure were much more expensive even at that time.Pleased to say that these sound just as good if not better and were quick and easy to install.The security cables were a brilliant stroke protecting the speakers from crashing to the ground when mounting.Good thinking Yamaha.
4,nice looking speakers bought theses along with 3 other pairs of cheap indoor outdoors sets. they were def a step above the others with solid brackets and connectors. great sound for the size.
5,Just added a deck to the house and got these speakers to finish off the space. Cant say enough on the sound quality and the mounting brackets offer many hanging options. I had some friends over for a bbq and they went and bought some as well. Buy them while you can!!
2,I purchased this product with the notion of "you get what you pay for" but in this case I got less. While the sound quality is decent I could not play this louder than 1/4 of range of the volume control of my stereo. I would hear crackles and pops once I got past the quarter mark on my volume control. Alas this came to close to a deadline and had no choice but to use it. I had to keep volumes at a minimum and reduce bass to 1/2 on my eq. I would not recommend this for outdoor us.
5,Speakers work great. perfect for outside. I attached these to my 3 seasons porch with a bluetooth amplifier and work perfect while we are in the pool or just sitting by the fire.
4,I have mounted these speakers on my front porch and they are perfect to cover smaller outdoor spaces.  They sound great for the cost and they came with nice mounting gear.  I would recommend.
3,Sound good but don’t let them get wet they will quit working.
4,Replaced outside units with these and they sound great!  Easy install and easy to position.  I would recommend.
4,Great sound! Out of an inexpensive speaker..  Read the reviews and the ratings have it right! This is the one to buy
4,I use them under my eves for sound out to the pool. They work great and are weather proof so this makes them perfect for Florida weather.
5,They work great and look great much bigger in person than I realize so they look extra nice. I like the up and down adjustability!
4,at 1/4 of the price of my other outdoor speakers they are a bargain.  They sound good not fantastic but really good for the price.
5,Just got these today.  Well packaged easy to install and sound GREAT!  Really the highs and lows are distinct and full.  I am very impressed and pleased.
4,Great sound. Nice speaker.
5,Unbelievably easy to install and the sound quality is terrific.  The speakers are on each side of our covered deck and have a clarity and sound quality that made our recent Friday evening guests take notice and ask about them...  Highly recommended.
5,My hubby waited til I left town to order these speakers for our attached garage.  He REALLY NEEDED surround sound when he washes our cars!!! So this along with the speaker wire and a new receiver gave him a good project to work on.  It actually sound great.
5,I mounted these on my boat last weekend and they sound fantastic! They look very nice an they don't take much power to run. No complaints here. The price can't be beat either. Just keep in mind they are low wattage speakers so don't blow them.
5,Client wantef a new pair of speakers for her boat deck. Very impressed with sound look and price.
4,Work great not too big but fills my back yard and patio with enough sound.  Just wish the mounts where a little more adjustable.
4,good speakers for the money
4,Worked fine for one summer.  When I went to put them back out this year all four terminals broke.  Not happy at all.
5,Always been fan of Yamaha speakers and felt you got a lot for your money but these take the cake. Nice sound pleasing appearance and easy to install. What more could someone possibly want for $60? I installed these on my new deck and could not be more pleased with them.
5,Awesome sound on my back porch... Very easy to install...  Love em so far
4,Very good speakers for the money. Complete sound and full range.They look good install easily and produce a nice pitch. I would recommend them.
4,For as little as these cost they are totally woth every penny. They do not have Bose sound quality though so don't expect that but they do sound good.
4,Great sounding speakers. But there are better ones in the same price range. But I am happy with them.
5,Fantastic range.  Surprisingly good lows.Extremely easy to mount though limited angle if you are mounting under an overhang.Ive had these in almost continuous use for 6 months.  No issues at all.
5,Bought a pair of these for my outside surround sound system. Do not use them enough!! They seem to stand up to the weather although they do not experience any direct water or sunlight since they are under an awning. Sound quality is decent for the price.
3,I have had these in place for less than 2 years  looks like the texas weather has finally gotten the better of them. Both units were water logged when I removed them  from the brackets. Have served me well  just a shame about the lifespan.
4,We decided to find built in speakers but these appeared exactly as advertised.  Good price and would buy again if I found a need.
5,These speakers have a quality sound and are well constructed. Included brackets are sturdy. I purchased these speakers so the music would  soften the porch. They look nice installed and are well worth the price.
5,Very happy with the crisp quality sound of these speakers.  We use them a lot entertaining guests and I get a lot of compliments on the sound.  They can handle loud and sound just as good when they are turn down low.
5,These speakers sound pretty awesome for the price. We installed 3 pairs on our vacation home and they make drinking Rum that much more fun!
5,Very impressed by the sound. I was expecting a little better than the 15 year old JBL outdoor speakers that I had and I was pleasantly surprised. The sound quality is awesome! Great highs decent lows. I highly recomend these for anyone looking for outdoor speakers.
4,Solid speakers.  Not as loud as I'd hoped but definitely a great buy for your deck.
5,I am very happy with the set of Yamaha speakers. They came in the time frame quoted were easy to install look good and even better they sound great. If your looking for a little music by the pool these speakers will do the trick.
4,Great speakers. Good price. Little bit of tin sound but you will get used to it.
4,While these speakers will not blow you out of a room the do have good sound quality and look good. I am more than happy with them.
5,Paired this up with a Lepai Amp sold here on Amazon and it filled my pool area with sound. Very impressive. Good bass and sound Run order these now if you are debating you will not be disappointed.Great buy for the money
5,I couldn't be happier with this purchase. I installed them myself at my family's ranch house and connected them to a cheap Insignia 200w receiver and the sound is amazing (and loud!).  I would recommend these to anyone that's on a budget and wants great sound quality.
4,I installed them on a backyard deck with a low end Sherwood receiver and was very pleased with the sound.  Not audiophile quality but for the money a great value!
4,Sound Is pretty good.  The mounting brackets are a little chincy.  Overall a good value.  Would recommend to anyone  who wants some backyard speakers.
4,Sound great. Look good too.Moderate Bass response.
5,installed these to move from 5.1 to 7.1 surround. Sound is great and the sturdy mounting brackets saved me $$. total bracket rotation possible is about 90 degrees (+/- 45 deg from straight). perfect for me but review your need for positioning.
4,Speaker sound great bargain for your money.
4,Very solid performing speaker for the money.  I bought a second set.
5,I hooked them up last weekend and were blown away by the sound. We kept switching back and forth between then and our Bose system and could not believe how close they were considering the difference in price. And they look great on our wall outside!
5,I was replacing another brand which seemed to have a "tinny" sound.These Yamaha speakers-- to my semi-informed ear-- have very good sound quality very nice gold "screw-down" speaker wire connector (as opposed to the "clip-down" on my last) and the mounting brackets were versatile.All in all good performance for  a reasonable price -- a great buy.
4,Great product. I don't give 5 stars because the voice quality isn't as best as I expected but for the price it's OK.
5,Great sound huge value compared to other big name brands. I purchased 4 pairs for a 7.1 surround system and the clarity and frequency response is excellent for both movie dialog and music. Again huge value light weight and certainly weather proof!!
4,LOVE THESE SPEAKERS. They work great for every day use. No issues with sound quality or static. I am going to purchase more for the house
4,These Yamaha speakers sound very good so far..only had them up for a couple of weeks.  Not powerhouses but good full sound.
5,Used these in my garage and my backyard to set up two bluetooth systems. Bought speakers mini amp and bluetooth music streamer for each location.they deliiver enough sound to fill my backyard well with music and also on movie nights.
4,Works well easy to set up
5,I bought a pair of these over a month ago to mount on my covered front porch.  They performed so well that I bought another pair to mount on the back of my house.Great sound quality for the price and well built.
5,Great speakers. They are loud and sound great. They rock the back yard during parties. The only problem is the neighbors aren't very happy with my purchase...
5,We have had these for a couple of months now and they work better then expected.  They are not completely exposed so i hope that they will stand the test of time as well.  Great sound for a great price.
4,What can I say? They sound clear and look very  nice. what more could you want? We'll see how they hold up through the seasons.
5,great sound.  easy  to  install.  have  worked  without  issue  for  almost a  year of rain  Sun  and  snow. easy  decision  to  buy  with  no  downside.
5,Great speakers at a great price.  I have these mounted underneath my carport.  They provide a very nice sound for playing radio / internet radio.  I have them attached to my Yamaha RX-V675 receiver (zone 2).
4,Very loud  strong built .Good baseThe sound is a little bit poor .There is no a mid sound
5,Was very sceptical about purchasing these speakers my husband is all about music and the sound quality. He was a firm believer the more you pay the better the sound.. I fooled him! this was a great deal and it is past the sound quality..an outstanding value for the quality.Thanks!
5,Nothing better than a little a back deck music through the summers.  Sound quailty is second to none for the value of these speakers.  Easy to mount and disassemble at the end of the year.  Definately a must a have for summer time entertainers!
5,Speakers sound great.  Finally got them installed last week. Installation worked well.  Overall the sound is great.  I have them outside on my deck.  So the real test will be in 6 months or so after they are exposed outside for awhile.
5,great speakers for the price.  i had outdoor speakers at my last house and they still sounded great after 7 years.  i hope these keep going that long!  installed under the eaves so they are somewhat protected.  live in the northeast so cold winters - we'll see.
4,These came with several mounting options  Basic easy hook up.  Sound quality isn't  bad for a 2 way speaker..  Nice!
4,I put these on my wharf. They sound great just what I was looking for. I would get another pair for outside the house.
4,These speakers work very well outside have had them for a couple of years and they still sound fine.
3,Still working after a season outdoors.It's now almost a full year since receiving these speakers and one has blown.
4,I doubt you can get the sound and quality at this price the design is even cool ... lov them
4,They are not obtrusive at all. I think anybody would love to have a set of speakers like.
2,I put these on an outdoor pool patio (4X).  I drive them with a harmon Kardon receiver.  The performance is ok for the size but I end up connecting larger speakers when we want to crank it up for a party.  I have them under eves with some protection.  They've been working for more than a year now.Update:  2 of the 4 are toast.  not sure why but maybe driven a little hard
5,Looks nice sounds good
4,Title says it all. Easy to install look nice but don't make the bet sound. For the price they're great just wish a little better.
5,Great speakers for out doors under a covered open area.  Very loud.  I have paired this with a sony head unit /amp and it is working great.  Would also be great indoor speakers as well.
4,Great speakers for the price. They look nice and sound great. I put them outside at the pool and they work and sound great.
5,I have a 4 zone sound system in my house and these work perfectly outside.They were easy to install (under the eves) and sound amazing in our BBQ and Pool area.I would definitely recommend them.
4,Nice speakers at this price.
5,The price was so good I thought there was a catch. These things sound sooo good. I only have them hooked up to a crappy Boombox and mounted on my Garage by my patio. But a vast improvement from the old speakers I had. What a great deal and easy to install.
5,Bought these half off because package was damaged. They are as good as new and have incredible sound. Not a whole lot of bass but have mine setup with a surround system which includes a subwoofer so it compliments nicely.
4,just hooked them up and I am very pleased how they sound.build quality seems to be very sturdy and nice.
4,These speakers are nothing fancy but they have a good sound for the price.  They will get the job done.
5,These are really great speakers for the price.  They sound great and are a good size.  They come with any mounting options you might need.  Definitely (for me) not worth paying more for competitor speakers.
5,The speakers are awesome. .I have them on my patio and they sound superb....Great sound very clear and also a little bass depending on where there placed...if your looking for great sounding speakers at a great price look no further...
4,Very good sound from these speakers. They handle soft and loud volume with equal clarity. Very easy to mount as well.
5,I live in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area and have had these speakers for a little over two years now.They have held up to extreme weather conditions and still sound great! The amount of bass you get from them is incredible! Well worth the price!
5,I installed these almost a year ago and they seem to have weathered the cold Wisconsin winter just fine. They sound fantastic especially given the poor acoustic qualities of a lawn. Plenty loud too.
4,Speakers work fine recieved them on time. I got what i Orderered. Very easy to install and has diferrent options to mount them.
1,Very happy and well worth the money. One week later I decided to order another pair and amazon raised there prices by $10.00. That's the downside of giving good reviews .Either  way it is a very good buy. Well I rated them a five at first and bought a pair a while back. When I went to install the new pair to replace the bad ones I could see why they are failing. Both speakers were full of water and they claim to be outdoors. This new set I drilled holes in the bottom to release the water that gets inside of them and drowns them out. I will not be buying anymore. You got me twice. I am sorry I rated them so well the first time I purchased them
4,Replacement for speakers that lasted 12 years.  Good design easy to install good sound and price was low.Would recommend
5,I was amazed at the sound quality of these speakers.  I have heard more expensive units that did not have the quality of sound that these speakers have.  They mount easily and seem to cover a good size area.  I would highly recommend them.
5,Great sound from these speakers crystal clear.  About as much bass as you would expect to get from a speaker this small.  They work well sound good good range of sound.... and CANNOT beat the price.
4,outdoors on my patio. very good sound and separation. easy mounting and good looks are a plus. great product indeed
5,Got for out side patio. They sound great and look good. Shipped fast and came in good condition.
5,I installed these inside the cabin of a small Catalina Sail Boat and have used them onboard for the past few months. I am thoroughly impressed with the sound quality of these speakers good rich tones with no feedback or static.
5,Easy to install
4,a couple of years later they are working great.
5,Using them on my covered patio and running them with the zone b form a Yamaha rxv-677 that is in the living room. Very satisfied with these speakers!
5,These are nice speakers at a very reasonable price.
5,Well packaged installation was easy and also came with alternate part for installation positions. Sound was adequate but great for entertaining family or simply BBQing. Only wish I had a good drill bit for concrete before I started project :)
5,I purchased these speakers for use in my bathroom. For their size they sound very good. I added a sub as speakers this size are not very good at reproducing low frequencies. Included mounting hardware works well. Overall I am very satisfied.
5,Great set of outdoor speakers for the price. I ended up buying 2 more after using the first two for a year so I had more coverage.
5,Great sound. Nice speakers for mid range volume and coverage.
4,A friend and I both purchased theses speakersand we love them. The sound quality is great just enough of everything. Great price too
5,Excellent outdoor speakers. Easy to set up and sound fantastic!They also look and sound as good as my more expensive Bose speakers inside my house!Best buy in the speaker category!RegardsTerry
5,Sound asome
4,Bought these with an inexpensive Pyle tuner for pool area. They are fantastic great sound easy setup and blend right into the background.
2,I come from an audio background having worked as a sound engineer in both the recording studio and live sound. I was expecting great things from these speakers as I have other Yamaha speakers that I really like. These however sound boxy and metallic. Pass on these.
2,Lasted for 10 months before the first one started to go. Second speaker hung in for another month.  Sound was ok for large back yard.  Disappointed at their short life due to brand name speaker.
5,Great sound holding up well.I read before I bought these that allot of outdoor speakers didn't last at all before stopping working right.These were rated very good and are doing great so far.Nice looking too.
5,Sure am glad i chose these. Impressive clear smooth sound for patio area and with a powered subwoofer your in music heaven!With a decent receiver and good wires you can find the sweet spot with ridiculous ease.oh yea!
5,Wow amazing that all I have to say.
3,Only 6 ohms didn't  work with my amp.
4,The Yamaha speakers were easy to install look good and the sound quality is exceptional. They met all my expectations.
1,The sound coming off these speakers is great and the feel like good quality; however their durability is below poor. I've had these speakers for  3 months and they already crackle when they play music at medium volume. Their durability is terrible for the price I paid.
5,purchased the larger ones for our main speakers and these as the surround and i am very pleased! Good quality and look great! Using the included speakers mounts were easy and works well! Sounds great!
5,These are excellent speakers for the price.  I have purchased Niles Audio & Boston Acoustics for considerably more and these have a similar build quality with good sound.  Yamaha includes plenty of extras in the box for horizontal vertical or tabletop mounting.  Great speakers - highly recommend and will purchase again.
1,First speakers worked for about 4 months and then one speaker stopped working and the other had to be cranked up to hear anything.  Contacted Yamaha and they replaced them after I paid to send the non-working ones.  We get the new ones and those worked for 3 weeks and then also quit working.  We will see what Yamaha does as I surely don’t want to pay to have to return them again at that point I would’ve spent over half the cost of the speakers itself!
5,I love these. Great speakers great sound and easy to install.  I would recommend these to anyone who wants a reasonable priced speaker.  I use them indoors but can easily be used outdoors under an eve or porch.
5,Great speakers Amazing audio quality for the price.The speakers have been installed outdoors in my patio area for 6 months now.  They have handled the weather and moisture well.Fast delivery to Australia from Amazon also.
5,Good sound
3,They Rust right away in salt air. Sound good. Mounting Nut inside speaker breaks loose.
4,got them last summer.  Doing good.  Still rocking out the neighborhood
2,I had these speakers since the beginning of the summer. The mount is rusting (very disappointing) and the speakers crackle (sounds distorted).  the crackling is intermittent.  When they aren't crackling they sound awesome.
5,Great speakers we attached them to the shed for entertaining purposes.  They have great sound and easy install.
5,These speakers have a great sound. Was easy to mount them thanks to the hardware provided. The bass is good and the treble so clear. I recomend for home indoor outdoor business.
5,We built a deck on our house and needed speakers outside but we didn't want to spend a lot of money. We are very happy with these speakers. They look good were easy to mount and they sound great!
5,I installed these on my exterior wall facing our outdoor deck.  connected them to a Pioneer receiver with an Apple Airport Express acting as an Airplay destination. Good sound. and good price. Cant really complain.
5,Well built outdoor speakers.  I've had them for a few months and everybody loves them.  All the great reviews are accurate.  Unless you're an audiophile don't spend your money on any other speakers.
5,Love these speakers so much.  Sounds fantastic.  Have them on outside of pool house and they sound magnificant.  Would buy these again.  My son also loved them so he had to buy a pair.
5,These have turned out awesome.  We were not expecting much and they have really turned out well.  They sound really good and have really held up.
5,Ibought 3 sets of these over the last 2 years. Obviously I am pleased with their sound and quality! LOL
5,Great outdoor speakers. Shape helps with wide dispersal of sound it seems. Easy top install. All outdoor speakers worth their value are pricey. But these seem better than the JBL's in the last house.
5,Very good quality and great price. Works great for the outside hot tub area. Would buy again. A++
5,Installed on my shed fills my large yard with crystal clear sound
4,Speakers worked out great. Very happy with the quality and the price.
5,Very pleased with the speakers.  The mega mounting plate was neither included or available through Yamaha....went to Lowe's and wow...they had them...on sale for $0.29 each.
5,Great sound. They look amazing. Very happy. Checked for same speakers in other places Andy wanted double of the price. The price is right for this product speedy delivery and satisfaction guarantee.
4,Not wifi for I pad
1,THE SPEAKERS SUCK AND STOPPED WORKING AFTER 2 DAYS - WAITING TO SEE IF YAMAHA REFUNDSAFTER 2 DAYS THE ONE SPEAKER STARTED SHORTING OUT. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE STEREO. THEN IT WORKED FOR A COUPLE WEEKS AND NOW 30 DAYS AFTER PURCHASING THE ONE SPEAKER DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. Waiting to see if Yamaha does anything about this...
4,Great speakers for the money.  Easy to hang nice sound.
5,I thought it was too good to be true! I've seen this product for twice the price so I thought they must have had something wrong. I've tested them and everything seems fine. I already bought 2 more boxes!!
5,Delivered on time. Installed it outdoors in the deck. Works really well. Strong sound.  It is hooked up to Pyle PTA2 mini amp. Really like it. Will update after seeing how it does after this winter.
5,Sonido
5,Lookssounds and handles alot of watts
5,Very loud clear sound.  Used on outside deck and i'm afraid to turn it up or else my neighbors might call the cops on me.
5,I use it outside in a area of around 1200 sqf and it is more than enough to trow a nice party! Would fit a larger area for sure
5,Had a hard time selecting outdoor speakers after a lengthiereview of speakers I did choose the Yamaha NS-AW150 speakers.  Installationvery simple and the quality of the sound is great. I couldntask for anything better.
5,My speakers are mounted outdoors about 30 feet from a salt water bay. They're subject to lots of moisture and wind but are under a roof so they don't get rained on. After six months they are still working great. They're attractively shaped came with complete mounting hardware for different types of installation and they sound fine.
5,Really like the look and the sound
5,The  speakers are excellent and very reasonably priced for a pair which also included table stands and wall mounts. they performed better than expected and were delivered promptly I would recommend this seller
3,Big and clunky - but descent sound.
5,THESE SPEAKERS ARE A DEAL!  A MUST BUY.  THEY LOOKED GREAT AND FELT SOLID.  HAVENT HOOKED THEM UP YET BECAUSE ITS BEEN SO COLD OUT BUT SO FAR- A DEAL.
4,So-so sound. Nothing great but they serve the purpose.
5,Great speakers !No problems up til l now !
5,The speakers delivered a day earlier then it was suppose to. Installed and the look and sound great!! Can't wait to sit and light the grill and listen to my new speakers!
5,I like these speakers.  Used outside under eaves of back porch.  Great balanced sound with the right input.  Would buy again for my next house.
5,These outdoor speakers exceeded my expectations in performance. My intentions were to install them temporary until I can afford more expensive set.  The sound surprised me and decided to keep them.
4,Super value for the great sound.
5,Great speaker for outdoorprice was right
5,These Kicker speakers work better than I thought!! Very pleased with the sound quality and they rock my deck!!
5,My second set.  They are exposed to the elements so I know I won't get long life.  But the sound quality is the best I have found for outdoor speakers.  Will buy again!
5,These are my go to speakers
5,Great outdoor speakers. I have 4 of them outside on my deck/pool area and they are great!
1,Update:A year later and two more replacements that I've paid for myself I'm switching to POLK. These speakers are terrible.Would have been 5 Stars but unfortunately 1 speaker of the 4 I ordered one speaker is blown or shot! I didn't set them up until my porch was finished so they sat in the box and I missed the 30 day return period. When we set them up last night the other 3 sounded fine but the one would just crack we double checked to make sure the wires weren't backwards and everything was fine.
5,Put these on my patio to listen to college football on fall Saturdays as well as general music while outside.  Great sound great value for the money.
4,Nice quality not much base but good clarity
5,I just purchased a se cond pair... these I purhased last summer for my lanai and the new ones are for my deck... great for the price.
5,I ordered these for my back porch by the pool . I have not mounted them yet but they have stands so they are on a shelf for now . They work great no problems .
2,Better off with the next model up. Well constricted for outside but don’t play them loud. I blew a woofer on one and the tweet on the other with a 40watt receiver at -10db
5,I've only used them for a few months but the quality they offer   Yamaha NS-AW150W 2-Way Outdoor Speakers (Pair White)        my back yard and pool area is great. Good clean sound volume. Easy to hang and nice to look at.
5,Great sounding speakers. We have them mounted on our lakehouse and they deliver deep and crystal-clear sound all the way to the lake. Recommended especially at this price.
5,Great outside speakers quality sound.
5,Installed these in my yard to bring sound to another area work great and were easy to install look forward to listening tousic in my backyard for years to come.
3,They seem nice but one speaker arrived broken. The sound is very distorted in the one. Hoping for an improvement in the replacement.
5,Love these speakers and have had them for 2 years now with no problems what so ever.  Endured the rain and weather just fine!
5,I purchased these for my local community pool. They work great and sound very good especially for the price! I got 4 of them for less than $150
1,I ordered 4 of these speakers for a cafe one was blown right away. I didn't use them within the return period on Amazon on now I'm stuck with a blown speaker. Called the linked Yamaha support line and waiting on the phone for 15 minutes with no answer.I want a warranty replacement unit ASAP without needing to jump through a million hoops.
5,Really good outdoor speakers Installed both in the pool deck the sound is really clear
4,perfect but average sound
4,Good speakers for the price
4,Ok better than most
5,Very simple addition to our patio.  They have weathered a little bit over the first 8 months but I hope that's nothing a little elbow grease can't clean up.  Sound great.
4,Good speakers for my patio.
5,Have them up at a beach house in the OBX.  Have held up for three seasons now with the salt air.  Look good and pretty good sound.
5,FANTASTIC speakers for the price. Everyone loves them. Some have already bought them now as well.Thanks for a great deal for the price.
2,Worked for 1 summer and I "was" happy with them. Put them back up and a week later started to crackle at less then medium volume. Troubleshooted my whole setup (amp wires speakers). Definitely the speakers. They suck. They blew another receiver I tested them on too. I don't know if they shorted or what but I am not happy.
5,Sound is better than expected pleasantly surprised. Excellent value.
5,Great sound and clarity. I mounted these outside my beachhouse and now I can sit on my deck and listen to music. These speakers are a great value.
5,For the price these speakers are great for what I use them for. Installed 4 on the back porch one in each corner.  They are nice looking and work perfect.
5,Excellent sound
5,Great speakers for the price.  They sound as almost as good as my Polk Atrium 4's for a LOT cheaper.  Can't go wrong with these Yamaha's.
5,Very nice. Great sound
5,Sound great and installed easily!
4,Nice outdoor speakers
5,These have good sound. And even though the white finish is now more of a beige/yellow due to exposure to the elements the sound quality hasn't suffered at all. Good value.
4,These are GOOD.
5,Great set of speakers. I purchased these for our farmers porch. Mounted in front under the eve they sound great. Nice base to them for an outside speaker. the white color blends into the white trim real nice.
5,Love them. These speakers sound great  are easy to install and have good price. I installed them on my deck now we can relax outside with the music.
5,Very inexpensive! They are very easy to set up and come with several mounting choices. I am using the Yamaha speakers as indoor/remote speakers to get audio in kitchen from central receiver/iPod dock/CD/DVD hub the sound is amazing.
1,Perhaps someone can help me out here. I purchased these two speakers wired them up and added an adapter for RCA plugs and a 3.5 mm plug - so i could plug into my iphone/ipad/ipod and listen to Pandora or my music. The problem is that the volume is so low I can barely hear it. I'm using them outside so I had not intended to hook them up to a receiver and then plug the iphone into the receiver. Any knowledgeable helpful feedback is appreciated.  I've already tossed the box so i can't return.
3,Good solid well-built speakers for outdoors. Mounts easily. A bit disappointed in the sound but they are small so they don't get the base sounds you may be used to on larger units.
5,Really nice speakers with good sound. Have them mounted on my deck by the pool.
5,These are nice speakers.  I matched them to a mini amp and mounted them under the eaves on my deck.  The amp is the weak link but overall things sound pretty good.
5,They sound great. They are replacements for a set of outdoor speakers I had that had dried up. Would definitely buy again. Great speaker for the price.
5,Sound greatEasy mounts
5,Great pair of outdoor speakers.. I was happy I decided to go with these and pair them with the in ceiling yamaha speakers indoors. Great price great product
5,Excellent speakers for outside.  Survived multiple monsoons and dust storms.  Ensure you have enough power going to them to get the party going!
5,Speakers sound great and shipping was super fast.  I was worried at first because of the great price but they do sound so much better than I expected.  Thank you.
5,You really can't beat the price on these.  I have BA speakers on my deck at home and these guys aren't too far behind those in terms of performance.
1,Have to say we were very disappointed in the ability of these things to hold up to outdoor life. The first set we got didn't even last a week and 3 uses. We got them replaced and even built them boxes we could enclose them in if we had a storm. Again didn't last a week nor 2 uses that time. They sounded great when they worked but cannot recommend due to not being able to hold up to ANY outdoor weather. We live in Virginia.
5,Speakers are great no problems and still kicking that sweet music.
5,Great speakers for the price.Very good sound.  I installed them on my covered porch which is about 10 feet from ocean.  Have had them for a year.
1,These speakers only worked for a couple of weeks.  Yamaha customer support is impossible to get a hold of.  Chat doesn't work.  They don't answer the support number (well I gave up after holding for 1 hour).  I will never purchase anything from Yamaha again just based on the fact that it seems as though if you have an issue with a Yamaha product you cannot get a hold of them.
5,nice
3,Ummm maybe I should have known this but there's no plug or anything.  So you need to have a clue to assemble/install them.
2,Sound is muffled. Doesn't even compare to my $100 indoor speakers.
5,I installed the speakers in the bathroom to listen to TV/ Music while taking a sh.... ower.Those are solid speakers with good mounting brackets. They have good connectors and sound great.
5,Sound great and easy to install.
5,Using these outdoor on my patio for my zone b on my receiver working great so far. I'm not a big audiophile but like good sound and these are great especially for the price.
5,Speakers sound good
5,Love these. Great sound in the yard now.
5,top of the line speaker rigth now they are full of snow and they still sound amazing  you can`t go wrong with yamaha
5,These speakers are awesome for my back patio!  No complaints with them at all.  They are very loud!  Great price too.
5,Hung these speakers on out new screen porch.  Easy install with a great sound.  Love them.
5,These speakers are great! Have amazing sound quality Good bass and treble! they go well on my 15x25 patio!
5,Great speakers have two sets on my house and garage crank them up and they sound great.
5,We had a tight space to fill so these speakers fit right in because you can mount these speakers vertical or horizontal.Sound good to.
5,Very nice sounding speakers.  I'm sure others would be happy with the too.  I just hope they'll last in the harsh Texas weather.  We shall see!
5,Durability and weather resistance yet to be determined but they look good sound good and install easily all for a fair price.  Good Yamaha product.
5,Awesome speakers very loud and perfect to have outside! Couldn't be happier with the purchase.
3,I returned this item

5,WAS OK QUALITY BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR WHERE I HAD THM TO MUCH OUTDOOR SPACEONES I GOT TO REPLACE ARE GREAT THANK YOU
1,These speakers are not loud and HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE sound with any song that has bass or a little bass. Maybe an opera music would be ok if u don’t like it loud.
5,Very good speakers. Have one pair in patio and one pair in garage. Easy mounting and hookup.
5,Have installed speakers to back porch the wife is pleased. Now I got to get a 2 zone receiver to make it all work.
5,So far so Good actually great! they sound clear and loud. Perfect for outdoor patios back yards or even indoors they are amaizing.
2,One sounds great the other sounds likes it’s popped or something. Rattles and is very annoying
5,My poor old Bose garage speakers finally gave up but these sound just as good.  Makes a day in the man cave so much better.
1,Do not hold up. Woofers give out. Junk speakers
5,They were great and sound great!
3,One already stopped working.  So you get what you pay for
5,My son loved these.

5,Perfect!
5,The speakers were easy to set up they have excellent sound and I expect to get years of carefree enjoyment from them.
5,put these speakers on the back of the house under the eves wired them into a light switch next to the back door.
5,They work great will probably buy another pair
1,I am actually emailing you to see how I can return these speakers. I did not know they do not come with any wires. I've taken them to Walmart and RadioShack and no one can assist me on how to get wires to hook the speakers up. It's more of a pain now. Please let me know where I can return the speakers so I get credit on my account soon as possible
5,Got these for my father's back yard in Mexico and he is raving about them.  Great sound!  Really pleased with the purchase.
5,Good solid speakers at a good price.  Held up well in Northeast winter and summers.
5,I use these outside next to my pool. They have GREAT sound. Very clear and decent bass but I dont turn them up very loud.

5,We hung these speakers outside to play music while in the pool. They play music very loud and good quality sound.
1,My speakers turned yellow after 1.5 years mounted to my house... they worked fine... I had issues that the speaker wire would rust and the speakers would stop working every year or so.  The speaker wire was not a big deal as I just has to cutback the wire and rewire the speaker... but the fact the speakers turned yellow was very disappointing... I need to get new ones now...
5,I bought these for my deck they have there own amp coming off my Denon receiver they have there own zone and really rock
5,Nice sounding speakers for therir size. I like them so much I bought 2 sets because I liked them so much.
5,These sound great and were very easy to install...  Currently connected on back deck protected from most elements by the roof overhang
5,These speakers are great!!  Sound quality is good and it makes yard work much more enjoyable.  I wpuld recommend them to a friend.
5,Very well constructed...easy to mount with strong solid base. Acousticsexcellent
5,great price and great sound. These are my first outdoor speakers so I have nothing else to compare them to. I have no complaints.
5,Love these outdoor speakers. They work great in the backyard around the pool area!
5,Sound great for a great price. Would definately recommend these speakers for an outdoor patio.  A little small but packs a great punch.
5,The price is more than fair and the sound is great. It's for outdoor on my deck so I don't need the best sound but these impressed me!
5,I am completely Satisfied with this product.  It works very well for what I need.  They do have a lot of power.
1,Was really excited to get this set up as it was a Mother's Day present. The description lists that it comes with speaker wire but it sadly does not. Disappointed.
5,Great sound for the price/watt! Considering purchasing 2 more for other parts of the house! Handle outdoor conditions very well and show no sign of any type of wear. After doing much research these speakers seemed the best bang for the buck!
5,These are amazing we use them outside 4-5 nights a week and they have great sound quality!
5,I am a professional audio engineer and chose these for a client. Sound is amazing for the price point!
5,Great sounding
5,Look great easy install wish a little more bass but great set of speakers.  I would recommend to any one.
3,The speakers are working great. Great price and fast delivery
5,great speakers
5,We replaced our old rusty outdoor speakers with these and they sound fantastic. Clear and clean with great highs and lows.
5,I purchased these outdoor speakers for my patio back and absolutely love them. They sound great and are very easy to mount with the included brackets.
5,Very nice. Crisp clear sound perfect for the patio.
5,Excellent sound at a reasonable price.
5,Bought them for my bathroom sound is great and installation is super easy.
5,Good speakers. They've been outside now for 2 summers and they work great. About the size of a football.
5,Came quickly with all of the required parts.  Easy to install fantastic sound quality and a very reasonable price.  Would recommend to friends and family.
5,Have not installed yet but was what we wanted
5,Great Value and excellent instructions
5,Great quality..!!
5,Yamaha has quality products but these smallish outdoor speakers have surprised me as to the sound they provide.
5,perfect for outdoor.. looks good and it has been exposed to sun and rain and still works
5,I put these at my outdoor bar. They are awesome speakers for the price great clarity. We're very satisfied. Great product!
5,wow these are so easy to hook up and they sound great and the color matches the pool just finethanks again
5,Great soundhave them installed on the out side of a beach house by our pond. very clear soundfor the price you couldn't find a nicer pair of speakers. Highly recommend.
5,Speakers sound great and were easy to mount outside.
5,These work great outdoors at -10° below... Installation was very easy. They work as advertised and sound amazing for the money.
2,It was unclear on the hook up for these speakers from the descriptions so I assumed I might have no trouble using them with my computer. The instructions even reference a specific type of cable that they don't offer. Needless to say I have two maybe great speakers that have to wait until I get a receiver for them.
5,Speakers needed for the Church Foyer work great!
5,Great speakers for the price and for outdoors. Needed some music for patio and this was the fix. I would recommend them
5,Crystal clear sound even after spending a Chicago winter outside. Excellent sound and good bass. These are perfect for a medium to large deck.
5,love these had a pair outside for 6 years. they filled with water and still kept working. Stands work great too.
5,These speakers are great quality for the price & how they sound . We have them mounted right above our deck! Enjoying them ever since they arrived!
5,these are nice looking and good speakers for a very reasonable price - would recommend them for indoors or outdoors
1,I was very disappointed with the sound quality.  I used Yamaha before and loved the speakers; these not so much.  I am returning them.
5,you have to turn them up to here in the distance maby 75 feet they soung great though  and look good
5,I've owned these for well over a decade and take them in MOST winters (I've missed a few) and they still work and sound great. They're mounted under a covered deck and I have repainted them once due to the typical plastic discoloration. I'm not sure if the quality has changed but mine have survived well over many years. I would definitely buy another pair if these EVER fail.
5,Works good for the money
5,Work great - bought another pair for another room
5,I have the Yamaha's from a few years ago and these sound much better.  I highly recommend it.  Good luck.
3,they work!!
5,Great deal on a an excellent product.  Install was easy and painless.  Sound exceeded my expectations.  Would definitely recommend this product to others.
5,We have these in our garage and out side under the eaves! We love them!!! Great for parties or just lounging in the backyard.
5,i use these in the back yard which is quite large and think they sound just fine. good bass and treble. not a single complaint. for the price they are excellent.
5,This speakers ROCK!! I had to replace some old Jamo speakers on my patio & these sound fantastic.
5,Great speaker
5,great speakers for the price
5,These are great speakers and work as described.  We highly recommend this product.  Our friends have complimented on how good they sound.
4,speakers give good sound quality and are small and unnoticeable at a good price all the things I was looking for in speaker
5,Works all great sound is good and enough volume to piss of the neighbors lol
5,Quick shipping very nice product. Several ways to install which gives you some flexibility on how to mount them. We have them on our outdoor porch and love them!
5,Awesome out door speakers. Had these from 2 years and the sound perfect.
5,Installed on my back porch. Sound decent enough and look like they will hold up nicely.
5,Great speakers and work fine.  Mounted on a white wall they're almost invisible.
5,Put these in my man cave and they're perfect for the garage.
2,Bought these as a cheap replacement for older Yamaha speakers (one had failed). They sound like your listening to an old AM radio through a tin can. Do yourself a favor and get the 350 or 390 series...
5,just like at the home depot at 1/3 the price
1,Plug receptacle cracked during speaker wire connection. Speaker ruined and unrepairable. Waited too long to unbox and install so past the return window.
5,Great speakers for outside.  Big rich sound for the price point.  I look forward to enjoying these speakers all spring summer and fall.
1,They sounded great however it appears water got inside this winter froze and broke it.  They are comletely unusable now.  It wasn't just one either.  Two of the four I have outside broke.  The other two are under the roof's overhang and they are still fine.  I guess they are good if they are not overly exposed to the elements.
5,Just great!
5,Not the highest quality sound but satisfactory for outside covered decks.  Good for the price.
5,Love sound. We have these speakers in our pool area and gym area sounds-- like we are at a concert.
5,Used them for 2 months now & these speakers have a rich sound! They sound good at low or high volumes.
5,They perform as advertised.  I use them outside on my back porch.
5,I think think "WOW" sums it up.The speakers are installed outdoors and they survived IRENE (in South Jersey)!They work flawless the sound is still amazing!
5,They worked out great for the place and sound on the deck for us
5,Don't exposed them to rain because for couple days it won't sound great
5,These speakers are easy to install and sound very good. Installed them next to our swimming pool as replacements for an old pair that had worn out.
5,good speakers for the price great sound for outdoor use would buy again.aaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaa a  a  aaaaaaaaaaa aaa aa a
5,I bought these for my brother and he loves them!  They are really loud too!
5,perfect
2,not what i expected. No bass and quality of tone just not there sounds cheap and china like. Listen before you buy there must be better choices then this model. would not buy again.
5,Love these sound amazing!
1,These lasted less than a month outside before the cones came unglued.  They may be outdoor speakers provided the weather is not hot or they are not placed in an area with a lot of sun.  They sounded good up until that point.  Now they need to be replaced.
5,Work great great sound as well. easy install good color light weight perfect. just wanted to write a brief statement.
5,Do you need an extra set of outdoor speakers you will not go wrong with this purchase. Simple to install and sound great.
5,Installed these in out backyard under pergola great sound very easy to install.
5,Speakers work good. As expected!
5,The lows and highs are just great and it can handle quite enough power from the amplifier without any noticeable distortion. You can't beat the price also.
2,I have 4 pairs of these speakers mounted- I've replaced them all within thelast three years- latest pair lasted two weeks and the bass blew-  I won't be buying these anymore....
5,1st time buying outdoor speakers they really sound good and was easy to install. I am very happy with the product.
5,really good speakers. sounds great.
1,I install a lot of outdoor speakers. The mounting brackets are NOT ideal for most locations. Especially the eve of a house and having options to direct the sound to a specific area
1,I had these mounted outside under the eave and initially was very pleased with them.  However after 11 months they both quit working.
5,Quality sound!
5,Awesome sounds. I mounted two in my backyard and they sounds great!
5,These baby's rock.
5,on time and works great
5,Am looking forward to set them into the brackets outdoors and enjoy some music in my yard this Summer season
5,i was semi hesitant of how these would be for the money but i was left in awe of how loud and crisp these are.. great buy!
5,Good sound. Easy to install
5,have them outside completely exposed to the elements and they work great.....love them.  great value.....great sound and still look great.
1,Sadly to our dismay it was missing parts. My husband went to install them and its missing speaker mounts. The description never said anything about it missing speaker mounts. So they are useless and unable to hang them up.
5,Sound is exceptional.
5,you can't go wrong with Yamaha.  Can't beat the price.
5,Very good!!!
5,Nice sound!
5,these speakers provide excellent sound and were easy to install.  they look great and for the price paid i think they are a great value.

5,These speakers rock!! Easy to put up and nice appearance.
1,I purchased a pair  one worked one did not  disappointed .
1,Speaker stopped working after three months. A lot of distortion.
2,Instructons says that it can't be 100% exposed to rain. Outsite speakers must be 100% waterproof and seems it s not.
5,Great speakers for my time in the pool!!
5,Great product.
5,Great quality and sound.  Would definitely purchase again.
1,Low sound. Not what I excepted at all. Would send them back if it wasn't a hassle. Have a pool/ deck in back yard and have other speakers . Bought 2 more for more sound. Not good
5,Great speakers. Sound awesome.
5,Love these speakers. Good sound and have lasted through several Ohio winters.
1,Only had a few weeks and one of the speakers has quit workingShould have bought bose.
2,These speakers should not be used when expecting high quality sound output.  Also the terminal connecters are flimsy since once broke off when attaching a spade conncetor.
2,Speaker sound quality is sub-par at best. Id get something else.
5,Great price timely shipment - back yard music sounds great!
5,have these on my porch now for 2 years no issues

5,Awesome!
5,Thank you
5,worked great!!!
5,Excelent
1,Blow out after 6 hours. Got new ones and same thing happened
1,Complete rubbish. Don't waste your money. Sound thin (no bass) and are really inefficient - meaning you don't get much volume out of them without turning your amp way up.
5,Great speakers
5,love it
5,Nice
5,Excelente producto
1,crapped out after 1.5 years of light use outdoors.
5,GREAT
1,Complete junk.  3 out of the 4 i ordered  lasted 5 months under my patio.  Do not order. They are complete junk
5,Needed outdoor speakers.  Looked for the least expensive.  These fit the bill and work great.
1,Wow the price is good but the sound is really poor. I can't believe anyone would like the sound.
1,Dont waste your money;  I bought 2 pair and both are now shot in less than a year.
1,Terrible sound wish I had not spent the $
5,Great!!!
1,I installed these into an outdoor tiki bar.  They stopped working after 2 months and are outside their return policy.
1,These were listed under my search for wireless speakers and they are not
1,We did not care for the sound quality & so returned them.
1,Good working speakers like the style and the sound
1,Stop working after two weeks--- Terrible :/
4,I received a pair of the these speakers from my daughter for Christmas 2015.  The do sound great for their size and price.  However  I had one of the two speakers stop working a few weeks ago.  They were both mounted underneath my second story deck.  When I took it down from the mounting  there was water inside the housing.  I let the water drain out  kept it indoors to dry out overnight and it resumed working.  I wrote to Yamaha and their response was: "While these speakers are designed for outpdoor use and are advertized as all-weather the speakers are not water proof but are designed to be mounted in corners or under eaves to minimise exposure to rain and snow."  I couldn't find anything in the product literature that gave these mounting instructions.  I have since made shields for them out of aluminum flashing.  I got lucky.  Others might not.
4,I've recently put an in-ground pool in my back yard and I bought these speakers to mount on the outside wall of the house facing the pool about a foot down from the eave. I've did some search around Amazon and other sites read bunch reviews and finally decided on these. The speakers are pretty big in size require no power just the signal input and I ran a pair of cables (about 70-80 feet) from the wall behind my entertainment center to the outside through the attic and hooked to these on the wall. The result is pretty good I'd say I'm not a big audio person and these are just for when me and/or if I have friends over and using the pool the sound isn't loud as far as speakers go but taking in consideration of the distance of wires in between plus the price I paid for these speakers I think it's really good over all. Other than that the only complain I have is these speakers came with some really short mounting screws instead of using those I bought some 2" ones from Home Depot and with that these speakers are mounted very sturdily.
4,i am using these in my garage. They are ok sound but definitely lack the base . There is base but not very much. I am connecting a sub woofer for that. The other thing i don't like is that you can't mount them verticle and adjust the angle. Only horizontal you can. i will keep them since they are only for the garage but i like base in any situation.
5,I bought these speakers for my roof-deck. They are partially covered (backs) but also partially exposed to the elements (fronts). The speakers look nice and sound great. The connection of the speaker to the brackets works well and I like the flexibility in being able to pivot the speaker to point in the direction I want. My only complaint is the shape of the brackets is such that it can wobble since the footprint of the surface contacting the wall is somewhat small compared to the overall bracket and speaker. Not the end of the world but be mindful of this when you're installing.
4,Does exactly what the other reviews say amazing sound for the price.  Has relatively good bass a higher volumes crystal clear highs.  The build quality is very good and numerous mounting options.  I paired this with a BlueFidelity bluetooth amplifier (available from Amazon) as deck speakers for my iPhone music. I added a small self-powered subwoofer to get better bass at low volumes.  I am very happy with my purchase.
5,Came with everything I needed! Even came with safety cables ! Super loud an made right!Sounds good in my garage!
4,I like these speakers but they do have less volume than most.
5,Had my yammies in the yard for 8 years and still sound great.  Being a reggae fan the low end is important to me and I love the low end on these.  Can’t get a better outdoor speaker!
5,You can’t beat these for the money! Buy them. Supply ample power and they’ll jam. They’ve held up to Kansas’ ever changing weather (100 degree + summers and -10 winters) and wind with no problems mounted outside under my house eaves facing north for 5 Years now. The grills are staring to come off after harsh treatment. Not falling off just starting to separate. Speakers still function 100%. I’ll pull the old pair in the garage or maybe just add two more outside and see what happens.  Rock on!
4,good so far
5,I read the excellent reviews for these speakers and was skeptical.  However the price was right so there wasn't much risk.  So . . . I bought a pair.  The reviews were spot on.  They sound is terrific the price was unbeatable and look is very acceptable (even to my Interior Designer wife).  Unless you are an audio perfectionist you'll never get a better price/performance value.
4,These are excellent quality and over powerful. I have a garden at the back of my one acre lot and can hear them as clear as sitting on my back porch. I was slightly disappointed with the bass tones but great buy for the price.
4,When I bought them I chose them because they were fairly priced. What I didn't know is that I would get much more than I expected. Great set of speakers and they were easy to install.
4,Great little products! Hooked up quickly performs as expected.....fair price for product!  Five stars if the came in other colors....other than that very happy
4,Bought these 2 years ago and they are still holding up well.  I mounted them under my eaves so they are out of the weather but they get plenty of temperature changes being in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.  I am running them through a cheap receiver and the sound is very good for the price.  I can't crank them too loud because I don't want to disturb my neighbors but they are plenty powerful for the backyard.  Highly recommend.
5,Can't fault these for the price. Installed a pair at least 3 years ago that remain outdoors on the Jersey Shore throughout the winters and fire back up the following summer without a problem. Some slight rusting is visible around the mounting screws but that's nothing. Great product.
4,Overall a good product for the money. I did not want to spend $100 for a pair of outdoor speakers. These speakers were easy to install and sound good. I am glad I did not get the bigger pair. These are big enough.
5,Awesome speakers for the price. Excellent fidelity clarity and detail.I power them with am Amphony bluetooth receiver/amp from Amazon and the setup is very well matched. Yes being small speakers you won't get a lot of low bass but they are very pleasurable to listen to nonetheless.They can either be wall mounted vertically or horizontally or can be placed on a shelf with the base included. Would make great surround speakers for a home audio system as well.All in all these speakers and amp make up quite a nice sound system for the patio for around $150 -- I have received numerous compliments on the sound.Link for Amphony amp:http://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Audio-Receiver-Amplifier-Model/dp/B00JB4YWGO/ref=pd_sim_e_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=1B50GGNTPRVWDB7S83BK )
5,I got them for less then 70$..and they sound as good as any 300+ outdoor speakers I have heard. Excellent value and great sound.
5,Great sound.  Solid bass with smooth mids and high range.  Couldnt be happier with the performance and at such a low cost they are amazing.
5,We closely scrutinized both the Yamaha 150w and the Yamaha 350w for our outdoor patio enjoyment.  Wow both are SUPERB!  And for a fraction of the price of their main competitors Polk and Acoustic Research. Considering we have Polk indoor speakers in our sunroom and AR303As in our home theater setup in our family room we knew the great quality we would expect to receive from the competitors.  Wow! The quality of the construction and the quality of the full-range sound in these OUTDOOR speakers are absolutely amazing!If you have a few extra dollars to spend may I suggest the Yamaha 350w. If not you will NOT go wrong with the Yamaha 150w.
4,I'm not using these in a situation where I can crank them to see what they can do but for our needs they are working out well. They were easy to install and are decent to look at. For the price I think they are well worth it.
5,Very happy with this purchase have them mounted on my garage door facing the house.  Setup was pretty easy and they sound great hooked up to my Altec Lansing 5.1 system in the garage.  Just plug in your audio source and provide entertainment thru the backyard!
5,Awesome speakers.  Amazon Warehouse deals are phenomenal!  Looks 100% new in every way- even the sealed box!
5,I love Yamaha products and have found them to offer fantastic performance and reliability and these speakers are no exception. Just look at the constant positive reviews these units get. These speakers are real winners!
5,These are exactly what I was looking for good brand and good price. I can sit and listen to music on the patio. Nice and soft or rocking out.
1,I didn’t mount the speakers for a year or so after purchasing due to moving houses but when I did mount them 1 speaker blew the first use. The second speaker blew the second use.
5,Excellent sound quality.  installed on my outdoor patio next to my pool.  everyone loves them!  I would definitely buy again!
5,The boxes are very good top notch sound and performance. Excellent resistance. I can recommend to my friends.
5,Now this product is running in its second year of outdoor use on my deck it is still working rock solid and sound is crisp and clear. Very satisfied with the value I have received for the money.
5,I've spent the past few months looking for outdoor speakers. Never owning a pair before I was concerned given the high prices and the short life expectancy. I found these Yamaha's on Amazon and while the reviews were excellent I was still concerned about the price being so much less expense then other outdoor speakers. I finally bit the bullet and ordered them this past week. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised. The speakers are well built and sound quality is amazing Almost as good as my Bose indoor speakers! While I'm still skeptical of how long they will last only time will tell. Given the price and sound quality even a year or two would still make them a great buy!
5,Speakers sound great. Price is right.
1,Mounted almost entirely out of weather and sun covered porch blew after 3 weeks not suing big amp or loud.  until then they sounded good.
5,great sound very happy with them
5,Had old pair of KLM or somthing like that?  Replaced them with the Yamaha and as I expected it was far above a better product.  The realy great thing is that I actually believe I spent less for these upgraded speakers and it has been about 5 years later.  Fills the backyard pool area up with great sound. Easy install great sound & great price is there anything else you want from outdoor speakers?  We will see if holds the test of time!
5,Sound great. Great price.
5,Not as much bass as some of the other posts suggested. Speakers have nice clear sound at peak levels.  Good value
5,Sounds wonderful in my backyard...
5,These are some good bass takin' speakers!! YAMAHA HAS REALLY DONE IT THIS TIME WITH THEIR NS-A150W 2 Way Outdoor Speakers!
5,I am amazed at the sound of these speakers.  I have never been very impressed with outdoor speakers as they always sound like they are pushing the music through a tin can.  but these blow me away.  I have had them for over a year now - they have survived the winter with no issues.  I leave them up year round - they are exposed to the elements with no protection.  well worth the money!
5,Working well for the price
5,Great sound
5,I purchased this item several weeks ago for my deck. Easy to mount and sounds clear. Since then there has been heavy rain storms. Even after the speakers were soaked from all the rain I pumped the music to them expecting them to sizzle and WOW! I heard music! The music that came out sounded great! Just like new. Great Speakers and can withstand the test of my loud outdoor parties.
5,These speakers have really met my expectations.  it is a great value.  Definitely worth purchasing.  Its for people who appreciate quality and want value as well.  Great all around!
2,Bought these for $25 used about 5 years ago and tried them out 1 time had a Denon receiver at work in metal fabrication shop and thought they would be perfect for use in that environment since they have the outdoor use design. I found them to be absolutely worthless distorted and couldn't even reach audible sound levels that I was getting out of speakers that has 1/2 the size of the drivers than these had. Also plan on the grills coming loose and never staying in place. If you used these on a system that was anything other than a background music system for outdoors you will be very disappointed they just sound awful and the pair I bought have nothing wrong with them they are just really poorly made. Plastic cabinets that sound like Plastic cabinets. Like those old detachable boombox speakers that make that clunking noise when anything touches them. Yamaha has never been known to make a decent speaker at any price point when compared to others side by side it becomes very easy to hear the lack of depth & limited sound reproduction. Not to mention inefficient & poor power handling. No matter what numbers they put on these speakers I supplied 50W per speaker and I could only get it to 1/3 volume before they distorted Barely loud enough to hear over the noise of everyday shop sound. They have been on a shelf since I bought them I don't have the heart to pass them on to anyone they need to be destroyed so no others bother to keep them laying around taking up space like I have done.
1,Speakers are shot after 1 summer
2,Sound is great for the price but after about 1 year both grilles fell off of each speaker about a few months apart.  I pressed them back in but they fell out again.  Not sure how to fix them.
2,I expected more from these speakers. Granted I love good music (all types from Classical to Jazz and EDM).  I installed these speakers on my porch.  After using them for two years I'm going to pull them down and replace them with something else.  They sound TERRIBLE.  They really sound cheap.  Zero base and very muddy mid-range.  I would not recommend these and would spend your money on something else.
1,I had these up outdoors for two seasons. So they never saw winter. When I was taking them down for this winter I noticed they were filled with water. Very disappointing. Sound quality was good but if they cant keep water out then what good are they. I switched to Dayton Audio their speakers are waterproof instead of water resistant.
5,Can be mounted horizontally with right left directional adjustments or vertcally with up down adjustment. Mounted indoors though the price and quality make it my first choice for a future purchase for outdoor use.
5,These Yamaha speakers truly live up to the Yamaha quality and performance.  Installed the pair on my outdoor patio with an old Awai receiver.  Great crisp and quality bass sound.  Thinking of purchasing another pair for my garage.   Yamaha NS-AW150W 2-Way Outdoor Speakers (Pair White)
5,these speakers look exactly as they appear in the photos. They have a clean simple stylish design. They sound as good as we can expect for a speaker of the size enclosure. Maybe they sound even better than average. Mounting was as easy as 2 screws (not supplied) in the supplied brackets. There are several mounting options. The only negative is that the mounting brackets are 2 direction hinges and not swivel. No big deal I knew that when I purchased.
5,These are hands down the best outdoor speakers I have ever heard.  The sound reproduction is remarkably clear...I hear instruments in the music that I hadn't heard before even with my indoor system.Unfortunately they sound so much better than my indoor speakers that I will probably have to upgrade those now.Great speakers great price and quick shipping with Prime.  Thank you Yamaha and Amazon.
5,I have had these speakers installed on my deck for a little over a month. They definately fill the area with sound well. I have a small 14x20 deck and at even low volume there is nice full sound about 25 feet into the yard. My neighbors are fairly close so I haven't had a chance to really crank them up. Overall I am very happy with this purchase. The speakers look great mounted against the house and sound excellent. I highly recommend these speakers.
5,I looked very hard at speakers before I bought these.  I could have spent much more money than this on speakers.  I was hesitant to spend such a small amount and think that they might be good.  But they are worth every penny.  I have a large patio and they sound greaat wherever I stand.  I would recommend these to anyone.
5,Don't waste your time or money on a set of $25 outdoor speakers - they will sound horrible!  You want to at least start with a set of these Yamaha's.  They mount easily and sound great!  They offer a very good range of sound and don't distort at higher volumes.
2,The sound on these speakers is great however after having them installed under the eaves of the roof above our patio one of the grills started to fall off.  Upon closer inspection I noticed that the grills are glued on with some adhesive and the heat softened it to the point that the grills are loose.  I will be returning them.
5,Wow! I was not expecting the sound to be as nice as it is. I would like to see better flexibility on the wall mounts supplied with the speakers. I would recommend purchasing the more flexible wall mount.  The sound is great and I have gotten lots of compliments on the speaker appearance and richness of the music.
5,Since I installed this speaker set I have seen all kinds of bad weather; still they look and function like they did the day I got them. The sound quality is great. I am considering buying another set so I can have great sound on every side of the house.
5,We bought these speakers for outdoors for the patio.  they are great speakers with great sound. Just what we were looking for and they weren't very expensive either.  They were a nice addition for the summer months. We would definitely recommend buying them.
1,Unless you listen to music VERY  softly AND the music  you like has NO bass at all DO NOT BUY THESE.if you like your music with no bass  buy these. I found them to be awesome listening to a documentary tv show.  However as soon as I tried to play good music loud enough for my guests on the patio to hear ( only 4-10 ft away) I  learned that this was the worst purchase EVER. UGH!
5,Honestly wasn't expecting these to perform quite this well.  One of the best outdoor speakers I've heard.  Very good high and low frequency response.  Rivals RusSound quality at 1/2 the price!
5,These speakers were used as outdoor speakers at the beach so i'm not expecting them to last long but they sound decent and i won't cringe if i have to replace them every year.
5,I bought these speakers for my outside porch. The sounds are very clear even at low volume. They are very durable and well put together. I later bought a second pair for my outdoor deck.
5,Easy to install.They work great.The price was right.I'm very pleased.
5,Easy to install  better then expected sound quality  very nice bass.I use it as bathroom speakers  its much more then I really need
5,I love these speakers! The sound is perfect for an outdoor set of speakers we use them all the time. You won't be disappointed with this product!!
5,I mounted these on the garage for our patio the sound quality is amazing for the money I would recommend these to anyone.
2,I did not expect that these would turn out to be so very bad. The sound quality was of average and during the last winter the speakers stopped working all of a sudden. They broke and are completely unusable now.
5,I really liked these speakers the sound and the design are excellente for outdoors I installed on my ceiling terrace.
5,i love themthey really sound great. i had one pair then bought another. i have them by my pool.
1,Amazon still have these marketed as "wireless" under technical information.  Do not trust the information Amazon provides.  Research separately and read reviews.  Several customers were burned on this false claim and Amazon has yet to correct it.
5,these speakers sound good.  glad I got them for the price I got them for.
1,The speakers are two tone. Looking at the speakers you can tell they were used. They seem like old speakers in a new house.
5,Llego en excelentes condiciones muy buena calidad
5,Very clear sounding plenty and easy to mount
3,Good sound but the grill front came off even those these two speakers were mounted under a shelter.This well reported problem with these speakers for several years and I thought Yamaha would have fixed it but does not look like they fixed it - they should use better "glue" for the grills that stands upto the summer heat.
5,Work well easy installation
5,Arrived on time packaging protected the speakers from minor damage to the box it came in.  Purchased the speakers for my garage paired them to a Sherwood amplifier.  I had the same size speakers Radio Shack) in my previous garage and the sound quality seemed ether but it was smaller.  This garage is large with an rv Bay so I am pretty sure it has poor acoustics still the speakers sound is good and I am happy with my purchase
4,I bought mine in April and installed them in June. They were very easy to install and look great and very sleek. I would highly recommend them. With that being said I blew a speaker this past weekend. They get very light usage as they're only used on weekends because they're at my cottage. Im assuming I got a defective speaker and am hoping that if I can figure out how to connect the seller they will cover their product by replacing it. Again I do recommend them. They look great and sound great. If the seller reads this please contact me.
5,Excelentes bocinas la verdad rebasaron mis expectativas y eso que las instalamos sin un "bajo" aún así se escuchan muy bien las volvería a comprar sin problema. Yo las adquirí en un buen fin del 2020 en 1900 el par aproximadamente.
4,Buen sonido las uso con un AVR en segunda zona y dan un sonido muy claro y fuerte si así lo requieres la instalación al exterior es sencilla y los materiales para desinstalarlas se ven resistentes ya que donde se atornillan a las bases fijas son de acero
5,Exelente producto. cuenga con todo lo que se nesecita para instalacion manual bases y tornillos. Cuenta con un sonido muy nitido y no le pide nada a otras bocinas de su clase y de mayor precio.
5,Great sound quality! Really nice product. 100w is pretty sufficient for a good ambient sound. Just do not expect to throw a big party with them. I recommend 2 pairs for a extra boom but one is already amazing. 10 of 10. P.s just installed them can’t say much about durability on different weather. But build is really solid.
5,Muy buena bocinas es la tercera vez que la compro. Me han funcionado excelente y aguantan al intemperie
5,Excelente opción a un muy buen precio!Es el segundo par que compro para un segundo espacio.El primer par lo tengo desde hace 12 años funcionando con laCaliddad del primer dia.
5,Llego en tiempo y forma suenen muy bien no son bocinas premium pero por el precio son una excelente cormpra
4,SON BUENAS BOCINAS SIN EMBARGO LO QUE ESTAS BUSCANDO ES TENER UN SONIDO DE MUCHA FIDELIDAD NO ES EL CASO YA QUE CUANDO LE SUBES MUCHO LOS BAJOS SE DISTORCIONAN A UN VOLUMEN MODERADO SUENAN MUY BIEN
5,muy buenas bocinas a un precio razonable  y de muy buena calidad cumple con mis espectativas
5,suenan muy bien muy buena calidad de audio. yo las tengo en un lobby comercial de doble altura y han mostrado muy buen desempeño.
1,No llegó el producto la caja llegó vacía como lo voy a devolver ?
5,Ok
5,Fue exactamente lo que esperaba a muy buen precio
5,Muy buen producto a muy bien precio
5,100%
5,Estaba buscando unas bocinas para ponerle a mi barco y de verdad que estas son las mejores bocinas con relación calidad/precio.Tienen muy buen sonido y muy buen tamaño.
5,Funcionan muy bien y son prácticas de utilizar
4,funciona bien se escucha mejor
5,Buen sonido y producto de calidad.
5,Relación precio calidad muy buena
5,Excelente articulo
5,Super
5,Arrived within a couple days. More than pleased with these speakers. They sound great and the price was great.
3,En melodías con bajos la bocina retumba dando un sonido molesto. Ya había leído una reseña donde comentaban sobre la pobre calidad y aun así quise probar.
3,I bought 6 of these and after 1 year 3 are dead. only one of the dead ones was actually outside so I think they may not be able to handle volume.
5,High quality speaker..with crispy sound.and reasonably priced
5,La marca habla por sí sola Yamaha es calidad en material y audio
4,Calidad de audio pero el blanco se decolora al sol
5,I have had these speakers for 7 years now and they are excellent. I have had them out side a few times and now I have them in our sunroom. The speakers are well built as I had dropped one on a wall mount and it did not break. The protected case for the speaker inside held well and just scuffed. The sound quality and versatility are excellent. I wish in some ways I could find them in black but the white is still aesthetically pleasing to the eye and don't stand out like a sore thumb on a wall. I have purchased another 4 of them as I found them to be one of the better wall mounted speakers I have come across over the years.
4,Me parecio un buen articulo solo que derrepente  dejo de dar sonido y solo se escucha el twiterPodran desirme que debo hacer para validar garantia??? Llevo 4 meses von ellas y las use poco
