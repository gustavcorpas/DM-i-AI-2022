4,I've bought a more expensive wrap band in Hawaii and although beautiful workmanship the watch always lifts up and away from my wrist so that it locks.  Makes the watch fairly useless.  When I saw that this watch has the straps mounted to prevent this I was very excited to try it.  So far it has lasted wearing many times.  I do switch it to a sports strap most often since I want to wash up without damaging the band.  At first I couldn't unclasp the links to downsize but when I found I had to remove the whole thing it happened to be an easy lift.  At this length however it is just a tad small and I have to be careful not to pinch my skin.  It isn't easy for me to reclasp since its so tight but it works great once on.  I'll be looking to buy more though.  Good price for a nice look.
4,The band is Gorgeous!!!!BUT‚Ä¶.. it does run big which I was expecting honestly because ALL Apple Watch bands that I have purchased in the past that do not have a ‚ÄúPull to Tighten‚Äù closure like a watch or magnetic band are big on meeven after removing all the extra links‚Ä¶Unfortunately it comes with the territory. Which is having a child sized bone structureü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.So if like me everything is big on you expect this to be as well.It‚Äôs not near loose enough to fall off so I‚Äôm still going to use it on occasion but it‚Äôs loose enough that it won‚Äôt register HR or o2.I haven‚Äôt worn it long enough to assess durability.**I am wearing a 40mm sized watch **
5,I removed all of the links and it fits perfectly. I think my wrist is small usually any watches with links can never go small enough to fit how I want them to. I like it to be snug and not move around at all. I am in love with how this looks and how well it fits. It doesn‚Äôt feel cheap but I just got it today so I‚Äôm not sure if the durability yet. It‚Äôs a little bit difficult to clasp on and off but just the same as any watch with a clasp.
4,No dig but had to return it due to the clasp. I did not want to play around with getting another one so just returned it. The clasp kept opening and it fell off my wrist several times. It may have been a one off and the company was easy to return to with no difficulty. The band was very pretty and again the clasp may have just been an issue on mine.
4,These straps are nice. They have adjustable links if you have a nonexistent wrist like myself.  The little ‚Äúdiamonds‚Äù look cheap but far away you slay girl!  I think these are cute and get you away from the silicone bands that everyone judges you for wearing in pics with nice clothes.
4,Overall I really like the band! I get a ton of compliments on it and it‚Äôs comfortable! The only thing negative to say is the clasp looks like it‚Äôs a bit tarnished. (As seen in the photo) I never wear it in the water and don‚Äôt sleep with it on so this is just normal wear on the clasp. It still holds tight just isn‚Äôt very pretty anymore. I‚Äôve had it about 2 months.
4,It‚Äôs quite cute however if you have smaller wrists removing all of the extra bits makes it fit snuggly. This not easy to remove.  I still like it and would recommend.  Just be aware.
4,This watch band is a cute Boho style. I like wearing multiple bracelets and this fits that style nicely. I chose the band in rose gold to match the Apple Watch face.Pros: The links are removable so it‚Äôs easy to adjust for fitThe multi colored straps are fashionable and have just enough bling.It‚Äôs durable I‚Äôve had small children pulling  at my watch and it hasn‚Äôt come loose.Cons: It‚Äôs price point is obvious. It‚Äôs fast fashion because it‚Äôs inexpensive.
4,I love how cute this watch band is but I‚Äôm not able to use it. With an additional link it‚Äôs too big but without any it‚Äôs too small. They watch moves around and loses contact with my skin. Got tired of having to constantly unlock my watch.
5,Loved this! Made well. Looks like the pics. Easy to adjust the size. I have a 44 mm apple watch and the smallest adjustment was too tight. The next size up was too big to keep contact. Sad to have to return it. üò§
5,I wanted a bracelet look with my watch. Love this‚Ä¶it was easy to attach to my watch and it is very well made. Will be getting another one in a different color. I also like that you just need to remove a link to shorten it.
5,It comes with multiple links so you can adjust the size. I‚Äôm kind of in between sizes but it‚Äôs still comfortable. I really love it. It‚Äôs dressy but not too gaudy. It goes well with my business casual or my professional attire
5,Update the one I had was defective. The littlest touch would make the clasp open. They sent me a new one and it works perfectly. I get comments on the band all the time. I love it!While this is the prettiest band ever the clasp that holds it on your wrist won‚Äôt stay shut and falls open at the slightest bump. I have it a couple tries because it‚Äôs so pretty but it‚Äôs not worth the gamble of losing my watch because of the cheap clasp.
4,I have received a bunch of compliments on this piece.  It is prettier in person.  Unfortunately I had to remove all of the links and it is still too big for my small wrist.
4,One of the best purchases; however it‚Äôs not made for every day use. If you wash your hands multiple times a day the band will only last you a few months if you wear it on occasion it‚Äôs perfect for you.
5,I purchase 5 different bands. I love them all. They are really great looking well made bands!! The only thing that makes me sad was I wish there were more choices with the dark metal.
4,The watch band is soo cute I love it cause I always forget to put jewelry on when getting ready I‚Äôm in a rush a lot cause I have a lot of kids so this is great. I get a lot of complements on it and the color goes with a lot of outfits! It‚Äôs been a couple weeks now and it‚Äôs starting to leave a green mark on my wrist everyday. I‚Äôm going to search for one that has a better metal buckles that went turn my wrist green
5,I was extremely surprised by the quality of this item. I like the fact that it was easily adjustable and would fit a range is wrist sizes. I have since order another color. Happy with the purchase!
4,I have had this for a few weeks now. It‚Äôs very pretty but it‚Äôs already showing a lot of wear n tear.
4,Love the look and style as described and shown in their photos the links are adjustable/removable for size. I bought 2 because I wasn‚Äôt sure the gold was going to hold up and would start to fade and after 2 weeks of wearing it every day it has started to tarnish a little but as expected for a 16$ band. It‚Äôs still holding up nicely! I love it!
4,Super cute!!! The links are not easy to remove and there was no tool to help take it off. Had to figure something out small enough to get in between the links and then had really shake it so I could unlatch it.I used the the little tool that comes with cell phones to help pop out SD cards üòÜOther than that worth the purchase!
5,i love the product but i did lose a link and i wonder were can i buy a link or two .. soni use it with my apple watch
5,I like watchbands that have a little bling but they are usually too big.  This one is cute and fits perfectly after I easily removed a link to make it fit properly.  I love a little bling and this band is perfect!
4,I originally wrote a review about the clasps not staying closed. They sent me a new one and I absolutely love it! It is easy to open and close change out links is a breeze and looks beautiful! (Original post-The clasps doesn‚Äôt stay open. Every time I move my wrist it pops open. I can say that it is pretty but that‚Äôs about it.)
5,I am the type to buy 5-6 watch bands looking for what I wanted. This is my second favorite. It is great for us gals with chubby wrists.I took out one link and it fits great. I already bought a second one to send to my friend for her birthday as well. Just can‚Äôt say enough about how cute it is.
5,I‚Äôve had a ton of compliments on this and have ordered it in silver for the holiday season! Fits great comes with a couple of clasps so you can adjust the size. I like my watch to fit snug and this is perfect !
4,I love this band I‚Äôve worn it for months. I do not get it wet. It is now turning my skin green and the silver parts are tarnishing. It was a good run I might get another one.
5,I love this and wear it daily. It fits perfectly after removing some links. I get lots of compliments. I highly recommend it!
4,No instructions on how to install it!
5,I LOVE this watch band! I ordered every color. People must remember to clean it with alcohol wipes after a few washes.
5,Love to switch out my watch bands to go with my outfits. On the weekends when not at my hospital job I like to change it up so I switch out my watch bands for these and it makes my watch look like it‚Äôs incorporated into my outfit.
3,When this watchband arrived I really loved it. The look was great it was comfortable and easy to put on a takeoff.  It is a Watch so of course I wear it every day. As you can see by the photos there‚Äôs a lot of wear to the metal and because of the wear I occasionally have marks on my skin. In addition many of the straps are coming apart. I do not wear this in the shower swimming or where it‚Äôs going to get wet. I have only had the band for three months but I don‚Äôt feel like I can wear it anymore in its current condition. Extremely disappointed because I love the watchband  it just does not stand up. I can see from other posts this seems to be an issue with the black band more than some of the others.
5,I have a very small wrist.  Took out all the extra links and it fits perfect.  Very pleased.
4,Watch band is pretty big. Will have to take to a jeweler to remove a link or two. Still very pretty and looking forward to wearing it.
4,Functional comfortable and lovely to look at.  It‚Äôs cool and easy to wear in the summer
4,It‚Äôs very cute and stylish. I‚Äôm not sure how durable it will be only time will tell. It is loose on my wrist but that‚Äôs not a big deal for me.
5,I get so many compliments on this. It looks great. I am also pleased that taking out the links made it small enough for my wrists
5,I ordered this watch band for my niece to wear with her fancy prom dress. Her accessories are all silver so this was a perfect match the quality is amazing.
5,I bought and have only worn for one trip for two days. The leather of course stretches. It was very hot out when I wore it too. I love the clasp and the look of this though. My watch worked with it on too. You can take out pieces to make smaller. I really like this babd
4,It‚Äôs so pretty but so hard to open and remove it. I wish it was better and I would wear it every day.
5,Honestly it did come a couple days late understandable do to bad weather on the expected day but it was worth the wait I like that it's comfortable easy to put on readjust able to fit your wrist size & the quality is wonderful maybe I'll come back to give a second review after a couple of weeks or a month of use.
5,Really easy to size each clasp can be removed!
4,It was a little big but super cute. Easy on and off.
5,So cute! I get a-lot of compliments on it.
5,I love this band it fits well and it‚Äôs pretty. Seems very durable too
4,Metal is turning colors after only 2 weeks of wear
5,The product is size adjustable. I love it and its quality so far.
5,I like that fact of this product is easy to remove links and very comfortable.
5,Nice band- good quality- great price
5,
5,I love the band. It is so versatile and durable.
4,Looks and fits great however I wish it didn‚Äôt turn my wrist green.
5,Exactly as expected!
4,Love the look of this band! My only issue is the clip does not seem to secure tightly!
4,Used to dress up my watch for wedding.
4,Super cute!! I love that it looks classy and like I‚Äôm wearing a bracelet. The links are removable so you can make it smaller/larger.It is tricky to get on by myself once I perfected it it was easier. But also hard to remove the actual watch face from the grip so I will struggle to swap it out for my workout band in the mornings. Oh well. So cute!Three week update - the band is still cute but has def stretched out. I have to remove another link to shrink it. Still cute and worth the money. Gonna buy the black one soon!
5,Had to take a link out fits perfectly and was so easy to remove
4,
5,LOVE this band!  Many compliments!  You will not be disappointed.  The adjustable links are a win as well.
4,Easy to change
4,PRO: I like that the band comes with clasps that can easily be removed if you‚Äôre needing it smaller. I was unaware that it did that put it on the first time & realized it was too big. I was able to remove a couple of the links with clasps to then make it the size that fit me the best. Some bands make you use a tool to remove the links to fit your wrist but this was so much easier.CON: I did notice that it did turn my arm green from where I must have gotten water underneath it from washing my hands. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs something different that would cause this to not happen (I have heard of clear fingernail polish).
5,Very stylish. Received a lot of compliments.
5,I get so many compliments when I wear this band.
5,Ive received SO many compliments! Get it you won‚Äôt regret it!
3,It‚Äôs totally cute and got a lot of attention with this wrist band. Let‚Äôs face it it‚Äôs only 2 months old and I thought it would last longer. But I‚Äôm glad I checked it before wearing it again could have had a broken watch. Notice all four straps that hold it all together are no longer functioning. I guess it was too good to be true price verses length of time it lasted. Sad. So cute and so quickly it‚Äôs worn down.
5,I'm so happy with this watch band. I bought it because in the AZ heat I sweat and the silicone bands gave me a rash. This one does NOT give me a rash and can be dressed up or dressed down. Super cute and great quality! Will be buying more
5,Love it
5,It‚Äôs beautiful and comfortable
4,The band is really pretty and comfortable. The only problem I see is it scratches up easily. Overall it‚Äôs a decent buy.
4,I like the overall look of this band but I‚Äôm constantly checking to see if the clasp is locked. Once the leather stretches the band loosens and the clasp becomes unhinged- even after removing several links. I‚Äôm going to look for another band.
5,It looks very dressy
3,I love the look of The watch band but with the bracelet on the top it slides underneath the watch and the watch disconnects from your wrist even after I tightened it to the tightest it could go. The bracelet part that was not connected to the watch broke after only two weeks.
5,Love üíï absolutely perfect for what I was looking for something casual with a little bit of style. Clasps are extremely easy to remove and put back on. I wore it on my trip to Norway for two weeks and got many compliments.
5,Looks beautiful with my series 7 Apple Watch. My nine year old says it looks ‚Äúreally expensive ‚Äú ha! I highly recommend !
4,It‚Äôs turning my wrist green but it‚Äôs worth it!
4,
4,Had to take all the links out for it to fit but I probably have tiny wrists now üò©üòÜ some of the bands are larger than the others but no one besides you will notice or care I promise üòÇ
3,It‚Äôs pretty and will be nice for dressy occasions but putting it on is frustrating.  There is no quick way to do it. The link flops around and makes it difficult to thread through the little opening. It snaps in place and seems secure. Time will tell.Removing links is easy for those of us with very small wrists.
4,I have gotten lots of compliments on this it‚Äôs one of my favorites to dress up my watch
5,It was a simple process to adjust the band to fit me perfectly and the look of it is great the feel of it is great I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase.
5,very cute. thanks
4,The only thing about this product is the clasp come undone a lot.
3,I‚Äôm disappointed because this is a beautiful watch band but it started tarnishing within the first week of wearing it. Very cute but will not last long
4,Pulso y el color
4,Great comfort and durability üëç
3,Cute and easy to remove pieces to adjust size and take on and off but the smallest size is still too loose.
4,Very cute. The only issue is that on the smallest setting it takes a little bit to get it to latch. Also it has two leather straps that I suspect can‚Äôt hold up long but for the price I‚Äôm not too concerned. It‚Äôs very cute and fits very well
4,I like the product but the only thing is with one connector it fits tight and with two it fits loose. I guess I need to get use to wearing it with one.
5,I love this watch band especially for the price! Great buy!
3,As much as I love the way the band looks it doesn‚Äôt fit my wrist well (5.5‚Äù). Even with all the links removed. I use my Apple Watch for stand and move goals and the straps on this band keep moving around and lifting the watch off of my wrist. So I continually have to sign in to my watch. It is very pretty though. The rhinestone face was a separate purchase.
3,Pretty band. Slid easily on my Apple Watch but was difficult to get the clasp in the link.  Once I was able to I could place three fingers under the band it was so big.  I had ordered the smallest they had but way to large. I‚Äôm going to see if I can remove a couple links to make it more snug.
5,Fairly easy to put on and take off. Easy to size. Very pretty.
5,looks Nice and wears great
4,I really loved this band but only got to wear it a few times bc the adjustable clasp/link that I needed to use to make it smaller wouldn't stay clasped to the band & it ended up falling off.  I can't wear it now which sucks bc I loved the style.
3,Beautiful band but it only lasted a little more than a month. I wear my watch everyday And I noticed after a week or two that the gold pieces started to turn. After a month the clasp started to come undone at random times. The final straw was the band coming off the part that is secured to the watch. Going back to my basic band I guess.
3,I enjoyed my watchband while it lasted which was less than two months. The straps that connect to the watch face are just folded over and clamped back against itself. They are not clamped very tightly so they slide out and disconnect themselves from the watch face which can cause the watch to fall off.
3,When I saw this band had links I was hopeful that it was sizable. It is not. I definitely have skinny wrists so I‚Äôm not saying the band is bad but it is huge for me and cannot be made smaller.  I will return.
5,Love the band but not sure how long it‚Äôll last by durability standards. Only time will tell.
3,I removed all the available links...it is really easy!  The watch is still a trifle big even with all the extra links removed.  It is also just a big "gaudy" but I will wear it!
4,Really cute and feels durable. It‚Äôs easily adjustable. Only down fall is it‚Äôs really hard to put on with one hand
4,So it‚Äôs pretty for sure. The adjusting was easy. As for durability no clue yet. It‚Äôs as comfortable as something like this is going to be.
5,Look fantastic!  Accents the wrist and watch!
3,This band is really cute however I struggle with putting it on.  I actually can‚Äôt put it on by myself.  It‚Äôs just to hard to latch.  I can‚Äôt wear it as much as I‚Äôd like due to this.  I would not order it again
3,After a few uses it turned my wrist green and I‚Äôm not a person that even wears my watch everyday
2,When I got the band I loved the fact that I could adjust the size with the links. I also liked how the bands look next to my watch but that is where the likes ended. As I started wearing it daily the outer bands would slide under my watch which then interferes with how the watch is meant to function. I found myself adjusting the straps multiple times a day. I was able to deal with that until recently. It's been close to a month if not longer of wearing it daily. I don't wear it while showering in the pool or anywhere that there is prolonged water exposure. Now my wrist is turning green not only on the decorative metal pieces on top but also on the clasps. If this was truly stainless steel like they advertise it wouldn't be turning my skin green!! Looking at it it looks like it is a stainless steel plating with cooper under the plating. Very upset over the fact that they have false advertising on the metal for this! Thankfully I didn't buy one for my mother-in-law because she definitely wouldn't be able to wear it with her skin sensitivities! Super upset over this happening and that I now need to find another band to wear and fast! Can't have a green wrist when I work as an office manager of a rental company and tenants see my hands on a daily basis!!
4,It‚Äôs easy to attach to the watch but I have very slim wrists so if I wanted my watch to record a walk or run it wouldn‚Äôt be tight enough. I wear this when I go to dinner or when I‚Äôm out with the family and want a different look.
3,The clasp color fades away and turns my skin green
4,This is cute but one of the leather pieces is no longer attached after just a few weeks. Of course it's just past the return window. Will update the review if the seller gets back to me with a replacement.EDIT: The seller contacted me the next day after this review posted and sent a free replacement. Very happy with the service and hopeful the new one doesn't break!
3,Love how this watch looks and the compliments I‚Äôve received. The metal is very cheap and leaves green marks on my wrist. For the price point didn‚Äôt really expect much there. I‚Äôm really sad that the strap broke today after only 2 months. :-(
5,The band is so pretty.  I have a very small wrist so the adjustable brackets are helpful. Love it !
5,I love that this band is so different from my regular Apple watchbands.  I get a lot of compliments about it. I‚Äôm going to order others that include bracelets too.
3,I absolutely love it it‚Äôs so pretty and fits great. My only problem is one of the clasps won‚Äôt stay latched causing it to fall off my wrist with a $300 watch face attached : /
4,This Apple watch band is very cute I really liked it. Sadly it doesn‚Äôt fit my wrist. I have very small wrists so if you have small wrists too it might be too big. I know it adjusts but the smallest adjustment is still too big for my wrist.
5,Ok girls this is a must have watch band! The links will fit just about any size wrist. I have a hard time finding the bracelet or nicer watch bands to fit my wrist. This one fit with no problem. Love the style and look to it. I have two and plan to grab a couple more soon!!
4,Love the color the design but I have a metal allergy and broke out on my wrist.
3,loved this band it looked good on but material is not good quality one of the smaller straps came loose after wearing one time
4,I have this in both gold and black. My wrist turns green with both
5,
5,Trendy and looks great for client meetings. I‚Äôm not using it everyday to keep it looking clean and dressy. Will definitely be wearing it for events and other special occasions. Considering purchasing in other colors. Extended clips were easy to remove for size of wrist.
4,I love the look of the watch band. I have used it off and on for a month. The braided strips are coming undone.
5,I absolutely love this watch band.  The links are so easy to remove (just use the link like you are going to fasten and you can unlock however links you need to).  It is comfortable too.  I got the khaki color with cream and blush color bands.  Just lovely.  I can't say anything for durability as I only just received it.
3,Only was able to wear it a month before it fell apart. The first couple times wearing it I had to fix the claps on it.
3,I love the look of the band and it‚Äôs comfy but it doesn‚Äôt lay right on my wrist. Constantly puts my phone in lock mode and my watch doesn‚Äôt recognize that I‚Äôm wearing it.
3,I have a Series 3 38mm watch. It looks great with the watch really dresses it up. The links are easy to remove to size it and I had to remove all but one. That said while it fits my wrist the extra decorative bands on it cannot be sized and they look silly and are too big with large gaps. If I had a larger wrist it would look far better. If you have a smaller wrist this may not be the best band for you.
5,Super comfortable and pretty!  Makes me wear my watch a lot more than I ever did!
5,I always hated how sporty the Apple Watch looks but this band turns it into a real piece of jewelry! It‚Äôs not water resistant and I wouldn‚Äôt wear it every day but it‚Äôs great for dressing up a little.My one complaint is that it really seems to mess with the stand and move features. I wore it for two lazy days in a row when I got up late and wasn‚Äôt feeling good so spent most of the day on the couch but I somehow crushed my stand goal before noon (how is that even possible?) and my move goal by 2 pm. I‚Äôve tried attaching the band both ways and it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Love the boho look of this band. After reading all the reviews I was a little nervous about having trouble with taking off the links but it was surprisingly very easy. I didn‚Äôt have to use tools. They easily popped off.
5,Personally I love it. I would never wear my watch because I hated the bands and was looking for something more I would like. I love that they put more links on that you can easily remove and put back on to match  the size of your wrist! Only negative thing I can say about the whole product is when I opened they had tape (assuming it wouldn‚Äôt scratch) on the part that clips together and it was kind of annoying to get off but I managed! Lol
3,It fell apart within 3 months.
5,Now I can wear my iwatch all  time.  I can dress it up!  So many compliments
3,Keeps letting go at the point where the watch band holds together
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I love it. It‚Äôs so cute. It‚Äôs really big but you can easily remove the links. I think I removed 3 links. No tools required. They just unsnap. I‚Äôve worn it 3 days. I read reviews it doesn‚Äôt hold up. So far so good.
5,I get so many compliments on these bands. They are really easy to adjust the size of the band.I have this silver one and a black and gold one. I wore the black and gold one more until the finish wore off on the connector piece and started turning my wrist green. I just switched to this one. I hope it doesn‚Äôt do the same. But I do love the look of these.
4,I love this item I also add some more bling and I just love the out look
3,Owned this 3 months and wore it for dressy occasions . It broke while I was wearing it today. So disappointing. I liked the color and design!!
3,It‚Äôs beautiful! It‚Äôs not too sturdy and not easy to remove links or to use closure.
5,I get compliments everywhere I go!!  Love it!
3,This product unattractive and hard on the skin.
5,I love the look of this new band with my Apple Watch. I'm impressed with the quality! I've been wearing it daily for over a month now and it's holding up very well. I'm glad I purchased it.
5,LOVE this band!! I have been searching for months to find the perfect watch band and this is it! It‚Äôs so comfortable breathable and just the right type of sparkly. I can dress up or down. Definitely looking to get it in more colors! Very happy!
3,Finish wore off the clasp very quickly
5,I love the untraditional style of this watch band. Many reviews noted lack of durability & breakage after a short time but I have had no such issues with my band. The clasp is easy to use (& easy to remove links if needed). The quality is great especially for the price. Highly recommend!
5,This watch band looks like a few bracelets on my arm and it catches peoples attention. I‚Äôve gotten several compliments on it. It‚Äôs easy to take the links out where the latch is so that it fits snug enough for the watch to get the info it needs from your inner wrist. The middle band is snug but the others are made to be lose like bracelets would be.I love it. Not water proof obviously.
4,
3,Tarnished after wearing it a week
3,Please note it works well and looks cute. I just didn‚Äôt think of the clasp In the back.  I wear my watch backwards.  So all you see is the clasps I was looking for a complete wrap around.  But I have been getting compliments like crazy and it‚Äôs not uncomfortable.  But not gonna lie when I get home I take it off.
5,I love the bling look of this band. VERY easy to size took 1 hot second. Comfortable and looks great. Intend to buy a few more of the colors!!
3,This watch band looks perfect. Love the colors and feel. But after only wearing it for a couple days I'm already seeing some wear on the metal parts. I'm not hard on my watch and don't remember bumping anything. But scratches and some wearing on the metal this quickly makes it seem cheap.
5,I haven‚Äôt had it long enough to know about durability but it was pretty inexpensive so I don‚Äôt expect it to last forever.  But it‚Äôs definitely what I was looking for ‚Äî a cheap way to make my Apple Watch look nicer when I want to dress it up a bit!
3,Watch doesn‚Äôt sit well on wrist with this band causing the sensor unable to detect wrist.
5,Stylish and no threads that poke or itch. Lower quality so won't last but if you like having a little of band choices this should be in your jewelry kit!
5,Sizing isn‚Äôt necessary as part of the band is removable making it very handy. Very comfortable if you don‚Äôt want your watch tight which I don‚Äôt. Band opens so it can lay flat on the charger. Only concern is durability- a couple of the straps seem to have stretched and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they break and the metal is clearly coated as the coating scratched off pretty easily. It‚Äôs still very pretty and comfortable and isn‚Äôt noticeable except to me.
5,I get compliments on this apple watch band every time i wear it. It fits great and has adjustable clasps. Easy to change out from other watch bands. Would consider another one like this in other colors
3,The band discolored 3 days after wearing it.
3,I got this watch band because my mom got one and I loved it! Wore mine 10 days and it is falling apart the strip with the bling and chain is separating the chain changed colors and the balls on another strap 2 of the 3 changed colors. She has had hers for a long while now and wears it everyday hers is just fine still. I am not a very happy customer at all. My return date has ended on the 7th it is now the 11th I will NOT buy another one. 10days of wear for the money I paid for it just doesn‚Äôt cut it I am very dissatisfied. Could been just a one off but I won‚Äôt purchase again to me is a waste of money and don‚Äôt want to waste more money to see if it was just a one off situation.
3,Meh
3,Loved the look and color but one of the clasps the major anchoring clasp ( I had to remove the others to get it to fit) didn‚Äôt close right and kept opening up
3,I liked this band and received several compliments. However after a month it broke.
5,Lots of complements I love wearing it out with my going out outfits.
3,Love the band! Love the adjustable size -But the clasp turned my wrist colors- that‚Äôs a bummer- I will have to put clear polish on the back to keep  it from happening-
5,I get so many compliments this band. Easy on and off. Took out a couple of links. It‚Äôs also very comfortable to sleep in. Ended up buying same in another pattern.
5,Do you ever see fb add of something then immediately head to Amazon to find it?! Thanks fb algorithm for picking me to see this watch band being sold for $37. And thanks Amazon for helping me find it ( the photo search tool in the app is my new favorite thing btw) for only $16. And its surprisingly great quality! I love how cute and dainty it is I can dress up an otherwise clunky watch (my only dislike about my apple watch) The links are adjustable (super easy and no tools needed like others I've bought) so I could shorten it to fit my tiny wrist but the additional strappy pieces stay loose. I'm probably going to go buy a couple more colors so I have some other cute and dressy band options.
5,Love this watch band.
5,Guys I‚Äôve never had luck  with watches.  Ever.  Period.  But I literally attached and sized it in under 10 minutes.  Game changer.  Plus it‚Äôs super cute in an extra kind of way ya know?  It‚Äôs our Day One so I can‚Äôt speak to durability but this relationship is off to a good start üíú
5,I got my watch band today. I love it not sending it back
5,I love the look and feel on this ban.
3,Cute and very comfortable but did turn my wrist green so no longer wearing it. Long run kinda a waste
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I loved this band. It is so boho and cute. I‚Äôve had it for about a month or two and the band came apart from the clasp. Very sad because I loved it.
3,I just got my first Apple watch and wanted to dress it up.  This band did just that for about 3 days.  Day 4 the little bar that holds the straps on one side broke off.
5,This is exactly what I wanted to fit my watch into my style. I have a small wrist. This was so quick and simple to adjust sizes on. I bought several colors of face protectors to complete the look. Love this!
5,Worked as expected
5,I love it it‚Äôs just what I was looking for I totally recommend!
3,It is cute. This watch comes with extensions. I only needed one but the clasps on them are not strong and open unexpectedly.
5,East to put on and take off- both the watch and the wrist.The links of the band are easily adjustable to fit your wrist size. (No tools needed YAY!)Seems durable. I get lots of compliments on the style- have already sent link to friends for them to buy.
5,A very eclectic boho look. So many compliments on this.  I have purchased 2 different color patterns and so happy with them both.
3,Cute but not dursble
5,Cute and have gotten lots of compliments . Underside discolored and tarnished looking .
5,I have a very slim wrist and this band was easy to adjust (to the smallest size) and it fits perfectly. I wanted something light for summer with a little bling. This is perfect! I will probably order the version in black. Delivered promptly and well packaged. Many compliments on it already!
5,Style of it is fantastic. I love wearing my watch around on this.
5,I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase it looks great and the bands fall just right for a boho look. I bought 2 the Black & Silver both are great quality you can smell the leather.
5,Super adorable. I bought the band so it would match my outfits for vacation. Surprisingly it went with all my outfits. I loved that it came with removable links to make them fit better. Very nice and affordable
5,Watch band is beautiful. I‚Äôve received so many compliments. Dresses up my watch for special occasions
5,I love the jewelry look to my watch.  One of my friends ordered one too.  I may order another color.
5,It was so easy to change the length of this band to fit snuggly around my wrist.  I love it!
3,Not the same as the picture . Very simple braided on 2 strands and pretend leather on 5 and 1 skinny Brown strand.  Only 2 very small extra clasps
3,This band is way too big and not adjustable. I ordered the smallest size
2,Ascetically this is really nice. Unfortunately that's where the praise stops. This is the most infuriating product to open.  The ends are wrapped in some kind of plastic that is hard to cut open because it's so tight. It took forever to make tiny little cuts.  And once you cut it it doesn't just open right up....you have to keep going.  This made me crazy.  Once you get it open....you will have (depending on your skin) maybe a week or two before your wrist will turn green.  All the clasps will turn the whole inside of your wrist green. It just starts to tarnish right out of the package.
5,
5,Love that the band is adjustable! And love the different colors/designs of bracelets... But oy after 5 days the leather has begun to peel off at the hinges...
4,I love that it is easy to remove a link in case you need to adjust it. Nice band but starts off stiff. But after bending it and wearing it a few times it lays on my wrist better.
5,I struggled to put it on after sizing it down to my wrist but had help. It is super cute and comfortable to wear!!!
3,I wash my hands acquire fequently and turned my wrist green at the clasp
3,I loved the look so much. Broke the second day I wore it.
3,I haven‚Äôt had it long and it‚Äôs discolored. The leather parts keep coming undone too. I don‚Äôt think it will last much longer. Pretty expensive just to last two months.
5,Love this watch band.  Fits great easy to adjust size stylish and receive lots of compliments.
5,I have small wrists and I was able to easily remove the extra links and wear it with in a matter of a minute!
3,It‚Äôs so cute but the black starts to peal off. üòî this was my favorite one until then
3,But I‚Äôve had it for a month and the clasps don‚Äôt snap to secure when I put it on anymore. I have to fight to put it on so I swapped it out already.
5,absolutely love this watch band. I had more compliments on it the first couple times i wore it. My sister oohed and awed over it so much i ordered one for her too..
5,I really loved this got the black one and the silver. They have easy remove links to make the correct size and very comfortable! Much better than my sports band which often left my wrist sweaty!
4,Nice and fancy they‚Äôre cute to wear fits my small wrist. I like the easiest way to adjust the band no tool needed.
5,Love the look of a bracelet type of style instead of the traditional watch band. Was easy to get on and the links seem pretty durable. Great fit!
5,Easy on and very comfortable
3,Product is pretty but the clasp are loose .. open to easy and falls off .. I‚Äôm afraid I may lose my watch with out knowing .
5,I love changing out my Apple Watch bands but have found that being plus size impacts how many of them will fit! This one comes with multiple removable links for those with smaller wrists. The best part all the links also make it comfy for those with up to a 9 inch wrist. Very happy!!
5,This is such a cool band- looks like a boho bracelet! I get loads of compliments ever time I wear it! Highly recommend- links easily removable for a perfect fit!
5,Love the look and feel of this band. Very cute on.
5,Everything is perfect!
3,Initial reaction is LOVE IT! will wait and see how it holds up after a week at the beach.Update: 7/2022 the ‚Äúleather‚Äù has started to peel. So bummed. This is after daily wear since the original post. Changed to 3stars.
3,Love the look of this band. It‚Äôs also very comfortable. Sadly it didn‚Äôt last more than three months. On the smallest setting sometimes it‚Äôs too loose to make contact with skin and disconnects from phone. Also if you wear your watch on the left wrist and flex your hand the extra bands press on the dials and set off the sos mode and cancels out any exercise you may be tracking. If you‚Äôre just looking for a super cute band though this will do the trick.
5,This watch band is really super cute!!!!  It is well-made and the band is adjustable. It was just what I was looking for at a fraction of the cost of Apple Watch bands. I highly recommend!
5,This is so pretty and makes me feel a little dressier when I‚Äôm wearing it.
5,Very pretty on the arm and adjustable to several wrist sizes.  I have received compliments on it!
3,I PURCHASED THIS AS A WATCH BACND FOR THE APPLE WATCH AND THE LINKS WERE ON BACKWARDS AND WHEN YOU FLIP THEM AROUND THE FASTENERS DO NOT WOR PROPERLY. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
3,Turns spots on arm green. Two of the little band pieces have broke. One glued and stayed. Other won‚Äôt. The shiny coating is mostly worn off. Usually wear most of the week through the work day. Been about 6 weeks of wear.
5,I have tiny wrists so I‚Äôm very happy the links were so easy to remove & it fits perfectly. Great value purchase & I bought 2 colors.
3,I love the look love the style but already had a part break off.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I love this watch band. Easy to adjust and to remove.
5,Cute watch band. Very fashionable and easy to dress up or down.
3,I really like the band. The color is great and the material is nice except the fact that the clasp will not stay closed and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll lose the whole watch.
3,Cute band but one of the pieces broke it‚Äôs difficult to change out and the band is so loose I‚Äôm always having to put my pin in to check anything.
5,Looks fantastic and fits perfect. Love it.
3,This is easy put on
5,Love the watchband! Adjustable sizes looks elegant easy to put on!
5,Love this band and the rose gold!
3,It‚Äôs a nice looking band and it lasted about a week before one of the leather bands broke loose from the metal clasp. I got caught in a rain storm so I‚Äôm going to blame the band getting wet as the reason the strap came loose. It is adjustable to fit multiple wrist sizes but even on the smallest clasp it was still loose fitting on my wrist which caused my watch to frequently lock as if I had taken it off. So I don‚Äôt recommend this if you have issues with ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù watch bands being too big. I don‚Äôt have dainty little wrists either.
4,I love it I just put it on and it‚Äôs super cute. I‚Äôm not sure about durability because I just put it on but so cute ü•∞
3,Durability is not good!
4,Cute and fun Apple Watch band.... and very easy to adjust
4,Very cute band. Started to come apart after about 2 months. I change my bands about every week
5,Wish it were a little easier to get on.
5,Cute band affordable can adjust size by removing links. Dressed up my Apple Watch to wear with a dress.
3,Beautiful bracelet but glue and clips fall apart easily . Had to glue it a couple of times already. I wish the structural quality was better . Design is beautiful.
3,Its very beautiful and stylish got so many compliments on it. The only problem is that if it gets wet it turns to rose gold.
5,Purchased this for my step-daughter.  She had picked it out but was still excited when she was able to wear it.  Very sharp and trendy.
5,c√≥moda elegante practica!
5,I bought this for a conference and received so many complements! It‚Äôs not chintzy at all and blends really well with the rose gold Apple Watch face.
5,Just got mine and was exactly what I was looking for made my Apple Watch to be fancy and really nice to go out with it. Just loved it!!
5,So pretty and comfortable. You can adjust the the straps by removing a link around the lock portion. I love it. Looks very fashionable.
3,Loved the design easy removal but one strap was broken in 2 weeks!
5,I love this band! I get so many compliments and it is gorgeous!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Even more pretty in person! Link so easy to adjust only had couple openings f days but so far so happy
3,It‚Äôs very pretty. The main clasp is next. To impossible to open had to grab pliers..which is not good. Today I looked at it and it‚Äôs missing a stone. I‚Äôm just not happy with this purchase for those reasons. Probably going to return it. :(
5,Have had it for three weeks now and it is still in great shape. Minor wear on the clasp. It‚Äôs super cute.
5,Love it. Beautiful. I have a small wrist and it was super easy to remove links.
5,I‚Äôm so glad I ordered this watch band it looks really nice and it‚Äôs so comfortable
2,Very pretty but one side of the band does not stay in the watch and the glittery parts are already peeling. The white parts of the band get dirty super easy. Sad purchase for me. I have been wearing it so I did not try to return it.
3,Turned my wrist green almost instantly.
2,I absolutely loved this watchband! I got lots and lots of compliments on it every time I wore it. Sadly however the clasps  quickly tarnished and turned my arm green and the leather straps started to look faded and worn just after a few short wearings
2,This band was comfortable adjustable to fit my wrist with taking out links. It was stylish and looked great. However after about a week it began to turn my wrist green. I never got it wet and always took off the band and exchanged it when I worked  out. I wore it most days. This might be a great band to wear ‚Äúonce in a while‚Äù but not for every day use
5,It‚Äôs beautiful. I get lot of compliments. I‚Äôll be getting the other colors.
5,Love it !!! Very stylish
5,Love it
5,I have had so many complements for this watch band. It is very pretty and well made
5,This band is adorable I took it on vaca and felt like I was wearing a bracelet
4,Love this watch band. You can size it to bracelet style or nice & snug. So far a great buy!
2,I wanted to love this watch band. It was so gorgeous and I got compliments on it‚Ä¶ for the first couple of weeks then it started falling apart. This was just with regularly use I took it off to swim pushed it back when I washed my hands etc. I was so hopeful because I really love the look!
5,Sorry I went back through my orders and I did purchase this and I love the bands for my Apple Watch.
3,The band was very pretty and I received many compliments. I gave it a 3 because it fits kind of big and you have to put in the code many times because of this  ‚Ä¶ it is adjustable but it was either too tight or too loose. Also some of th strands came loose within a few weeks of wear.
3,It is kinda hard to remove but it‚Äôs super cute. The bands can be tricky i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs made for constant wear
2,I loved this watch band‚Ä¶.until it broke! 5 days after my ‚Äúreturn window‚Äù closed 2 of the small leather straps (part of the main band which secured the watch) broke. I‚Äôm so sad bc I would love to try again but don‚Äôt want to spend this money every month. Be careful. It seemed well made and it was very comfortable after I easily adjusted it. I‚Äôm sad. I didn‚Äôt even wear it all the time for that month. üòû
5,Love this band! Goes so well with my rose gold Apple Watch and jazzes it up. I get tons of compliments on it.Comfortable and the big thing is removing the links to fit‚Ä¶super easy as they are clasped together so you don‚Äôt have to remove tiny pins. I am also sensitive to metals and so far no issues with itching rash or leaving green marks on the skin.I definitely recommend!
5,I love it it is exactly as pictured.  Easy to adjust to size.
5,LInks to adjust size like a normal watch. Very fashionable. Love it!
3,I really like the look of this band. It fits well‚Ä¶. When you can actually get it on. You‚Äôre going to need help. Like a lot of help. I‚Äôve taken out grown men in tug of war easier than clasping this thing on myself. It‚Äôs rough. But if you have a strong man with tiny fingers to help you you‚Äôre golden.
2,Have had the watch band for about a month and it is falling apart. It‚Äôs never been in water but have worn it daily. The clasp keeps randomly opening all the strap brackets have fallen off and the leather is scratched up. I liked how small the bad was due to my very small wrist size but this just didn‚Äôt work out. So disappointed since it actually fit and worked very well for if I wanted to dress up or more boho look and done for exercises bit didn‚Äôt hold upüò¢
5,I get so many compliments.
3,i LOVED the look but it broke after just a few wears.
3,I wore this for an event not a whole day or during the night and it already broke. I would have loved it otherwise.
5,Really beautiful for a low cost stays on looks pretty. üëçüëç
5,This is a nice watch band. It came as described. My daughter has a really small wrist so being able to remove a link was very helpful.
3,Pros:  super cute and fashionable. Sturdy and made of quality materials.Cons:  stated sizing is wrong. Even with all links removed it is still too big on my 6‚Äù wrist. Says it fits down to 5.71‚Äù. Definitely not true.If you are looking for a super cute band and you have bigger wrists definitely go for it. If your wrists are small. Don‚Äôt bother. It will spin.
3,It‚Äôs a pretty band. But couldn‚Äôt get it to adjust small enough for my 6‚Äù wrist.
5,Love the quality looks very stylish durable!!
5,It‚Äôs very comfortable and stylish band.
2,Bought this in June for a vacation in August. Latch was always hard to secure. Wore for 2 weeks before it completely stopped latching.  Metal discoloration happened within days. If you buy it make sure you wear it immediately because the return policy is only 30 days.
2,It looked great for the first few days - really beautiful. However after about 2 weeks the metal tarnished and it started to fall apart. It also stained my wrist. Ended up throwing it away. Not worth the money
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It‚Äôs so pretty. Isn‚Äôt the most comfortable to wear but it so pretty and getting on and off is kinda difficult. The back scratches pretty easily. I‚Äôve only had mine a few days
2,I love the watch.. it looks super cute. Only problem is I have had it less than a month and one of the pieces that hold it together came undone. It looks like they were crimped on so unfortunately it‚Äôs but something I can fix myself.. other than the band breaking I would get it a 4 for looks
2,I have worn it daily since I got it. It started turning my wrist green within a couple of weeks and then the metal started turning a different color too. Not satisfied with how quickly it tarnished.
3,Ok so it‚Äôs only 15 dollars! Quality is poor.Easy to remove the links. Don‚Äôt think this will be durable for daily use may use it only when going out on the weekends.
5,This is exactly what I hoped it would be. Very cute and seems durable. I wear it nearly every day. I love that it looks like the type of bracelets I love but also holds my watch. It goes with just about anything. The clasp is strong and I don't worry about it falling off. Overall very happy with my purchase.
2,I‚Äôve owned this watch band for about a month and switch it out regularly depending on my outfit and it‚Äôs already fading and feeling loose. It doesn‚Äôt fit as well as it did when I first bought it and is flaking all of the rose gold. Do not recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I like everything about this band. It‚Äôs a perfect fit. I had to adjust it down. The heart rate oxygen ecg work fine. I have been wearing it for a few weeks now. Highly recommend.
5,surprised by how nice the quality seems‚Ä¶ i do wish it was possible to make it fit better after removing all the extra pieces but i do have small wrists
5,Cute watch band that looks good with the rose gold watch trim.  Easy to take the links out to make it smaller too!  Love it!
3,Decent quality. Cute for casual wear. The colors are muted which makes it perfect for mixing and matching outfits.
5,I‚Äôve broken so many cute watch bands!! This one was a little big but easily fixed by removing a couple of links. Putting it on and removing it is slightly difficult in the dark but otherwise it‚Äôs perfect.
5,Beautiful designs- also fits so comfortable!
2,I loved the style of this watch but it comes unclasped all the time. My watch has fallen off multiple times in my first two wears. I was so sad because it is so cute and stylish.
2,After only a month or so the clasp started scratching and getting difficult to open/close and soon after that I was unable to open/close the clasp w/out help or needle nose pliers
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Cute but straps don‚Äôt hold up.
5,Love this band looks expensive very comfortable to wear can be adjusted for any size.
5,I have purchased several other bands but they all fit my wrist to big fits just right
3,LOVED how this looked. It only lasted a few weeks before it broke.
5,It‚Äôs really cute and I get lots of compliments. It‚Äôs hard to get on and off. The clasps are difficult to get open and closed.
5,I love the adjustable wrap style! Easy to adjust. People have  been noting how nice it looks . Love the style !
5,First I have to say I was just thinking about how much I don‚Äôt like my watch when I‚Äôm going out because don‚Äôt match all my bracelets I wear!!!!Suddenly I saw this and LOVE it!! Really looks like the pictures and so easy to resize!!!!!!!Great fashion watch band!!!!!Thank you!!!
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Me gusto pero lastimosamente es muy grande para mi mano y tuve que sacarle dos de las partes doradas y as√≠ me sigue quedando grande y por tal motivo no luce bien y los cordones negros son muy largos
3,Super cute and I‚Äôve gotten compliments on it! Unfortunately the gold clasp section turns my wrist the tell tale blue green color of cheap jewelry. I was looking for an every day type watch band and am afraid it will come apart / rust out before too long. Maybe more of a once in a blue moon type.
5,I love it! Took out two pieces very easy to remove easy to clasp.
2,Very pretty just super disappointing that the band broke that holds that actual watch on so I couldn‚Äôt use it after a week.
5,Gives your watch a whole other look! Love it!!
5,Beautiful band however it did not last long. I‚Äôve had less than 6 weeks. Not for daily wear.
5,Very happy with the item it‚Äôs really pretty!
3,It‚Äôs all of a sudden caused blistering where the clasp sits on my wrist.
3,I love the look of this and really wish it had fit but I have a really small wrist... and even after I took out all the extra links to adjust the size it was too large. If you don't mind your watch dangling like a bracelet (or not counting your steps etc.) go for it!
2,I love this band.  But had one of the straps come out.  I bought it in June and only wore it when I am going out or to church.  Had lots of compliments on it.  It‚Äôs not very durable.
5,Love these bands!! They look so good when I‚Äôm dressed up and it looks like I‚Äôm wearing multiples bracelets.  I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments!
3,Wore it for maybe a couple days and the band broke easily.
3,Sometimes one of bands moves under watch and the watch turns off. Have to check watch constantly to make sure it‚Äôs on.
5,I love this!!
5,Don't know about durability yet. Just got it. It came very quickly and looks to be good quality so far. Love it!
2,This is so pretty. I put it on and wore it around the house for about an hour. The clasp came open 4 times. I am returning this.
3,The bracelet is BEAUTIFUL!!! If you want it smaller just take out links.
2,Cute watchband & I liked that the clasp was adjustable and durable being metal but the leathery decorative straps are not at all durable and the first one broke a few days after the return window closed.
5,This was easy to use with my Apple Watch and it really is so much more attractive than the original band
2,Cute but wouldn‚Äôt stay clasped. Didn‚Äôt replace due to the links not fitting  to my preference.
2,I only kept it because I‚Äôd passed my return date. I don‚Äôt wear it. It‚Äôs difficult to put and not like advertised. I wish I could still send it back.
2,Love the way the band looks and feels but had it about 3 months and the watch fell off my arm.  Luckily I was able to feel it and grab it off the ground.  One of the screws fell out and I have no way to fix it.  Just greatful that I didn‚Äôt lose my watch
5,I love the band. It‚Äôs easy to remove the links. Brings out my professional business attire at work. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments üòä
5,Love this band! It‚Äôs comfortable and stylish.
2,The wristbands were really pretty but didn‚Äôt fit at all and they are non adjustable. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying they fit a man‚Äôs wrist so unless you have large wrist don‚Äôt buy
5,Definitely worth purchasing
2,I really like this band. It was easy to adjust to my size BUT I‚Äôve owned it less than 2 weeks worn it daily and it‚Äôs turning my wrist green already. I wish I would have checked the reviews first in the event someone else gave the warning.
5,Love it
2,Bought this 11 days ago and it already broke. Super cute but won‚Äôt last. Bummer
5,This band is so comfortable links were simple to adjust/remove because they are all clasps. I only had to remove one. Already have received so many compliments. Love it!
5,This item is fantastic! I get lots of compliments on it it's very durable and looks cool too. I really like it I wear it everyday. Easy on and off clasp.
2,band broke within the month of wearing it. it was super cute but terrible durability
2,The concept appealed to me but in reality it looks cheap
5,I really love this watch band. It is a nice addition to give a little hip look to your attire.
5,Seriously. It‚Äôs super cute! Love mine!
2,I have several of these bands that I love however I was extremely disappointed with the black.  It looks very cheap and the material is  only stained on 1 side so when it shows you see the cheap tan plactic material underneath.  It is more obvious on the black.
3,Too loose. But! It‚Äôs cute and the adjusters are easy to remove
5,This makes my watch "pop" on my arm with style.
5,I‚Äôve only worn the watch a few times and the coating is coming off of the metal band.
2,Super cute band just bummed it only lasted for a short time.
5,Love the bling!! Perfect!!
5,My watch band broke and it immediately was replaced by a new one they stand by their products.
2,Love the band but within 2 months the black started to peel off and today one on the straps randomly broke. Sad because I really liked it
2,The clasp literally comes undone all the time I cannot even wear it.
5,Super cute watch band love everything about it
2,Cheap metal and fit was awkward and too big
2,Looks great for a little while but like cheap jewelry it turns green after about a month.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This watch band is so pretty! Links are easy to remove for adjustment. I love this watch band! You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
2,This band made it impossible for my Apple Watch to actually sit correctly on my wrist.
5,I love this watch band! It‚Äôs well made and will fit ANYONE! I removed three links to get the band to my comfort level and still have a link to remove if I want. For the price point this watch band is AMAZING! Would definitely recommend.
2,Love the style however the material made my wife break out in a rash. Unfortunately may be returning it. üòï
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This is seriously so cute! I love it
2,Loved it until the links started fading and turned my wrist different colors
5,Very beautiful! Easy to adjust very comfortable and makes a great accessory.
5,It looks so nice on the wrist but was flimsy and broke quickly. I tried to glue it but that was unsuccessful. It was a no return item which I hadn‚Äôt realized.
5,Love this!! Easy to adjust to your wrist size and easy to put on. Very pretty and stylish.
3,You get what you pay for!  Super cute and fit nice but the clasps are very cheaply made
2,Clasp is broken and I don‚Äôt even wear this all the time. It‚Äôs very cute though.
5,Cute bracelet style Apple Watch band. I get SO many compliments! Buy it!
2,Turned wrist green after 3 weeks
2,The clasp is cheep made
5,Product as described!
3,I like the look but the band is a little small when I take out a link and a little big with it in.
5,I love the look and it has links that are easily removed to fit your wrist.
5,The media could not be loaded.

5,I am so glad that the links are easy to remove to make the band fit better. Very pretty and fits great.
5,Customizable size elegant!
2,This is a super cute band but it the watch head doesn't lay flat so it makes it harder to operate.  I will not be wearing it any longer.
5,Love it
2,This is a super cute band but the snap is not secure at all!! My watch popped off my wrist and shattered thankfully I have a case on the screen otherwise  it would‚Äôve completely shattered. I took it off immediately and put the regular silicone band back on. If you are active do not purchase this it does not stay on your wrist. Very disappointed because it is super cute and I was looking forward to wearing it.
5,Love love love!
2,The clasp broke after the first use.
2,This band tarnishes easily.
3,I like the clasp style and the band is boho like I like. However I noticed the band is oxidizing and turning my wrist green.
5,I love this band exactly as advertised.
2,Love the watch; however I was charged twice.  First watch was not in package.  No way to contact seller or Amazon.  Bad business.
2,Very stylish and functional. Makes an Apple Watch look more acceptable in business attire. Gold hardware tarnished almost immediately though
2,I really liked the looks of this but after wearing it five days in a row the part that attaches to the watch snapped off.  Irreparable‚Ä¶. Fortunately I had a back-up watch band packed.
5,I loved it! It‚Äôs my band for everyday use. I love that the claps makes it easy to take off and put on.  Love the multi bracelet look. This is the first one I find that is right up my alley!  If you love to stack bracelets like I do. Then this is the one for you.
2,Cute sparkly band but the metal is cheap and will chip in no time.
5,Looking for fun and stylish and this fits perfectly.  Clasps we‚Äôre a little tricky at first but once I figured it out and applied more pressure to open the clasps it was easy.  I have a smaller wrist and removed 2 links and it fits perfectly!
2,The band was comfortable and I liked the look of it. However it broke in less than one month.
5,I love this band and have gotten so many compliments on it!  I wear my standard bands when working out or doing anything where it might get dirty and then easily switch to this one for the office or going out.
3,detached
2,Cute but not secure- less than 5 days into wearing it. It fell off my wrist and I lost My iWatch. Cute but not secure
5,Es muy c√≥moda para usar y los eslabones se eliminan muy f√°cilmente
5,Great Purchase !  I am going to buy it in every color they make!  Good quality and dresses up the iPhone!
5,So cute and comfortable. Just what I was looking for for a great price!
2,Love the look of this band and received a lot of compliments but in less than a months use one of the leather straps came loose from the metal bracket holding it in place. My husband was able to re-attach but came loose once again so i stopped wearing it. Also color started to fade or come off within that time.
2,Very pretty as in pictures. I have barely had this band a month and it is turning my wrist green. So quality is lacking.
2,Band broke at watch connection on both sides after only 1 month of useSadly right after the return date expiredSo cannot return
2,I thought this band was super cute but it hasn‚Äôt lasted long (maybe a couple of weeks). The fit has been too loose (and the alternative was too tight where I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to fasten it) which causes it to not sync with my phone so I miss phone calls and texts while I‚Äôm running errands. So overall I liked the look of it but it hasn‚Äôt been functional.
2,
2,Overall not my style.
5,This is easy to switch out with other bands easy to adjust the size and pretty easy to take off at night. I get lots of compliments!
5,I get tons of compliments on my watch band. It‚Äôs easy to take on. And off but is sturdy. Looks great when casual or dressy. Love this band
5,for the price it‚Äôs great I like the looks of it on my wrist‚Ä¶. gives it a dressy look yet casual look
5,It‚Äôs awesome! I love it! Looks great on
5,Very cute!
5,
2,After wearing this band for a few weeks it started to turn my skin green where the beads rest on my wrist.  I stopped wearing it.
2,This cute little bracelet looks so nice and fancy. However after 1 week of wear it started leaving black mark on my wrist. NOT worth any $ SMH
5,It looks amazing love the fact I can make it fit my wrist love it !
2,Tarnishes within days.
5,
3,I love the band but it‚Äôs hard to clasp one handed and doesn‚Äôt always stay closed
3,Liked watch band at first but after a while of wearing to work and washing my hands the band gave me a rash.
2,Loved the look and loved it while it lasted. That‚Äôs not long.  Tried to already fix once- but it doesn‚Äôt last.  They put a small overlapped strip with a tiny crimp.  It keeps popping out and won‚Äôt stay attached to watch.
5,Great everyday band. Had to remove all the extra links but it does feel sturdy on my wrist. Love the layered bangle look would highly recommend.
2,I had to reglue the main leather straps and the chain is coming off the other leather strap. Plating on the clasp is wearing off quickly.
5,Love it! I have a small wrist so I had to take the links out but let me tell you‚Ä¶ THIS IS CUUUUUUTE! Definitely worth the purchase!
3,Really loved this. It did not last but 2 weeks before it broke.
5,It's awesome.  It makes my iWatch look great and it's just fun.
5,I love the watch band. It's comfortable and elegant!
5,I love how I can adjust the size!
5,I like it. It‚Äôs tough looking and durable.
2,Super cute. With daily wear only lasted a few weeks. Disappointed
3,This band looks very nice on. That being said you have to be careful when removing/opening the clasps as they snap easily. Thank goodness my wrists are small. I was able to save one.
2,I loved the style of this watch band so much I wanted to ignore all the other reviews that said it broke and was hoping to be one of the lucky ones. I was not :/
2,Very pretty but clasp will not stay and it keeps falling off of my wrist.
2,Absolutely loved this band I wore it every day for a week and it broke right where it connects to the watch.
1,I wear my watch all day except for showers hands in water and charging. I got this about 3 weeks ago and my wrist has turned green and as you can see in the picture the coating I wearing off. I know I didn‚Äôt pay much and shouldn‚Äôt expect gold/silver results but I didn‚Äôt expect the green and quick wearing of the product. All of that aside this band although very very cute also tends to go under the watch part making it hard to register moves and heart rate. Yes it was snug not tight or loose.
2,I have used this band for less than a month and it is already falling apart.  Do not recommend for daily wear.
2,It is very comfy and looks great but it doesn‚Äôt last. I have had this for one month and the bands are already coming off
5,Easy to put on.Doesn‚Äôt vibrate when watch goes off.Great look!
5,It's really professional but stylish. I also like how it's sizable.
2,I‚Äôm on the last link and it‚Äôs still to big
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I love it! Comfortable and lovely ü•∞
5,Stylish and comfortable.  This band is very light weight.
2,This is a beautiful watch band but it broke after only 2 months of occasional use. The small bar that attaches the band to the watch came apart and is unrepairable.
2,Was excited because I have small wrists and the fact that I could adjust it easily was a selling point. It was prettier than I thought. Unfortunately it broke in under 24 hours arrived May 3rd and broke May 4th. Highly disappointed
2,Doesnt stay in place but very cute
5,love everything about this. easy to adjust the strap length. looks amazing for the price point.
1,I love the overall look.  Fits just fine.BUT:The clasps are not secure.  I have found my watch has come off my wrist and I did not even feel it come off.  Thankfully I did find it.  Now I am afraid to wear my watch.  I have to buy another band.The metal part is already tarnishing.Not satisfied at all.
1,One side of this band would not even slide into my watch. When I looked closer I realized there were small springs sticking out of the center of it. By depressing the springs I could get it to slide in. Within less than a minute of wearing it 2 of the main straps pulled out & there was no longer anything holding the watch against my wrist. I have very small wrists and the watch was by no means tight. I don‚Äôt know how this band has any good reviews because it is literally garbage.
2,Band has already broken and I just received it less than a month ago.
2,Very pretty newest Apple Watch version doesn‚Äôt work well with this band. Functions randomly occur random calls made because watch doesn‚Äôt go into sleep mode
3,Just too flashy for me!
1,Cute and comfortable for short term use but fell asleep with it on and it turned my wrist greenI ordered this item along with two other items. Got an alert when the ‚Äúitems‚Äù were received yet THIS was not in the package. I filed a complaint and a replacement was sent promptly. it‚Äôs 8/22 this purchase was in JUNE and NOW they‚Äôre sending me emails saying if I don‚Äôt send the original band to send back to them I will be charged. I NEVER RECEIVED IT HOW CAN I RETURN IT?
5,It‚Äôs really cute good quality fits nice and comfortable.
5,Comfortable and looks exactly like the pic!
5,Love this wrist band. I get sooo many compliments on a daily basis! Definitely recommend.
1,I loved the watch band‚Äôs fit & style but it fell apart within 2 weeks. Clasp stopped holding and band came undone.  My watch fell off and I was fortunate someone saw and gave it back to me.
5,Turns my wrist green
1,Not even a month with the product and gold parts are fadding out. I tried to make it smaller to have a perfect fit but wrist bans pops up making look ugly  since I had to add back 1 extra extender to look good now it fits to loose.
5,I love it. Want to get other colors!
5,I love it it‚Äôs cool
1,It broke and I never got to wear it. I started the returning process- but it wouldn‚Äôt let me select wholefoods as a location. I had to go to UPS. Got busy and it‚Äôs been over 30 days and I never returned it. Oh well.
1,The part that connects to the apple watch is thin flat leather and it was pulled away from the clasp when received. it wasnt attached at one end. return in process
1,The watch part is way too loose while the extra bracelets on either side are too snug. I had to go down to the smallest size and the watch doesn‚Äôt not fit on my wrist where it doesn‚Äôt move but the bracelets are a little too tight. I have never worn it because of this.
2,It‚Äôs so beautiful and cute and comfortable the only issue is I‚Äôve had two now and the same strap broke the exact same way on both.
1,Doesn‚Äôt waste your money. I‚Äôve had this for less than a month and it is already falling apart and discolored. Wish I would‚Äôve known how poorly put together it is.
1,I guess it‚Äôs cute but that‚Äôs it very disappointed. I have small a wrist and the straps kept going under the watch face. It was hard getting it on and I needed to remove if I was cooking or cleaning. Waste of money
1,I gave one star because of the colors. But this broke after second wear- the screw came out and it was so small I could not find it but then again I could have lost it anywhere.Amazon return window just closed by 2 days -Go figure
3,It was very pretty the only thing was the band broke within a week. M
1,Purchased on July 25 and gave as a gift. The recipient a good friend asked if it could be exchanged since the clasp broke. Today marks 35 days from purchase and less than 3 weeks from giving as a gift. There is no option to exchange the product.
2,I LOVED this watch band.  But it came apart (broke) within just a couple of weeks of having it.
1,I wore this for two months and the clasp no longer fastens. Of course it‚Äôs not one that was added it‚Äôs the one attached to the band.
2,Very pretty but fell apart after 2 weeks
2,The bracelet is cute but definitely not for longevity wear. Also the straps are long. I don‚Äôt have the smallest wrists right now but I could literally wear it more comfortably if I took off all the links‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Would not recommend.
1,The metal snaps do not stay together. I‚Äôve worn this twice and it falls off my wrist because the latches are very weak. One of the bracelets attached to it came off as well. Poor quality. Would not spend money on this.
2,I really wanted to love this item however within 10 days one of the straps broke AND the clasp started turning my wrist green. Bummer
1,This watch band was really pretty until it broke after 35 days. Since the return window has closed I had to break out the needle nose pliers to open the little clasps on the leather bands in the center and feed them back through and then pinch them closed. Shouldn‚Äôt have to do this with a watch band after a month of owning it. Poor quality. I do not recommend.
2,The chain broke on the band after the second week.
5,me encanto
2,It‚Äôs comfortable and cute but I don‚Äôt appreciate it turning my wrist green.
1,Received one and the clasps wouldn't stay shot so I returned it for a replacement and they won't stay shut on this one either do not buy!
1,It was cute but only wore it for a couple weeks before it turned my wrist green. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,The clasp that‚Äôs supposed to hold the watch to the band fell apart. I wore it only a few times. Super cute but mine didn‚Äôt hold up at all.
2,its just the band  its nice  now i still got to buy a watch  i thought it came with it way to big
1,This is really cute band but it started to fall apart in less than a week. The straps that attached to the watch started coming apart. I was scared I would look down and my watch would be missing. It‚Äôs a no for me.
1,I also didn‚Äôt like that it came with all the same size links.  Half size links should be included it was either too tight or too lose
1,I really liked the look of this band but after 1 month (I received the band on June 21 2022) of on and off wear it is already falling apart. The straps are starting to come apart and the rose gold is scratched and coming off. Extremely disappointed in this item.
2,Super cute watch band but I‚Äôve had it less than 2 months and the strap broke. This is the 2nd one. I don‚Äôt workout in it or take it in the water.
1,It felt and looked very flimsy when I got it out of the package and I could only get one band on my Apple Watch because the slide piece was warped.
1,Purchased  a month ago the clasp came undone with switching it out frequently.  It‚Äôs super cute I got lots of compliments on it but it‚Äôs not durable.
2,This is super cute and comfortable but I‚Äôve only worn it for about 2 weeks and it has broken already. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed because I love it so much
2,One of the leather straps broke off after only a month of use
1,The clasps on this wear out within 3rd use causing your very nice and expensive Apple Watch to go soaring off your wrist at any moment. This broke my watch.
1,Arrived and I was excited to switch out my silicone band for this leather one but the clasps don't lock I first tried it with all of the links in tact to gauge how many links I would need to remove and it wouldn't clasp so I removed 2 links and then tried to clasp it again with no luck. You may think it has clasped but you move your arm and your watch is coming off. The band is really pretty but returning it for a refund doesn't do any good if I can't wear it.
1,I wanted it to fit more like a bracelet (kinda loose) but it was more form fitting on me didn‚Äôt really like that but I‚Äôm going to see if it fits anyone else better because overall it was still cute
1,Loved the look of it! However it broke after wearing it only three times.
1,Broke the first time I wore it. Strange fit adjustable but was either too loose or too tight. Sad that I missed the return window I purchased to wear with a specific outfit.
1,I bought two; one for me and one for friend.  The first few days they were fabulous.  Then the rope started to fray and get dirty looking.  Then the other bracelet rings discolored in a matter of weeks.  This happened to both of them.  Returned them.
1,This band has fallen off my arm several times. Easy to remove is an understatement it will definitelyfall off of your wrist.
1,This isn‚Äôt anything like the picture. I wanted to return it but forgot about time.
1,I really like the band. But less than a month and it‚Äôs broken.
1,The clasp that holds your watch on your wrist doesn‚Äôt last long I wore it for 10 days and it won‚Äôt shut so I can‚Äôt wear my watch until I buy a new band
1,It looked fantastic on but after two weeks the leather straps broke and that‚Äôs the part that holds the watch in.
1,The watch band was extremely difficult to open/close and 1 section of the band broke after wearing 3 times.
1,Product came fast and is super cute. I wore for about a week daily took off to shower and sleep. Within the week it turned my wrist green!! Not something I expected. Very disappointing.
1,I absolutely love the look of this band. That being said I now require a new watch. The links do not hold securely and my watch fell right off my wrist facedown on cement and cracked. My under $20 watch band is now costing me close to $500 as I need a new watch. So disappointing.
2,It broke in less than a month
1,owned it for a week it keeps unlatching during the day (everyday). the braided letter strap has come unbraided already.  not a good purchase. I had to order another band from another maker.
1,Beautiful but broke right away. Two straps just fell off so my watch was hanging by the other side.
1,After a week it‚Äôs already turning colors. Also the links to take out are too much so it‚Äôs rather to tight or too big
2,Loved it until I went to wear it and it was broken and the return window closed last week!  Really bummed.
1,I was excited because it really is a super cute watchband/ bracelet. But unfortunately it broke the second time I used it.
1,I was really excited to have something different than just the pink straps for my watch but my straps the secured the watch face broke less than a week of me having the item. 1st the right side which I chose to ignore I thought maybe to hot glue it and then the second! just realized it was a piece of crap $15 down the drain I really want my money back because it wasn‚Äôt even a 30 day timeframe of me having the item
1,Broke after 2 months and couldn't return it. Bummed out because it is cute but not long lasting.
1,Will be returning the product as it will not stay on my wrist because the clasps are so cheap. I should have known with the low price. Spend a little more and get something that will actually work!
1,Item broke where it connects to the watch less than a month after I wore it. Part of it broke off and I couldn't find it so I was not able to fix.
1,I wanted to love this but it‚Äôs cheaply made and not worth the money.
1,Really liked the pictures of this band. But unfortunately the first one I received the bands snapped right away. I got a second one replaced and it won‚Äôt secure the watch in the band. Just keeps slipping right through the lock.  Would not recommend this unfortunately.
1,This band fell apart less than 3 months after I purchased it and I didn‚Äôt wear it daily.
2,Started to wear off color n chip within three times of wearing it
1,Finish started rubbing off less than a week after purchase and was not able to clasp it tight enough to prevent my watch from losing contact with skin and locking up. Really wanted this to work bc it looked so cute but sadly just didn‚Äôt work.
1,I only had this on for an hour and it broke.
1,Update: The seller saw my original post and reached out asking whether I wanted a refund or a new watch band. I asked for a refund and they immediately processed it. Their attention was quick and their customer service was awesome.This item was cute and not too cheap so I thought it‚Äôd at least wear for a few months. But I noticed today that after less than a week of wear the straps are coming apart from the buckle. I‚Äôm bummed because it‚Äôs cute but clearly not worth buying.
1,Very cute but cheaply made purchased in late July didn‚Äôt last a month.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Did not like how it broke after wearing for one day. The link/clasp are hard to open and close. Love the idea. Supper cute
1,It was lovely and wonderful. I got so many compliments. Then day 6 the finish was gone and my wrist was green
1,This band lasted about a week after that it was faded/tarnished looking and after it got wet it turned my wrist green. The clasp color came off after day two. Its now in the trash.
1,I ended up sending this back. It is cheaply made and doesn‚Äôt look as nice as the picture. I sent it back before doing this review. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,A couple of the straps keep coming out of the clips and the rose gold is tarnishedOther than that it‚Äôs very pretty
1,my wife purchased this strap.  the metal pieces broke in less than 48 hours.  it unraveled from there.  very poorly made.
1,Broke only after a few weeks.
1,Broke after 1 month. It was 3 days past return policy so stuck with a broken useless band
1,Beautiful but poor quality broke the first time it was used.
2,The media could not be loaded.
1,Loved how it looked and the comfort of it. Wore it for a few weeks then links randomly fell off.
1,Too lose not attractive didn‚Äôt lay flat
2,After 20 days using it the bracelet brake and wasn‚Äôt able to fix it. Don‚Äôt waist your money
1,I was so excited about this band! It suited my style and personality so well. I wore it two days before a band broke. I am so sad :( I really had high hopes for it. It came on time and looked amazing easy to assemble. It just isn‚Äôt strong enough to withstand being worn.
1,Started to come apart after a few weeks of use. Waste of money.
1,Product looks cheap. Not like what was pictured. Very disappointed. Would not buy again.
1,This bracket broken after wearing it for a few days
1,Had the band now 1 month today and it just broke and now I‚Äôm past the return window so that sucks definitely do not recommend breaks easily
1,Falls apart easy
1,It is very pretty and comfortable but the durability of item was heartbreaking. It broke within 3 days after wearing it.
1,Love the look but it‚Äôs super cheap and does not hold up well.
1,As you can see from the photo the left hand band on the bottom was broken immediately upon opening. Can only imagine how it would hold up after use.
1,I loved this at first but after just a week and a half of wearing it it broke at the base near the watch and I couldn‚Äôt get it back together.
1,Ive only used this band 3 times. I was out one night and the clasp somehow unlatched itself and the watch fell off without me noticing. My watch is now missing. A $16 dollar band is now costing me $250 for another watch
1,product came damaged
1,Broke.  Too late to return
2,The band is too big and twist around all day.
1,Durability dislike
1,Received item and looks very cheap.
1,I loved it but only lasted about 6 weeks before it broke. Of course after the return window closed. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,Watch band was delivered on April 8 2022. Unfortunately it has already started falling apart. Enough to wear it is no longer wearable. So less than 6 weeks of use. Super cute but not durable.
1,Came apart the first week I bought it cheaply made and looking in person. Don‚Äôt buy quality is nonexistent.
1,The media could not be loaded.
1,It was pretty but the metal bands that hold the blk leather all slipped off
1,Very flimsy. Broke when I went to put it on.
1,This watch band is super cute but one of the straps came apart after 2 weeks.
1,Literally had it less than 30 minutes the leather bands are already popping out of the metal settings shipping took a while even though it was a prime item. It wasn‚Äôt the cheapest one on Amazon so really expected it to hold up longer than 30 minutes. It‚Äôs not too tight either I can comfortably fit a finger in between the band and my skin.
1,This was so cute at first but tarnished very easy and early on and parts of the band already wrapping apart
1,Doesn‚Äôt sit nicely no matter what I did to look like the picture I couldn‚Äôt get it too fit that way
1,It‚Äôs easy to resize by removing the links. After a few weeks it became out of shoe and loose. Straps started to pop. Not durable
1,I loved this watch band and it was very easy to fit it to my wrist. However on the third day wearing it the floral piece of the band where it attaches to my watch started pealing and now looks very cheap. I am so sad and do not recommend this band.
1,I have worn this 2 times and has already broke in a spot that I am not able to wear it.  I will be returning the tan one I bought.
1,Clasp won‚Äôt stay closed. Have to fix it with pliers if I can. Almost lost watch second day I had this on. No return option available so‚Ä¶
1,Straps broke after wearing it a total of 6 times
1,Very cheap quality falls off easily and looks cheap
1,I used it for a week and the pieces that attach the band to the watch keep breaking. It was really pretty and comfortable when I could use it
1,I would not recommend this band. Tarnished after only a couple weeks and now turns my wrist green when I wear it. Missed my return window so can‚Äôt return now.
2,Even when adjusted to smallest size this band is too large for small wrists.
1,Clasp broke right after return period ended. $17 in the trash
1,The size was way off it was NOT adjustable and it was far to big to wear.
1,Loved the look of this band but it broke just a month after having it. Very disappointed. The last band I had lasted 2 + years. Not this one. Not even close. Waste of money.
1,This band broke within 3 weeks of wearing it not very durable and started to come apart within a week of receiving the band
1,It was cute but did not hold up well. The little brackets where they slip into watch came loose within 3 days
1,It‚Äôs not very durable. I work a desk job and it broke after only a few wears.
1,The rod connecting to the watch broke and the entire watch slid off her wrist. Could have been extremely expensive. This happened on the 5th day of wearing the band and 12 days past the return window of course.
1,I wore it for like two weeks and the metal color changed! So sad it looks so cool but not durable at all.
1,I‚Äôve Woren watch band less than 2 weeks. Watch band is unraveling.
1,I loved this band and was ready to buy additional colors but today it broke. It didn‚Äôt catch on anything it just fell apart during a doctor‚Äôs appointment.  I have only had it for 2 weeks and only wear cute ones when I go out so it wasn‚Äôt even 2 weeks of consistent wear.  Very disappointing
1,The band get stuck and the watch does not move freely
1,Arrived March 24th and the leather bands came unhinged from the metal clasps it‚Äôs only April 11th and didn‚Äôt even get a full month out of it.
1,Wouldn‚Äôt stay buckled and would fall off
1,Cheaply made and didn't fit properly.
1,The clasp broke in less than 2 weeks did not last in durability or color.
1,The band clasp would not stay closed. I finally had to take my watch off. Please think twice before you purchase this watch band!!!
1,The first watch band I got broke after a week and the second ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù band broke after three days. Very disappointing.
1,The latch horrible and broke so easily didn't even enjoy it
1,Don‚Äôt waste your money

1,Horrible
1,The band looked nice but not good quality the band‚Äôs pieces kept popping and breaking ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1,Rubbed off the day after I bought it.
1,Looks so cheap and was faded
1,Super cute fits great...but it broke quickly
1,Absolutely loved the look of this watch band but it was made very cheaply and fell apart after wearing for barely a week.
1,Just after 2 weeks one end of the band broke.
1,The part that connected the band to the watch broke the first day I wore it. Not fixable and Very disappointed :/
1,Poor quality
1,This bracelet won‚Äôt last more than a couple wears. The leather bands start coming apart
1,broke less than 1 week wasted money
1,I loved this band but only got to wear for appx 2 weeks before it broke.  The piece that attaches into the watch is what broke.
3,Very cute and received many compliments. The only problem is the clasps will not stay closed so the watch constantly falls off my wrist. I can just be walking and a clasp will open and the watch will fall to the floor. This would be the perfect band if the clasps were functional.
1,Cheap quality. Fell apart.
1,Terrible band! Don‚Äôt fit comfortably.
1,The clicks to hold the watch were put on upside down so the watch will not click in.
1,Cheap looking. I sent back
1,So cute!!! But it broke after 2 days. Totally disappointed
1,Broke with in a week of having it.
2,Pretty but the straps broke a week after use.
3,After wearing for a week the band broke üòû
1,I don‚Äôt like it üëéüëéüëéüëé you have to do to much.
2,I love the style of band!  It‚Äôs so cute but It broke the first week after wearing it for a mere few hours (casual dining only). **The company replaced it immediately**  I have the replacement and the bracket separated from the leather again and the braided leather rope band frayed. I tried to clamp it and the leather snapped in half. SMH. I love this and am so sad at the same time ha ha I want the band to be durable to last!
5,Love this item very fashionable!!
5,Very durable adjustable and looks very stylish.  Great quality.
5,It was a gift super cute
5,This thing looks great you'd never guess it's this inexpensive or at least I wouldn't. Other said it's not durable so I'll have to see how that goes but it certainly seems you'd want to swap it out for a different band if you were doing anything active. But for general day to day use it's held up well enough after 3 weeks.
5,It broke right after owning it for 30 days. It was cute! But cheaply made.
5,Love this watchband. Adds a cute boho feel to my outfits.  Great price and easy to adjust for sizing.
4,I loved it. Just wished the links were smaller. 3 links were too Big and 2 links were too Snug.
5,I love this watch band and it is exactly what I wanted.
5,First of all if you‚Äôve never worn a regular watch with links like me you might find removing them tricky. We‚Äôll it‚Äôs actually very easy yet once clasped it holds tightly to your Apple Watch. Even though I bought the smaller size my wrist is very tiny so I had to go down to the last link. It‚Äôs still a little loose but it doesn‚Äôt spin all the way around so ai like how it fits. Once I adjusted the size correctly it was a very pretty bracelet style Watch band.
5,Really like the look of this band.  Bracelets and band all in one.
5,Love the dressy casual vibe of the band. Looks great with jeans.
4,I like the band and the way it looks but it leaves my arm a bit sweaty under the metal part of the band.
5,This is very cute but definitely hard to put on and take off. Big with extra link and tight without
5,Best band I have bought. Would purchase again. It gets wet and I have no issues. I wear it daily.
5,It‚Äôs my favorite watch band! Very durable but the metal clasps do wear pretty easy. Clasps can be taken off to fit wrist. I am getting another in a different color!!!
5,This is much nicer in person. It is big I hope when I remove the links it fits.
1,Came all broken
4,It‚Äôs very cute and I love to wear it when I‚Äôm going out. I do wish the bracket was tighter because the pieces so come up and over my watch and since it‚Äôs metal I get scared that it will eventually scratch my watch.
5,I love this band I get so many compliments on it when I wear it out. I wanted something a little nicer than the silicone bands I had this is perfect.
1,It‚Äôs a cute band but it fell apart in a matter of a few days. Not worth the money to me.
5,Looks so cute on. I get lots of compliments
5,Lots of compliments!
5,I think the Apple Watch is big and clunky but I wear it for the features. This does dress it up a bit but it still looks clunky. Putting on a light watch face helps
5,I absolutely love this band. I love that leather and gemstone look. It‚Äôs feminine and has that bit of glam that makes me want to wear my Apple Watch every day
5,These bands for my Apple Watch were so perfect and cute! They have extra links so you can make it smaller or bigger as needed!
5,I needed a nice watch band to wear for a friends wedding and this was so perfect. For the price the quality is pretty good I got so many compliments. I love the layered bracelet look. It‚Äôs super comfortable to wear. It comes with multiple links for different size options. Doesn‚Äôt move around on my wrist. Definitely worth the price. I will be buying more!!
5,Fits perfectly.
1,I absolutely loved the look and style but i almost lost my apple watch because this band kept opening and falling off.
5,I saw it and got it for my wife.  She loves wearing bracelets similar to what's shown in the picture of the wristband.  Goes perfectly with that aesthetic.  Get it if you like it.  It's durable and lasts.
5,I love this watch band. It fits my jewelry style and I get so many compliments when I wear it. It's the number one choice from my band collection for dressing up any outfit!Note: I was able to easily remove links to make the band fit my arm.
5,I love this bracelet watch band. It allows me to look cute and still have the functionality of my watch. I removed several links so it fit properly. I've even worn it swimming and it still looks like new.
5,I love these bands. Add a little style and boho hippie look I was wanting.  Wish they had a few more colors.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Love the product! It is adorable and easy to remove links!  Super cute. You can dress up or dress down.
5,Such a cute band to replace the ugly Apple Watch band. This looks like a bracket. It makes your Apple Watch actually cute.
5,I love this watch band. I have it in more than one color. I love that you can add and remove links to adjust the size. It matches most of my clothing and is very casual and also dressy at the same time.
5,Super cute and durable. Took some getting use to putting it on and off with the type of clasp but now it‚Äôs easy peasy
5,I love this watch band. I wanted something to use most days that is easy to put on/take off with a little bit of bling. This band is perfect for that.
2,The band is not durable and broke of 3 weeks of limited use.
5,It looks amazing. However I feel the quality is compromised
5,I love this band its beautiful
5,"Love this!!! The band is super easy to adjust and it looks awesome!! It was 2 days late. But i guess that's ok because Amazon always seems to like about the delivery times anymore. And Amazon can do whatever they want and we just have to deal with it I guess
5,Super cute ü•∞
5,I love this watch band it‚Äôs so cute and comfy and it‚Äôs easy to take on and off. I get so many compliments.
4,Cute band. I have a small wrist so I had to remove all the extra links but it does fit perfectly. Hoping this band does last awhile!
5,Love the product
5,So they sent the wrong band. I ended up loving the wrong one they sent and re ordered the original one (hoping they will send the right one this time). It is so cute and really looks great with the watch.
5,I bought a couple of different bands so I could switch them out and I just love this one!!!  So pretty easy to put on and very comfortable.
5,This Boho style band is adorable comfortable and stylish. It's very easy to perfectly size with the removable links no tools needed (just strong fingernails). I am thinking of getting another color band... or 2  ;-)
5,Love everything the pink colors with off set of bead‚Äôs matching the clasp.I‚Äôve received a lot of complacent on the bracket type band
5,Very comfortable and chic
5,Nothing it‚Äôs very beautiful
5,Gold parts start to rub off
5,I love the look of this watch band and it‚Äôs very comfortable. It adjusts easily. I have a small wrist so removed all of the links to have the right fit.
5,Exactly as ordered
5,I love the style. At frist I didn‚Äôt know what to think about it but now I wore it lovvv ittt.
1,I was so excited for this band really cute Wore it one day no problem the next day it just fell apart didn‚Äôt get it wet didn‚Äôt pull on it.  Extremely cheap junk product don‚Äôt waste your lonely.
5,I love this band! Super cute!
5,I thought this might not hold up but my wife has worn it for a while now and it‚Äôs in great shape. She gets a lot of compliments on its unique style.
5,I bought this band to wear when I want something a little more exciting than my everyday band and this one over exceeded my expectations!  It adds so much I am so glad I bought it.  There are several links you can easily add or remove depending on the size of your wrist they just link and clasp together.  Adding the band to the watch was super easy but it took me a few tries to lock the claps in place but that is to be expected when you are only using one hand.  I recommend this funky and fun band!
5,This watch band is well made & so cute. It goes with basically everything. The brown is such a deep brown (almost a coffee color) so it tends to match whatever I am wearing whether it be browns or black tones. The clasps securely snap closed and I have had no issues putting it on or taking it off. It‚Äôs a great buy.
5,Absolutely beautiful band. It come with several links that you can take out to fit your wrist. Very comfortable
4,I ordered this band because I like bracelets but they always interfere with my watch. I love this watch band because it is bracelets with my watch. The band was easy to adjust (just pop a link open to take off) and no problem putting it on and off on my own. Only thing is I feel that the 2 bracelets towards my hand (the blingy and braided ones) are a little too big for the front of the band. It could be that I had to take out 2 links to make the band fit on my wrist so maybe it is smaller than it should be? Not a big deal though! They still lay in front of the watch but aren‚Äôt bugging my hand.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†this is seriously so adorable and i‚Äôm so pleasantly surprised by how much i love it! the clasps were easy to remove and it‚Äôs a lot more sturdy then i thought it would be! definitely purchase if you‚Äôre thinking about it!
5,I really like this band. Fits my Apple Watch perfect. It was very Easy to removed link. I wear it every day and still looks great. I had many compliments and I will buy another one for a gift.
5,I get compliments daily on this watch band. It‚Äôs easy to adjust to fit perfectly. It‚Äôs super cute and goes with any outfit.. love it
5,Easily adjustable watch strap. Love it.
1,Turned wrist green and one strap broke! Had it about 2 months
5,Mine hasn‚Äôt broke at all and I‚Äôm a bus driver who obviously uses my arms a lot and refuel the bus. It has links you can take out without tools just unclip a link if too big. I‚Äôve now bought 2 of these straps in different colours.
5,As described and easy to install
4,Very nice and looks great on...
3,This band is very pretty but after two weeks of wearing it daily (not getting it wet) it made my wrist green from the clasp.
3,This band looks great but it‚Äôs not something that can be worn every day. If you keep it for special occasions you will be fine. But mine is starting to show wear after a few weeks of daily use for work.
