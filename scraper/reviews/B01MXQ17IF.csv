4,Born in the 90s don’t 100% remember how to open the adapter plus i think mine had a slight defect because i had to carefully fiddle with it to open it because the mechanisms that is supposed to easily open it malfunctioned. I recommend patience and optimism because things didn’t work the first try but did function properly eventually. You need to be super careful because one tiny broken piece will ruin your investment. One vhc tape got caught inside my vhs player. Was carefully recovered and the damaged was repaired but i don’t blame the adapter it’s the technology in general. Handle delicately best price i found and it comes brand new in original packaging in a timely manner
5,I love being able to watch all my home movies now. could not find my original adaptor.  This one works great . you need to have a battery in it to open the door.
4,Works pretty well. It is kind of heavy but it works.
5,The product is excellent service was very quick and no problems whatsoever.
5,I have a bunch of old VHSC tapes from when my kids were small I am transferring them to DVD and this worked great to play them.
4,This must be an old product because it keeps freezing when placing and removing mini cassettes. It's scary because sometimes it seems as if it might break the film and precious and unrecoverable old memories are on the tapes. When the cassette is finally in place it works well but wish they just made new one of these. It's obviously new but it's been packaged since the technology was invented
5,I love this vhs because i can see my mini videos of my kids when they were little but i wish the people who work for this company pay more attention to what they are doing because i had to go look for my package on another address instead of mine and this is not the first time it has happened to meI don’t know what the distraction is but they should focus on everything they are doing because whatever they’re delivering can be more important than this vhs and then end up in another hands…..just my opinion!
5,It worked perfect for our old home videos thankful to have it!
5,EXCELLENT item price & service. THANK YOU @ Video Camera Center & Amazon. I wasn't sure these were still available & GLAD I found a replacement for my broken adapter.
5,Works great
4,Works as expected
5,Súper
5,Good product. Easy to use
5,What a gift for my family. I had several small children that I would video lots of times. I no longer have the camera but I have the tapes. This little adapter I now have allowed  me to see my children playing. They now have adult children. I thank you so much for quickly getting this to me. My parents are no longer alive and I am a grandfather. We all shed a thousand tears together after 32 years! Thank you so much!  KMLewis
5,I purchased this because I lost the other adapter I had used for my VHS tapes lost it in a move to a new apt.  This one arrived quickly in good shape not damaged or anything.  Works fine.  Have used it for numerous VHS tapes since receiving it.  It requires one AA battery (not included).  Keep in mind with these adapters that if the AA battery you insert is not brand new then the adapter might act or sound slow it works based on how good the battery is so if you notice it acting this way it more than likely is the battery running out of juice.  I placed an older AA battery in it which I had lying around & it's a bit slow so I need to buy a new package of AA batteries this is common with ALL VHS adapters.  Aside from that it was slightly overpriced but I needed it badly as I'm converting all of my VHS to digital.  When I first bought my small JVC camera in the late 80s it came with one of these adapters they cna last a very long time if taken care of properly.  The door for the tape is fragile but yrs ago I was able to still use it even if the small door was broken off.  So far satisfied with this purchase.
5,When it was delivered I inserted battery and put it to work right away without problems
5,Works great and it will save a lot of money recording your own tapes instead of paying someone else. My only gripe was there were no instructions with my product. I figured out that you must put in an "AA" battery to do anything with this case. The instructions are on the product description however so read those before you force anything. The case is plastic but it feels solid. I've recorded 15 tapes so far with no issues and no sign of wear to the unit.
5,This casset does not come with any instructions which makes it a little confusing to figure out at first. You will need one AA battery that will be placed on the left side of the casset. After placing the battery in there is a “button” that you slide to “unlock” the casset and it opens by itself. You place the tape inside and close it and it “locks”. Then toy place in the recorder as usual. Hopes this helps anyone in anyway. I enjoy mine & I have no issues with mine so far!
5,Product was a good value
5,Although there weren't any instructions with it it was pretty easy to use.
1,I'm betting this has been flooded with fake reviews: five stars and cartoonishly bad English.I had something like this years ago but got rid of it thinking I was done transferring VHS-C tapes to digital. Well I was wrong. Now I find myself paying top dollar for hot garbage. Scan through the reviews a little to see how many people are pointing out that these things come with no directions of any kind. You might think you don't need them because this is just a simple adapter . . . .I've loaded a AA battery easily enough. However there is no indication as to how the adapter opens. I looked at photographs to determine where it was hinged and got my fingers inside to push open the side opposite those hinges.There is a slider labeled "ON." Slide and hold this to allow a very weak motor to open the door. If the battery is not new the door will not open. Insert a VHS-C cassette push the door back down and the very weak motor will lock the door and spool the VHS-C tape out for play in a regular VHS machine.Problem is there are no printed directions telling how to use the product and its use is neither obvious nor intuitive. It would have been a simple matter to print direction on the package but someone decided against it. As a result it will be common to assume the adapter does not work especially if someone has the misfortune of loading a bad AA battery. I have to laugh at the number of returns due to a simple lack of printed directions.There are other issues aside from a lack of printed directions. The adapter simply is not very reliable. At first my VHS machine would neither rewind nor fast forward the tape. Instead it would simply eject the tape back out over and over before something finally decided to start working and I was finally able to play the VHS-C tape without issue. And eventually both the fast forward and rewind functions began to work. Maybe some part needed to be broken in before working?Back in the 1990's these types of adapters were ubiquitous and reliable. Now in the 2020's we are stuck with under-engineered technology for a shrinking niche market. I do not trust the high reviews for this product and suggest looking for something by another manufacturer. Then again this is a niche market and perhaps there aren't a lot of options to choose from.
5,Very happy with my purchase. Brand new item. Works perfectly with my 8MM tapes.
5,That it works great!
4,Make sure you put a AA battery in before you try to open the access panel or it won’t work! There are no instructions. I had to read another reviewer’s instructions on how to use it. Not too happy about that but other than that it works great! No issues
5,Reviewing old VHSC tapes
3,It is of value to use this adapter as a last resort for converting VHS-C tapes to play on a VCR. It would be better to use a VHS-C camcorder with a line output.
5,Easy to use
4,I had one please before I am so glad to have this now… all my old home movies are being turned digital now… yes!!!
4,It brought back so many memories!! Great to see the TAPES OF so long gone. You need a vcr.
5,As described
5,My family had a videocamera with VHS-C cassettes like half country.Our camera disappeared and we were left with +50 useless tapes. We had this adapter too so I looked for it thinking I wasn't gonna find it. Thank Amazon and the seller we are able to watch them after more than 10 years!
4,Very easy to use
5,video cassette holder works great and was received in a timely manner.Thanks
5,Worked great
5,Works great in the VCR to transfer content from smalller tapes to my computer
5,I’ve never seen one of these that requires a battery but it was a small inconvenience considering it allowed me to access precious memories of loved ones long gone on old family home movies
5,Easy to use.
2,Worked great for 20 tapes then it broke I am processing  my home videos to digital so to say the least for what I paid it was not a good buy. would not recommend.
4,It works
3,Product broke after 40 cassettes. Was copying home videos to digital. Done at separate times.Very disappointed.
2,I purchased this because I've used it before and it would work. However I knew how to use it. That was not the problem. The second VHS-C tape I put in it tangled it up and I had to carefully wind it back into the case. I would not purchase this because if you don't know how to wind the tape and put it back inside the small VHS-C case you're screwed. It tangled it twice. TWICE. I had to gently take the tape out of the VHS then out of the adapter. You could seriously ruin your tape. I would look for another adapter if I were you. My VHS plays regular tapes well and has no issues. However this adapter screwed things up. I could go and splice the tape but unfortunately I do not know how to open a VHS-C case and it has to be handled VERY VERY carefully.
5,working fine
1,Note:  Insert the battery first then insert your VHS-C tape.I was able to view my first VHS-C tape the first day.  The second day I inserted my second tape.  The adaptor started to load the tape then stopped midway.  It's stuck inside the adaptor.I ordered a replacement adaptor and asked for instructions for how to get my VHS-C cassette out of the adaptor without destroying their unit before returning it.  I received their postage paid Mailing Label by e-mail within 15 minutes but no response yet on how to get my cassette out.This is a plastic cassette adaptor with plastic and metal moving parts to stretch the tape back and forth from its resting position to the VHS playing position.  I don't expect it to have a very long lifetime.  Be ready to transfer your memories quickly.
5,playing old videos from camera on VHS player.
3,Not by Panasonic.
2,It broke after I used it twice.
5,It works well. I did 21 tapes with this and it is still working so I will be able to do dome for other family members.
5,I bought a different brand of this same product and it broke on my second one. I am now 10 in and it is working perfectly!Definitely worth the money!I am using it to play old cassettes through my VCR player in order to digitalize them. Working perfectly!
5,Great item for converting old movies over to VHS format.
5,I was concerned about jams and eating my tapes but I was able to play and use this adapter to help digitize over 35 vhsc tapes with no problem at all. I did not use to rewind or fast forward as a precaution. So glad I bought this!!
5,I'm  so glad I got this I have so many old family tapes on VHC I couldn't watch. It didn't cost very much don't know why I haven't gotten it sooner. It's so easy to use too!
5,It's perfect and I'm so happy to be able to watch my recordings of years past.
5,Haven’t used a converter cassette for yearsWe watched our old movies over Christmas it worked perfect
3,My fault it didn’t work for what I needed. I obviously didn’t read the description carefully. It arrived promptly.
5,Transfer videos
5,This product worked perfectly! We pulled out the old home movies and watched with the family at Christmas.
5,Great
5,Please note that the adapter is specifically made for Panasonic VCR. It works perfect with my Panasonic VCR and performs all functions flawlessly i:e playrewindFF stop eject.Don't know how it will work with other brands VCR.I am going to get 1 more as a backup and put it away.
5,Worked as it should had no issues.
5,I had one before and this one works just as well.
5,Works well
1,This seemed fine during running my first cassette. When I attempted to remove it fromThe vcr the second time the cassette tape got stuck somehow and I had to force it out of the vcr. Then it would not release the cassette without breaking the whole thing to get the cassette out without damage to the tape. I do not consider it a successful purchase/use.
1,I purchase this a couple months ago and only got to use it last week and when I used it it broke. I bought this to transfer my video tapes to dvd of my husband who has passed and my children when they were little.
1,Only too late I found out this product is crap and it doesn't work. Too late to return it. It accepts a AA battery and there is an "open" switch but the thing won't open to insert the smaller cartridge!
5,Ease of use is what I like best!
5,Wonderful! The device exceeded my expectations
1,The first VHS-C tape I played in this adaptor worked fine but did not rewind completely. When I ejected the tape from the VCR there was film hanging out of the cassette. I salvaged the cassette and tried another one. This time the tape got jammed in the adaptor. It took brute force to remove the cassette. The tape was creased but I was able to remove the cassette without destroying the film. Once I got the cassette out I couldn't close the door on the adaptor. I was eventually able to force the adaptor door shut then it worked okay except it wouldn't eject  from the VCR or fully rewind. If you use this product you are risking destroying your tapes.I had an old JVC adaptor that died. I attempted to fix it and failed. I do not recommend disassembling these units; they're extremely complex.  I never experienced any issues with the JVC. It died of old age. This product is certainly not an acceptable replacement for the one I had.
1,It never worked from the start. Seems to be a common issue. I messaged the store and they never replied to me or sent me a working product. I was no longer eligible for  return either. Don't waste your money.
5,Worked as advertised. Purchased to replace adaptor that no longer worked.
1,For one the door doesn't open or close but I made it work with tape but it still doesn't play in the VCR. I purchased this to organize family videos for legacy box.....oh well.
1,Tried to use the product and it kept getting stuck in player. Sent back 10 days ago by requested method and still no refund or notice it was received.
5,I had a problem with first one I contacted seller and they responded immediately and no problem quickly replaced item and it works great!! So happy! Thanks!
5,Great delivery time and it does what I want.  I thought my old one was bad but it turned t be another problem.  Still nice to have a new adapter.
1,I have lots of SVHS tapes and I bought this adaptor to capture them on my PC. It worked very well at the beginning exactly the same way how the original adaptor used to work 30 years ago. However after capturing few tapes I noticed that it started to malfunction and after only 4 months it stopped working completely. On top of that it damaged some of my old tapes. after this bad experience my friend advised not to buy this type of adapter if you want to capture lots of tapes and want a durable one then better to go for the manual adaptor but I could not find it.
1,I purchased this product and it arrived broken I inserted a battery and the door/panel wouldn't open. At first I thought it was the battery so I tried another brand new battery straight out of the package and it still wouldn't work. Thought it was a fluke so I sent back that one and got a replacement from amazon a few days later. I tested this one and it opened HOWEVER the door would not close. It appears the latch is completely stuck and I haven't even gotten to use it once. In addition this product came with no directions which I thought was bizarre as it would be completely confusing if you had never used the product before.Overall this product is incredibly overpriced for the quality. If you're like me looking for a replacement of a product that was from your family home in the 90s you're better off scouring thrift stores in hopes of finding one.
5,The VHS-C cassette adaptor works great.  Product looks and works exactly like the original Panasonic cassette adaptor.  Shipping was fast and product received u damaged.
5,I am happy with this adaptor..works great for our dozen VHS-C tapes..shipped fast as well from Canada..
5,Been looking around for a new cassette adapter and found this and thought give it a try. Recommend to anyone!!
5,Thanks I got it now I can watch my  old videos filmed around 1997...Hue
5,Battery operatedEasy to useWorks greatI Would recommend this product to any one
1,We were able to play about a dozen videos when it stopped working. It had a tape inside it and we could not get it out without breaking device.
5,Wonderful
5,So far so good I was able to playback about 10 old tapes in my also old VHS.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED..This got stuck in my vcr and my son had to take it apart to get it out!! Do NOT recommend !
5,Great item for the money. Will be putting all 30mm tape and convert them into DVD.
5,I am now able to watch old movie videos in VHS-CS format on my VCR.
1,On god. Listen to the reviews. This shouldn’t be able to be purchased. Jfc almost ruined a tape from 1999. Find some other adapter just not this one. It’s also def not name brand. what it is.. is a pos.
2,Broken and the replacement did not work either
1,I had one of these years ago that worked perfectly. It got lost and I bought this to try and replace it and be able to watch some old video tapes I recently found.First when opening it sounds AWFUL. It pops and grinds sounding broke. The VHS-C loaded with the awful popping and grinding sound but then when placed in the VCR it wouldn’t play anything. I tried rewinding it thinking that might be the issue and it made obnoxiously loud rewinding sounds stopped and then still wouldn’t play anything. It would just shut itself off.Definitely “cheap” material and product for a hefty price. This is not worth ruining your home videos for.
1,This item quit working the third time I used it. The motor that operates it quit.I sent it back and reordered hoping I got a lemon. The replacement also quit on the third use. This time the switch quit working.Both times I had to pry it open to retrieve my VHS-C tape.I am willing to give things a second chance but will not be reordering for a third time.
5,Had a lot of C tapes and no way to play them. Did not know they still made the VHC adapter. Great product
5,Works great
5,Just what the doctor ordered.
1,So I had saw all the bad reviews but I also saw a high rating and this is suppose to be like an Amazon choice so I went ahead and wasted my time and money and bought it anyway. It does not work and almost destroyed my tape. I had one of these years back and though I was in luck when I found this one. Delivery was speedy but the product was bad.
1,Bought this to finish converting VHSC tapes to digital. Once you load the unit with a tape and put it in the VCR it will not eject. Hangs up in the VCR. Almost had to destroy the VCR unit to get it out. I'm ordering a new one but I fear it will also hang. Yes I try it in several different VCR units.
1,I tried this to start videotaping my vhs-c tapes and put in my cleaning tape to get started and it loaded up and that was it! I changed batteries and it doesn’t work! Need a replacement or my refund!!
1,Broke after 2 months
1,I used a new battery like some reviewers suggested. I was able to insert the VHS-C tape into the adapter but then it stopped working and my VHS-C tape is stuck inside the adapter.
1,A vhs-c tape got stuck in the adapter. Fresh battery too Internal mechanism is stuck halfway thru it's cycle. Seems that I'll either lose this 25yr old tape by returning the unit with tape stuck or take apart the adapter to rescue my tape; likely ruining the adapter and canceling the $40 refund.
5,Very good value. It works very well
1,I was hoping this would play my older VHS-C tapes in a regular VHS player as it is advertised to do.  When I loaded the small tape and inserted this adapter into the VHS player it would not advance the tape to play it.  It would rewind it but not play it.  The adapter would not eject from the VHS player requiring me to disassemble the VCR to get it out.  Amazon's return policy was fabulous so I got a full refund but it's disappointing that the adapter does not work as advertised.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS! I disregarded the reviews and bought anyway hoping it would work. Got stuck in my VCR player we had to take it apart breaking the VCR player to try to salvage the tape but the cassette adapter was broken inside the VCR and we can not get the tape out of the adapter. We now have to go pay more money to attempt to salvage the home video. Safe yourself the money and head ache. Do not buy.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I was only able to watch 2 videos and then the cover stopped latching shut. It closes the motor runs through the motions then it pops back open. It is longer functioning. Huge bummer because I am in a time crunch. Just ordered another brand from Amazon.
5,It worked good thxs
1,The mechanics of this device are poorly designed I constantly need to open it up to pop a gear or bracket back into place to remove my trapped tape.
1,Try a different VHS adapter.  This one did not hold up and ate a "vintage" tape.  Try a different brand!!!
5,Did a great job playing my old VHS-C
5,Worked perfectly
1,Didn’t work cause seems defective
5,Exactly as listed and works
5,Works fine
1,Used it less than 10 times.  The last time I used it the switch broke with a tape in it.  Had to take it apart to try and salvage my home movie.  Total piece of crap to only last a few uses.  I don't believe this is a Panasonic product.  I'm betting it is a knock off.
1,Broke within 1 minute
5,Works perfectly!
1,A screw fell out of it as soon we opened it. My husband fixed that. Every time we use it and open it to take out the tape it has eaten part of the tape and have to rewind it manually back in to the cassette
5,Works well.
1,unfortunately I purchased this some time ago finally got around to opening it and start backing up my old tapes. Put a fresh battery in inserted the cassette tape popped it into the VCR ( also new) and it immediately ate the tape. The motor stopped working on the adapter and could not get the cassette out.
1,It broke after the 3rd use.  I had to dissemble it to retrieve my original tape.  Don’t risk memories on cheap products.
5,Works great no problem with this VHSC cassette runs smooth in my DVD/VHS recorder.  Nice price.
1,Wanted to use to convert VHS to digital but a piece was broken in the hinge. Unusable and am returning.
1,Didn’t work at all just make noises not worth the money
1,Worked on first tape. Tried a second one and it was fuzzy. Tried a third thinking perhaps it was the tape but it got mangled and ruined. Very disappointed...had to cut the tape to get it out of the adapter. Can't get those videos back...a trip with parents both now deceased.
1,I ordered the wrong thing so I had to return it.
1,Useless defekt junk!
1,The devise was broken and would not work.  A small piece of plastic was rattling inside it.  Tried it and would not work.Saw a no return on this device.  Ordered 2 tapes for the same price i paid for this one tape. I'm sure it got damaged in transit.
1,Item played my home video for 30 seconds before making a weird noise and then stopping play. I tried with multiple tapes and couldn't watch my home videos. Very disappointed and sent back.
1,It does not work
5,It works
1,It didn't work for me. All of my other tapes work but not this one. It always ends up getting stuck and I have to figure out how to get it out everytime.
1,Cannot print return label.  All I received was a bar code
1,Waste of money. Useless.  Not clearly disclosed on Web site.
1,only worked once now no good dosent work
1,it wouldn't open. I planned on returning it but my dad tried to get it to work. Now it won't close
1,I installed the battery heard a motor spin for a few seconds then nothing...........returning it and going elsewhere.
1,It broke within the first week of use
1,Didn’t work
1,Does not fit 8mm as advertised
4,Good
5,Thanks
1,Does not work. Waste of money. Product is a scam.
1,We lost our original cassette adapter and purchased this as a replacement. After playing about ten tapes and enjoying sweet memories it ate one of our tapes. We removed it and tried another tape. It would not release that tape and we had to take the adapter apart to save the great memories on that tape while destroying the adapter.
5,Works great for vhsC cassette tapes
5,I was pleasantly surprised that it actually worked. I have copied many of my old VHS-C tapes not and preserved our family past history. Great functioning product. I highly recommend this adapter.
1,I put in batteries but could not get the door to open or to get any of the mechanism to work.
5,Brings back memories from old movie camera tapes
5,I used to have one years ago and have no idea what happened to it. I have tons of VHS-C tapes from when my girls were young and wanted to be able to watch them! When I looked on other sites I was shocked to see some were $75-$300! I thought I'd never get to watch them again at that price! Luckily a few months later I was able to find this one and grabbed it after reading the great reviews. It works great! I have been able to watch my old videos using this and it's super easy! It does require batteries and I'm very careful loading and unloading the cassettes but so far no issues whatsoever and I'm loving all the old memories. ♡ I still think they're overpriced but at least it wasn't as bad as some other sellers on other sites.
2,This was a strange product right off the bat I had one of these as a teenager and it didnt require batteries....This one requires a AA battery for whatever reason. The one I had as a teen didnt require batteries to run the tape you simply slotted it in. Trying to watch the footage is impossible the footage scrolls from bottom to top on every VHSc I own. Avoid
5,Packaged well and works as expected
5,I’m finally able to watch my old camcorder videos!!!
5,To transfer mini camcorder tapes to dvd
5,If your VCR is old or weak you may have trouble.  I used a VCR that I had refurbished with new rubber parts.  That VCR/Adapter combination worked well enough to capture all my old family videos.  So I was happy with that.
5,Very pleased with this. Works great
5,Just what I ordered and fast delivery.
5,Allows you to view your VHS-C (from legacy camcorders) in a standard VCR machine!
5,I had ordered 2 of these from another seller. They had no brand name and were so cheaply made. One worked for a few days the other not at all. Finally I found this one. It is a Panasonic comes in a sealed box it is sturdy and solid compared to the others and it works as it should.
5,Manuable y útil
5,Works fine quality good & prompt delivery!
5,Nice quality
5,Works well and helps for a very fast rewind
5,I used it to transfer video to a digital format when there was no other way to see these memorable family events.
5,Perfect for watching old home videos with!!
5,I have been wanting to get one of these for years and years because our family had dozens of the little video tapes that we haven’t been able to watch. I finally decided on getting this one. I thought it was a bit pricey but it was worth every penny to be able to watch all those videos again. Product functions well and I recommend it.
5,Gracias por este equipo muy bueno
5,Works perfect. Was shipped from Canada and arrived in good condition.
1,It worked the first few times then it wouldn’t eject one of my tapes. I lost a precious home video to this thing. Don’t buy.
5,My previous cassette adapter broke and my 13 year old granddaughter was coming to visit. I found some tapes of her father as a child. I needed the adapter quickly. It was sent quickly and in perfect condition. We sat and laughed and shared precious time together.
