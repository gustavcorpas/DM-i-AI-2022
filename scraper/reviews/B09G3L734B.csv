5,The new Lenovo does everything I need in a laptop. Excellent speed lots of memory good feature set. It runs either Windows 10 or 11 which is nice if you don't want to move to the later version.
5,It fit
3,We ordered 8 of these; they arrived quickly and were in good shape. I have opened one up to provision for a new user and Windows is not only unlicensed but it will NOT activate. I'm hoping the seller responds in a timely manner. I haven't checked the others yet.
