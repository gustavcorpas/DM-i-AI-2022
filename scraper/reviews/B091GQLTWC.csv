5,My favorite part of this car phone holder and the biggest reason I selected this one was because I have a hard time seeing my screen when driving and this particular phone holder has the arm that extends out making it much closer to me!So we all know safety is paramount when using your phone and driving therefore having this makes it so much easier to use my phone if an incoming call comes in and I can see who's calling easier and faster having it closer to me!!Aside from that very important reason the phone holder itself is very sturdy and holds extremely well to the windshield. I have not and probably will not have the need to try the attachment for the Air vent so I can't speak on that.
5,At first my Apple phone fell out when hitting bumps until I realized I just had to tighten it secure and then remove my phone and click in just one more tighter. I leave it at that setting and it never falls out
5,Arrived on time and was easy to install  I installed mine on my glass window the suction power works great got 2 of them for both my cars  great price and product highly recommend
5,Clip on vent is perfect. Have not had the need to use the suction cup as of yet.
5,Seems very well made so far.  Very strong grip.
5,It all works great thank you
5,Good if you move between vehicles alot
5,Gives me eye level view of phone screen. The view is very helpful for GPS.
5,Very strong
4,serves my needs good for the price
5,Quality is ok
3,I got this to replace the other holder that only stuck to my windshield. Well the adhesive on the dashboard plate peels  away under the weight of the holder as soon as it starts to get hot outside. So not it's on the windshield where I don't want it. I am going to try my own adhesive to see if it's any better.I also don't like how it's in a fixed position. I thought the base would swivel but it does not. It also doesn't extend very long which is a pain when you have to stick it on the windshield because in order to keep it in arms length it has to be mounted high up.So overall it does the job but it doesn't do it exceptionally and it's not what I'm looking for. The price should be half of what they charge.
4,Through the years I have many types of phone holders. So far it's the best. And the price it's about right. I only have one question how do you remove it so you can install it in another place. But it's good. Please answer. Thanks
5,I bought this for our trip to Florida and the Florida  keys to take pictures wile we were driving worked great ‚Ä¶ except when I went to take the dash base off the rental car dash the 3M adhesive did not stay intact. So I am looking into how I get a replacement dash pad only thing wrong with this product other than that it worked very very well!
3,I love the location and idea of mounting it on my dash in my 4Runner but the adhesive have come unglued within a few months I don‚Äôt really want to install it in front of my air vents.
5,Good
5,I recommend it üíØ it's strong and comfortable just what I was looking for üëç
5,It fits on your windshield you‚Äôre dash or on your vent!
5,I‚Äôd tried a handful of dash cellphone holders but none of them stuck. Finally switched to this windshield phone holder and it works great!
2,Once you have it set up and you squeeze the ‚Äúarms‚Äù to hold your phone in place it is reasonably firm. That is until you hit a pothole or turn onto a gravel road or hit a speed bump where it will knock your phone out of the holder because the ‚Äúarm‚Äù mechanism sucks.No matter how hard I squeeze the arms to hold the phone it will still get knocked out during rough roads or dirt roads. It‚Äôs VERY annoying and there is no way to secure your phone other than that arm mechanism.Overall I recommend NOT getting this unless you drive on smooth roads 24/7 that have no potholes or bumps or cracks.
5,So I have a problem of having the tiny cute little car and having the biggest phone ever. It is very tricky to find the right place for phone holder in my car without my big phone blocking the view. My phone weights about 500gr and thickness is around 20.8mm. This phone holder holds it perfectly and it fits so great. You can see in the photos the thickness is just perfect! It is exactly like advertised even more! I did not tried on textured space cuz I was afraid that suction might not be enough to hold my heavy phone so i just placed on to the glass and it is powerful holds my phone just fine! I am assuming it would do a good job on textured spot as well. I am extremely happy! Thank you so much!
5,Works well can adhere many places arm is extendable and it has an adapter for the vent.
3,suction is good
3,It shakes when you drive. It is annoying. There is no way to get your phone out of it with one hand other than to push on the screen of your phone since the release button is in the back middle. But the most annoying thing is you can‚Äôt get it tight enough to not shake.
5,This is the Best Windshield Mount I've ever used!! The telescoping arm is strong and keeps my cellphone very stable in the Upper Windshield location where I mounted it next to the Rear View Mirror. No more obstructive to my vision than the mirror itself.
5,Goode Goode
3,It has good suction but when it gets hot it falls off
5,Greek for hands off speak texting easy to use
5,Perfect
5,Love it
2,It looked easy but unless suction power or adhesion are really strong I couldn‚Äôt see how it would work. At the end it wouldn‚Äôt fit my car which has a high dash and a sloping windshield.  I wasn‚Äôt interested in using the vent to install it.  I returned it.
2,I was going to return but don't have the time.  The suction is not very good. My phone keeps going down. (It's a Samsung)
5,I love everything about
5,This doesn‚Äôt fit comfortably to me in my suv. It feels like it obstructs my view.  So going to get one that is a cup holder. I have one similar to this in one of my cars and it worked well. So thinking it‚Äôs just the make of the car.
4,I haven't had it but a week but wish I had gotten it sooner..great phone holder.
4,Sencillo para instalar
1,The suction power was great and in the end it was the actual clamping to the phone that made the product not work for me. The phone kept falling out of the Cradle part no matter how tight I locked it. It just doesn't hold the phone.
5,Para los que usamos cover con bateria incluida no busques mas este es tu producto
2,I bought this product because I was going to be able to leave the case on but it doesn‚Äôt hold it.  Disappointed.
5,Love it great suction  stays in place on my semi
1,Se despegaba conduciendo y el celular se cae debajo del asiento no fue una buena compra anuncios enga√±osos
1,Doesn‚Äôt hold phone in place well. Constantly having to reset whenever I am on uneven road. Which the cause the Phone to fall out of holder regularly. When I‚Äôm landscape using landscape mode for maps‚Ä¶. don‚Äôt even bother it will not hold for more than 10 seconds in place before falling.üëéüëé
5,Number One I've order over 10 holders and this is truly the best one very strong and totally reliable..Don't order any other car phone holder Guaranteed Satisfaction....
5,Bueno para cargar mi cell
2,doesn't hold phone tightly
2,I was disappointed with this. In order for it to have the suction power that it needed you had to adhere the hard part. Problem is the size of that part was just too big for any good areas to put it. I tried it without and didn‚Äôt even get down the road before it fell off. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,AFTER PAYING A DECENT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THIS ITEM I INSTALLED IT ON MY WINDSHIELD.  IT WAS VERY FLIMSY.  IN ORDER TO ADHERE TO IT CORRECTLY YOU HAD TO ADJUST IT SEVERAL TIMES TO ACCOMMODATE THE LENGTH OF YOUR PHONE.  ONCE IN PLACE FORGET ABOUT USING A SUN SHIELD IN THE WINDOW.  UNLESS OF COURSE YOU DON'T MIND TAKING IT OFF AND ON ALL OF THE TIME.  I LIVE IN FLORIDA LOTS OF SUN....THE SUCTION CUP MELTED TO MY WINDSHIELD AND COULD ONLY BE REMOVED WITH A PUTTY KNIFE!!!  SO I HAD TO BUY A NEW ONE A DIFFERENT TYPE HOWEVER.  THAT ONE ARRIVED IN A CRUSHED BOX AND WAS MISSING AN IMPORTANT PART...UGH!!!  I GIVE UP!
1,Horrible
5,Love it buying another one solid construction!!!
1,devuelvan el dinero en un robo un producto chimbo
1,Wasted money. Will not hold to surface or windshield for longer than 1 minute and it keeps falling. Almost causing me to crash my car because it fell while in heavy traffic
1,This is a very cheep phone mount afterall. The round twist (nut) snapped and broke my second use of it and it‚Äôs not like they supply you with additional ones. So this item is now useless to me.
1,Phone will not stay in holder.
2,Doesn't stick on dashboard
1,This did not stay mounted to dash or window The glue sticker melted in the heat
5,Better than one suction
4,I recently took a road trip. This was in the car and after installing it off on the left side window of my newer Honda Pilot I found that this had good suction power and held my large iphone with some authority. It held up through the trip and was useful with Wazeing my way through Oregon and Washington.There's a button on the back that releases the tension on the phone holder's clamp. I keep forgetting this and practically rip the phone off every time I remove it. Overall this is a good basic phone holder that held onto the front window well. I don't know if it will stand up to actual heat. I'll update the review if it falls off.
5,I am constantly on the go and needed a GPS can sometimes be dangerous. I always use Bluetooth in the car but having it at eye level is much more secure than looking downwards or having to turn my head completely. After a few weeks of using I have realised how much my driving has improved I have been more on time and was surprisingly very easy to instal. Out of the box it has a window suction car suction panel suction and a cleaning wipe with a dryer. To connect to either the airvent or window suction is simply attach them and tighten it with the circle piece. Then open the arms by pressing a button that is on the book that will spread and close them is to simply apply pressure and you will hear a soft clicking that will hold it in place. This product is perfect Thank you very much!
5,This set is simply amazing. It was so easy to install. Once I locked it it didn't move you can rotate it 360¬∞. There's a button in the back that automatically adjust the holder to fit the phone then you just gotta press the sides to tighten it. As you can see in one of the pic I had one that was in the CD slot but it was obstructing the camera when I back up. So this is a great switch for me. 5 stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
5,This is a great car phone suction cup cell phone holder! Better than I expected for sure! It's very easy to use holds my iphone 11 without a problem and it's easy to open and close as you wish. Love how it holds everything together and keeps it clean and has a open space for the charging cable to go through!Love it love it!! Highly recommend it!!
5,Si le sirvi√≥ mucho a mi esposo pero la goma se acaba muy parido.
5,Me encanta
4,Mi celular se cae con facilidad si no precio o los ganchos lo suficiente al celular
5,I was looking for a reliable phone holder but without having to permanently stick it to my dashboard. This one comes with option to secure it to your ac ent in the car. I‚Äôve had other holders before that would fall off the vent all the time but this one has knobs to tighten and loosen it. It‚Äôs been tightened securely to my vent and has not fallen once. It‚Äôs easy to install and your phone pops in and out of it securely. I would recommend this to anyone that is not wanting to use the adhesive part.
5,Easy to install works great with my Galaxy Note!
5,This is a great little holder. If your dashboard is really long like mine?  You may not be able to stick it on your windshield for your phone to be really visible. I ended putting mine on my driver‚Äôs pocket door window.  I didn‚Äôt want to put it on my dashboard. It‚Äôs been up for more than a week with no issues.Before I settled on the final location?  I had tried sticking it on the windshield. In multiple places. To put it at the current location? I simply washed off the suction cup let it dry and put it on the side window.
3,Not the best buy
