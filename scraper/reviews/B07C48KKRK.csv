4,I have a HP 3700 series and thought this printer would be different for I like the compact but the cord connecting the computer and printer is short also the direction book in this one I bought saying it a 3755 model came no instruction book in reference to the part numbers what they do how to connect to the wifi SO I pulled out the quide book from the one I have and come to find out this is coming up under the printer settings as the 3700. I am glad I had the book to help me through just remember to hook the computer and printer together with the usb cord so that you wifi can detect your printer go to settings advanced settings printer add a printer on the printer make sure your turn on the computer on and under the x turn on the symbol below and on my wifi router I turned the wsp on not only to locate my computer but to work securely  you probably also can find the specs online by typing in the Make and model number
4,With no owner's manual it was difficult to get all the info I needed to complete the set-up phase. I downloaded HP Connect as instructed. Unfortunately because this particular model was not on the list of HP Connect printers it got very frustrating. Some other YouTube videos helped show me how to print the Information and Using Wifi Direct sheets. There was a problem though with the default password during the Set Up process. Nothing worked. Finally a QR code option came up but I didn't have another phone or camera to take a picture of the QR code as instructed so it wasn't until a few days later that I was able to connect. But.... I could not make the device print using a 'share' command (converted to Pdf) only the 'print' command from my photo gallery (which uses ink to print the background if I screenshot a form for example).My wifi direct signal is weak also so sometimes the printer is Ready/Connected but by the time I use my phone to get to the document the printer is off-line already.Because I can't use HP Connect without getting passed the Password phase I do not have the full benefits of the printer's abilities.Difficult overall.
5,Super easy to connect to wifi once you get the hp smart app on your phone set up and printed the welcome page within 5mins
3,This thing its i dont know....the price is very HIGH OMG !!!....Ni muy muy....ni tan tan el precio es MUY ALTO POR DIOS
4,The printer took a pretty long time to set up but once the wifi was all set up printing is super easy and fast. I love that it's light and I can stow it away after use. It uses *a ton* of ink and that isn't cheap.
5,This printer was as expected prints fine and fast enough if you’re just printer a page or two or three here and there  Which is what I got it for.  I really like that I can print from my phone and anything else on my Wi-Fi in the house  Don’t have to stand beside it and wait.  I’m sorry I haven’t tried the other features yet but they just weren’t that important to me yet…. I have had it a few months.  I’m sure it will be fine I trust HP quality.  It does kinda make me smile sometimes it’s like a toy compared to my office printers…. But it definitely does it’s job!  I recommend it
4,This product socks. I spend to much time to reconnect the computer to the printer each use. It takes hours and hours to get the NEW Hp printer to work with a HP laptop.  Never again
5,Muy fácil de instalar
5,Great deal arrived quick excellent purchase
1,i was super excited about getting a printer for my home for an occasional print job. i got it set it up took forever for me to figure out that apparently the wireless connection must not work. the black ink that i received shows empty. i contacted them about replacing it and they asked for proof. so a couple of weeks later i got around to trying it out again. i have spent several hours now trying to get the printer to print. i am unable to print via the usb cord or wireless. my computer shows on wifi and the printer shows on wifi. i am also unable to scan. the computer is not communicating to the printer. i tried to contact HP but it is out of warranty. i tried to download the fix-it option but it just kept showing "file corrupt" which gives me warm and fuzzies. i tried using the virtual chat i go around and around. the HP part is not the problem of this seller but maybe there was something wrong with the printer in the first place for them to sell it refurbished. i will be sending it back since i cannot seem to resolve this.
5,As good as the old one but works
3,This does the job or so I thought until I really needed it. Don't waste your time on useless Virtual chat and HP Smart Doctor. You will run in circles for hours re-installing new drivers updates etc. Go straight to live support and let a tech troubleshoot via CHAT. I am updating THIS review solely because of Nichola the tech who figured out the problem on two devices simultaneously. He is an absolute rockstar.The printer/scanner is lightweight affordable with adequate print quality. The scanner is one page at a time and the dialogue window got easier as I worked with it. Again it works for documents slowly but it does the job and you have a multi-page pdf jpeg or email option.It's a solid option for an occasional paperless user who needs to print/scan once in awhile. My old workhorse HP toners couldn't sit between uses without drying out. For this reason the purchase met my needs.
4,Xxxxxc
3,I think I would of liked this printer if only my laptop could of found it ?? Even after many try's everything looked good until you would try to print. Was sad to have sent it back.
1,So I ordered this printer on March 22 2021 got it on March 29 2021 on a Monday afternoon by Fedex finally was able to get the printer out the box that Wednesday March 31 2021 to find the printer was missing a cord and had no direction in box at all. Took forever to figure out how to connect up app on phone to the house printer because of the printer coming with no directions or guidance on where to go to get it. So after I finally figured how to connect the app and printer then before I could do a test print that is part of the app setup to see if printer works I get immediately a Carriage Jam error 3 before I could add any paper to the printer at that and I tried all trouble shooting that online sources including YouTube videos and Hp online resources provided and nothing worked. The status on the ap kept saying ready but the printer kept showing Carriage Jam. So I immediately reached out to the Value Rush company Wednesday March 31st and sent at least 3 messages to them and got no response and it is now April 3 2021. I needed this printer for work and to me this is not what I call go service or a good first purchase experience. As a prime member I waited a week to get it delivered by Fedex to find that the printer doesn’t work. I definitely didn’t get what I paid for. So 1 star is my rating.
4,Bought this for my freshman in college. Excellent value for the price compact size for her dorm room. With all the Covid restrictions it was very time consuming to use the printing at her school so this is a great alternative. Only issue she is having is other students use it on the WiFi without her permission so she has to turn it off when not using it. Easy fix but a password would be a nice feature.
1,Without an instruction book it was very difficult to even guess what to try but looked on google for instructions.  They did not work.  Another issue is trying to connect to Samsung Chromebook.  Another impossibility.  This printer  is very light weight not very sturdy but would have used if it connected.  Also tryed a cable with a USB C connector since wifi wouldn't connect.  That didn't work either.  I have a 10 year old HP printer I may get back out.  YOu just pushed wifi and it connected maybe the external harddrive of the old computer had the password it picked up?  Who knows.  Wish they would make something easy other wise technology is a migraine.
3,Evey time I went to use it it lost WiFi and had to reset it up. Returned it
4,I love it.. even tho ur was hard setting it up to the WiFi. It’s trouble in my area. But I had the option to plug it into the computer and had the plug for the wall. It was more than what I hope for
3,could not connect to my chromebook so I returned it.  Make sure that I do not get "Instant Ink Ready"
3,Having g to connect to USB port to print anytning.
5,I love it.
2,Cannot fix.  will have to throw away a $30 cartridge and see if a new one works.  Less than 6 months old.
3,LIKES --GOOD QUALITY AND GOOD PICS--SMALL VERSION FOR A SMALL DESK IS GREAT. I HAVE TROUBLE GIVING OUT 5  STAR REVIEWS TO THIS GOOD PRINTER DUE TO THE ORIGINAL SET-UP OF Hp INSTRUCTIONS.  NOT CONCISE.IF I HAD GONE TO GOOGLE'S REVIEWS OF OTHER BUYERS OF THIS 3755 Hp PRINTER FOR TROUBLE SHOOTING .I WOULD HAVE SAVED HOURS OF FRUSTRATION.  THE HP PRINTER I REPLACED WAS GREAT BUT VERY OLD AND EASY TO SET UP. WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE WASTE OF TIM WITH THIS PRINTER 3755. I WIL NOT SEND BACK THIS PRINTER BECAUSE IT'S GOOD QUALITY BUT THEIR INSTRUCTIONS COUD SURE BE LESS COMPLICATED. VERY SAD!WHAT I FOUND MOST MADDENING WAS THE PAGES OF INSTRUCTIONS FROM Hp BUT IF I HAD GONE TO GOOGLE FIRST AND CHECKED THE TROUBLE SHOOTING COMPLAINTS OF  OTHERS
5,i liked this printer because of its size quality and affordable price.  i use this for all my printing and copying
4,I do beleive that after I get all of the bugs out and figure out why it is having a problem with LINUX thenthings well be better!
5,So I waited for a few months to pass by before reviewing this product. My one and only complaint which didn't affect the rating I gave it is I wish I had known that refirbs don't come with consumables. Other than that it's working great. Fits nicely on my desk and does exactly what I need it to. The seller also worked with me on shipping when I encountered the issue with ink. I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend.
5,Works fine.Does not take up much space
3,Printer just stopped working
1,Setup is not easy or user friendly. Does not print correctly- prints a shrunken version of doc and immediately gets jammed trying to print 2nd page. Complete waste of ink trying to get it to work.
2,BEWARE---- know that this is a "refurbished" product. The printer worked out of the box for black copies only and the scanner worked as well.  Just outside the warranty window the printer will not print anything. It continuously shows offline on the computer so I can't hit the "diagnose and fix" icon. Ive printed at most 50-75 pages on this machine. Im hoping the cartridge is dry but if that's the problem then this machine has poor ink efficiency and I would not recommend.
5,Easy to use compact
2,This printer eats ink. It only connects to my phone not my laptop not my tablet just my phone. I still have to drive across town to print simple things like information sheets and invoices if I want them to look good.
3,It took forever to setup!!  No instructions with the product...not good for a 79 yo!  Color inks would not be placed in the printer...so it’s only a black printer!
4,Es muy comodo
2,Do you have 4-8 hours to spend on googling articles reading reddit threads and watching youtube videos trying to install this thing? then buy the printer.
1,All I wanted was a SIMPLE printer that would connect to a USB port and print.Well this WAS NOT IT.Apparently it does NOT support USB connection.It has to be WIFI.I'm on a GUEST network so wifi was not an option.
3,This printer/scanner/copier works well it connected immediately was easy to operate the only problem is that straight out of the box there is as huge line through my scans...
1,Save your time and energy and just purchase the new printer. I initially had no problem with the fact that this was a refurbished/renewed printer but the setup was a nightmare. Wi-Fi connection was the biggest issue. You need a password and the instructions don’t supply it for you. In fact the directions are basically useless garbage. After searching for help on here (type in WiFi in the Q&A section and the code should pop up) and downloading two apps I was finally able to get the printer going but it wasn’t worth the trouble. I went ahead and ordered the new version of this printer and I had zero issues with setting it up; took all of 5 minutes. It’s a bit more expensive but absolutely worth it. I’ll never get those 2 hours back!
2,When finally set up the printing quality is great. Perfect for my small space setup.  Just don’t buy from anyone outside of HP unless the mention that the printer cable is included. You can not connect this printer via WiFi unless you have 2.4G. Anything higher (i.e. 4G or 5G) you are required to use a printer cable for connection. The cable is not included and when you call customer service there are no options to assist with set up. They just tell you that you have to buy the cable separate. There is also no mention of this before buying the product.
5,Very pleased with everything! Product and service.
2,Text quality comes out a little blurryUpdating my review: literally only works to print from my phone. Struggles to print from laptop over wifi or plugged in. Excellent for wasting time
3,Incomplete. Need to purchase a connector cord to computer. Must go to internet for set up. Not from HP company.
3,The printer takes up very little room. Good price however it is impossible to connect to wifi. I spent hours trying. App didn't help one bit.
1,Scanning and copying have never worked. I've probably spent 40 hours installing uninstalling and reinstalling plus contacting the virtual assistant and running ALL the hp problem solving apps. Nothing works and everything is a huge time-consuming process on this thing. I hate it.
1,I have only printed a few times and the print quality quickly went downhill. I tried cleaning the printheads and it just got even worse. Printing out a one page document shouldn’t take me 45 minutes because it keeps messing it up printing out blank pages or printing out just complete crud. Did you ever see the move Office Space? I am about to do that to this piece of $4it!!
1,Terrible expereince try to operate this copier . Read the reviews and see what I am talking about .
2,Paper is difficult to align the Bluetooth is spotty the paper jams easily.
5,EASY SETUP WORKS PERFECTLY!
1,Don't buy this because it won't work. And you'll never get it to connect to WIFI.
1,Want to return printer It says it has printed the document. but did not print.
5,I needed a printer that worked well but wouldn't take up much space. This fit the bill perfectly.
3,Very difficult to set up - way more involved than expected. Support system people were very helpful and was eventually able to connect up.
2,If you're just printing text it's good enough but if you want to print an image just know it WILL have a variety of printing issues.Yeah you gotta restart it every time you wanna use it. The ink cartridges go bad after maybe two prints and the quality of the images is pretty low.If you're broke like I am just spare yourself this item. Only get it if it's a negligible expense for you.
5,Printer would not turn on. Sold by Amazon but through 3rd party supplier. Returning and getting a refund. The extra ink supply i bought from Amazon is going back too.
1,This printer is not new looks to be about 5 years old and used. After contacting HP they informed me that the printer is out of warranty and they cannot help me with the defective printing this printer produces. Ink is expired and a deal that looks better than it is.
2,So I like the footprint as it is in a small apartment desk. The setup was cantankerous as software could be. At first it would not recognize the ink cartridges. Had to reboot the software everytime I did a setup function. Took three tries to do a firmware upgrade. Hung up everytime. Took four tries to do the wifi direct. Two reboots to connect wirelessly. and the list goes on. Oh and I am using a Lenovo X1 so not an old slow computer. But it is an inexpensive computer and will serve its purpose I imagine.
1,My HP laptop could not find this HP printer even with the usb cord. It seems the refurbishment was putting it in a new box. It certainly didn't involve any QA. The return process has taken about 1 week thus far. Get this I received an email telling me to print out the return label for the printer. Did I miss a joke? After pointing out I had no printer to print a label (duh) I received a copy of a return label via snail mail.
4,slow and doesn't hold much paper.
5,Could not get the printer to print from my computer. I could only get the instructions to printer when I tried.
5,I gave this as a gift.  It is worth the amount I paid for it.  I intend to purchase this again.
5,Perfect size for our rv. No paper setup instructions. Go online to set up and read the instructions carefully. I didn’t and it took me longer than necessary.
1,I'll warn you with this printer. I have horrible experience with this. Totally useless. From setting it up until the end this product sucks. I ended up throwing it after 2mos of buying it because it stress me out.! If I could gave a zero star I've done it. This product doesn't deserve any star.!
5,love the precut
1,This is my second HP printer.  The first one was a more expensive version and it recently crapped out.  After hours of trouble shooting I threw the towel in and bought this one.  It's cheap I know!  I just need a basic printer.  Nothing fancy.  I do like that it is smaller but I do not like how I have to troubleshoot and reconnect to network every time I want to print something.  It really really really puts me in a bad mood.  I am convinced all printers are cheaply made and lousy.  HP makes it impossible to contact them.  I have to walk away before I throw this printer through the window.  What a disappointment.
1,I had high hopes for this product but it never wants to connect to my computer.  The first time I added it it printed 10 pages of info before I was able to connect it. So frustrating.  Now I'm trying to print something and it won't connect again.  It has printed 20 or 30 pages of info and nothing helps
5,Perfect for home office. Compact. Sits nicely on my small desk. Luv the fact that you can copy stuff off this printer also.A bit tricky getting the ink cartridges in but after once or twice you get the idea.
2,It worked fine at first than completely stared to act up and was not printing anythig onto the paper at all.
1,Doesn’t work no service
5,It is a little slow  but print quality is great.  I use it to print from my phone.  Good value buy.
5,I didn't like that there weren't any instructions on using the printer.
1,Very disappointed.  Out of ink already!  Will not even print the code for the HP ink subscription.  HP says I have third party carts.  HP customer support is of no help.  The ink costs almost as much as the printer.  I really regret buying this printer.  But the truth is why would anyone ship a printer not full of ink?  Renewed?In lockdown and can't go to the library.  The seller will accept my return but I can't print the label.  If I could get full ink carts I'd keep it.  The return deadline is tomorrow.  I asked for more time.I think it is good printer.  Ink is costly.  Printing just a few pages and then not being able to get HP subscription?
5,Love it and it fits in my camper
4,Slow scanner when using unit. WiFi Good
5,I’m so happy with my printer.
1,Junk!
5,It’s a slim fast printer.  We’re thinking about getting one for my husband’s office.
1,Scanner did not work with HP Smart.  I thought I had purchased a new  printer but it was refurbished. (Renewed) did not have any meaning to me. I had to return the product and order another one directly from HP which resulted in a lot of extra effort. Since this is tax season I need a reliable printer.
5,Great product...We use it in our camper...Awesome dependability
1,I hate this printer . It keeps telling me that it cannot fine air print. I have not got it to work or the other two I have.  All I have is trouble with them
5,Lightweight and small we love it
5,I'm very tech disadvantaged and this was easy to connect and the first pages printed were above expectations. Would recommend this to anyone.
2,Very slow and scanner leaves black marks at the top of the pageBecause of it being a renewed it doesn't come with instructions so you have to go online to find out setup instructions.
2,Hard to set up!
5,Excellent price n product
1,No matter what I did the paper would not come out straight so the last part of all the prints was blurry.There were 'shadow bars' where a solid bar should be. Not happy with my purchase.  HP has usually been great for me.
5,Love HP printers. Was looking for an inexpensive one for our condo. This one is perfect and compact. Runs a bit slow but that is not a problem.
1,Unfortunately I could not get this unit to sync to my Wi-Fi. But there was absolutely no problem with returning this item my hat's off to Amazon and the seller. Thank you very much for all your cooperation
5,I needed something to take with a small footprint that would do everything including scanning from the computer. This worked out great.
5,Great printer
5,Great unit at a great price
2,Can't for the life of me connect this to the internet. It dosent work with HP smart. And there is no usb cable to help me
5,Perfect
1,I will not give this a star. Printer came in a plane brown box. I suspect that this was a repack. Upon trying to get the printer to function I learned that the warranty had expired (I had not registered the printer?!?) So how could the warranty expire? I am going to give this one star or I cannot submit these comments.
1,The printer was poorly made. I could not get the printer to work. It felt like it would break every time I touched itI sent it back
1,The first one didn’t work changed to new one which worked for a while.Today nothing I called the support number then listened to a recording obviously recorded to frustrate callers until we hang up.  I’m stubborn so I listened to a lot of repeats before hanging up.  Never again!  To late to return but worth writing it off.
5,Doing what it's supposed to good product for the money
5,I love how easy it is to use.
1,Wasn’t able to even use the printer. Since the moment that I plugged it in it said that the cartridge was jammed and I had to move it. I would do it and it would always repeat that same error. Would not recommend.
1,This printer is ok for the first 5 pages. The ink runs out VERY quickly. It’s difficult to access the “monthly ink deal” that it uses as a selling point. Buy a more expensive printer. It will save money in the long run.
1,Muy mala impresión muy mal imprimió
1,I did not realize this was a used printer. I would never have purchased it for that price. I can get a brand new one for the price this was. Also it will not connect to my laptop.
1,This was a joke. Packing was horrible literally just put it in a box with zero padding. When removed there were "loose parts" or something making rattling noises and small plastic parts fell out of it when opened. It was definitely used even dirty. Not acceptable.
5,Exactly what I need
5,It’s a great little printer bought one for my daughter in college too
1,Disappointed receiving my printer damaged.
1,i have order HP deskjet 3755，i don't know why receive different model 3752 and also doesn’t work
1,Brand new color ink cartridge malfunctioned for unknown reason printer wouldn't function. It's snowing and cold here so I can't pop out and drive the roads for another brand new cartridge. Printer cute compact and small but so fragile as to be flimsy. Am returning all and getting a different printer altogether.
5,Perfect my step daughter loves this
5,Compact. Easy to use.
1,Doesn't work
1,I cannot hook it up.  The instructions on the disk  are incomplete.  It won't let me contact the website.  I am very frustrated.  No instructions on loading ink.  Says it is already installed. It is not.
1,Not user friendly & missing items. Did not come in original box but rather a plain cardboard box. We returned it.
1,Impossible to set up.  Even my IT person from my office couldn’t do it.  Apparently it is broken
5,love it
1,Very difficult to copy & scan. Paper feed twists the paper.
1,Terrible printer do not buy this product
1,Can't get the printer to print code to input for second time you have 5 mins to enter & I didn't know. Still can't print wired or wireless.
5,Good everything
1,Printing not work at all with me its show always estimated errorThe problem is the colors not support from here is damage !!!
2,Difficult to set up initially takes several minutes to connect / print even one or two pages let alone more. Have to feed pages one at a time. Copies come out smudged and then analytic tests say everything is fine -- no easy way to get additional support. Charged monthly for "Instant Ink" but don't get any cartridges. Better off going to FedEx and paying per sheet there.
1,It never connected to the internet
1,Product did not work when opened and tried to install ink cartridges ... carrier did not move. Sending back for a refund.
1,Came in dirty and broken
1,Broke upon receipt sent it back
1,Only work for a month and then stop working
1,Did not work after troubleshooting.
1,The product was defective.  The paper kept jamming and was attempting to print out where ink cartridges were located.
1,No sirvio
1,The last time I bought an HP printer I swore it would be the last time I ever made that mistake. Well this one with it's claim of easy use without a network lured me in and I bought it.Big mistake!The thing comes with no manual - though there is plenty of printed material with it to sell you "Instant Ink" and a printed guide with three whole pages in your language - one of which describes the buttons another full page of warranty information.I'm convinced that HP's mission statement says nothing about printers - just an emphayon selling ink cartridges to people foolish enough to buy their printers. I say this because pretty much every time you touch a button on the control panel you get one to four pages of mostly useless information printed with YOUR expensive paper and ink.If you're looking for a printer that EASILY allows you to print and scan from a mobile device or laptop without a network - keep looking because HP doesn't appear to actually make one.
1,Came with no ink
1,The printer didn’t work
1,No me agrado
1,nothing.
1,HP DeskJet 3755 All-in-One Printer is a piece of JUNK - it has never worked and HP does not take responsibility for it. I asked to have it replaced while still under warranty you refused and now I am out of warranty you simply don't care - PIECE OF JUNK you should be ashamed of yourselves - loose face like this over a retail product that is under $100?? Why just not send a refurbished replacement and keep your customer happy?? You are the worst company - never buying an HP product again.
1,I bought this printer new about 14 months ago. Connectivity problems have been constant. At least every week or two the printer goes offline.HP support which has also been terrible now informs me that since one year has passed since the purchase I can’t get free support anymore.My wife and I are seniors and “technologically challenged”. I finally figured out that I could connect it to my computer with a USB cordinstead of the Wi-Fi that HP recommends and I think that has fixed the problem. Dealing with this printer has been more frustrating thanall of the computers and peripheral devices that I have ever owned combined.
3,Okay you wanted me to write a review on Amazon although I bought my printer HP Desk Jet 3700 All in One Series which I cannot find on here. So I’m writing here because it looks exactly like the one I purchased for $39 on sale at Walmart. Here’s the problem I have printer scanner copier works fine I do not like the fact I have to go to 30 different sites to set up all functions leaving me feeling rather vulnerable to hackers as I’m needing to log into all these different websites.  Why did your company do that?  Until I poked around myself because I shut all your sites down & while attached to them/you if I tried to print the letters were about 2” tall and it only printed in the middle section of a sheet of paper causing 20+ sheets being printed on instead of the 1 that was needed. As I stated I shut your websites down got a double ended usb connector from Amazon and just plugged into the back and I run everything manually.  No need to worry about getting phished/hacked/identity stolen etc.  I recommend your company use 1 website to configure these printers I haven’t reviewed the others but I’m assuming they are all handled the same.  Best of luck and I hope nothing happens to anyone and your company gets sued because of this madness you’ve created.
1,this is the first wireless printer for me and the last. This is the worst printer I've ever had. I got it at Walmart not Amazon.Starting off there is NO HP support for this printer no instructions come with it and the ones online are line pictures taht are indecipherable.It has  a ink subscription program that I COULDN'T SIGN UP FOR and security features in the app that I couldn't use! It kept saying I had entered the wrong password WHEN I HADN"T ERGISTERED ONE YET. I fo0llowed the "instuctions" on the printout a dozen times and couldn't do any of these things. It wouldn't work on USB but thankfully  did work on wireless just fine FOR WHILE. All I used it for was printing ebay labels and that lasted about 6 months and then every time I went to printd something I had to mess with it for a half hour. I uninstalled the wireless part and went wired with it and it worked ONE TIME FOR A COUPLE LABELS but next time it doesn't work again.  now  it won't work because of something else. now it is ALWAYS something and it never prints when I send a file to print.  NOT ONLY THAT but It comes with NO instructions there are none at HP ANDI'VE NEVER FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE THE SCANNER OR EVEN WHERE TO PUT THE EFFING PAPER INI TO SCAN BECUAE ALL THERE IS ANYWHERE for instructions for this is TINY line drawings of the printer that dont show what is the front or back. so I tried both front and back and Nada nothing zilch fuggedaboutit. Honestly I don't think this POS is even a scanner I think it is an effing BS ripoff scam through and through.all my other HP  printers in the past all the basic $30 models' lasted for three years and then quit working all together. That's even true for the USED One I got from my brother that he'd all ready had for a few years. It was the best one. But This POS didn't last a year.
1,OMG!! This stupid printer will NOT connect to my wi-fi AT ALLLL!! I have troubleshooted everything!! I have googled it I have wasted over 30 sheets of paper of printouts saying its not connected. The printout instructions give little to NO help in how to connect the Dumb device. All it has to show that the printer is connected is a real tiny tiny tiny dotted light next to the buttons that blink non stop which I assume it is trying to connect??? I don't know what it is doing I have spent HOURS trying to connect it tried unplugging and plugging back in--this printer SUCKS!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!! IT DOES NOT WORK!!! I have wasted paper and time on a cute little dumb printer that does not work!!! Don't waste your time find something better.
1,Other than the annoying online/offline messages we get when trying to print things I get an email warning me that if I don't update a payment method for the free ink cartridges I got with the printer they will basically shut my printer down. This was confirmed by many other customers complaining that if they tried buying cartridges from anyone but the HP subscription their printers refused to work. Their is also talks of a class-action because of this. Overall I want a new printer.
1,I printed exactly one page and now it won't connect to my network. Power cycled the router the printer ran the trouble shooter... Nothing. HP trouble shooting doesn't even recognize it. Total garbage. The one page that printed took 10 minutes for one page. Useless.
1,I'm a very computer savvy user and spent a good hour+ trying to connect this so my wireless network using 5 different techniques.  It kept printing out unhelpful quick start guides that were 3 pages each and the printing was like a root canal.  Yes it's small and inexpensive but we returned ours after a few hours.
3,Scanner will not feed properly.  I have to push-feed the paper to get it started and then the left side stops pulling so it doesn't scan properly. Basically you get a reasonable quality albeit slow printer and that's about it. Scanner is not functional.
1,If you pause your ink renewal they basically lock up the printer not allowing you to print with the ink you already have. This on top of the fact that the results are less than clear makes this printer a complete waste of money.
1,It's cheap and easy to print when it's connected as wifi direct. That said once HP can't connect to the printer after a while they essentially block your printing until you get the printer connected to your wifi. This took about 9 months for HP instant ink to block my printing. Connecting to any wifi access was not an easy task. After 3 hours of trying reading every how to instruction and watching all the videos on how to connect to my wifi I decided that beating it with a hammer felt better. In fact it felt amazing!! I will now be on the lookout for a home printer that is not HP.
1,This was so difficult to connect. I got it because I am a college student and was looking for something small and simple. This was definitely not simple. I had 5 people try to help me connect this and we all were unable to do so. please do not get it.
1,This printer will not work if you turn it off at any point. If you leave it plugged in and on all the time then it may work for you if you also leave your computer on as well. If you turn them off at any point and then turn them back on then you have to uninstall and reinstall the driver EVERY SINGLE TIME. This is literally the worst printer ever and a waste of money. Trust the reviews there's a reason that Amazon's rating of this has 28% 1 star reviews. it's garbage.I'd give it zero stars if I could.
1,I appreciated the scan options and the small footprint. It took a while to set-up connecting to the computer and such. It has (or had) an auto order for ink (never used) a remote email-to-print option and a print from the phone option.I the absolute failure now after about a year the printer DOES NOT APPEAR when trying to print pdfs. It appears in web printing and in some other applications. I tried uninstalls and re-installs for Adobe and the Printers... just too much hassle...
1,Worst printer I have ever owned by a large margin.  The paper feeder is so finicky you have to babysit every print and almost always redo as the paper feeder either spins or jams.  HP should be embarrassed by this unit.  As soon as the ink runs out I am smashing this unit on my driveway to alleviate the frustration and buying something else.
1,Hp will not let you reuse cartridges and force you to buy their overpriced ones.  Isn't this a scam? Unfortunately I realized this past the return date and have to through away the printer into the dumpster. Not buying any products from HP every again.
1,Would not recommend.  Printed two pages and it ran out of ink.
1,DOES NOT WORK DO NOT BUY!
5,I like the light weight very nice printer pretty  nice quality
5,Great print with easy setups and helpful app options
5,Very simple and modern printer with the usual features.  Great buy.
5,So far it is great. Wifi connected and sits in a very small space. Minimal documentation came with it that posed a few issues.
5,Very easy to hook up I just plugged in the power and USB cable rebooted my computer and it was working.
5,Love the compact size takes up very little space .Print quality is spot on especially for the price point!
5,at first I was having issues when I was trying to set everything up and it kept reading an error code so I thought it was gonna be a waste of money but hp fixed my problem and I use it every single day. I love it and it's worth the money. Quality is great and it's perfect for people like me who don't have lots of space for a huge fancy expensive printer.
4,Please do yourself a favor and google how to set up this printer. Then watch videos. It wasn't easy at least for the chromebook. I thought I may throw the printer against the wall. But alas youtube saved the day.Good luck to any who attempts to set this up with a chromebook. It isn't easy.
4,So far it is good Hoping it will last for a long time
