5,She needed it you got it to her. The right product right on time!
4,Perfect
5,Inicially  I gravitated towards purchasing the cheapest one but then I compared how they're made and this particular one is made with Much better Quality materials.  It was a couple more dollars but well worth.
3,I bought this in June and it died in late September. For the time it did work it was fine. When the seller saw my original review of this product (this review is a revision) they reached out promptly and when they found out I had to replace it right away with another product they gladly refunded my money. Based on their handling of this situation I would gladly do business with them again.
5,Works well little light is useful to tell if it's plugged in.
5,Love this product. It was actually longer than the original and worked perfect as an replacement for the cord that my son lost that was for school
5,Charger broke had to get a new one so I don’t have to pay $50
5,Good product as advertised
4,Was able to use this one time.  It worked fine.  Next time I used it it didn't work. They worked with me and sent me a new one and it is working great.
5,My son lost his chromebook charger for the school's chromebook. The school said it would cost $35 to replace. Definitely not paying that when they are half that price on Amazon. He turned it in at the end of the school year so hopefully it works great for the next kid that gets it.
4,The first one broke randomly with little use but customer service was excellent and they replaced it with one that has lasted much longer and works great.
3,Broke within a few weeks of having it exchanged it it broke again. Not worth it.
3,Lasted five months. From reading the reviews I guess I should consider myself lucky.Update: Seller did contact me and offered to send a replacement.
4,Nice replacement. Works perfect for my daughters chromebook.
5,Perfect replacement!
5,what more is there to say
4,OK I assumed a USB-C would charge no matter how it was plugged in. This one only works in one position so I painted the 'Up' side with a gold Sharpie and Im good to go. Also wish they had added a velcro starp for the cable no big deal shipping was fast and the Xformer charges very well. not bothering to exchange it. Oh the cable itself is extremely stiff and hard to wrap nicely.
5,Works perfect for my kids samsung tablets great cord length.
4,Update on 7/26/21: After I posted my initial review the company contacted me and offered to ship me a new one to replace the faulty charger. It arrived quickly within a few days and so far it's working flawlessly.Can't vouch for the quality since only time will tell how long the replacement unit will last but I have to give them credit for their customer service and very positive experience in making sure that my needs were met here.------------------------[Original review]Bought this for my Asus Chromebook. After 2 months it has stopped working. Would not recommend.
4,Update- the company made it right by contacting me and sending a new one. I haven’t tried it yet but the customer service team immediately sent a new one.This worked fine but for only 2 months. It just stopped working. It’s of course past the return window.
5,My daughter needed for her school laptop.
5,Fast quick charge
5,My son lost his charger for the 3rd time to his school Chromebook. This one seems to work great so far. No issues. Charges at a good rate.
5,This charger is still going strong and is super quick with charging. Love the long cord because now I can use it while playing my oculus quest without difficulty.
2,Had this cord for a month and it worked great until it didn't at all. Didn't last long and I wish it had because other than that it worked really well.
5,Delivered quickly works with HP Chromebook.
5,I've gone threw so many if these types of cords for my chrom book it's ridiculous as they burn out in a week So far fingers crossed it still works. If it stops I will write a addendum to this review
5,Works great with school issued Chromebook
2,I bought this charger not too long ago and it's already starting to go out. It no longer charges my computer or phone unless it's in a specific position and even then it doesn't charge long. I'm pretty disappointed because I've only had this charger about 2 months.
5,It charges my chromebooks and phones.
4,Just Wow. Customer service was awesome! so niceEdit: Update the charger is not durable tbh but then again might be because of my mishandling
5,Bought to charge my android phone as it has type C and others just wouldn't charge it good enough. This super charges it as my phone has that option equipped already just needed the charger to do it. Happy because it actually holds the charge. Thank u!!UPDATE: IT IS NO LONGER WORKING AFTER EXCATLY ONE MONTH!!! Used it for every couple of days and for a android at that. A smaller device then this supposed to be used for. So while it did do great for the whole month while it lasted and is dea good quick fix. You could definitely spend that+little more from HP or Chrombook with warranty. That is what I am doing. Lesson learned!
5,I got a laptop from the pawn shop and the charger that came with it was damaged and would not charge do when I got this charger and it only took a few hours to charge I was very happy as now I can take this laptop with me on the road. The cord length is perfect. All in all I'm real happy with the item.
3,Adding an update to my review I had boxed this up ready to return it and because of who I am as a person it sat on my counter for about a week and a half. Finally I remembered it and decided to give it another try before returning it. And the thing worked! I don’t know what changed or why it decided to start working but hopefully it keeps working. At this point I plan on keeping it and hoping for the best. I’ll update if it stops working again. For the price I guess I can’t complain too much but next time I’ll probably just spend the money on a better charger.Previous review:Don’t buy this charger! It did not work! I plugged it into my laptop and the charging light never came on. I tried moving the charger around unplugged it and plugged it back in and got nothing! Let it sit plugged in for a while just in case and it never charged. Don’t waste your time or money on this.
5,All of our chargers for our androids/tablets and computers have USB-C inputs and they all stop working within a couple months. THIS CHARGER IS THE BEST! Having a little larger charger but knowing I can rely on it is 100% worth it to me. I've had this for a while and it's charged my daughters Chromebook our Galaxy phones our Samsung tablet etc etc. Excellent!
5,Needed and new one.. to work out an issue with the computer.
5,Exactly what I needed and exactly as advertised.
5,Good product. Did what was needed. Would buy again
5,works great
5,I bought this charger for my sister’s laptop so that she can bring it to school.
4,Funciona igual que el original
5,It works great on my daughter’s chrome book! I is very sturdy and reliable. I’m 100% satisfied with this product. I saw some bad reviews on the adapter and after using it for a month I found it to be a really nice quality replacement for the original adapter.Update: 3 months of use and still working and looking like new! My daughter uses this for homeschool. Did I mention that she’s 7 years old and destroys everything?!? This adapter has been through hell and back! Lol Again don’t listen to the bad reviews. 🙃🙂 The factory adapter couldn’t survive two weeks of the wrath of my child. Lol
5,I like how the charger connects to my computer very solid.
5,Perfect
5,Has worked perfectly fine with several laptops Chromebooks and tablets that require USB-C connection.
2,The product quit working right after the time to send it back was closed think twice before buying this product.
2,It’s exactly what I ordered but doesn’t last long 2nd one in a year and I need a third now….
3,Worked well but didn't last long. This may be due to heavier than normal cord manipulation it doubled as a phone charger.
5,I only have it a short while
5,Worked great while it worked. Only lasted about 2.5 months then cord casing began to wear away and a short develop and stopped charging.
2,Less than 2 months after purchasing the connection of the cord to the USBC tip is crapping out (see photo). Will only charge if I am pushing the wire into the base of the connector tip and holding pressure.  I have troubleshooted to be certain the issue is not with the charger port on my device.  It is definitely the cord.  The weakness can be felt though the outer casing.Disappointed to say the least.
4,Working great. School sent my child home with laptop and charger for virtual learning. The charger the school sent would not work unless you stood on one leg twirled and prayed to the gods. Joking but it didn't work as intended. Ordered this charger and it was a perfect match and works great.
1,A 30 day return window for electronics is criminal!After only 8 weeks this garbage product started giving me trouble having to fiddle around with the cord to get it to charge. By 4 months DEAD.The charging port on my laptop is TOASTED. I don't want to even imagine the damage this garbage charger has done.It's not an expensive charger but if it can't do the only job it's required to longer than 60 days?? But even if it were FREE it's not worth the risk of damaging a laptop that cost hundreds or more.
5,As I've only had for 2 weeks cannot comment on the durability which was a Feature question.
5,Charges my laptop and cell very fast def worth the size
5,Broke the end off of my new Chromebook charger and of course none of my other chargers are compatable - bought this as it said it was a direct replacement and after a week it certainly appears to be. I just plugged it in and I'm back in business - I left the durability question unanswered right now as it is too early to know that - my original charger did not last long so hopefully this is better. But for a very fair price and no problems with compatability I am very pleased so far...
4,Works well.
3,My grandson uses this for his Acer Chrome book. Loved the chord length.  But last night the small bottom part was gone...dunno if it fell out or what.  Have to reorder today . But I thought it was a great item for the price.
5,Buena longitud poco tiempo de carga.
3,Product charger my HP chrome book just fine for about 2 weeks. Now it will no longer keep up with the computer if I have it plugged in and using it.  My phone charger charges the laptop faster.
3,Unfortunately this stopped working a few months after purchase.
3,Charger was fine but then randomly stopped  working after about 3 months…do not waste money on this product get a name brand charger
2,Frayed at both connection points within 6 months from normal ware and tare use.
5,The charger stopped working after 4 months. However this American based company has amazing warranty. I emailed them and indicated that the device was not working they replied back immediately and resolved the issue by sending out a new device. They're very helpful and stand behind her along warranty so it's definitely worth purchasing this device.
4,This was a great charger for the short time I had it before my puppy chewed it lol. It seemed like good quality but my 8 week puppy chewed right threw it in seconds (almost entirely my fault). Other than that it charged great and worked for my HP chrome book.
5,Purchased this as an extra for my sons chrome book for school so he has one for home and one for school since they are doing hybrid with Covid.  So happy I did so I know he can always charge his computer.  The cost is very reasonable and it doesn’t run warm ever.
1,It's a month old and it stopped working.  Incredibly disappointed in the quality of this.  I tried it on several other devices and it was dead.  Don't buy this one.
5,I was needing a replacement order for my nieces Chromebook for virtual learning for school. this works great. I went shopping around at Walmart could not find the correct order. I'm so happy to look on Amazon to find this product for a low price.  Works great!🎉🙌
5,Works good but missed a piece
3,It worked! My babygirl has her laptop back up and running again!
4,Product worked exactly as it should
1,Check he Watts & voltage on Chromebook & laptops before purchasing any adapter. This is not made for Chromebook 14-ca137nr In the details it says 45W but didn't realize until after my chromebook shut off & stopped working that it was really a 65W. They're basically advertising 2 different Watts  & in the detailed description it specifically says 45W but they send a 65W adapter so it's going to fry your laptop if it only goes up to 45W because the adapter is too high in Watts. Whoever makes the details for this item should be put in check & learn details before advertising false details
5,Great little replacement cord.
5,We needed a replacement charger for my daughter's computer and purchased this one because of the good price point. It worked great until a couple of months after we got it the metal usb tip broke off. I got in touch with customer service and they sent a replacement charger the very next day. Very satisfied! Thank you!
1,I bought two of these in March of this year. They were great at first but both completely stopped working by the end of May. I tested them again today with multiple devices (two different phones two different laptops) just in case it was a fluke when we were trying before... nothing.Seems like a lot of other people have had positive experiences and if it were just one I'd chalk it up to a lemon. But two failing after such a short time? I'll be looking elsewhere for replacements.
2,I never write reviews but I am extremely disappointed in this product. This is the second charger I have bought from this company and now it is going out for a third time. This is within a timespan since the beginning of COVID (April 2020). Chargers should not have to be replaced every 4-6 mo. I will now seek a different seller and I would recommend you do too unless you want to have to repurchase in a couple months.
3,It was great while it lasted until it didn't.
5,Substitute for a Chromebook charger.  Was not expensive.  Worked fine until it suddenly did not 6 months after buying. Contacted seller with picture of defective unit and it was replaced immediately.  Alice is a nice customer representative.
4,Only worked for 30 days 👎🏽*update - The seller's did ship me out a new one right away. It has been a couple months now. The new one works just fine.
2,Purchased August 10 2021 for my ASUS Chromebook. Worked wonderfully until now. Showing "low-power charge" It will no longer charge my device while in use. This should not happen in such a short time. I have tried flipping the plug using another outlet. The same result. I am very disappointed.
4,We lost  one of our chrome book charger chords this works perfectly
5,Thanks
2,This unit works well as a charger but if you have any kind of AM or shortwave radio you like to listen too this unit will create hideous noise in your speakers. I tried several filters. They didnt phase the noise at all. Avoid this one.
5,Was hoping I ordered the correct core after my bunny decided to bite my cord😒😒. Perfect match and it charged it very quickly
5,Laptop
5,Works great and same as the original! Pricepoint can't go wrong !
5,The adapter that came with my Chromebook all of a sudden stopped working.  This adapter works perfectly and I don't get a "low powered charger" message.
1,Purchased two of these power supplies and both were dead within 6 months.  Total garbage.
2,Died completely after a little less than 3 months.
5,Use to charge phone and laptop.worls well.
4,Ok
5,Good deal on a charger. I have had it for about 2 months. No issues to date with it. Seller has even followed up to make sure everything was good.
5,Somehow my cord for my chrome book went missing.  This was inexpensive and is a perfect replacement.  Cord has great length and charges it up quickly.  Very happy!
5,It keeps have shortages some times it charges and Sometimes it doesn't I only had it a month todayI am so happy the company has sent me an replacement for the charger it work perfect thank you soo much for the charger and it got to me within a couple of days.
1,Second purchase from this seller. The seller advised me that the power adapter had an 18 month warranty. Fast forward less than 4 months later and product is not working. Made contact with seller to see best possible outcome to use warranty. Seller now advises that they are unable to honor warranty because "Amazon won't allow them to." If this were the case I'm pretty positive they knew this prior to offering it to me. But Amazon will allow them to offer me a 5% discount. I could use the discount to purchase a new cable but the principle of the matter is what's important to me. I will NEVER purchase from this seller again. They are selling defective merchandise to get and retain customers.
4,Perfect fit
5,Great fit to my chrome book when I accidentally threw out my charger 🙃Get value great cord length and thank you Amazon for the delivery time .
1,This stopped working conveniently right after the return window closed. I know for certain becuase my standard charger still charges my computer and this one (which did for a month) doesn't any more. No damage was just left in my office as a backup. Wish I could return it...
5,This is the second charger I have purchased. Great chargers.  Both of my kids missed placed their chargers at different times. They both came in one day each time! Thank you for the speedy delivery!
5,Good replacement product delivered on time works well. Just what our school needed for replacing lost or damaged factory chargers (factory chargers are poorer quality than this one).
2,The end plug seperated from rest of cord wire exposed after 4 days from receiving it. I was really bummed for 19.00
5,Works great on son’s HP chromebook.
4,Shipping was quick. No issues
1,The charger was working perfectly fine. The length was great and everything. And then out of nowhere it stopped working. 🤷🏽‍♀️
1,Had this for 6 months and it simply stopped charging. Worked well before that. No damage to the chord at all. Beware.
5,I bought this for my samsung laptop and my samsung phone for charging them up. This is the best and fastest Charger I have ever used before. I love it
5,Purchased as a backup for our son's Chromebook.  Works perfectly and we use it to charge other devices in our home.
5,It’s the perfect replacement for my daughters computer. I will always shop with this company if any of my other electronics chargers burn out . You have a customer for life
1,Completely stopped working a month later. Don't waste your money.
1,I got it for my sons chrome book and at first it worked amazing but after 2 days of use it kicked the bucket
5,I like that it works simply put.
5,Just a regular charger my work laptop charger my son destroyed found this one on amazon for a good price.. basically for the laptop I have. I ordered it got here a day later and that was 3 months ago still working great! Thanks!
5,I got this charging adapter for my daughter after she misplaced hers for her school issued Chromebook and I have no problems with it. It keeps her book charged and that is appreciated!
1,I don't even travel much with this cable and I mostly used it at home....and it stopped charging all of a sudden. I bought this in April and now it's only June. I contacted Amazon for a replacement but they said the return window has closed and there's nothing they can do? Oh well I guess I just wasted my money the faulty charger 🥲
1,the tip wore out in 3 months and wont consistently charge my devices
4,Works great with my laptop.
2,This charger worked great...until it didn't. Died sometime between 3 and 4 Months. It worked fine for daily use up until that time and was moved from room to room fairly frequently. Your mileage may vary. I'll be considering other brands as a replacement.
5,My daughter's Chromebook charger stopped working and I was able to get this the next day.  Worked perfectly!  The prime shipping was very convenient.
5,I purchased an extra cord for my  ganddaughter's chrome book so that she didn't have to worry about forgetting it at her home when she came to my home.  It works perfectly.
1,This charger only lasted a month & a half before it stopped working.  Garbage….
5,solve the issue charged chrome book like original charger
3,worried a little since the box transformer gets hot - unexpectedly
2,Product worked for approximately 2 weeks
5,I ordered this charger as a replacement for one that my kid broke. It matched the details in the description and was perfect.  The seller even followed up to make sure everything was satisfactory. I will definitely order from here again if needed.
1,I ordered this in May and it has already stopped working... very disappointed and now I'm unable to return.
5,My daughter lost her charger for her school chrome book. This worked out great as a replacement for at home.
5,Original charger died and Best Buy’s cord was $80!! Great value here
3,Have not had it for long and it already has a short in.
5,Met expectations. Provides plenty of wire to do work on tables/desks that are too far away from the only outlet in the room. Lightweight versatile fast charger. Nice!
5,Buena inversión
1,After a few weeks of use the cord completely stopped charging my chromebook
1,Return window ended: July 18 2022 Stopped working: July 20 2022. UPDATE: I bought 2 just in case. The 2nd one died after 2 days. BEWARE!!!!
5,So far the charger is pretty good had it for about a month now. I try not to ne it much like i did with the other one that's how they stop working
4,It works perfectly. Very quick charges
3,I dislike this item because it is a cheap item this charger stop working a couple of weeks after I brought it
5,Great replacement for my chrome book charger!! And 1/2 the price!
5,I use it my kids computer when they can't seems to find their for school. It's a good back up to have.
1,I didn't think to write a review on this item because until today: it worked fine. That being said I smelt a horrible nickle like smell and couldn't place it then I looked at my laptop battery and it was sparking! I was so grateful I was awake when it happened - I immediately unplugged it and wrote this review.
5,Exactly what I've been looking for at a good cost for my chromebook.  It doesn't give me the 'slow charger/low capacity charger connected' error that all the others I've tried have.  Works great charges my 14 inch HP Chromebook from zero in about an hour and a half to 100%.
2,UPDATE - Seller responded to my review and offered to replace the broken charger; the replacement has worked perfectly and I haven’t even noticed it getting hot.Worked for month before it broke a week after the return window closed. Very cheap quality got very hot while charging. Would not recommend definitely save money in the long run by buying a genuine manufacturer’s charger. Lesson learned.
4,Arrived on time and fits the chrome book as it indicated.
5,Works very well I like it.
5,My daughter misplaced her chrome book cord from school. This replacement arrived quickly and functions well so not to delay any assignments.
5,This is a high quality adapter and it has a right-angle plug at the computer end which I like.  Being a USB-C plug it can be inserted with the right angle facing forward or backwards so that is convenient also.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
5,I had lost my power supply for my chromebook.. and I found this one after much searching it is great the right one and it arrived in two days.. and works great.. Thank you...
5,Arrive quickly to replace the charger my son misplaced to his chrome book. Charger works as good as the original.
5,Gave it to my daughter a month ago. she disappeared into her cave of a room and I haven't seen her much since! all good! Lol oh she would have let me know if it wasn't trust me
2,This cord worked well for all of a month then decided to just die. No warning no wire messes no bite marks. Just dead.
4,Great charger nice quality it just makes the computer really hot while charging.
5,its a good charger for the price. havent had any issues so far. charges just like the original one.
5,I ordered for a replacement to the one that broke very good price
3,Stopped working with our chrome book  after 5 months. Disappointing
5,Fits my daughter’s chrome book and works as expected.
1,Not happy.  Just after the 90 days the charger went belly up.  The green light is still on the power inverter but does not charge Chromebook.  So am going to have to buy a new one.
5,I like that the seller showed pictures of the plug  It made it easy for me to pick the right plug
4,Sad that it only fits one way with an elbow turn that blocks other ports. But it works great.
5,We misplaced the original plug and bought this one. We find it works just as good as the OME.
5,Works perfectly! Price is great considering how often I need to buy to replace when the bunnies sneakily get ahold of one!
5,Being in the IT industry I expect it to work this does. My daughters school chromebook detected the AC Adapter immediately and started to do what its suppose to. I wouldnt hesitate ordering from this company again.
4,It broke in two weeks.
5,Product was well described and work perfect for my Chromebook
5,My granddaughter lost her charger to her school chrome book... this worked perfectly...

5,Less expensive than original replacement and just as good.
5,It fit my daughter's HP laptop perfectly. I am completely satisfied with the quality of this product and would definitely buy from this seller again!
5,Fast shipping item as described. Works great.
5,It arrived fast and works great
1,Everything was fine until it wasn't. This product no longer charges my laptop or phone. For the price I did not expect it to last a decade but this broke after just one month. I could never recomend this product when there are others of an equivalent price and function.
1,I liked this charger for the first few months. I purchased it in Feb of 2022 but now it has already stopped working. Overall a disappointing experience.
1,Plugged it into my laptop. 10 minutes later it stopped charging. I unplugged everything. Waited for 1/2 hour and plugged into my laptop again still didn't work.Didn't even get to fully charge my laptop!!
5,Charges the Chromebook great. Can't travel with it unless there is a wall port to plug into. Great buy.
5,Works great. Good value for the money
5,Product is a great value
4,Charge laptop
5,Perfect perfect size and it work good
5,Worked great for my son’s chrome book no slow charge or anything
5,It didn’t even work
1,This charger lasted for less than a month and stopped working. The light is on but it is not connecting. Luckily I had an old USB from my Samsung 10 that I could use but it takes 12 hours to charge.Total waste of money!
5,Worked as advertised as a replacement for an original.
1,Read reviews took a chance - ordered 2 as backups.  Quit working within 1 month used maybe twice as a secondary cord
5,Works like a charm!
5,Works as expected
1,Worked great at first. About 4 months in started working intermittently then a few days later it died. Disappointed
5,Great product!
5,Works great.
5,Works fine on HP Chrome Book. No overheating.
2,Within a month of purchase  the wires at the connector had separated from the connector and no longer charged my device. It worked as it should up until that time  2 stars because I have to buy another so soon.
5,This is was the perfect replacement for my HP Chromebook charger that had stopped working.
1,After 3months of use just burned out 2 Chromebooks this week :(When we needed a new charger for our school issued Chromebooks our school told us they didn't have any in stock and had me buy this replacement charger from Amazon. It worked until last week when it fried out my sons Chromebook. (Will not charge will not to boot will not turn on-completely dead; fried!) Then my daughter took the charger today (unknowingly) to use for her Chromebook and now we have 2 fried Chromebooks.Very disappointed customer.
5,Great charger exactly what i needed
5,Just what I needed. Thanks.
5,Works great
2,This product didn't even last me a month. The wire that connects to the pluging part where it plugs into your phone or computer is starting to separate. Also the wires in there dont connect to the plug in anymore and don't charge. Awful. Better off with a wireless charger
5,Product works very well.
5,Shipped fast and works perfect
5,It works
1,Cords are breaking at the base of the cord and failing to charge. Used less than 9 months.
1,It charger really fast until it broke and I liked it enough to write it off and get another but accidentally bought 2 instead. I keeped the 2 bc I thought I would find a use for the extra one. Those broke as well which makes 3 that broke I wasn't rough with any of them in the slightest nor did I travel with them. So idk if you should buy it and test your luck but I'm not probably buying another one.

5,Very good product
5,Great product.
2,literally bought this like 2 months ago and its already broken. Its not even a broken wire or anything it just will not charge anymore at all thing sucks don't buy
5,Got for an HP spectre laptop. Works great. Gets hot but so did the original. Appreciate the significant savings!
2,I needed a new computer charger. This one worked great for about 2 weeks and then it stopped working all together. Now i had to go buy another charger and this one just sits in a drawer
5,Great product seller had great communication
5,excellent replacement for stolen original charger. thank you so much!
1,This was a great buy until it stopped working after 4 months. We did not overuse it didn't plug it in more than once every other day. No consumer support due to date of purchase!
5,Needed a replacement charger for my daughter's lab top and it worked great
5,Worked fantastic for my sons chromebook Highly recommend
5,Product is good.
2,We only had this charger for about 8 weeks before it stopped working.  We used it a couple times a week so it was maybe used 16-20 times before it stopped charging our Chromebook.
1,I have replace this charger three times this school year and getting ready to go to BestBuy to purchased number 4.
5,great
5,Great value for the money works as advertised.
5,Needed this for home schooling. Was able to get quickly.
5,came quickly and works great!
2,So this charger is a cheap and affordable chromebook charger but this charger is cheap. My chromebook does call for a 45w charger. However this charger gets extremely hot during charging. It has not caught fire but it did give me a second degree burn on my leg. I fell asleep doing homework and never realized how hit it actually got. Buyers beware!
1,I wanted to like this but unfortunately the quality really sucks. It broke within months of the purchase I thought mine was faulty so I ordered multiple times. They all broke within a few months (3months). Unless you want to be constantly buying chargers ho with something higher quality.
5,Fits my HP Chromebook perfectly and it charges great!
5,NA
1,Worked for my chromebook BUT only for about 5.5 months. Delivered on 20 July 2021 stopped working on 7 Jan. 2022. Definitely will spend the money for a name brand charger now that I have to replace this one.
2,I purchased the item in May 2020 and Oct 2020 the item no longer works.  Great price but the item did not last one year.  Wish it had a 1 year warranty only 30 days.  ARGH!!
5,Quick ship time.  Works perfectly
5,Works great for my Chromebook!
5,Great deal
5,Been using this everyday with my HP x360 Chromebook without any issues.
5,Works for my google chrome book!
5,It worked for me.
5,Works great
5,my old charger quit working. this fit perfectly and charges my chromebook
5,This adapter was perfectly compatible with my HP convertible laptop.
5,Great replacement laptop charger.
1,It worked great while when we first bought it.  Then it stopped working in less than two weeks.
1,Worked for a couple months then it stopped and blew out my hp laptop on it's way out.  Had to send my laptop to northridgefix to repair/replace the USB C controller chip.  Cost $300 to repair.
1,I have bought this charger twice and each time it has not lasted longer than a month. The original one that came with my Chromebook lasted for two years. This charger has terrible quality do not expect it to last more than a month. 0/0 stars. My child that has to do online school will have to use her phone in the meanwhile because this charger has let us down once again. I repeat DO NOT BUY it will not last.
5,Great product!
5,Accurate description and quick delivery.
5,Perfect fit
5,The price is right!
2,This charger does not last. This is the second first time lasted a month  time I rebought this charger and it needs to be replaced because it broken there must be some cheap about it.

5,Replace broken USB Connector
5,Fast shipping good product.
5,Received quickly and it was exactly what we needed!
5,Charger works good and at a good price.
1,So I bought the charger because the original charger for my chromebook had finally stopped working. Not even a week in of having the new one does the metal tip break off completely resulting in me having to use an old phone charger to keep the computer charged up enough
2,I purchased on July 23 2020 and it stopped charging on September 11 2020. This is the second charger which experienced the same problem as the first. Please don't buy this charger. It's not a reliable.
2,Bought this as a replacement for my chromebook charger that stopped working.. less than 2 months of having this charger it completely stopped charging my chromebook.
2,This product stop working after 2 months
5,We use this product as a charger for a laptop computer.

5,Fast delivery and works great
5,Thanks!!!
5,Works great. Just like it should to charge a chromebook.
5,Replaced a damaged cord.  No further.commemt needed.
5,Great product fast shipping
5,Exactly as described.
2,Don’t waste your money! This charger didn’t last long at all. Such a disappointment.
1,...Like others here it stopped working much too fast however it also messed up two devices I had plugged into it. I didn't realize until it was too late and plugged a 2nd thing in testing why it wasn't working. Incredibly disappointed that I even tried this charger.
5,Fit chromebook as stated.
1,Very upset. First stopped working right AFTER the return date.Call and deal with Amazon customer service. Was told they would honor a one time replacement and that they could not reach the vendor.2nd has done the SAME THING!Don't buy. It gives out about a month after receiving.
5,Exactly what I needed
5,Does the job...
2,Didn't even last me 3 months no longer charges my chromebook laptop
2,Worked for 2 months then didn't anymore. :(
5,Very Good charger.. Must Buy!!
5,Na
5,Just as expected
5,Exactly what I needed and delivered swiftly with great service.
1,So I brought this charger in June and it worked for a little bit and it’s October and it completely doesn’t work any more!UPDATE: I was able to get into contact with the company and they were able to help me and send me a replacement right away didn’t have to pay for another charger thank God and I am so grateful and so happy with the company thank you so much!!
2,Kids broke it in under a week
5,Works great. Fits perfectly
2,Lasted right at a month. Not working and the return window passed yesterday.
1,Quit charging an acer chrome book after 5 months.Strangely it will still charge a usb-c kindle fire tablet.I purchased 2 of these so the kids wouldn't have to carry the chargers between houses.Wondering how much longer the second one will last.No issue with the factory chargers.Would not recomend
2,Worked for about a month and then stopped working!
5,Arrived on time and exactly as described
1,Unfortunately it only lasted a week before it stopped working
1,Got this for my chrome book worked fine at first then just stopped working after about a week. No sign that power was even going through it after it broke
2,It does not charge the chromebook!!!
1,Worked great for a month.  Then just stopped charging
1,Only had it a month it stopped working won't charge laptop
1,Of course our new puppy would eat the charging cable to my son’s Chromebook. So I ordered this charger which arrived quickly but it stopped charging his Chromeboook after just 1 week!!! Huge waste of time and money. Spending the extra $10 and ordering the Lenovo brand name charger this time around!
2,Stopped working after a few months. Won't by again
1,Quit working at almost exactly just past the 6 month product support window deadline. Do yourself a favor and buy a little better quality one or you could be buying another one of these in 6 months
5,Works well.  No issues so far
1,It already stopped working and I have only had it barely 5 months. So I guess it is not something to invest in unless you wanna buy multiple a year. Normal usage. No wear and tear visible. Just stopped workinf and I tried multiple outlets.
2,Worked great since buying a month and a half ago then abruptly stopped charging few days ago.
5,Durable.
5,Perfect and shipped fast!
1,stopped working in 3 days. Returning.
1,The product worked great for two days now it won't charge anything.
5,Fast shipping
5,As expected
1,Only worked for a few months and then stopped.
1,This worked for exactly 1 weekend. It hasn't worked since.
1,Very surprised this item is already toast!! Wasn't used improperly.. not used much at all actually!! Received it on July 29th and by August the 8th.. dead!!
1,As mentioned above the product was great out of the box but 3 months later it conked out. It's been plugged into the same outlet the entire time not being moved or yanked or majorly jostled at all but its not working anymore. don't buy this product save your money.
5,Awesome
1,I bought this as a replacement charger for my son’s chrome book on June 5 and barely 2 1/2 months later it will no longer charge it.  The one that came with his chrome book lasted 2 years and this one didn’t even make it 3 months.  And of course it’s to late to return it.
5,type c plug inserts either way
1,Stopped working after 6 weeks. Purchased end of Oct.  Dead by Dec.
5,No issues
2,This charger stopped working after 4 months!! Waste of money
1,Literally stopped working after an hour of charging my laptop. Not even worth the money. Id rather buy the brand name one for my hp.
1,I have had this charger for 33 days and it stopped working 2 days ago! Find a different seller and/or brand! Not worth spending this much for only a months worth of use (and not even daily use).
1,I bought this is mid-September and it has already stopped working.  Don't waste your money.
5,Worked perfectly quick shipping!
1,I purchased this charger and stop working after 40 days I tried to get a replacement but the warranty expired in 30 day I think this is no good
1,This charger stopped working in less than a month. As other reviewers have mentioned it gets extremely hot when plugged in. While my original charger does get warm when in use this one would get uncomfortably hot until it died. If you're in need of a charger look for another brand.
1,The charger wasn’t used for months and kept in the packaging. The time I used it it broke immediately.
1,After two weeks of use the charger has stopped working. Definitely a waste of money.
1,A month later does not even charge. No hope had to go back to my torn cord which I have to position crazy to even charge. Waste of money.
1,I ordered 2.  One was broken upon arrival.  The second one broke after a couple months.
1,This product is trash. I purchased this as a replacement for my son’s chrome book. Only a few weeks later and it no longer works. Don’t waste your money.
1,For the price its great for the fast delivery also great. However it didnt work for my laptop.  I was disappointed because i was excited for my son. I purchased it so he can charge his laptop. I actually just returned it and requested a refund on the item
1,Took long to ship and didn’t even work
1,Just lasted 17 days. This charger apparently was working well but this morning stopped  charging my chromebook only two weeks after I purchased it. Don't waste your money.
1,**update** was sent another one to replace broken item. This one broke in 1 MONTH. TOTAL GARBAGEbroke within 2 months total waste of money.
1,This dd not fit my chrome book. I spoke with Amazon because I need a smaller c style connector.  He sent me the wrong link for returns.
1,Cord only good for a couple of months. I returned first cord and received another now this is no longer working.
1,Product worked for just over 3 months which just so happens to be the length of time that it’s covered for replacement. Piece of junk!
1,This charger was great! Until it wasn't...stopped working about 3 months into use for no apparent reason. Very frustrating. Trying to contact the company about a replacement or refund but am having a hard time getting in touch with them.
1,I purchased this to replace my Chromebook charger & after 3 months it burned out. The wattage is too low for my Chromebook. Now I have to replace me replacement charger.
1,This stopped working within one use . The pin became loose. Won't recommend
1,After a couple of uses the charger stopped charging my devices. Ended up sending it back.
1,I've purchased 4 of these chargers now within the last couple of months and every single one quit working. I do not recommend this charger at all.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Just brought 4 and they dont work
1,Charger only worked for a month.  It no longer will charge the chrome book or kindle fire.  Disappointed
1,The last one I bought lasted 4 weeks. This one lasted 3 weeks. That adds up to a lot of money just to charge a chromebook.
1,I bought two of these in September.  One stopped working in January of course the night before a calculus test for my son.
1,My cord also stopped working and charging the chromebook we bought it for and now it’s outside our return window for Amazon.  I want to use the year warranty but am not sure how.  Please help!!!
1,I bought this charger in Decemeber used it a few times and for some reason it stopped working. Wouldn't buy it again.
1,A little over a month into college courses and the charger started getting weird. Now it won't charge at all. Waste of money.
1,I should've just ordered a replacement from HP. This one got so hot within an hour of use that it almost melted itself. So glad I didn't leave it plugged in overnight. Returning it for sure!
1,DONT BUY THIS DESTROYED MY CHROMEBOOK I PLUGGED IT IN AND MY CHROMEBOOK SHUT OFF AND WONT TURN ON EVEN THOUGH IT WAS 80 PERCENT!! DONT BUY
1,I ordered this charger and not even 2 months later it no longer works/charges our chromebook. So unhappy with this order.
1,Stopped working properly after about a month. Currently my laptop won't even turn on.
1,Bought end of June stopped working beginning of November.  Used 1-2 times per week if that.  This was my back-up computer charger.  It is dead now.  Very upset about it.
1,This product worked for about 2 1/2 months and then without warning it stopped working.  Completely dead.  I expect a longer life than that for the price.
1,This product is junk. Lasted 2 months now it won’t charge and I’m past my return window.
1,This is the second one that I’ve had that quit working. And the return window closed on 1/31.
1,This charger just FRIED my son's laptop that he uses for virtual schooling.  He has only had this laptop ONE year.
1,Bought the charger January 24th. It is now March 15th and it no longer works.
1,Doesn’t work.
1,This is the second power adapter for my HP Chromebook that died in less than one year.  Power adaptors should last several years!  Poor Quality!
1,It seemed to be working fine and now it just quit like the last one
1,It seemed great at first but something happened and it has now fried three chromebooks.
1,This is junk.
1,This charger stopped working in less than a month. DISATISFIED.
1,Two months of use and it's broken. Prior to breaking it was a great charger
1,Only used for 5 weeks and stopped charging today.
2,Broke after a week
1,Thing worked for about two minutes and then swelled up and popped.  Will actually spend money next time and get what I pay for.
1,This charger stopped working 1 day after the return window closed. Now we are left with a broken charger!! 30$ wasted on junk!
1,The box always felt way too hot and it was dead in 3 months.

1,Junk ! Do not buy worker less then two months and now had no power to it
1,It took less than one month for this charger to quit charging my laptop. Very disappointed and dissatisfied.
1,Purchased Aug 5th it is now November 9th it is dead.
1,Only worked for 4 months. Very poor quality
1,Este adaptador NO ES COMPATIBLE con la HP Spectre X2.
5,I use my MacBook at home and school. I don’t like to carry the charger back and forth as it adds weight. This was perfect to have at home.
1,Have ordered 2 of these both have stopped working in less than a month
1,Stopped working after 1 month!!!  Can I give zero stars???
1,Worked great for about 35 days then it just quit. Haha great timing

3,it lasted me a month  charged fast but i had to get a new one
1,I  purchased 2 of these in January 2022.  The first one died in May then the second in July.The green light on the brick will not turn on and no power output.  I tried different AC cords and still dead.
4,On time and great price
5,5 stars for customer service. Can't say about the reliability of the product since they had to replace twice already. But they stand behind their warranty replacement and takes care of the issue right away. So 5 stars for customer service.
1,We purchased 350 of these over the summer to replace the ones not returned by students during the pandemic and to have extras for all our classrooms.  They are dropping like flies. We find that at least 2-5 a week stop working. No visible damage on most. On some you can feel that the cable just isn't connected into the brick. Some the usb-c connector just comes off. We generally buy HP chargers but due to demand could not get the amount we needed. Our Accounts Payable person reached out via Amazon's vendor chat option as that is the only way we could find to connect with them and they have not responded. We are now at about 50 not working. Not because the dog chewed on the cable not because it got caught in the rocker. We have at least 800 HP chargers and we are lucky if we have 2 fail a year. We have had about 50 of these fail in 3 months time. Run!
5,Fits perfect....charger works great
5,Excellent product and quick shipping.
2,So you know when you've had a charger for too long and you have to twist it a certain way for it to charge? That's what happened with this charger when it first arrived. I've been twisting and turning and now finally it charges as a low power charger. Very disappointed.
1,Mine stopped working in 2 months.
1,= UPDATE: The company reached out and gave me a full refund. Great customer service.  =The rubber part of the plug-in to the computer pulled right off withought even pulling on it. It just seperated - rendering the whole thing useless. I barely was able to get the metal part out without having to resort to pliers.
5,My Chromebook charger broke so my dad ordered this one and it is so good it literally charges super fast I really recommend it
5,needed an extra charger for my daughters chromebook from school. It worked perfectly!
5,n0
1,It worked well until it randomly stopped. there was no reason it didn't get any hotter than my OEM one did and my computer pulled less than the rated wattage. DO NOT BUY IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK.
2,It worked for a short period of time and with in a few uses it stopped working
1,So we've ordered two of these... first one burnt out/stopped working in less than 3 months. Replaced with a second one which gave up the ghost in less than 2 months. There will be no 3rd attempt we will look elsewhere for a higher quality product. I've been in IT for 20+ years and supported many laptops and I don't ever remember a power supply unit failing so fast.
1,I’m very disappointed with the product seller and amazon.  Product lasted under 45 days just outside of the returns window.  Product must’ve been defective as Both chargers stopped charging 1day apart.  If I could’ve given it 0 stars that would’ve been my rating.
1,Broke within 2 weeks
5,over the years I've had many laptops and many different chargers.  Some of them work with other computers but I bought this one specifically for my new lap top.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn it works great with my android phone as well. Cuts down on the weight of luggage.
3,Works great for what you need it for and it does charge the laptop as it should. Quality of the product feels softer tho  we will see if it lasts that long.Will update
5,Had to replace mine when the original crapped out.  It doesn't look like the original it's actually physically larger.  Works perfectly barely gets warm.  I think this is going to last a long time.
5,Short and sweet.  Ordered this as a replacement charger for an HP Chromebook.  Works well with the C type adaptor charges well no issues so far.  Good purchase.
5,My brothers dog chewed up my daughters Chrome book laptop charger so I bought this one. Definitely works great and great price too!
5,Definitely recommend.
5,Good replacement for my child’s chrome book
5,Charged laptop quicky when i lost my charger.. Arrived fast!!
1,It was great at first it didn't get that hot it was small.  Then one day it just stopped working if it made it a year I'd be happy but 2 months isn't long enough.
5,Works with a Chromebook.
5,👍
5,Exactly as advertised  fit my daughter's school issued Chrome HP laptop and charged it as well as the original.
5,It works as it's supposed to. It's a charger.Hasn't exploded or set anything on fire. It's solid and correct. It doesn't smell funny.Promptly shipped and arrived in good condition.
5,It works perfect for my laptop
5,Works great have on hand as a back up incase the kiddos can’t find their original charger.
5,Great charger for chromebook and note 20 ultra.
2,The box gets very hot cant charge my computer for very long in fear it will catch fire.  If you buy this dont keep it plugged up for very long. Definate fore hazard
5,Fits good and works great
5,Product seems to be working very well so far for my daughter google chrome book..
5,Works good
5,Great replacement cord works and charges Great now.
5,I like the fact that I plugged it into my computer and it turned my dead computer on automatic!!
5,My computer
5,This was exactly what we needed. Good value for money.
4,Works fine  good length  not sure now long it’ll last though doesn’t seem all that durable definitely not an original laptop charger . Iv had it for about 6 months and it still works so guess I can’t complain
1,Only worked a week.
5,Works great and the cord is a perfect length.
5,This product is at what is says and works for my HP laptop as should.  This is the 2nd time buying this same charger and it arrived before it said it would. Highly recommended 👌
5,Although this cord is not from manufacture it is exactly the same at cheaper price.
1,I waited to write this review after some time. It worked perfectly when I got it but after time it would come on and off. It eventually stopped working after I’ve spent $30 on it. Just don’t get a chrome book it’s not compatible with a lot of things. I definitely won’t recommend this charger unless it’s really urgent but you’d need to keep buying more chargers and spending $30 every 2 weeks. Terrible.
5,Replacement for my son's lost chromebook charger. Works great!!
4,It doesn't stay in but we make it work.
5,Perfect charger. Works awesomely for the price for my 2 in 1
5,Just what I b ordered
5,Product is quality parts for extra durability and is the 65Watt power charger
5,Used this to replace prior item.
1,Fried 3 of my laptops before we realized this stupid charger was what was causing the problem.
5,Work as it should.
5,The dogs chewed up my son's old Chromebook charger. So I purchased this one off Amazon and it shipped very quickly and it works awesome!
1,Waste of money it works for loke a week and the it stops. I would rate it 0
5,My daughter had one of these from the school that went to her student laptop. It is the same charger as our phones and they charge very fast. I finally bought a few for us to have at home and we just love them. they charge very fast and are made much better quality than normal charging cords. it goes great with my samsung phone.
5,Item was of standout quality. Packaging was good. Delivery was ever so quick. A++
5,Funciona muy bien en chromebook  de mi hija
5,Purchase 3 of this chargers and they all work great ... Love that it has a long cord .... I received what I was expecting thank you
4,Overall the charger is good; It does heat up a little if you keep it plugged in too long. When you're not using it to avoid it heating up make sure to unplug it after each use It was a good buy.
5,I hooked it right up to the computer and in a few hoursit was powered up and ready to go!
5,Exactly what I needed!
5,Item as described.
5,It works well with the chrome hp laptop. Thanks you.
5,WAS delivered fast and perfect
4,Charges chromebook just fine.
5,Charger is working great so far.
5,Works great on my HP Chromebook. Much cheaper product and the same quality as the HP brand charger of the same wattage. Thank you!
