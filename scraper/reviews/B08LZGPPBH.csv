5,Very good product for a very good price. This charger has worked flawlessly for the past year and a half. I have little else I can say to to add to that. Easy to pick up and play when swapping out controllers when the first drains. Can and have recommended this one to friends.
5,The charging cable that comes with the ps5 is way to short so I had to purchase another controller. Now when I am not playing both controllers can be charging at the same time or if I am playing with one and the battery dies I pick up the charged one and put the dead one on the charger. Super easy and works great.
5,Honestly these are great but my only wish is that they would seat a little easier into the charging ports. There’s a certain amount of finagling required or to hit it at the right angle every time & I feel like that could be achieved by a smart engineer. But that’s my only gripe.
5,Excellent buy.. my son is a gamer so this is perfect for him to charge his controllers
4,My only complaints about this item is the connection isn't as tight as should be and it takes a bit to get the connection just right. Otherwise a good product for the price.
4,Having used a charging dock for my PS4 controllers for many years now I thought to invest in one for the next generation of gaming. If memory serves some folks have noted how the LED display images on the front do not indicate charging (not changing colors) so I was happy to see that is not the case for mine. Red when charging blue when "full." While sliding a controller into the dock itself can be a bit iffy at times the device does its job well and consistently. I am a "mild user" with maybe just a couple hours of playtime a week so more regularly recharging and/or time in general could have an effect. Would recommend!
5,Husband loves it works great
5,Buen producto y carga bastante rápido los controles
5,I don’t leave reviews too often but I had to for this. Packaged nicely from the manufacturer and very sturdy. For this particular charger I like the fact that it has a plug-in so I have the option of not having it tethered to the PS5. Matches the system and the blue lights are nice (and can be turned off). For the money I highly recommend. Quality as if it was made by Sony!
5,Charges well (pretty fast if you ask me) can't really say much on that because I charge the controller before it runs down completely.  But contrary to other reviews here maybe because I may have gotten an updated version...The Controllers fit perfectly and easily on the dock and starts charging.  Previously my charging dock also bought here on Amazon about 2 years ago...charges the controllers upside down.  They charged from the usb-C slot on the front of the controller.  That made it difficult trust me.  (had an attachment that would come off).So this one 100% so far....keep in mind its less than 2 weeks with it...longevity is still up in the air.
5,My daughter loves it! You can even charge the controller right from the wall adapter if you wanna play while it charges…. Good affordable buy for an expensive console
5,Nice
5,Partner commented what a PITA the PS5 controller battery was bc it didn't hold a charge long. Not even an issue with this. Charges fast and whenever it's not in use it goes on the cradle (organized and charged yayyyy). Looks nice as well. Was a great surprise for him. Been several weeks since purchase and still going strong. Will probably buy again when we end up buying additional controllers or if it craps out in the future. Great value for price.
5,Product was great
5,Very happy with purchase and product is great quality.
5,Works great so far after three months. Frees up USB ports on the PS5 for stuff that really needs them. The blue indicator LEDs seemed a bit bright at first but from across the room they're not too bad. If I decide they're bothersome it's easy enough to dim them with a little tape.
5,Works great just plug it in and turn it on. A lot better then leaving my controller plugged in all the time where a certain cat likes to chew. Where with this the cord is in the back and out of prying eyes. So glad I took a chance and purchased it. Didn't take long at all to charge either.
5,Very nice product. Good charging rate. Change colors while charging and when full. Directly seats on the charging clips. No Socket or plugs. Comes with its adapter so u can use your PS5 USB for other stuff if needed.
4,Lo instalé y funciona a la perfección
5,First this stand does exactly what it says it will. It's sturdy and meets the need. My only request is for easier placement on the charging ports. The stand is very deliberate in the design which takes slightly more effort and care when placing the controllers for a charge.The charging lights on the front are an unexpected bonus because it'll show you exactly when the controller is fully charged. I know the controllers themselves have an indicator for this purpose but sometimes it's just easier to look for these lights than the controller lights.
5,I've been using this dock for quite a while now and have no real complaints.A minor nit pick is that it can be kind of tricky to actually slot the controller into the port but that might just be a me issue.
5,I’ve had it a short bit now but so far so good. Easy out of the box setup and use. No issues thus far. Very handy. Arrived quickly from seller. Looks nice and everything. Great value too.
5,Does exactly what I need it to do.
4,Don’t get me wrong. It works. But it’s too easy to knock the controllers off their charging spot. You have to get it on there perfectly or they will not charge. But there’s nothing to secure them tightly.
5,I bought this out of frustration.The last charger I bought for my PS5 controllers was incredibly difficult to use. I had to practically slam my controllers into the charger at various angles before it would connect enough to charge them. Even then they would sometimes not charge.This charger however does not require any slamming whatsoever.The controllers are easily seated with the indicator lighting up to show which controller is charged/charging. It matches well with the console and controllers and it does the job. It charges quickly and without issue.Exactly as advertised and worth the money.
4,Good charger a bit of a learning curve when getting used to setting the controller on to the device.
5,Sufficient for the purpose
4,The OIVO charger station for the Playstation 5 is a capable charger that may be a necessity for your PS5. This OIVO charger station will give you the ability to charge 2 DualSense controllers with one device. The device is powered by a usb-c adapter which plugs in to the wall and turns on with a switch which sits to the left of the usb-c port. The DualSense will attach to the mounts of the charger from the bottom of controller. LED lights which will resemble the shape of the DualSense will indicate the charging status. Red means it is charging and Blue either means the controller is fully charged or unplugged. As noted on the box of the product this charger will only charge the controller 70 percent to avoid any battery damage to your already expensive controller. The OIVO charger station asthetically matches the PS5 two-tone color scheme with the white shell surrounding the black inside. The white shell also emits a blue LED similar to the PS5 console. The texture of the white shell on the charger feels very similar to the finish to the front white panels of the DualSense controller where the directional and face buttons sit.The caveats of the OIVO Charger Station I have noticed so far are only a few and can be seen as nit-picky however they maybe worth keeping note of. First off the LED panel which shows the charging status has a glossy feel (after you rip off the protective film) and may be susceptible to scratches which could possibly be highlighted by the bright LEDs. Secondly the conductors on top of the charger are exposed in which it maybe important to keep that area protected to prevent damage to your controller and charging device. Furthermore it may be important to align the DualSense perfectly with the mount as well which could be seen as an cumbersome task as plugging in your controller to a charging cable seems to be more efficient. However the DualSense controllers sit pretty well on the mounts while connected. Finally performance wise I used the DualSense controller until it was at 1bar of battery life to see how long it would take to charge on the OIVO Charger Station. After nearly an hour the device was still charging which seems like a while considering this only charges up to 70 percent.  Upon turning on the PS5 and checking the status of the controller the Charger station was indeed doing its job nevertheless. Also it is worth noting this might not be an issue for I can see this product getting most of its use after a gaming session where an immediate charge is not required. With this being said I would only consider a device like this if you own 2 DualSense controllers.With there being many alternatives to the OEM PS5 charger station for the DualSense with a similar price point it maybe hard to see how the OIVO Charger Station stands out from the rest. While the device is asthetically impressive it also fulfilled what I was looking for in a charging device from my experience using it and I hope it satisfies your needs too.
4,OIVO Charger Station ReviewI have managed to get a couple of OIVO Charger Stations for the PS5 and I will share my opinion about the device.Let’s start with the basic features. The OIVO Charger Stations for the PS5 features quick charging Blue and Red LED indicators and Intelligent Protection. The charge unit comes with a power adapter and a power switch if you want to manually turn the unit on or off. All the features provided by OIVO in my opinion are very desirable and convenient in a charge station.I feel that everything OIVO promises on the packaging is delivered. I have used the units for a few months now and I am truly impressed. In a nutshell the product is outstanding.Here’s are some more in-depth details on each feature:The Quick Charging feature- In my time with the OIVO Charger Stations for the PS5 it has never taken more than 2 hours to fully recharge my Dual Sense controllers as advertised. This feature comes in handy when you are in a long gaming session. On average my controller battery life lasts around 5 to 6 hours before needs charging. I have my second controller already on the OIVO Charge Station ready to go. I simply swap them out and put my controller that needs charging back on the Quick Charger and in 2 hours or less its back to full charge. I never miss a gaming session!Blue and Red LED indicators- Once you place your used Dual Sense on the charger it will display a red indicator. This lets you know that the controller is indeed charging. Once the controller is fully charged the indicator turns blue. This lets you know that the controller is ready to go!Intelligent Protection- Once the controller has fully charged it does not continue to charge. This guards against overcharging over current overheating excessive voltages and short circuiting which can shorten the life of your battery or damage your controller. Thus possibly extending the life of your controllers and helping to protect your controllers from unforeseen electrical hazards!Now for the cons. Yes there is a con. The one and only con that I have found is minor but is worth pointing out. The controllers look very nice when they are placed on the charging stations. However you must be extremely careful on the placement of the controllers or removal of the controllers from the charge station. The angle when the controllers are sitting on the charge station is aesthetically pleasing but it does have to sit on the base just so. You must place the controller at just the right angle to prevent possible breakage of the plastic controller stabilizer meant to hold the controller properly on the base. That is the only negative of the charge station. You get all of this at a great price point that is just below the first party charge stations. Overall great buy! I give it and 4 out of 5 stars for the final score! Check back with us for the next OIVO review coming soon! We will be reviewing the OIVO Cooling Stand with charger.
5,Being a PS five owner who detests freaking wired stuff this makes a perfect thing to charge your controllers without having to worry about the wires
4,Works ok but difficult to get position to recharge. Not the best design
5,Have had this for over 18 months and still working fantastic thank you.
5,It’s easy to use and take only 2 hrs to charge the controller. I am happy with this product.
5,Super easy. Just plug it into a wall outlet and set your controllers on it to charge.
5,Works great
4,I'd say that this is a good alternative if you are no willing to pay for the branded option. So far I did not have any issues with my controller after charging if for a month now. It takes probably 2-3 hours to fully charge both controllers at the same time. The only minor con for this charger is that you need place the controllers at the right spot to charge. Not a big deal but it could just be more fool proof.
5,The charging stand has an on and off switch in the back so when it's not charging/ in-use it can be turn off. The lighting on the charging stand is helpful so can tell when the controller is fully charged.
4,Seems to take a minute to get it centered so it will charge. Other than that I would have given 5 stars.
4,The charger works but sometimes the light doesn’t come on so you’re not sure if you’ve properly connected. Its not a big deal but I would buy a different charger if I could go back and change my decision.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Bought this charging base in hopes to be able to dock my scuf reflex controller for the PS5 and also my stock PS5 controller with a extreme rate remap kit. Unfortunately the extreme rate controller will not fit but the scuf reflex fits perfectly. Love the on/off switch for the charging light. A great but for the price in my opinion
5,My son was always forgetting to charge his controllers and losing them-this is perfect.  They always stay charged and have a place to go.
5,Does what it says
5,
5,I have been using this four about one month now.  It charges two controllers very quicky.  No issues to report.
4,Had a few connection issues where the connection wasn’t detecting the controller but it charges fine. It is difficult to connect them without slow precision but I’m happy with it.
5,So much easier than plugging them in to the console!
5,Charges ps5 controllers perfectly and fast. The lights change color to let you know where your charge level is
5,Love it must have for ps5 controller.
4,Not a bad product. My only gripe is sometimes it takes a minute to jostle the controller about trying to get it to line up JUST right to start charging. 4/5 stars seems fair.
5,A great charger to hold and show off your controllers. And easy to tell which one is fully charged. Has its own adapter so you don't use the PS5's power.
5,does exactly what you think it should do compact and super convenient
5,Yes! It's a bit minimalistic yet exactly what I was looking for. This charging dock is great for charging two controllers at once and it looks great to boot. I like that it plugs into an outlit instead of defaulting to USB power like my old ones. Works great!
5,The only negative thing I will say is that it can be tricky to get the controller to sit exactly right. But once you get used to it it's not an issue. It's been working well for a while now so we are happy with it.
5,Product has a blue light when controllers are on charger to indicate it’s fully charged and a red light for when it needs charged.
3,The charger base is fairly well designed but the included power supply was dead on arrival. The base works fine when plugging into the PS5 (with a USB-C cable) but not with the included one.
5,Quality product and easy to use with PS5 controllers.
5,Charge the controller fast
5,This thing is amazing. Period. I have not owned a charging station in quite some time. Mainly because I don’t want to spend the extra time messing around with setting it down correctly on the stand. Always seemed easier just using USB’s.With this stand I really appreciate it has the extra little bump to steady the controller making it nearly impossible to struggle with getting it to charge go one.I let my controller completely die twice and charge it twice to see just how well this thing held up. It took a total time from dead to full on my almost new controller in about 2 hours.The sleek design fits great next to the console and the controller as well. It matches and that’s always an issue for me and my OCD. I need things to match if they’re gonna be out in the open.Setup out of the box is extremely simple and is easy as plug and charge.My ONLY gripe with this stand is the charging lights. I love the lights but when your controller is totally dead or there just about- the lights are always red. When it’s not totally charged but enough that it doesn’t require a charge or when its done charging it’s blue. The gripe comes in because I never know if my 40%-60% charged controller has reached 100% unless I turn on the system and look. A 3rd color would’ve really made that pop for me. Green yellow purple any color would be great but some form of separation would be phenomenal.But overall I gotta still give this thing a 5/5. It does what it needs to do quickly effectively looks great on the shelf next to the console and is overall just a great product for the price and has changed my mind on charging stations!
4,The charger is easy to use with a little aim. The only thing I feel like it's lacking is a slightly wider base that is formed to the controller so it guides the controller to the charger easier.But it gets the job done and doesn't take up a lot of space. It's still the best charger I've seen.
3,Poor build quality and poor fitting connection
4,I purchased the OVIO charging station in hopes of finding a quick solution of charging my controllers and this product clearly didn’t disappoint. I was able to place both controllers into the station and have them be quickly charged within a span of 20 minutes. The design of the charging station has such a modern and stylish look to it that it actually helps enhances  the over all look of my game room as well. If you are like me and own at least 4 PS5 controllers then I highly recommend the OVIO charging for keeping your controllers charged and easy which in return allows you to have better gaming experience!
5,Long story short...it works and does its job.....fast charging as advertised and easy to use......only con I have for it is its not as east to dock as I'd like....kinda have to find the slot and play around with it before it docks....other then that tho...works as it should
4,After doing a long 25 minutes of research for the dualsense charging docks that aren't the sold out sony versions I came across this one by accident.Appearance: looks like the Sony one. Matches the ps5 perfectly. Even has blue accent lighting that's pretty cool.Function: charges the controllers to 80% to prevent battery damage I guess. I dunno I have no way to actually measure the battery power. All I know is it charges the controller.But...If you're a hardcore gamer playing 12 hours straight you should have more than 2 controllers charged up because this isn't a quick charger (I went through 1 controller playing Cyberpunk for about 5 hours). Thankfully I can only play for about 5 hours before I need to return to real life and take a break. My wife and I play some games so it's nice to have 2 fully charged controllers at all times which is why I wanted one in the first place.One thing I wish they had done was maybe mold in channels to seat the controllers in the perfect spots for charging. They make contact with the hole and ports on the bottom (which was a plus for me as to not screw around with the USB-C on top) but it's a balancing act to get them on there. Not a major issue but kind of an annoyance. So I deducted 1 star.Price was fine for what it is as long as it continues working and doesn't fry my controllers. I would recommend buying this one at least as until the Sony ones are back in stock.
4,My nephew broke the usb port on ps5. Didn’t really have any other choice but to purchase this bottom fed charger. This was expected as the same thing happened with ps4. Only complaint is that it takes a bunch of tries to line up charge port just right. Very sensitive.
5,Easy fast setup and charging is a snap
5,I have had this charging station for a few months now and there are no complaints. It fits well in spaces and charges pretty quickly. I like to fact that it has an on/off switch so that you can store your controllers without always charging the battery. Also the charging indicators is great so you know when your controller(s) is ready.The charger is well made compact and comes with a sufficient length power cable. I would recommend this charging station and have no regrets not purchasing the more expensive Sony branded.
3,It chargest fairly decent but the controllers are really loose. Good price though.
4,My first impression is that I noticed it is a little bit bigger than the Sony charging station but it looks just as nice. You have to use the power supply in order to power it up which is okay only if it wasn't blocky which means that you will have to free some space in your outlets. The oivo stand has a small button that allowes it to light up as you can see in the pic the controller icons will light up blue if they are fully charged or red if it is currently charging. It is a nice little feature because the PS5 also lights up so it is nice being next to each other but also a plus because the Sony stand doesn't light up. What about the charging time compare to the Sony? Well they actually have the same speed so that's good. My only complain is that its is much easier to dock your controller on the Sony stand than it is on the oivo but I guess it's just a matter of getting used. I think what would of helped is by shaving off the plastic piece in the middle where you dock the controller similar to the Sony one.Overall it is a nice option! It is $5 cheaper than the Sony but at the end it will depend if you want it for looks and to save a few bucks. While the Sony is smaller and slicker the lighting on the Oivo makes up for it
4,Works well as expected. Doesn’t take long to charge a controller and was cheaper than the names brand Sony one.
5,Easy to setupPretty fast at charging controllerAlign correctly or it will not chargeCool led display function compliments PS5Place the controller on charging station gently
5,I got these as a gift for my brother. He absolutely loves them! We're both gamers and anytime I visit we end up playing for hours.With his PS4 he'd have half a dozen controllers constantly charging on individual cables so he could cycle through them. When I saw this I knew it would be perfect.This charges two controllers at the same time and it's pretty fast. (As far as I can tell. Could just be the new PS5 controllers. I don't have one of my own yet to compare.) He hasn't felt the need to buy additional controllers yet so I think it's doing a great job.
4,This charges controller well it's just sometimes frustrating to get the controllers into it. There is a lot of wiggle room for misalignment.
2,Beware!  This item (by design) will not charge controllers to 100%.  It comes with a 'built-in chip' (see pics attached to this review) that prevents a full charge on the controllers.  The maximum amount you can charge your controllers is 70% of capacity which is a real letdown and not what I was expecting.On top of that when this arrived the box was literally already opened.  There was also no instruction book/warranty as there usually is with an item like this.  The circular tape seal at the top of the box had also been cut so it seems pretty clear I got a returned item that was resold.Another annoyance is that this comes with an A/C adapter and not a USB cable you can plug directly into your PS5 so unless you have an extra cable laying around you'll need another power outlet to use this.I'm returning this item and will probably just charge my controllers using the USB cable that came with my PS5.  If you're considering this or allured by the low price point decide if the issues above are worth it for you.  For me they definitely weren't.
5,Great product  charges remotes quickly!!
4,Not the easiest to cradle the controller into the leads.
5,Charges controllers well.I like that it stops sending power to the controllers once they are fully charged and senses if they need charged or not when put on the cradle.Maybe a bit nitpicky but I would like it if it was easier to place in the cradle correctly.
4,Hard to set the controllers properly.
5,Got this for my 10-year-old son. It’s not perfect and it doesn’t slide in exactly as the manufacturer claims but we no longer have issues with dead controllers because we didn’t plug the controller in and it is about as easy as plugging in a wired controller - just not much easier as claimed. Still the different form makes for a different experience and a superior one for our family.
5,The official PS5 dual charger is still hard to come by.  So what alternative options do you have?  Many.  Looking around I opted for this OIVO the reviews were pretty decent and for the price it was not a big gamble.  It was a great buy.  It works great.THe LED on the unit are basically always on but for our locations that is not a big deal.  Having two controllers without the extra adapter is good.  Having direct AC power is good.  Only thing I would improve on is you sometimes need to fidget to get the controller on the charging prongs.Pros:- its good looking- its a great price- it uses wall AC current not a spare USB port on your PS5- hold two controlloers- doesnt require extra adapter or dongles- color scheme matches the PS5I would buy again.  I would recommend to friends.Cons:- it can be tricky to seat the controller just so but its only a minor thing- its light almost wish it weight a little more just so it would slide around much
5,These do a good job of keeping the controllers charged.  Could be a little easier to place the controller on but not bad.
5,It has held up for a year now and is working great. Love the convenience of a dual charger for both of the PS5 controllers and the light symbols indicating which ones are charging. Seems well built as well.
5,Great for charging
5,This is one of the best chargers for the money that I have ever purchased
4,Have to be careful charger piece is not snug.
4,Serves its purpose that is charging the controller
4,Gets the job done for the most part. I don’t like how the controllers sit on top of the charging station though.
4,Love the charging dock! My fiancé got it for me as a gift so both controllers can charge at the same time. The dock looks awesome next to the system the lights on the side of the charging dock give it the same feel and esthetic as the console itself. I love the lights on the front as well to easily tell when controllers and done charging or actively charging. Controllers fit on the dock perfectly and I’ve never had to fiddle around with the controller to make sure it was on properly to start charging like docks in the past. If I had one complaint about the dock it was that it didn’t have a USB option as well only AC. That’s me really like looking for a negative though. I would absolutely recommend this dock to anyone. Also you don’t have to put the controllers in upside down lol. When shopping around that was a weird thing I kept seeing to charge the controllers and I wasn’t a fan of the look.
5,This is a super solid charging station. It's sleek it's high quality dosent feel cheap and the LED's are a really nice touch. And the light pulsates when charging. Really cool. Both my controllers were fully charged but when the controller is charging the little controller LED on the screen will turn RED. Another nice indicator to know when it's charging.Also the little power switch on the back of it is a really nice feature. When both controllers are fully charged there's really no need for it to be on. And instead of going thru the trouble of unplugging it (especially if the plug is in a inconvenient location like mine) you can just hit the switch on the back of it and boom its off. Really niceSo yeah. For the price you can't get much better than this. Looks real nice next to the PS5 too. Pull the trigger on it if you're thinking about it
5,Does what iy should easy to use aesthetically pleasing  and charges quickly. Can't live without mine!
4,Work as advertised.
4,Hard to set back in place. Accidental button touch when securing on pod turns the ps5 back on.
5,Exactly what I expected!
5,I like the lights displaying the remote actually charging and turning blue once it is fully charge great feature.
4,So far so good. Jury is still out.
5,As you can see from my photo the unit itself is made so it is straddled by the controllers.  When the controller is fully charged the icon on the front turns blue. As it is charging it remains red. The blue border around the outside of the controller images pulsate to indicate it is being charged. You can also see on the controllers themselves the lights going on and off as the unit recharges.  Depending upon how much charging the controller needs the recharge time takes between two to three hours.  And that is exactly how it is represented.  This is a well-made unit came very well packaged and I would recommend it for any PS5 owner.  I have been using this for several weeks now and it has worked flawlessly.
5,Buen tamaño nada estorboso y carga a la perfección Excelente para saber también cuando el control ya está cargado
5,It does its job period.
4,Somewhat difficult to get the controller to sit properly but works good
4,My fiance loves it and the design however it would be nice it the connection piece was a bit longer as he can not use it while he has silicone covers on his controller.
5,It makes it easier to charge two controllers without the need of keeping the console in Rest mode. In my area we suffer occasional brownouts and I don't like keeping my PS5 on overnight.
4,Does what it say only one con is putting them on sometimes you have to fish to put them on
5,I really like this charging station better than the last one I had for my PS5. This one is way easier to use and charges my controllers faster. Something to note though it plugs into the wall or power strip instead of the console while this isn't a problem for me it may be for others.
5,This charger is super sleek and nice looking next to your PS5. Really great and works as intended.
4,Wish the controllers sat more snuggly it's also hard to grab if you have to pick it up and move it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Absolutely loving this dock! The controllers just sit right on top. They start to charge when they are low and stops charging when the battery is full so you don’t have to worry about it over charging. The dock also has an on and off switch so if you want to use it as a stand in between charging you can do that as well! All in all I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to the Sony branded charging dock. It has a nice quality feel to it as well. The only down side to this charging dock is that it can’t charge the controllers if you have a rubber grip on that covers the bottom of your controller but I feel like that may be an issue for any other charging dock like this one. If you’re looking for a charging dock right now I think this one is definitely worth the price!
4,I like how it looks when the controllers are charging (which is at an angle) but it's annoying to put onto the charging station because it's at an angle. Overall I am satisfied with the products and does its job to charge the controllers.
4,The charging station looks great and works pretty well it can sometimes be hard to get the controllers in there even with them both charging as the plug is small and they sway to the side easily
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Works good so far
5,Definitely works good for wireless charging when not using the controller. If you have certain paddled controllers; the controller will not fit though.
5,Mi perro se comía los cables y no sabia que hacer esto me ayudó a que parase.
5,Great
4,This works and looks fine but it's really annoying to get the controllers set into the cradles. The back one is easier for some reason so I use that one all the time. It would be much better if there was some kind of plastic guide to line them up properly.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I’m sure after playing hours of Warzone and getting off for the night you forget to charge your controller the next day comes and the controller is dead.  This awesome dual sense controller dock fixes that problem. Just place it on the dock and bam your good to go. It even stops charging when full and will change from red to blue indicating that the charging process is complete.Goes very well with the ps5  Same white and blue design also comes with a very handy wall outlet to plug straight into the wall instead of using a USB port (we know how limited those can be on the system) you can also turn off the dock if the lights bother you. Overall it’s a very clean and sleek charging dock very well worth the price I highly recommend!
5,This device does it's job quite well and at a fraction of the cost of what a official sony device to do the same thing would do. There is an internal chip in the dual sense controllers that only allow them to be charged to 70% of the overall capacity but that is still quite a bit. If you want a cheaper option that is still just as cool looking as the PS5 then get this and never look back. OH AND it comes with the ac adapter which is just awesome also most accessories charge more for that to come with it.
4,I like how it indicates if the ps5 controller is charging or it’s fully charged. Its good as I only use this to charge my controller and the battery life is same as I used ti charge using cable before.
5,Amazing product charges great and looks better than cords and wires everywhere
4,Great product and easy to use!
5,Works good looks good compact.The only complaint I have with it is that the front charging light became very dim and hard to see after a few uses.It still works great just can't really see the front charging light because mine is so dim.Maybe it's just mine but I do like it.
3,Charger works great. One of the blue indicator lights went out fairly quick. It still charges so I'll deal with it.
2,I like the setup. Seems well made but the connector for the usb cable that plugs into the unit may orMay not stay connected.I bought this about 3 months ago and it’s not like the charge is mistreated. It literally just sits in one spot so I’m not sure what the issue is. Basically it will be lit up blue set your controller to charge and if I’m lucky I’m the power will stay connected long enough to charge the controller. So many times I’ve set my controllerTo charge only to find out that he connector cameloose lost power and it didn’t charge.  I currently have it sitting on the cord and backed against my wall to make it stay on.Maybe I got a lemon.If it actually worked I’d give it 4-5 stars but hey…all I can do is leave a crappy review.
5,I saw the official Playstation dual charging station that a friend of mine had. When I went to go look for it as he had recommended I found a few others and this one caught my eye. I liked the blue controller light indicating a full charge along with red meaning it was charging (mostly because the blue matched the ps5 blue light when it's on). It's relatively small and compact and it was very well to plug in and use immediately. It charges your controllers within a couple hours and it can be turned off to use simply as a dock. Does the job well and costs less than the Playstation one so it was an easy choice for me.
5,I love it. The charging station glows blue when it’s fully charged or red when it’s charging. It’s great and it’s small enough to where it’s not taking up too much room.
5,Great ps5 controller charger. Does exactly what it’s suppose to and looks great too.
5,No issues and had for months.  Not a fast charger so don’t expect it to be.
5,Sobrepasa mis expectativas!
5,Easy to use and set the controllers always charged when I need them. Thinking of getting another one for my other 2 controllers
5,Does the job to charge the controllers it beats plugging it in and having cords everywhere I like how I can set both of my controls on here and just forget about it
5,Easy to use just plug it in and start charging your controllers.  I love the charging feature where you can see when the controllers is charged and ready to use.Light weight chargers well and fast (in my opinion) and matches the ps5 look10/10 for the price and quality.
4,Love it great quality but one thing I don’t like is how little space between the controllers there is it’s a little hard to put them on and off without knocking off the other one also the angle makes it difficult to put on but other than that it’s perfect
5,Materiales muy finos de gran calidad estéticamente combina muy bien con los controles  carga muy rápido. En definitiva excelente compra.
4,This charging dock does a great job of charging the controllers quickly while also providing a place to put your controllers when not in use. I didn’t really like how finicky it was to actually get the controller to sit correctly on the dock. It sometimes takes a few tries to line it up correctly. On top of that the dock itself is incredibly lightweight and tends to move around a lot especially when you’re trying to place a controller on it. From what I’ve heard many other docks with this style of connection also have the same issues including the one that comes directly from Sony. All that aside this is still a good deal that I would recommend.
5,This Product Fits The Style of the PS5 works like a charm. I’ve had a few OIVO & Honestly a few things to point out! 1 the products hold up to wear & tear 2 they look and feel Quality 3 the customer service is 100% amazing every time I have a question! If you are looking for anything related to gaming/accessories OIVO is the Place to Go!!
4,Did the job!
5,works and looks great.
5,The charger is very effective and handles two controllers with no problem.  The controllers slide into place with no force needed but due to the shape of the controllers and the charger it is slightly tricky.  The controllers do give a signal with their lights when the connection is correct.
4,The controllers wiggle a lot in the stand and fall out if you bump them slightly.
5,Awsime product fast charge
5,Boyfriend loves them that's all that matters. Bought for his PS5
5,Overall this seems to be a great charging dock. If I had to pick something to criticize the best I can do is that the white plastic is a slightly different color/texture to the Playstation's. That's the nitpickiest I can be on it. No real complaints.
4,Works well enough. You do need to turn it on and off if you don't always want it charging.
5,It was a dope purchase ! My only complaint is that I wish they made the grooves easier to a-line with the controller so it would be a secure fit. However if it came down to I would buy another one . One of my favorite purchases that my wife has bought me.
4,The only reason I’m docking it to 4 stars is because if you have a silicone cover you can’t charge the controller with it on. Do I like this charger? Yes. Would I buy it again? Also yes. If it’s an annoyance to you to take off silicone covers each time you have to charger then don’t buy this or don’t buy silicone covers.
5,Always ran into my controllers dying previously so this thing is great.
3,The dock works great and looks cool. Does what it says. The only reason I gave it a low score is because it didn't come with an ac adapter like it says in the description. They did give me a USB cable so I plug that into my laptop and charge it from there. Besides that it works great.
5,I really don't understand so far why this product is not expensive. It looks incredible. Does like a safety feature where it won't charge your controller until it's below 80%. I LOVE it and that's saying a lot. I hope after this review that it continues to work because that would be terrible if it didn't. Overall great product. I strongly recommend!
5,Fast charging. Controllers fit in place perfectly. USB -C plug on the back with an on/off switch.
5,it is working like a dream.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Oivo's PS5 Duelsense controller charging station is a good alternative product for those who are having trouble with getting the official Sony version. But also for those who have a budget. The quality is much better than most third party products. The charging display is beautifully bright and like other chargers it comes in 2 colors blue and red. And very convenient to have next to my chair and not worrying having the controller connected to the console while playing just to charge it.Oivo does not disappoint with their products and I highly recommend them for those who are on a budget and looking for great quality products.
5,
5,It's easy to use and I haven't had any problems whatsoever. It charges the controller the way I expected it would do. An excellent purchase.
5,No issues works as advertised
5,This charges the controls very well once you have the controller installed correctly. Placement of controller isnt as easy as drop and charge. Must be sure to push it on and make sure the light turns red. Not that hard..just annoying. We still use it daily.
4,Easy to set up and use.  It doesn't connect to the controller via USB C but rather the gold pins in the front of the controller. Putting it on the unit takes some getting used to it and it just sits on it rather than plugging in. Feels kinda flimsy when its on there but it does the trick!
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             So this charger seemed to be pretty cool from what I saw online however when you try putting the controller on the charger you have to get it just right to get it into the slot. The blue lights stay on whether the controller is on the charger or not. It only changes color when the remote actually needs charged. Once the controller is on the charger  I haven’t had any issues with it actually charging. Just sucks when the blue lights on the front stay on with controller on or off. Would be nice to have another indicator to know the controller is actually on the charger correctly rather than relying on a slot or when the charger actually needs to be chargered when the light turns red. I did forget the remote lights up when it’s plugged in all the way however would be nice for the charger itself to have a better visual or even physical identification that the controller is on all the way.
5,Looks great charges controllers easy to plug in
5,Purchased in January and still working.
5,Works well with my wireless PS5 controllers
5,I got this for my brother and he loves it. But I was shocked at the size.
5,Super convenient and charges controllers super fast
5,I had to replace a cheap gamestop charger that I originally purchased and there is no comparison. This charger is easy to use and hasn't given me any problems since I bought it 4 months ago.  If you are looking for a sturdy reliable charger then this one is it. I'd buy it as a Christmas gift for my son if he didn't already have one.
4,Easy to use. Nice to have if you don't want to keep your PS5 in rest mode.
5,I love the dualsense controllers and even though they have a pretty good battery life I always like to keep an extra controller ready on standby. So it’s great when I’m playing for too many hours in one day and the little low battery indicator comes up I can just swap it out for the other. I really love how there is a visual indicator on the dock that shows when it’s fully charged versus when it’s still charging. It also has a pretty snazzy look that fits great with my other decorations.
5,This was a Christmas gift for my hubby. He just got a PlayStation 5 and needed a charging dock and he loves it. It actually works better and looks better than I thought. Extremely satisfied.
5,Works as advertised and looks good while doing it. The lights turn off while the product still functions if that's not a selling point for you as well.
5,Works good. Very nice having my second controller charging since there’s only 1 USB port on the front of the PS5
5,easy setup works well but a little fiddly getting the charging ports to line up (male on the charging station female on the controller)
5,Just want my kids needed to charge controller.  Comes with batteries and charges fast
5,Beautiful style color changing to help you to know if the power is low or ready to use easy to clip the controller on it nice !
5,I like how it displays two controllers at once so they can both be charged after playing. It also matches the PS5's aesthetic.
5,Looks super cool and does the job. What more could you ask for
5,Amazing charger. Amazed by the look of it and how neat it looks with both controllers in it
5,I wanted a charging station for my ps5 controllers since I seem to own the only ps5 that cannot charge it's own controllers. It can charge anything but it's own controllers. So this was a no brainer purchase. The station is super easy to use and I can just plop a controller on it and grab a fully charged one.
5,Excellent charger charge 2 at a time and lights up showing the charge
5,Just got the new Galactic Purple controller so this was nice addition to keep both controllers charged at once. Plus it just looks litty with the led lights.
5,I had one of these for my PS4 controllers so wanted the same for the PS5.  I was very pleasantly surprised on how well it works and ease of use.  I just throw the controllers on it when I'm done and next time I'm good to go.  Good product!
5,Works as expected. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Does exactly what it’s supposed to.
5,I really tried looking for one that was sturdy and good quality and took my chances with this one after reading the reviews.  And man am I happy with my choice.  Feels sturdy and looks very nice next to my PS5 plus it indicates when the controller is charged. Definitely very happy.
5,Was worth every penny! Love how it shows the controllers on front if they are fully charged or not.
5,It works as wonderful as it is advertised. I know exactly when my PlayStation 5 controller is fully charged. For me it takes about 2 and a half hours to fully charge.
5,Simply put it works. No issues so far
5,I’ve been using this charger for a little over a week now and I got to say I love it. It Charges my controllers quickly has a nice design. Also has a on and off power switch on the back. Nice display to show you when the controllers are charging and when they are done charging. The charger does plug into a wall outlet which I do like or you can plug it in through a USB port on the PlayStation with a type C plug. If you are looking for a nice charger for the ps5 I’d definitely recommend this charger from Oivo you will not be disappointed.
4,It charges well and it does have an on off switch my biggest issue with it is if you have grip cover skin on your controller it will not charge it at all. So you gotta remove the grip cover skin in order to charge your controller. It’s too much a hassle and not worth doing for me. Lucky I have another charging station that charges by using the C Type cable instead of the headset slot. I’m going to keep this one as a spare.
5,sleeksturdy and fast changing
5,Sturdy easy to use and very effective in charging controllers. Much better to use this than a controller charging cord.
5,Works just as advertised.  No complaints.  Easy enough for my 5 year old to use.
4,Kids think it’s great however the one initially received the buttons got stuck in and not sure how.  Returned and ordered another which seems fine
5,I highly recommend this dock! The dock feels stable and solid. It weighs just right and it looks similar to the official ps5 charging station with a few extra options such as the led light in the front and the on/off button on the back. The ps5 controllers can be placed right on the top of the dock which I think is a plus versus placing it upside down.  Other things I would say is it's a great space saver and the usb-c charger is genius. It quickly charges your ps5 controllers.
4,First of all this thing is 100% (5 stars) on style.The problem placing the controllers into the charging station is a chore. You have to angle the controller just right to get the controller to seat. The center nub in the controller seat is way too long you can't properly seat the controller unless you angle/position it just right.Great esthetic design but need to revise the controller cradle for easier docking.
5,Simple and straight to the point charger station for your PS5 controllers! Set up in less than a minute. I love the red and blue color indicators for which controller is charged/charging. It automatically shuts off when done so it does not over charge. I saw that the on/off button is actually just to control the lights not the actual station. Love it so far!
5,Excellent product would definitely recommend this to anyone with a ps5.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I love this charger dock. I love being able to just slip the controller on the stand and come back to it. I really don't enjoy leaving my consoles on just to charge controllers. This has been super convent to use. My favorite feature is the ability to turn it off on the back. I like the LED but its a good feature that you can turn them off for when you want to go to bed. Overall great charger dock.
4,Easy to setup just plug it in and switch button on. Handy on/off switch for when not needed for charging. Nice LED lights to let you know when controller is done charging.
3,I really like the look of this product but between the frustration of trying to get the controllers properly docked then the fact that the charge indicator stays red despite the controller being fully charged I am going to return this item. I'm not sure what solution I'll eventually end up with but this ain't it.
4,You've got to fiddle with the controller to connect it so it can charge. Minor annoyance. Everything else works perfectly.
5,I like the look of this product it fits with the black and white PS5 theme and does not stand out as aftermarket. The price is great and it works keeps the controllers charged up and visible so I don't have to mess around with charging cables or losing controllers.
4,I wish the controller sat in the dock better
4,Great for charging the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the controllers don't fit on there very well.  You have to fidget with it to get them to connect.
5,The product has charging indicators to show the customer/user if the controller is ready to use.
4,Good charger does what it needs to do. My only complaint is that it is not compatible with even the thinnest of controller skins. I have to take the skin off my controllers before I am able to charge which becomes tedious after awhile so I have ended up just using cord charger.
4,Good product but can be tricky to get the controllers in since the stalls that the controllers plug into are ver short. All in all this does a good job.
5,This one is 100x better than my previous docking station. Sits really snug and charges fairly fast not sure if it had fast charging built in? My previous dock had USB things you put into the top of the controller and set into the dock upside down and 99% of time it wouldn't charge. It was really loose and just not snug like this one. Since nobody can find Sony docking station this one is worth it especially for the price.
4,Title. this charging set works like a charm. only issue was i didnt realize it only charged up to 70%. Not a big deal because i have a second controller on the way but charges great looks great! WOOO
5,I’ve had the PS5 since Dec. and have been using the Sony dual charger since. The only problem with it is that there is no indicator light when either controller is fully charged. Luckily not only did OIVO make a fantastic dual charger that actually has well lit indicator lights when each charger is fully charged but on top of that it charges just as fast looks just as sharp and all at a fraction of what the Sony one costs. Highly recommended for anyone with the PS5.
5,OIVO's DualSense charging station is fantastic. It's sturdier than Sony's charging station it looks just like Sony's charging station and the controllers feel more secure on OIVO's charging station compared to Sony's.It also has LED indicators to let you know the progress of each controller's charge while Sony's does not. Lastly it's less expensive than Sony's charging station while still feeling like a premium product. I highly recommend purchasing OIVO's charging station over Sony's charging station.
5,Love this product.. The lighting its a beautiful piece of .....
3,Overall it is a functional charger electronic speaking.  Unlike the other chargers I have own through out the years the design of this one is hard to alignment the docking port.  All the chargers I have used on all the different game consoles you can just glide or slide the controlers into docking positions.  This one has no alignment guide for you to align the pins when set it down.  Very poor design in the user-friendly department.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This is a great little alternative to the official PlayStation one. Looks very nice and matches the color of the PS5. Has an on off switch to save energy while not it use. Charges two controllers at once. Comes with power supply and has indicator lights to let you know it’s charging and when it’s finished. Pro tip please off the plastic cover over the lights and it looks even nicer. The docking station charges the controllers pretty fast as well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Esta estacion para cargar es excelente si tienes 2 controles. Cargan bastante rapido. El diseño combina con el PS5 y se ve brutal! Me encanta la luz azul en la estacion es un buen detalle.
4,Well if you don’t mind the light Is a good charge
5,I wasn't skeptical but just wasnt sure how much I would need this. The PS5 cable is short and charging on the fly doesn't work but having this set up by the TV (This charging station fits on a mantle behind your TV) makes charging quick and easy to swap between controllers. Solid Buy!
5,They do a great job is charging our PS5 and PS4 remote. Holds a charge too.
5,These work really great!! They are clear when charged and charging and it’s a nice setup
5,Working as expected no issues thus far
5,The PS5 OEM Sony charger is hard to come by and is overpriced for what it is.  This looks just as good (maybe better with the glowing icons) IMO charges just as fast is built very well and uses the charging tabs built into the DualSense PS5 controllers.  No fumbling in the dark and has a guide to hold them in place.  This is very well designed and comes with the power brick.  For $20 with coupon it's almost a no brainer...
5,This is a good product and so far it has worked without any issues. The charge dock looks nice color matches the ps5 and has an on/off switch. Also of note is the fact that you do not have to turn the controller upside down which is exactly like the oem dock. All around this is a 5 star product for me so far. One quick protip the front led lights have a small film protecting it if you did not notice or if yours is scuffed carefully peel that protective cover off.
3,This charging station looks and charges well! The main Con I have is that the controllers don't connect/lock into the charging dock and are very loosely setting on those charging contacts.
5,Easy to set up easy to charge! Recommend
5,Like the product
5,I absolutely love the aesthetics—clean lines black and white which matches the PS5 perfectly!  LED strips down the side which is perfect for you RGB fanatics.  The controller rests in it like a glove and the indicators on the front panel show the charge status.  Something that may be overlooked but I found as a nice touch is the ability to turn it on/off via the rear switch.  I’ve been using it for a week now and have had ZERO issues!
5,I needed something easy didnt take up a lot of space and wouldn't have a bunch or cords running. We use the ps5 in the family room amd the controllers take some time to power of by themselves and was always left with a dead controller. This item has fixed that
2,1st died after 6 months. 2nd died on arrival. Cheaply made and no quality control what so ever. My advice - stay with the original. What was cheap at first - will cost you more later
5,Works great. Chargers the controllers on the bottom via pressure contacts. Very easy to attach and detach controllers. Will charge one or two controllers at the same time. With the unit switched on the charge lights are blue when finished charging or no controller. The blue light changes to red when charging. Wish the blue lights didn’t stay on all the time. Thankfully the switch on the back allows you to turn off the charger. The USBC wall charger actually is a decent length. Highly recommend.
5,Works perfectly! I actually like that this has a USB-C charger instead of an older style AC adapter like the Sony brand charger. This means I can charge the controllers anywhere with it since that is more universal! In all my tested it seems to work exactly like advertised and I like that you can see if the controller is fully charged or not from display on the front! I would definitely buy again!
5,The first thing that I noticed upon opening the package was that this charging station was not very big. Which is great! It fits perfectly between my PS5 and TV. It has two leds that light up and let you know when your controllers are fully charged. Going from red to blue. It's white and black which corresponds perfectly with the color of the PS5. Overall I am happy with this purchase!
5,Charges quickly good quality would buy again if ever need another one
5,Great item for the money.
4,Came in less than 2 hours! Now to work...
5,The review requires a title.  That seemed good enough.  The base is sturdy and I can keep my controllers next to my couch for easy access.  A well priced accessory that feels like its made from quality materials.
5,So I'm a stickler for things matching when it comes to buying third party accessories but this one nails it! The look feel and color are all a great match for the PS5. USB-C is a huge plus instead of your outdated USB-A. Although I haven't had much time to play my PS5 this product seems to work great and the lights aren't overpowering in the media center. All in all a great buy!
4,This Charger comparable to the official PS5 Controller Charger is very stylish with LED lighting after testing for a week I can confirm that this Charger is a bit faster to get you back into action the only negative I have to mention is the controllers don't fit as snug as they could but for the lower price this issue can be easily overlooked.
5,Very happy with the controllers!
3,Still charges the controllers but the LED display on the front that shows charging status stopped working after 1 day.
5,If you’re in need for an affordable dual charging stand I definitely recommend this one. I love how it matches the system itself pretty well so it doesn’t look weirdly out of place in my setup.  Controllers slides in seamlessly and the handy little led indicators are a plus. I’ve tried other OIVO products in the past like their ps4 charging stand and never had any issues with it. Great sturdy product at a more affordable price.
5,This charger has been a great bonus. With the new ps5 having limited USB ports having to constantly switch between charging headset and controllers and Bluetooth doggie while playing became a pain. This has proven to be a great solution. Plugs into wall socket making it so I have one less thing to switch out. And with 2 controllers I always have one ready to go when the one in use is discharged.
5,Works perfect
5,This is a great charging option for Dual Sense controllers.  It looks good sitting next to the PS5 and has a nice aesthetic that fits with the console color scheme and design.  It charges fast and has very nice indicators to show charging progress.  Definitely recommended.
5,Charges well easy to use. Just place controller(s) on the charger and it lights up to indicate if it is charging or fully charged. Very affordable as well.
5,Really like how it it indicates what slot you're using it a cool little feature. It also stops glowing when it's fully charged so you don't have to guess whether or not it's done. Since a lot of the games I play are still compatible with my dualshock this purchase made sense so I could charge two dualsense controllers at once without needing an extra wire or port for each.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Great charging dock! Super good value...definitely a comparable product in terms of quality and features to the PS brand dock. The design matches the PS5 aesthetic. Charges quickly (under 2 hours) and has LED lights that change from red to blue to indicate that controller is done charging. Would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable and attractive charging dock to match their ps5.
5,So far we are loving this charge station especially with the feature of it charging from from the bottom contact of the controller vs the the top micro USB connector that has a much higher probability of breaking down the road. It looks super sleek next to the PS5 and looks really cool with the light up LED. Totally worth the money! Would recommend to anyone looking for a charging dock.
3,Docked 1 star for the lack of paddle compatibility. Beware for anyone with controllers that have paddles this will not fit onto it as the paddles get in the way.Docked another star for the ease of use. I have to shine a light to line up the sockets with this thing.Definitely not recommending to anyone for that reason alone.
5,This does what it advertises it will do. And the front lights make it easy to know when your controllers are all juiced up and ready to go.
3,Controllers do not simply slot in or sit right on the dock. Often times takes multiple attempts for it to engaged correctly and start charging. Aside from that it looks good and when it charges it works fine.
5,I have both the original Sony dock as well as this one. They look almost identical except this one has lit up indicators showing you if the controller is done charging. This also comes with a detachable usb charger so if there is ever an issue with the cable you can just replace it. Works just as expected would recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This thing is great. You can charge 2 dead controllers up at the same time in about 2 hours. It has a cool interface on the front so you can see your controller's charge staus from a distance. Fits right in with the Playstation 5 and doesn't take up too much room. Awesome product!
5,This charging dock does a great job charging my PS5 controllers! I love that I can fit two controllers on it and there are light indicators that tell you if it’s done charging or not. It also looks so cool and stylish. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a charging dock.
5,They work perfect and charge my controllers to 100% and are quick i recommend
5,I was really surprised by this product.  Not only does it have a nice weight and balance but it charges my controllers effortlessly and is on par with sony's OEM charging product for less money.  I am thankful there are alternatives out there that are this well made and work so well.  I would recommend this product 100%.
5,I absolutely love Oivo products! It’s easy to use unlike some charging docks. No trying to place the controller just right in order for the controller to charge just set the controller on the charging stand and presto it’s charging. I’ve used many charging docks and this is by far the best at a very fair price. I would recommend Ovio to all gamers
5,So I received this product in the mail and have been using it for a couple days now & I have to admit it’s a great item! The price and features totally beat the official Sony one. It had LED indicators a power on Off switch and USB Type C! Pretty awesome I would totally recommend if you were in the market for a DualSense  charging station and want to save money.
5,Ambos pueden cargar cómodamente sus controles
5,I love this charger. Have used it for a few months now and it charges quick and easy. Especially if your port on top doesn’t connect to a cable. It uses the bottom connectors to charge!
5,This product works great! Super easy to just plug in and start charging immediately. The LED indicator showing that it’s fully charged is great. Looks wonderful next to the PS5 as well! I had another similar charger that I didn’t enjoy so I purchased this one and it was a great decision.
5,Got this for me and my boyfriend and we both love it. It charges super fast and is really nice to just put the controllers on the charger. 10/10
5,Love that it tells you when your controller is done charger. Very nice feature and very nice product to get as an alternative to the official Sony product!
5,Awesome deal in my opinion. It came super quickly and I plugged it in right away. It's sleek and fits where I needed it to its flat and therefore feels more stable plus it lights up indicating which controller is still in need of juice- so I never have to guess. It charges even faster than I expected. Great value & quality!
5,Great charger and easy to use.
3,The slightest of bump will knock the controllers right off the device. It works just fine but there is that annoyance.
5,Having to switch on and off is only flaw otherwise it’s great and matches the ps5
5,The charging station is very nice and does the job. The light turn blue when the control is full charge. Very durable material and even has the option on turning off the power while is connected to the outlet. Way better than the stock ps5 station l. Stock station does not have any of the features this station has.
5,This charger can be turned off or on best charger I’ve brought.
4,Nice design and works well.
5,It’s design super close to the original charging dock this one has some extras on it. I love how it completes the look next to the console. Huge plus it comes with its charger and the cable. So far so good!
5,Quite happy with this charging dock! There were quite a few options as far as aftermarket to sift through but the main feature I liked about this one was the LED indicator on the front. The controllers seem to charge quite fast also.
5,At first I was iffy getting a 3rd party charging station because like most of us I’ve had trouble with 3rd party accessories in the past but to my This charging station is the real deal! It doesn’t feel cheap and unlike the Sony official charging station this has lights that show if the controller is charged or not. Very impressed will buy from seller again
3,Will not charge if you have a skin on the controller had to take skin off for it to charge!! Charging prongs on not long enough. As far as charging the controller it charged pretty fast.
5,We had no issues my husband love it the shipping was quick
5,It's very sturdy. Easy to use and very convenient. It also doesn't take to much space.  Like it and will surely recommend 👌.
5,Great product! Only will buy this from now on for my PS5 controllers. I’m stoked on it because even though the PS5 comes with more USB ports it’s more convenient and it matches. And it works well.
3,You have to sit it on just right. Sometimes if you put the controller on here after the ps5 is off it will turn it back on (I though I hit the button the first time but it happened a couple times while I was watching). Now I just put it on charge before powering down. Just buy another cord. You don’t need this it’s just a fancy way to get frustrated
5,I would highly recommend this product to PS5 users. It really charges my PS5 controller in 2 hrs like it said it would. My favorite feature is the on and off switch on the back of it so you don't have to worry about your controller over charging. It is worth the money!!!
5,So far so good i brough two one for me and one for my brother. I like that it doesnt feel cheap its sturdy and you have the option of turning off light and continue charging the controllers. It charges as advertised. Plus it looks like an official docking charger looks good side by side of the PS5
5,Me encanto fácil de usar y carga rápido
5,I'm not sure why my PS5 struggles to charge my controllers. I leave one plugged into the console and noticed that it did not charge at all. The front port worked for awhile better than the back ports but not for long. This station really works and I am happy I bought it.
5,Exacto que la foto y excelente
5,Excelente
2,It works and it charges fast enough. But trying to position the controllers on this is annoying in itself and becomes infuriating when trying to mount them without disturbing the other controller. The controllers just sit there in a flimsy position that is also incredibly annoying to line up without fumbling around for like 5 to 10 seconds each time. They should really add some sort of back plate to help line the controllers up and reduce wobbling.
3,It is difficult to line the controllers up to this charger and it’s easy for them to get bumped out of place.Yes if you’re looking at it and take your time with it it’s “easy” - but previous controller docks that I’ve used have had some sort of snapping in/sliding mechanism that makes it easier to plop your controller on.Sounds like a nitpick but even after months of use I still can’t put the controllers away without some fiddling with the positioning.
5,The sleek design matches the PS5 perfectly. The blue led light to indicate the charge status of the controllers is perfect. I'd highly recommend this item to anyone who has a PS5. Compliments the system very well.
4,So far it works as expected.
5,*Update*The product was just faulty but the company has been really great about reaching out and correcting the issue. A+ for excellent customer service.*Original*It looks good but one of the blue lights have already faded. The port with the faded light still holds the charge.
5,Good product. Controllers are charged 100% every time.
5,Like how easy it was to set up and it looks good with the leds next to my Ps5
5,The charging station is great. The LED display let's you know when the controller is done charging. It's small enough that it doesn't hardly take up room on my end table.
5,This product works great! Easy setup and the power cable is USB-C and removable. The official charger by Sony is basically impossible to get ahold of due to scalpers.It also looks great and has the same styling/color as the PS5 and controllers.
5,I like the speedy charge/recharging the unit provides. The layout that allows me to pick up either one I choose to use. The illuminated display helps me to see which is changed and ready to go.
3,Item is good quality. I wish it had a usb style plug not a great option if you’re running short on open outlets. The LED light is very bright which is a bit of an issue when used in the bedroom once lights get turned off but I fixed this with a small piece of electric tape.
3,Overall works well  can be a pain to get the controller set in the right place to charge
5,This products is slim and sleek and works great! Quick charging is a must and this product delivers. We have recommended this product to multiple friends with ps5s. This is a must buy!
3,It's a bit of an awkward fit for the controllers but once you get them on properly it seems to charge fine.  Doesn't work at all for custom controllers with back paddles because of the awkward design.  Fine for normal controllers but curious if there's better options for custom controllers
5,Easy to use no controller attachments won’t fry your controllers. Full charge in like 2 hours! Highly recommend!
5,This charger is so much better than the “official” one. Simple to dock quick charging time and it’s a better product at a better price. I had the PlayStation one preordered but I cancelled it for this one and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase!
5,Does it's job great  charger
5,Use it for my PC gaming and have it setup on my stand right next to very quick and easy to use
5,Absolutely love it! Super small and sleek design easy to set up and love how well it matches the ps5 design! Only TINY problem is nothing really locks in the controller so it could be easily knocked off but the charger itself is very sturdy!
5,This charger works great. It's the third brand I've tried and by far the best. These fit the ps5 controllers perfect and I love that it has the block built into the cord.
5,This thing works wonders.  Have had it for a while. And nothing has gone out or stopped working. The style is what drew me in and it looks amazing  just like the pictures. Do get this!!
5,Very simple nice multi-color display clearly shows the charge status for each controller from across the room. The style nearly matches the PS5 as well. This is a great alternative to the rare Sony brand dual charger. I'd highly recommend it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Absolutely love this charging dock. Does exactly what I need it to do and looks great next to the console. I love that there is a clear lighted indicator letting me know when my controllers are fully charged. I can't recommend it enough.
5,Plug and play ready does what it’s supposed to.  Looks good next to the ps5 and works as advertised.
5,Great product for the price! Highly recommended!
5,I love it. So easy to use. Docking my controllers is so easy.
5,Awesome charger for the price
5,Ive really enjoyed it so far. I like how the colors change depending on the charging status and the fact that it is easy to take in out of of the dock. Charging is nice and effective would recommend to others.
5,Great product... As good as the original playstation OEM version but better. Also with one click you can turn it all off. Has weight as well so it will stick in place.
3,Llego bien empacado y todo pero la pantalla frontal venia con rayones pequeños como si ya hubiera sido usado. Igual el producto funciona muy bien
5,I like that you got exactly what you paid for and it works great.
5,Very easy to use and very compact. Saves you from always having to get up to charge your controller via the ps5 directly.
5,It's a very sleek and simple design that matches the PS aesthetic. It works well to charge 2 controllers at a time. The lights are a nice addition to make it easy to see if they're charged from a distance.
5,I love the blue leds and display that show you if the controller is charged or not. It has a sleek look and compliments my Ps5. This charger is durable and a great value for the price. It my primary Ps5 controller charger from now on.
2,Very poor design doesn’t easily slide into the cradle.  Each remote has to be at the perfect angle and position for it to charge.  My kid end up using the old usb single charger because it’s too much work to get it on right.
2,Purchased in October for a Christmas present for my husband.  Gave it to him on Christmas and it just stopped working in April. I was hoping to get more use than 4 months out of it...
1,Just received this Charger Station a few minutes ago and it appears that the included power adapter is defective.  I've tried it several times with different outlets but to no avail.  Using the PS5 USB controller cable does power up the station and it appears to work correctly so again leading me to believe the issue is a faulty power adapter.  I have contacted Oivo and am currently awaiting a response.Update 2022-07-14: Oivo Customer Support was not very helpful at all.  They didn't respond to my email at all.  And their web chat which is not a "live" chat also proved frustrating.
5,Fair price quick delivery On Off switch is great feature and durable casing-item works as it should.
5,There is nothing to dislike as the item works exactly as they said it would.  Thank you.
5,Es muy práctico en tamaño tiempo en cargar y enciende la luz al conectar el remoto para saber cuando se cargó en su totalidad. Es recogido y fácil de ubicar en cualquier espacio.
5,This is easy to use! Love that it has the lights that show you which remote is done charging. Our reg cable stopped charging the controllers and this worked! Would buy again. Great price.
5,Though this is only my first day using it I can already tell this is a great product. The lights on it look great and it charges my controller very quickly. Overall I like it and I would recommend it.
5,Well the charger works as intended. It's worth noting that it does not charge when the controller is full. It works well enough but I wish the controller was secured a little better. It sorta just floats on the charger.
5,The OIVO Dual Charge for PS5 Controllers works perfectly and matches the colors of my new PS5. I will continue to buy from OIVO from now on. I will also recommend PS5 and other console accessories to family and friends.
5,I got this DS5 charger after an unhappy experience with a different brand. The other one was difficult to align the controller properly. This charger doesn’t have that problem. Placing the controller on it is a breeze.
2,I like the look of the charger but there are aspects of the functionality that are sub par.  The device only charges the controller up to 80%.  It is difficult to line it up and place it on the small nub and to connect it to charge.
5,Works perfectly I did extensive research and this brand stood out. Love the design and happy about the quality.  5 stars.  The dock also has charging protection to ensure the longevity of the battery.
5,Charges the controllers comes with a plug-in charger unlike most others and looks great next to PS5.
5,Great product and great substitute for Sony’s charging station. Super easy to use and plug in the LEDs are super helpful. Recommend this product!
3,Nothing amazing about the charger. The controllers can be tricky to sock. It's not really a drop in and walk away setup. There is a particular angle to get it to sit right and charge.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love how compacted is and how easy it is to use. I would recommend it to everyone. It’s cheep so you can get it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It charges the controllers in 2 hours and also has the led indicators for when the controller is charged. The charging dock is great quality.
5,This charging station is awesome! I love the techy look to it. Shoutout to Oivo for making a great product.
5,So easy to throw my controller on it to charge everyday and works perfectly. Charges the controllers fast too!
5,Super easy setup. Just plug in and turn on. Cool design just like the PS5. Would definitely recommend.
5,This is great it matches the console as if it came with it. The product has an indicator that changes color once fully charged
3,It looks cool and charges well.  After only 1 month however the front lights that show the controller plugged in and charging went out. It still works though
4,Good product for the value.
5,I really like the display on the front.
5,Great purchase ! Charges quickly and looks great paired with the PS5. Thank you!
5,Works very well as advertised. Controllers connect and charge easily
5,Good product!I have no problem with this charger. It works well and really affordable. I recommend you to have it for PS5 controller charging station.
5,This PS5 charging station is portable and effective. Fast charging and looks great too!
3,Hard to pair PS5 products highly overrated for the cost should have waited
5,Great product. Charges my controllers quick and it looks nice next to the PS5
5,Ease of use. Sturdy materials
5,Absolutely love this product. It is good quality and charges the controllers easily. I really like how it looks very good aesthetic when they were planning this product.
5,Works perfect ! My son loves it !
5,Easy set up controllers charges fast
5,Works well.  Recommend this design instead of how controllers plug in over the other option.  Durable enough that my 12 year old has not managed to break it with daily use.
5,It's nice to look at and charges the controllers quickly. Saves me from having to leave my PS5 on standby to charge them. Great purchase!
5,Awesome charger for my PS5 controllers. I love the fact that it has a visual indicator for your charge plus the blue leds on the sides are a nice touch.
5,This is a great charger worked perfect for what we needed!
5,It's great! I would recommend it to anyone it's got a button in the back to turn the digital display on or off if you choose too see the charging status or not.
5,Great for the money  no problems thus far
4,Be careful putting on base it is a bit wobbly. Charges fast.
5,Visually aesthetic when sitting next to your console works perfectly and wonderful with the red/blue remote charge indicator.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Been testing for a few days now great product delivers on satisfaction and design. Couldn’t ask for more!
5,Would buy again
5,Charges nicely with indicators and easy to set up. Also has a off switch when I don't want to use it but can still hold my controllers
5,It’s a great product! Came packaged as shown on Amazon! I would definitely recommend this product to a friend or anyone who needs a charging dock for their PS5 controllers!
5,Seems to work well is stable the included charger is handy and the lights being optional is awesome.  Only minor complaint is no USB out to charge other things.
5,Nice looking design and charges fast all around I like it
5,Easy to install easy to charge !! Great for kids to charge there controller !!!
5,the controllers fit on nicely charges fast. very good second option to the sony ones.
5,just got mine in today and all i got to say is it works so good! charges the controllers perfectly and it looks great set up next to my ps5! 10/10 charging station highly recommend.
5,Great option for charging controllers when the PS5 is turned off!
5,Works perfect very high techEasy to use my 11 year old loves it !
5,Such a good charger it charges them super fast I love it I ordered a different one and hardly charges them. Great product!
5,Love this charger dock it’s best part it is a plug not a usb block so easily used will definitely unused them again
5,Seems to be charging and working great
5,Hey its a product that does what its supposed to do without having any problems.What more could you ask for? Lol
5,Love this! Now I can finally charge two controllers at a time 😊
5,My boys love the convenience
5,Charger is perfect and a space saver. My daughter had wires everywhere with the charger I eliminated 2 of them.
2,I had high expectations for this item because of the reviews so I decided to get it for my boyfriend. Turns out that the back one doesn’t work he has to be moving it for it to charge but it doesn’t last long until it stops working again. Very disappointed.
5,Purchased this because the Sony one was out of stock. Plugged it in and it worked first time with no issues. Glad I found this product.
5,Overall works great so far.  Will need to see over the long run - but does what it should look good and works
5,Charges the controllers fast and looks great
5,Affordable Has a light for each controller when it's charging good size.
4,It’s ok
5,Great item fast shipping and excellent communication. Thank you!
4,Loved the design! And charges great
5,Works well. Looks similar to the other PlayStation branded one at a better price.
5,Don't wait for Sony's charger. This one matches the equipment and does the job. Had it for over a month now.
5,Grandson has a PS5 and wanted this so he could charge both of his controllers at the same time. He is pleased I am happy!
5,Great product. Charges fast. Only downfall is that the charging light stays on constantly but not bothersome enough to not get 5 stars.
5,Exactly as advertised quick charge and looks good!
5,Simple to use.it also comes with a on or off switch just incase u want to turn off works perfect well worth the 30
5,It's not the original but it still works very good.I love it
5,The charging dock works great.  Love the low profile that keeps my controllers looking neat and fully charged.
5,It worlds perfectly!
5,Third party charge station that absolutely serves its purpose. Great alternative to the sold out official Sony model.
5,Good quality
5,Love the way it looks next to the PS5. Grat price great product.
5,Excelente muy fácil de usar y carga bien rápido
5,Works amazing and charges fast. Would highly recommend buying. Looks great too.
5,Charges controllers quickly and is easy to use. Good price makes it worth it
5,Works great and has A cool design when it's charging.
5,Works very well
5,Have no complaints! FAST charger!!
5,
5,Seems to be working well! I like the design  and how it matches the Ps5!
2,Charges fast but 2 months later won't work at all. Refund nowhere to be found fml
5,Great purchase.
2,Charges well and quickly but controller is extremely loose on charging stand. It is also difficult to get lined up correctly to charge and falls off easily. A magnetic clip or other mechanism to hold in place would make this so much better
5,Great a Look that matches the ps5! Works fast and affordable. A must buy for PS5 owners!
5,It was working fine and now it’s not
5,Great dual charger for my controllers.
5,Best controller charger i ever used im definitely buying from them again
5,This item works great
5,Works great and there’s an on/off switch. This also matches the PS5 colors.
2,The controllers do not click into place in any fashion the notches are very faint and easily become disconnected from the slightest touch. The similar Xbox charger I have lets the controllers settle into place far more securely
5,Works fine without a cover on your controller.
5,Nice product
2,While it charges fine it's nearly impossible to put the controllers on. The docks are too shallow to easily line up
5,Works great!I like the style of this.
5,Excelente inversion
5,It's small and perfect
5,Works great and looks to be great quality!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Absolutely a easy and affordable Ps5 dual sense charger 👍🏾
5,It just sits there and charges the controllers.  It is great!
5,Charges my controllers.  What more can I say.
3,El sistema de recarga es compatible con PS5 pero tiene algunos puntos de mejora sobre todo en el anclaje de los controles. Se caen fácilmente o al moverlos pierden la conexión con el cargador
5,Works great so far. Looks like a match to the PS5.
5,He like it
5,Great charger! Works perfectly with the PS5
5,Product Works Phenomenal Would Definitely Recommend It
5,Works well to charge both controllers.
5,Picture perfect
5,amazing works great charges fast
5,Works great and looks good.
5,Looks clean and works great
5,Charges fast & works great
3,The plastic material used for the front display can be scratched with your fingernail alone. If that's something that would bother you don't buy this.
2,Lights on the front that indicate charging have gone out after just a couple months. Still charges the controllers but I don't expect it to last must longer with this build quality.
2,ME LLEGO DAÑADO LO CONECTE Y SOLO CARGA UNO DE LOS DOS CONTROLES NO RECOMENDABLE
2,hard to get controller to set on charging port
1,It stopped working after only 2 weeks. It switches on but does not recharge the controllers
2,When I received the package it looks like it already has been used. There are some scratches that appear on the screen.
1,It worked great for 6 months but now it doesn’t charge the remotes anymore. Only the light come on.
1,The cord worked for just over a month then it quitBuy a different brand
1,The product was shown with an ac adapter and the description stated that it comes with an ac adapter but it did not and when I contacted the seller I was told that it does not.  Do not purchase if you want to plug the charger into an ac outlet.
2,This charger looks kind of cool but the controllers do not securely fit onto it. The controllers are very easy to dislodge from the charger. The charger also charges the controllers very slowly.
1,this was advertised as a charger station for a ps5 on the amazon website.  This is a lie.  It says P5 on the box which of course doesn't exist.  They are trying to deceive and obviously it worked on me although I am returning it.
1,Did the job for a year then just completely stopped working. No charge nothing. Consider spending a little more to get one that won’t fail after basic use.
1,Product looks good look sturdy price is fair. But when I receive the product it did not charge the controller on the front charging space. Sent back got different product. Take your chance!
1,Cable connection broke before I could even use the item. The connection between the base and cable broke when setting it up. Poor quality.
1,Thought this would have been a great gift for my brothr. Sadly it shortened out as soon as he placed 1 ps5 controlon it. Had to return.
1,Not charging for some reason; It worked for at start but currently it is NOT charging the controllers.Since it is oversea order returning it will cost more
5,Easy to use great value for the money worth every Penny charges faster than expected
1,Controllers can stand and charge easily I need to move controllers and find the correct position for them to charge. This simply doesn't work.
1,The box actually listed it as "P5" not PS5 and it does not fit the PS5 chRgers
1,I have only had this for a couple weeks and it has completely stopped working will not charge. will not even light up.(Garbage)
1,Does not charge controllers. I have a similar charger of a different brand and it works flawlessly. Would not recommend. Would not buy again.
1,It look good when it came in. But once I opened it I wanted to use it and once I put the contollers in it felt very wobbly. It was not stable at all. Does not even work.
1,Wobbly connection to the controller. Even if you touch it while it's charging a controller the controller will lose contact and will not charge. Look elsewhere.
1,This thing powered on but does not charge any controller I place on it. I've toggled the powere switch on and off still nothing. The blue controller lights don't work either. Disappointing.
1,Stopped working after just a few weeks!
1,It worked well for a short time but stopped charging the controllers after only having it for 4 months. Very disappointed.
1,Breaks down in 2 months
1,Worked great at first but 45 days into owning it the power cord no longer worked and of course I can't return it after 30 days. I would not suggest buying this charger!
1,The charging port on the station will not connect with the controller if the controller has some skin/cover over it.
1,The charging dock stops working just after one day of use
1,cheap don't buy! stop working after 4 monthsdo your homework and buy something better
1,Plugged it in lights on the front came on for a total of 30 minutes and hasn’t worked since. Trash product.
1,Only last a week wouldn’t recommend.
1,Prongs don't make contact with controller anymore and wont charge them basically a paperweight
1,None of the LED indicators work and I just received the package today. Very disappointing.
1,We were sent a used device
1,Sent back for refund going on two weeks now no refund. Stay away
1,After 1 1/2 months this no longer works. Sad…
1,Bad
1,Does not work well with PS5 controllers.
5,i like the design and color and the fact that it charges without issue price was good also
3,Good for the price however can be difficult to “seat” the controllers.
5,Works really well charging my controllers and is just so cute! For the price it was such a great buy!
5,Amazing not only does it work very well to charge to controllers very quickly but also looks super sleek. It matches the PS five shelf perfectly the LED lights are super solid
2,This product works conveniently and charges remotes. However I have experienced issues while using my remotes after using this charger for a week. My remote sometimes functions improperly. I believe it is because the remotes require the charging station from Sony. Good news is the Sony charging station is only a few bucks more than this one.
3,Not sure if the one I got has a problem but it actually takes some wiggling around in order for it to be angled just right to get it to charge. There's no click into place (not that I really expected one) but having to pick the controller up set it down multiple times or press down on the controller for it to start charging is annoying. After that I'm afraid to even bump into it less it knocks out of place even a bit and I have to readjust again. Once its actually charging it's fine. The overall style is nice and I like the screen showing the red / blue as charging / charged. But wish I didn't have to shift it around to get it to work properly.
5,Having picked up multiple controllers I needed a sleek and functional way to charge my controllers. It being hard to find the official PlayStation 5 Controller Charging Station I decided to try something of equal quality and I am glad I did. The Oivo PS5 controller charging station functions as you would expect without any issues. There is also a indicator on the front the charging station to let you know where your charging progress is. This is a nifty feature if you have this charging station inside a tv stand and not on top. Will definitely keep my eye on other products from this manufacturer.
5,This is a cheap alternative to the shelf models at the store... But it doesn't appear to be cheaply made. There are no extra components to hook to your controller. Just set it in the tray and let it charge. You may have to wiggle it a little to get the connection at times but it's really not hard.I haven't tested how fast it charges but I can confirm after a long play session just drop it on the cradle and it's charged when I wake up!
5,I loved the look of this right out of the box as it has the same shape and color scheme of the PS5. It is easy to setup with just a power cable connected to the back. All you do is flip the switch on the back to on and with ease place a remote or two down to charge. When it’s lit up red that means it’s charging and blue means good to go! It has the same charging speed as the official Sony charging base and is $5 cheaper! Not to mention it’s in stock and available to buy now. Highly recommend this for any PS5 owner
5,I love how they work right with my PS5 meaning the lights that show up when charging almost like a heart beat and shows up as a red light shape of a controller and with the smart chip when fully charged the lights turn blue. Not to mention the fast charging adapter that charge controllers faster. As for me it looks like it goes with my PlayStation nicely done at a outstanding price
5,Aesthetically awesome design with the LED indicators for the controller battery life and the black and white theme to match the ps5 with the blue LED lights running through the sides very similar to Sonys though it is a little bigger but feels nice to hold very sturdy feels high quality. I also appreciate the on/off switch on the back of the stand. Another thing I love is being able to sit the controller on the dock similar to Sony’s design as opposed to having to flip the controller upside down like other products sold on Amazon I do typically tend to struggle sitting the controllers on the Sony branded but this one is easier to place on the stand for sure. Otherwise My controllers have been charging perfectly fine for over a week now. If you’re looking to pay less than what people are asking for the oem design this is the best alternative.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This Oivo accessory is excellent for charging the Playstation 5 controls this dual charging dock is designed to charge two PS5 controllers at the same time the charger is adapted with a protection for your controls the red LEDs turn blue when they reach 80% battery  It is a very good quality accessory it is resistant this accesorie comes with a power adaptor I recommend it 100%
4,I this this is a perfect charger for those that do not plan to use controller attachments such as paddles. Sleek and well made. Charges fast and easy to connect controller. I did particularly like the status icon on the front to indicate when controllers are fully charged. I would definitely recommend if you do not intend to use attachments.
4,Works great BUT only problem is I’m having to take my silicone protection covers off my controllers in order for the base to detect that they are on the dock. That SUCKS!
5,Looks great with the PS5 works well controller sits nice and flush and the colors scheme in the lighting is great 👌🏻
5,I works fine looks neat and lets you know when the controller needs to be charged by lightning up red instead of blue.
5,Great alternative to charge your PS5 controllers looks awesome next to my PS5 lights up with same color as the PS5 can't go wrong
5,Exelente base de carga para los dualsense de ps5
5,Works great on PS5 controllers works with built in charging mechanism so you don’t have to add a connector like other products.
5,Works perfectly and charges the controller with no issue! I love how it has an indicator showing when it’s charging and when it’s full. Great product!
5,The first thing I always break when I get a new controller is drop it on the front charging port constantly so I needed a secondary charging option this is it and works great
4,I like how you can tell if the controller is charged or not
5,I love this product. Super easy to set up and super easy to use. I've had this product for about a week now and I can't stop using it every second. I can't thank the company enough for allowing me to test this product out. I love everything about this item!!!
5,Excelente cargador con indicador de carga muy buena calidad cargador rápido y muy económico.
5,I like that it shows what control stick is charging. Only thing that I would say I don’t like it takes some time for them to completely charge.
5,Perfecto diseño una chulada
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This charging station delivered! It looks great with the LED charging indicators that you can turn off and on not to mention the lightning fast charging speed! I really loved that it has the USB-C wall plug to give you that speedy recovery and safe with the surge protection for both controllers. If you game daily and more than 2 hours a day this is the way to go!
5,For the price I wasn’t expecting much but this is the best Dual Sense charging dock I’ve seen.  Better than the Sony one and it’s fast!  I don’t think it even took two hours to fully charge a dead controller.  It also looks cool with the blue LED lights and the slow “breathing” one on the charging indicator in front.  All of which can be turned off if that’s your preference.  I’m glad I bought this.
5,Super útil para no tener los controles regados organiza y decora...
4,This is great except if you have the silicone covers on your controller it will not charge them. I had to return for this reson.
5,Works great and an amazing price! Looks nice next to my tv and it’s awesome that you can turn it on or off. Controllers fit nicely on and it’s not hard to get them to “lock in” for charging. Must buy for a new ps5 never have to worry about not having a charged controller again.
5,Easy to use simple instructions plug in and use.
5,I always wanted for of these for my ps4. Now that I got the ps5 I decided it was time to make the purchase. This one is a better price than the og Sony variation. I like how this one resembles the actually ps5 and has lights that show when the controllers are charging. I highly recommend this product both for looks and functional
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I recently got myself the OIVO Charger Station for the PS5. I got tired of only charging my controllers one at a time and then having to be connected to the console to do so. My gaming area is messy enough as it is with all the cables.I love how the color scheme of the charger station totally matches the PS5 and I can’t help but appreciate blue led strips on it and the red/blue indicators that show the charging status.My controllers are usually fully charged within two hours. This definitely helps when I plan to have a long day of gaming.And it helps with the clutter in my gaming area since I can now charge my controllers anywhere in my house.A wonderful accessory for the PS5 and recommended for those who plan on doing a lot of gaming!
4,I like this product a lot! The only downside is that is does not charge my controller with the cover on so I constantly have to take it on and off.
5,Great
4,Hard to get the right position so it would charge lol. Cable wasn't that long either. But I did figure you can substitute the USB Type C to any other USB Type C and it would still work. Only tested it once with my PS5 Type C cable that was connected to my PS5 though.UPDATE: (01/13/2022)- Well after getting some time on it it's pretty good. The fact that it still works when I turned it off so that the PSN Logo on the front is not so bright on my room is great. Another plus on this product is that you can substitute the USB-Type C cable that connects on the port on the back with another USB-Type C and it'll still work is another great thing about this. When I took off the original charging adapter with a regular USB-Type C to Lightning Cable and plug in the Lightning Cable to my PC the USB-Type C to the back port of the charging port it still works! One thing I'd don't really like from the product is the magnet when you charged your PS Controller its not as strong so if you bump your controller it'll probably fall off easily.
5,This is a great charging station for the PS5. I love the charge indicator lights and that the controllers go on so easy. Overall I’m very satisfied with this product.
5,N/A
5,We finally managed to get a ps5 and had difficulty with charging the remotes. Both remotes had issues so before I had to replace the remotes or charging cords I decided to give this a try. It was shipped in 1 day and I immediately set it up.  Problem solved!!! Now I have 2 remotes fully charged and good to go.I recommend this to all the players for its ease of use and how cute it is but I highly recommend it to those who have issues with charging their remotes.
5,Excellent item.
5,N/A
5,Awesome fast charging for PS5 Controllers.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Works well and functions good just doesn't work well with my controller grips so I might have to find a different charging station
1,The pictures are exactly how I received this product. Opened (box seal cut) and what appears to be poorly repackaged (see pictures) I ordered this bc the official chargers seemed too expensive for me. But when I ordered this (less expensive) option I was not expecting to receive this quality of experience. Now I’m not sure how long life I’ll have with this charger since it appears to be used. I completely understand and respect “getting what you paid for” but When you order new condition items one should receive that. Very disappointed and will prob just spend the money on an official license Charger.
5,
5,I needed a way to charge more than one controller at a time and I also hated only charging them when the ps5 was on. So far this charger has been wonderful. It charges the controllers pretty fast and I haven’t had any problems with it yet. I also like that I can plug it into an outlet so I don’t have to worry about the ps5 being on or in standby mode. I will echo the same as others have said about it being a little hard to get the controllers to sit right but that’s not a huge issue.
5,Great for charging controller always ready when I game
5,Works great!!!!
5,Seems to work well. Nice and clutter free of cords.
5,Works as intended. So far so good.
5,Very nice non OEM pS5 controller charging stand. Had it for over a year and it works without question every-time. The only thing is the indicator lights on the charger itself aren’t what I would call reliable. But you can tell the state of charge on the controller instead. Definitely worth getting over the Sony version no question what-so-ever.
5,This thing is awesome not only a holder for the controllers but a charger too and the LEDs look amazing
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love this charger. It charges my controller quickly and is very efficient.
5,Takes several attempts to get the controller to dock with the station. I feel if they used the front side of the controller it would have been much better. It charges good and thankfully has a sensor tells the station when the controller is full so it stops charging. I do like the on off switch on the back so if that blue light bothers you when not in use you can easily turn it off
5,This charger is sturdy easy to use and much less expensive than the official PS5 charger. I haven't had any problems with it after several months of use.
5,very easy to use and set up.
5,Easy to use a little hard to put controller in right position
5,The quality of the dock is great doesn't feel like weak plastic. Controllers sit on the dock perfectly and are charged fairly quickly. You can charge either one or two controllers and the dock will stop charging once they are full to avoid over charging. It also doesn't take up much space. I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to the Sony version.
5,Great to just sit and let it charge vs getting the cord out and plugging it up! Both of your controllers can charge while your sleep or not home.I let mines charge overnight  wake up and turn it off. Easy peasy no hassle and ready to play when u are! Get it!!
5,it's a good charger especially no need to use an extra connector.Pro:- charging indicator- no extra connector needed- come we power adaptorCon:- no easy to put on the charger every time need a certain angle
5,Really can’t be beat on price. The thing works perfectly.
5,Indicator lights recharge speed and an easy setup were a huge factor in my purchase decision and this product had everything that I was searching for. Looks were not a part of my decision but the product's styling matches to the ps5 very well.
5,Easy to use.  Charges perfectly.
5,wonderful controller dock.I am notorious for letting anything that doesn't have dock die so this has been a super useful blessing
5,Charger works well and love the lights to indicate when it is charging
5,I love it its better than I expected it to be. It was a gift for my brother and now I might gift it to other people. The color is the same as the ps5 so it looks like a set plus if you have two controllers you are gonna have another one ready to go if one is low battery./ Me encanta es mejor de lo que esperaba. Era un regalo para mi hermano y ahora puede que se lo regale a otras personas. El color es el mismo que el ps5 así que parece que vinieron juntos así si tienes dos controles siempre tendrás uno listo cuando el otro se descargue.
5,Needed a charger for both remotes & this works great
5,This was a great value for such a nice looking QUICK charger. The controllers mount perfectly and smoothly. All the light accents make this a great look I bought 2 for my ps5's.
5,This product made my PS5 game setup much more organized than before and it works great as promised. I don't have to worry about looking for a cord when my controller needs to be charged. I made a great buy on this one!!
5,This is great for keep both of my controllers charged at all times! Charges from low to full really fast! I also love the light that tells you if the controllers are charging or not.
5,I love it we just plug it into the console instead of using another wall outlet. And it looks great
5,Works perfect
5,The cost was really good easy to use got my son one as well
5,I really like the product! Very easy to use. Makes my life easy.
1,Got this charging station on Christmas and it only last a couple of weeks. First the front light didn't work properly you needed to shake the station to turn it on. Now the device doesn't light up nor charges the controllers. What a waste!!!!
5,Charger works great just make sure you have the controller on the nozzle to activate it but it definitely works fine.
5,Great product 100% recommended
5,very useful
5,Thank u
5,Works as advertised charges my remotes within 2 hours couldn't be happier
5,Love it
5,My controller didn't come with a USB charging cable so I'm very glad I decided to get this! Set-up was super easy you just have to plug it in then turn it on. I've only got one controller but you can easily fit two on here if needed. And it looks nice! The white sides kinda clash with my black pc but I'm not a stickler when it comes to aesthetics so no biggie.
4,Overall good product for the costs. It works as described but can be tricky to tell whether the controller is in properly. If the controller is low on battery power you will see the indicator turn red when charging. When the controller is almost full you might think it's charging but it might not be fully in. It takes some playing around with to make sure the controller is charging.
5,Awesome Purchase
5,I got exactly what I wanted in this charger station. Easy to use affordable and it looks great next to my ps5. Highly recommend.
5,This charging station is great simply plug in to an outlet turn it on and place your controller onto the stand accordingly.Can be turned off or on with a single switch controller can be on or off.Been using for a month with no problems.
5,I purchased a PS5 controller charging station for my fiance and he absolutely loves it! We've been looking for one since he got his system and it fits perfectly on our TV console and doesn't take up uneeded room. Shipping was fast and the package was in perfect condition I'll definitely be recommending your shop to others!
5,This controller charger is perfect. There are no adapters or dongles to attach to the controller. It simply sits on the contacts and is well guided into position.  There are controller icons on the front of the unit that glow red when charging and blue when full.  I have two controllers and this will enable me to have one constantly ready to go when the other runs out of juice.  I couldn't be more pleased.Also well done on having the charge port being USB-C.  The adapter that comes with it works great but it is nice to know it will be easy to replace if I lose it in a move.
5,The LED indicator in the front is very useful.  The use of the native charging ports and the inclusion of an AC adapter is nice since it frees up a USB for charging the controller.  Also a must have for multiple controllers!
5,Great product
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Best charging station I’ve seen since the Sony one is sold out! Also the price is fair and the design is unique but stays true to the ps5 theme! I also like the led symbols in the front and the fact it came with a usb c cable.
5,It’s so compact and charges with no additional wires. When charged the controllers can sit with no additional power going to them so it’s a nice way to keep track of them in a house of 5 kids!
5,Recipient requested the item!
5,The screen in the front helps out to see if the charger is working or not I would love to see magnetic charge stations
5,The biggest difference between this charger and most other chargers is that it uses a 5V 3A AC adapter. According to Sony DualSense 5 chargers takes an input up to 5V 1.5A. In other words this charger perfectly matches up and uses the full charging potential of the controllers. It also uses the charging ports under the mic on the controller so you don't have to plug in one of those little USB-C adapter you see in other chargers. This is probably the closest you can get to the original DualSense 5 charger which I don't even think you can buy as of this writing.To clear one of the confusions many people are having what it meant by "does not charger if the battery is above 70%" DualSense 5 controller itself actually has a safety mechanism that prevents the battery to start charging if the controller still has at least 70% battery *when it is first plugged in to ANY charger*. Therefore once you put your controller (with less than 70% battery) onto the charger it will charge the controller to 100%. So no worries there.Overall performance is impeccable. It's also easier to put the controller on it than my old one which uses the USB-C port instead. I did my research and had my first-hand experience with it so I can assure you this is the one you want if you're looking for a PS5 controller charger.
5,This is very convenient. Before this I would only be able to charge one of my controllers with a cord. Now I can place both on there and have two fully charged in a short time
5,Charger is perfect easy to use and charges quickly.
5,Charges really fast and looks great the led screen lets you know when your joystick is ready for gaming
3,I found it interesting right away that the box calls it a "P5" controller. Then I see a statement at the bottom of the box that says it only charges to 70%. I went through the listing and nowhere does it mention it only charges to 70%. The listing just repeatedly says "charges within 2 hours". Also while it IS good build quality its so lightweight that even on a glass surface the bottom rubber does not hold the stand in place. The weight of the power cord moves it around. I feel extremely fooled by this listing and will be returning this just out of principle.
5,This is a very good purchase! Just put both controllers on at night and they are both ready to go next day. Only wish I had ordered sooner.
5,Son thrilled with it.
5,The controllers fit in the charging station. Everything works great.
5,I really like it. I will turn off the power switch when I don’t use it but I love the way it looks.  The charger is pretty fast as well.
5,It does the Job forsure I have no complaints It resembles the PS5 it looks great near it it charges well and it has an off switch so you can leave your controllers docked with out it over charging it becomes a cool stand near your PS5 I would highly recommend this item
5,Works great you should get one
5,Just as advertised.  A dual charger that works great for a great price.  Perfect product.
5,Gift user loves charger
5,Excelente  yes
1,Lights never blinked or indicated charging as they're supposed to and it did not charge the controller at all. I double-checked instructions to make sure and it's definitely faulty.
5,So far so good! I like it! Simple.
5,Great charging station. Son wanted for gift. I love that the controllers are now in one place
5,Managed to get our hands on a ps5 before Christmas and picked up this charger along with another controller. So far (~1 month) the charger works as advertised and charges two controllers well. It’s simple enough and takes advantage of the alternative charging pins instead of the usbc port. This makes it a bit clunky to seat in the charger but it’sa short learning curve to make it work well. The charger indicator on the front are a nice feature to tell you when it’s done charging. Only time will tell about its robustness but our first impressions have us happy with the purchase.
5,Just the right thing at the right time for my PS5 controllers. Light and easy to use.
5,Christmas gift
5,👍🏼
5,Carga rapido y es comodo
5,When I was fortunate enough to score a PS5 I ordered this item to keep the controllers charges all the time and get rid of the USB cables that hang off the console to clean up the play area.
5,I've been looking around Amazon for a great 3rd party charger and this is the one I ended up going with. It has worked flawlessly so far with no issues and blends in nicely with the PS5's aesthetic. The blue running lights are a nice touch and the pulsing animation helps you quickly know that your controllers are still charging at a glance. Great charger all around.
5,I was skeptical about buying this charging station but when I tell you it works and get the job done no complaints it's a great buy
4,I can’t say if it’s the controller or the charger design but I can’t get the controller in the cradle without inadvertently hitting a button.  I like to leave my game running all the time on pause so it’s difficult to get in the cradle without unpausing.It only charges once the controller drops below 80% which feels like cheap internal components but I can’t say if that goes for all chargers or just non-OEM.
5,Works just as suspected
5,This thing is amazing! Works so well cheaper than buying at the store and it looks great next to the system. The lights indicator is great shows up red when the remote is dead then changes to blue when it’s fully charged and each remote has a separate indicator which also has labels showing 1 and 2.
5,The charger is easy to set up and it's as easy as laying the charger down on the contacts!  No fuss!!
5,What can I say... Other than it just works. It matches the aesthetics of the PS5 perfectly and works off both USB C and AC power. And it even comes with an AC USB C power brick. The colored LED indicators are clear and clever. And it fits neatly in my entertainment center. It starts charging your controllers immediately and even has overcharge protection. However if I had to point out 1 minor flaws it would be that it doesn't work well with controller rubber grips or skins. So if you're into that kind of stuff then it may not work too well in your favor. Otherwise it's golden and cheaper than the OEM version from Sony while doing the same job in a more functional manner (with the LED lights charging pins and stable platform).
5,I bought this for my son and he loves it!
5,Item arrived on time and as described
5,This matches the PS5 perfectly and charges fast.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Good!!
5,Look no furtherthis dualsense charger is amazingquick charge and it looks amazingit looks like mini ps5 evenenjoy you wont regret it.
5,The product is exactly what it is a charger with more functions than the original licensed charger for your ps5 controller. I love the way it lights up and tells you that it’s charged all the way or needs charging. It matches the ps5 perfectly with its white design and blue lights. It didn’t take long for me to get back playing after the controller was almost juiced out. Highly recommended and it’s cheaper than the regular charger.
5,Carga rapido
5,Great and charges fast. Love the indicator.
4,Easy to use. No installation required just plug it up and use right away.  Convenient light that changes color to let you know it’s charging and goes back blue when charging is complete.
5,It charges fast which is nice. I'm also pretty big on the aesthetic look of my set up and these fit with that really well.
5,That's all that matters...
5,I love how it shows you the percentage of charge.
5,It looks so cool next to my PS5 :-) it works great too!
5,Excellent +++++
5,The charging light is pretty bright at night so if you don't want to see it this is not for you. Looks great next to the PlayStation 5. Matches the design lines but gives you a different feel than the original Sony charger.
5,Got this for my boyfriend and it works great. like the small icons that light up
5,Meine beiden Controller laden damit zuverlässig und schnell wieder auf.Lediglich die Anbringung könnte etwas besser gelöst sein ist aber kein Problem.Die Controller werden sofort erkannt und im Display der Station wird angezeigt dass geladen wird.Vor allem der Anschluss über USB-C ist eine tolle Sache!
5,Wer kennt es nicht man zockt mal auch zusammen mit Freunden und einem Controller geht der Saft aus. Wenn man nicht gerade ein 4m Kabel zur Hand hat dann wars das erstmal wieder mit dem gemeinsamen zocken. Durch diese ladebox sind die Controller quasi auch beim fernsehen durchgehend im lademodus und demnach immer voll. Nach nun bald einem Jahr PS5 zocken ist es mir daher nicht einmal passiert dass ein Controller komplett leer gelaufen ist also erfüllt seinen Zweck.
5,Ottimo prodotto stile moderno leggero e compatto carica due joystick con LED che avvisa quando è ancora scarico o carico ottimo acquisto avevo anche un joystick che non caricava tramite cavo type C Ma comprando questa base che ricarica il joystick da sotto ho recuperato il joystick che non caricava pure ottima Genialata
5,Mir gefällt besonders das Design der Ladestation da sie perfekt zum Design der PS5 passt. Optisch also ein echter Hingucker.Mit dem Schalter hinten lässt sich leider nur die LED-Beleuchtung ausschalten und nicht die gesamte Ladestation dennoch dient die Station auch ohne Stromzufuhr als gute Ablage für die Controller.Die Ladeleistung ist jedoch ein wenig langsamer als per Direktanschluss an die PS5. Wer damit aber kein Problem hat sollte keine Probleme mit der Ladestation haben.Meiner Meinung nach ein optionales Zubehör für alle die eine PS5 besitzen und auch eine gute Geschenkidee.
4,Nulla da dire funziona benissimo
5,Super Qualitat und alles wie beschriebenen.
4,No sé lo que va a durar en el tiempo pero la función la hace genial y a parte que es más bonito que el de sony muy bonito....lo recomiendo!!
5,Sehr schön.
5,Base ricarica controller funzionale perfetta per lo stile e lo spazio in cui volevo collocarla.
5,I’ve been using the Oivo Charger for PS5 controller for 9 days. I have not had any issues with this charging station it is working well. I was initially nervous when unboxing this item because I did hear a slight rattle coming from within I assume this is not normal but it doesn’t seem to be affecting its capabilities.This dual charging station looks great next to my PS5 the shape colour and lights match the PS5 which is important to me. The lights indicate red when the controller is charging and blue when it’s good to go.This station does not plug in directly to the console which in the past is what I have used it plugs into an electrical outlet. I’m good with either it but if your short on outlet space I guess it may be an issue.It does have an on and off switch on the back which is a nice feature. Personally I’ve left mine on for the entire time I’ve had the charging dock with my controllers on it and haven’t noticed anything wrong with any of my devices. My controller batteries are still lasting for the entirety of my lengthy gaming sessions (between 3-7 hours). I drained the battery on one of my controllers completely it took the station about 3 hours to charge it fully again.I like the way the controllers rest no need to force them into place which helps with the longevity of the dock itself and the controllers as there’s less risk of any pieces breaking off.The price is right for a quality aesthetically pleasing charging station. Thank you Oivo!
4,I bought this instead of OIVO’s other PS5 Controller charger that has a USB-C dongle and So far I’m happy with it.However the reason I only gave it 4 stars is because once the controller is actually charging a slight wobble on the device will disengage the metal contacts on the controller and the charger thus mimicking plugging your controller in and out. Not a big deal but I wish it was more snug once you dock your controller.Other than that small nitpick everything is good so far and only time will tell if this charger is just as good as Sony’s charger. I will update if anything changes.
5,I just recently bought a new PS5 and this charging station is very useful and it keeps my controllers charged without putting my PS5 in rest mode to charge them...this charging station in my opinion "Money Well Spent".
5,Prodotto semplice da collegare e attivare. Design che combacia molto col look della PS5 leggero e non ingombrante. Ricarica in 2 ore. Qualità prezzo ottima e spedizione Amazon avvenuta in meno di 24 ore. Consigliatissimo!
5,My plan was to by the OEM model but was sold out everywhere. Decided to take a chance on this one and I a super impressed not only does it charge my controllers like it should I think the LED lighting really makes it way cooler. Great product! Highly recommend!!
5,It has some weight to it that feels quality. Blue led that matches PS5 and an on/off switch. Charges my controller super fast and you don't need those stupid dongles like the other ones. 5 out of 5!
5,This product is AMAZING! Not only does it charge my controllers super fast it’s also narrow and small. Being a collector of consoles and anything gaming it’s always nice to have something that’s efficient but also take up minimal space! Now I can play without having to charge my controller while playing or having to put my PS5 in sleep mode! I would highly recommend this product to anyone. 5/5 for me ☺️ Thanks OIVO
5,I really like the sleek design of this charger. It fits in nicely with the console and controller and the blue ambient light on the sides match the startup light on the PS5 which is a nice touch. There is an on/off switch on the back LED indicator lights to let you know the controller’s charging status and rubber strips on the bottom to keep it secure and in place. It charges fast is super easy to use and I’d highly recommend to anyone with a PS5.
5,Qualitativ vergleichbar mit dem offiziellen von sony nur finde ich das das teil sogar besser aussieht wegen der Ladanzeige. Sehr zufrieden.
3,Product charges controllers fine. Only problem is that it was advertised only to do so when turned on but it still charges them simply when the device is plugged in. Turning it on just turns on the blue or red indicator lights. So if I want to control when the charger is on or off I need to unplug it which isn’t really what I bought it for.Otherwise no problems.
5,After having tried two different third-party controller chargers that both didn’t work I was very pleased that this one actually worked! It’s a very aesthetically pleasing charger too it looks similar (and honestly better) than the Sony one ! Would highly recommend this purchase.
5,Plutôt joli ce chargeur fait le travail attendu.Vous poser la manette un indicateur rouge indique qu'elle est en charge un indicateur bleu indique que la manette est quant à elle chargée.
5,Sieht echt gut aus mit den dynamischen LEDs zeigt die Ladestand der Controller an ist nicht unnötig groß. Schickes Teil
5,Works amazing so far excellent product looks like the original design.
5,Super product!
5,Beau produit de qualité
5,This charger works great. It is nice and quick.
5,👍
5,Look's good and works perfectly
5,Pas de problème
4,Die Ladestation ist ähnlich aufgebaut wie ganz viele andere Stationen aus China für verschiedenste Controller. Also nichts überraschendes. Dass ein Netzteil mitgeliefert wird ist jedoch positiv hervorzuheben und auch die Ladeleistung ist vollkommen ausreichend!Das was einerseits verwirrend und zugleich von Vorteil ist:Der Schalter auf der Rückseite schaltet NICHT die Ladestation selbst aus sondern nur die Beleuchtung und somit das sehr nervige pulsierende Licht wenn die Controller geladen werden.Insofern Glück im Unglück denn das Pulsieren ist störend wenn man die Ladestation im Augenwinkel sieht. Dennoch ist der Schalter eher verwirrend da ich erwartet hätte dass die Controller dann nicht geladen werden wenn er auf "off" steht.Für 15 Euro kann man das Gerät aber empfehlen. Sieht nett aus und macht was es soll.
5,Super consigliato
5,Base di ricarica funzionale ed elegante. Davvero ottima per ora. Consigliatissimo.
5,Fast delivery all is as described
5,Läd 2 controller sehr schnell.
5,Super design fonctionne parfaitement pour mes 2 dualsenseLa charge est assez rapide avec un voyant rouge et bleu pour indiquer l'état de la batterierapport qualité/prix au top!
4,Carga los dos a la vez pero no ran rapido  omo se anuncia. El producto es mejor que el cargador de Sony eso sí.
5,Top
5,Très beau design et solide. Cet accessoire est absolument parfait. Un interrupteur à l'arrière permet de l'allumer ou l'éteindre. Mais surtout on peut visionner l'état de charge des manettes (rouge / bleu).La charge est plutôt rapide. J'en suis très satisfait.
1,Dejo de funcionar a uno días de uso
5,Funktioniert genau wie versprochen. Und vom Design passend zur PS5. Meine uneingeschränkte Empfehlung
5,Die Controller laden in der Station gut auf und sind dort auch noch gut gelagert. Die Station ist ein optischer Hingucker neben der Konsole.Die LED Beleuchtung ist hinten an der Station problemlos ausschaltbar. Die Ladefunktion wird hierdurch nicht beeinträchtigt.Der Controller ist sofern man den richtigen Winkel kennt einfach aufzusetzen (das ergibt sich nach ein paar mal einsetzen von selbst) & sitzt dann auch sehr fest in der Station.
5,Produit livré rapidement. Fonctionnement parfaitement pour le moment. La manette se recharge sans problème.
5,Molto bello esteticamente funziona bene semplice il montaggio  forse unica pecca (ma prevedibile) i gamepad devono essere posizionati senza cover (in silicone).
5,Arrivato nei tempi stabilitiil prodotto è fatto veramente bene e ricarica veloce come da descrizione.
5,Alles wie beschrieben mein Freund ist zufrieden!
5,Original y queda bien al lado de la PS5Mandos al alcance y siempre cargados y lo más importante siempre en el mismo sitio
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Vor circa einer Woche habe ich diese Ladestation für meine Dualsense Controller gekauft. Beim auspacken und begutachten der Station war ich sehr Positive überrascht die Ladestation hat eine sehr hochwertige Verarbeitung. Die Ladestation ist aus Plastik aber wie erwähnt sehr hochwertig und super verarbeitet.Was ich richtig schön finde ist die Beleuchtung die den Eindruck macht das eine kleine Playstation 5 im Wohnzimmer steht. Zu dem finde ich die Anzeige total super das Symbol des aufgeladenen Controllers leuchtet Rot und ein vollgeladener Controller wird blau angezeigt. Zu dem pulsiert noch ein blauer Rahmen im Display so lange ein Controller aufgeladen wird.Die Ladestation hat sogar einen Ein-  und Ausschalter womit man die Ladestation nach Gebrauch auch wieder einfach ausschalten kann. Im Lieferumfang ist ein Netzteil dabei und was ich noch erwähnen will sind die 3 Jahre Garantie die der Hersteller hier einen gewährt.Ich finde die Ladestation optisch sowie technisch super. Sie macht alles was einen Ladestation machen soll. Von mir aus gesehen eine klare Kaufempfehlung.
5,Il faut prendre la main pour réussir à poser les manettes piles sur les connecteurs mais ça fonctionne très bien une fois la prise en main passée. Le design s'intègre bien à l'univers de la PS5 et ne fait pas cheap.
4,Super Gerät wenn man es aus lässtam Teil ist ein Schalter. Der Kontroller läd auch wenn das Gerät aus istwas ich gut finde. Ist das Gerät anleuchtet es vorne dauerhaft und das ist für mich nerviggerade wenn man in diesen Zimmer schläft. Sonst passt alles.
5,für diesen Preis ein sehr gutes Ladegerät es steht dem Gerät von Sony nichts nach.
5,Kann mich nicht beklagen. Das blaue Lämpchen ist schick und das aussehen ist elegant und schick. Es tut was es machen soll.
3,Zu den Kontrollern. Mich wundert es stark wie schnell doch die neuen PlayStation 5 Dualsense Kontroller leer sind. Beide sind nagelneu (neueste Generation) und haben eine Spiellaufzeit von ca 20 Stunden. Danach ist aufladen angesagt. Wer da keinen 2ten Kontroller hat na viel Spass.Da lobe ich mir meine XBOX Series X Kontroller. Die halten ewig. Da sie auch mit handelsüblichen Akkus (wiederaufladbar) genutzt werden können. Nicht so bei der PS5. WARUM?Nun zur Lade-Station:-------------------------Nach bereits 2 Tagen musste ich feststellen dass die Dualsense Kontroller leer sind. Aufladen nur umständlich mit einem zur PS5 1 Meter langem mitgelieferten USB Kabel an der Konsole möglich. Wer denkt sich so etwas für last Gen Konsolen bei SONY aus?Nun musste eine Lösung her. Dabei bin ich auf diese Ladestation gestoßen. Bestellt.Das Problem ist die Kontroller sind recht groß und auch etwas schwer ( nicht viel aber dennoch ) die Station jedoch besitzt nur einen sehr schmalen Stand.Dazu kommt noch dass man die Kontroller in die vorgesehene Ladebuchse fummeln muss dabei aufpassen dass die Kontroller auch wirklich gerade auf der Horizontalen und schräg in einem ganz bestimmten Winkel auf der Vertikalen Achse aufliegen. Sonst lädt hier gar nichts.Sollte Man ausversehen dran kommen kann es passieren das die Kontroller einfach runterfallen.Die Station erfüllt ihren Zweck aber diese müsste eigentlich genau so breit wie die Kontroller sein. Massiever!!! Die Kontroller müssten normalweiser inklusive ihrer Handgriffe automatisch in die Vorrichtung gleiten damit man nicht ewig fummeln muss bis sie auch wirklich richtig aufliegen und Kontakt für das Laden haben.Möchte man zudem dann noch hinten den Ausschaltknopf betätigen muss man beide Kontroller wenn sie gerade aufliegen gut festhalten. Hier kann es aber passieren das man ausversehen den Einschaltknopf auf dem Kontroller erwischt und somit die PS5 eingeschalten wird oder die Kontroller runterfallen.WAS FÜR EIN MURKS.Ich werde wohl noch einmal nach einer besseren Alternative schauen.Unter'm Strich:------------------Die Station tut was sie soll aber hat ihre Nachteile die ich oben beschrieben habe. Diese sind natürlich rein subjektiv und spiegeln meine Erfahrung nach ca 2 Wochen wieder. Wer mit der Station glücklich ist Bitteschön
5,Hace la función perfectamente.
5,Ricarica molto veloce compatto e pratico comodo anche il tasto di spegnimento quando non lo si utilizza!
5,Finde so eine Ladestation sollte jeder PS5 Besitzer haben. Denn über USB-Ladekabel ist das dann doch ein wenig komplizierter.Ich besitze diese Ladestation mittlerweile schon fast 1 Jahr und hatte bisher noch nie Probleme damit.*schickes Design*gute Ladefunktion*ohne Probleme/AussetzerZu der Schnelligkeit des Ladevorgang kann ich kaum was sagen da ich relativ wenig spiele sprich nach einigen wenigen Stunden mir eine Controllerladung ausreicht und ich dann entweder am nachsten Tag/wenige Stunden später wieder den Controller nutze.Außerdem hat der Controller bis jetzt immer voll geladen niemals eine Ladevorgang oder ähnliches abgebrochen.Ich bin vollumfänglich zufrieden damit. Es lädt meinen Controller nach einer Spiele Session und das soll das Gerät auch tun!
5,Ich habe mir die Ladestation für die PS5 Controller geholt weil ich den ganzen Kabelsalat auf Dauer sehr ungern gesehen habe.Demnach war für mich klar - eine Ladestation musste her! Sony bietet auch solch eine Ladestation für ihre Controller an allerdings bezahlt man dort einen hohen Aufpreis der meiner Meinung nach nicht gerechtfertigt ist. Die Ladestation vom OIVO macht ihren Job gut - wenn der Controller auflädt leuchtet das LED-Licht von Station 1 in rot. Ist der Controller voll aufgeladen wird das Licht in blau angezeigt. So sieht man immer sofort wie der aktuelle Ladestand aussieht.Es gibt auch die Möglichkeit die Lichter auszuschalten dann muss man aber davon ausgehen dass die Ladung nach kurzer Zeit abbricht bzw nur sehr langsam ist.+ Ruhig keine Lautstärke+ Indikator zum Anzeigen des Ladestandes+ Hohe Leistung+ Preis-Leistungsverhältnis+ Passende Farbgebung zur PS5 :-)- Nur 2 LadeplätzeIm Großen und Ganzen eine sehr gute Möglichkeit seine Controller jederzeit aufzuladen und zugleich ein bisschen Ordnung zu schaffen denn passend zur PS5 ist die Farbe der OIVO Ladestation im weiß-schwarzen Ton.
5,Hasta ahora funciona perfectamente
4,Ich bin bis jetzt sehr zu frieden mit dieser Ladestation. Wenn ich sie mal nicht benötige kann man diese Ladestation auf der Rückseite einfach ausschalten um Strom zu sparen. Die Halterung der Controller ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig aber in Ordnung. Die Anzeige des Ladeszustands ist auch super und leicht zu erkennen.Ich kann es empfehlen.
5,Ottime qualità delle plasticheCaricatore/alimentatore compreso nel prezzoEstetica accattivante che ricorda le forme della stessa PS5Consigliatissimo al prezzo scontato ma valido anche a prezzo pieno.
5,Perfetto funzionale e bello
5,Optik: Die Optik in s/w und die Form entsprechen der PS5 sehr gut. Sowohl in der direkten Umgebung der PS5 wie auch irgendwo im Raum weiß man sofort wohin das Ladegerät gehört.Ladeleistung: Direkt nach dem Kauf der PS5 habe ich die ersten Wochen den Controller an der PS5 geladen. Allerdings ist die Ladezeit dann eher lang und wenn man die Vibrationsmotoren im Controller auf volle Leistung stellt war der zweite Controller leer bevor der erste wieder voll war. Entsprechend bin ich dazu übergegangen die Controller an einem Ladegerät von "Anker" zu laden. Aber das dauernde Einstöpseln mit dem USB-C nervte mich. Also habe ich jetzt das Ladegerät auf dem Tisch stehen und an Netzteil von Anker angeschlossen - was nicht notwendig ist da ein Netzteil mit USB-C der Ladestation beiliegt.Ruhemodus: Die Anzeige der Ladestation kennt zwei Betriebsarten.- blau: es wird nicht geladen- rot: es wird geladenWenn nicht geladen werden soll kann man die Ladestation ausschalten.Für dieses Produkt spreche ich eine Kaufempfehlung aus.
5,Sehr gutes Produkt !
5,Alles ehrlich sehr sehr sehr gut
5,Preis ist gut das Netzteil wird mitgeliefert und es war wie immer über  Amazon als Versender schnell da. Wie gut es lädt kann ich jetzt noch nicht sagen. Aber so wie es aussieht lädt es schnell und die Anzeige ob ein Controller geladen wird oder voll geladen ist arbeitet .
3,Pas fiable
5,Die Ladestation passt Optisch perfekt zur Ps5. Was mir nach ungefähr einem Monat aufgefallen ist dass die Anzeige der Ladung nicht korrekt ist. Obwohl der Kontroller geladen ist und man ihn wieder drauf stellt wird Angezeigt das dieser Leer ist. Mysteriös aber nicht tragisch
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Wer auf der Suche nach einem tollen 2 in 1 Gerät ist sollte hier zuschlagen. Ich habe vorrangig nach einer Ladestation gesucht damit ich nicht immer ein loses Kabel rumhängen habe und der Controller einen festen Platz hat.Hier bekommt ihr zum kleinen Preis eine tolle Ladestation die gleichzeitig auch als Controllerhalterung dient und dank der LEDs einen tollen Eye Catcher bietet.Für jeden Gamingfreak ein absolutes Muss der seine kleine Zockerecke optimieren möchte.
5,Funktioniert wie es soll kann mich nicht beklagen.Draufstecken aufladen und weiter zocken.
3,Controller werden schnell geladen  soweit so gut. Nur das gefummel die Controller auf der Ladestation in die richtige Position zu bekommen kann leicht Nerven. Habe es noch nie auf Anhieb geschafft das die Controller einrasten.
5,Finde es gut das gleiche 2 Controller zeitgleich laden können aber sobald diese voll sind leuchtet die blaue leuchte halt weiterhin und frisst Strom.Akkus sind voll und joa gibs bis jetzt nichts zu meckern. Es kommt halt drauf an wie lange man eben spielt die Akkus der Controller halten ja nun auch nicht ewig.Preis/Leistung find ich völlig angemessen.Würde bis zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt ne Kaufempfehlung aussprechen.
5,Sieht echt gut aus !
4,Este artículo me ha parecido fantástico lo califico con 4 estrellas en lugar de 5 por el hecho de que tiene un interruptor en la parte trasera que sólo activa la luz de carga pero no impide que llegue corriente al mando en mi opinión sería útil que lo hiciera pues se esa forma podrían estar los mandos colocados en el cargador sin recibir corriente de forma continuada.En cualquier caso repetiría la compra.
5,Meine Ladestation funktioniert glaube ich nicht richtig.Immer wenn ich 2 Controller laden möchte geht das geblinke los. Einmal der 1.  Controller wird geladen dann der 2. Controller wird geladen wo ei dann der 1. Controller aus ist und so weiter.Mit einem Controller funktioniert es Super aber wenn ich nur einen Laden kann brauch ich keine Doppelstation.....Kurios.....
5,Bin absolut zufrieden! Muss sich absolut nicht hinter der Sony Ladestation verstecken.
5,El mejor cargador para los mandos de la PS5. Muy cómodos de poner y como se cargan por contacto no se estropea ninguna toma
3,Leider erschließt sich mir nicht der Nutzen dieser Ladestation.Der Preispunkt der originalen Ladestation von Sony ist zum Zeitpunkt dieser Rezension identisch und die Playstation Controller zeigen selbst den Ladevorgang an.Aus diesem Grund empfinde ich die zusätzliche Anzeige auf der Vorderseite dieser Ladestation nur als nettes Lichtspiel ohne zusätzlichen Nutzen.Meiner Meinung nach lästig ist allerdings dass sich diese  „Lightshow“ nach dem Laden nicht selbstständig ausschaltet. Ein diesbezüglicher Ruhemodus fehlt und wer die Ladestation nicht umständlich per Schalter auf der Rückseite ausschalten will wird eben dauerbeleuchtet. In meinen Augen eine unnötige Stromverschwendung.Ich greife lieber zum Original
4,Ist ok  erfüllt seinen Zweck.Könnte aber stabiler sein wenn ein Controller drauf ist
5,Produit vraiment simpa .déjà j'aime beaucoup le design je le trouve simple et moderne .de plus il va bien avec mon meuble TV 😅 recharge les manette très vite .Seule chose a prendre en main c'est comment poser la manette dessus .c'est une habitude .Petit plus aussi le chargeur arrête la couleur de la manette quand elle est charger et ça j'aime beaucoup. Au moin ont sais quand c'est fini
5,Eines der wenigen Produkte zu denen man einfach nichts negatives schreiben kann. Das Design ist angenehm unauffällig und elegant die Lade Leistung ist super und das ist soweit ich weiß ja alles was dieses Gerät können soll. Aussehen top Leistung top. Würde ich immer wieder kaufen.
4,Alle gut soweit!
5,Parfait livraison rapide. Conforme à la description
5,Bon rapport qualité prix
5,Acquistato perché ero stufo di dover attaccare il joystick alla mia PS5 che dovevo lasciare in stand-by per ricaricarlo. Funziona perfettamente e la ricarica è veloce. Per caricare il joystick al 100% ci impiega circa 2 ore. Esteticamente molto carino con luce blu e indicatore di carica completata.
3,Die Ladestation macht was sie soll und schaut auch gut aus. Der an der Rückseite angebrachte Ein und Aus Schalter schaltet nur die Beleuchtung und die Anzeigen an der Voderseite aus der Ladevorgang wird nicht unterbrochen. Bemängeln muss ich allerdings den mitgelieferten Netzstecker der doch ein leichtes pfeifen hat was doch stört ist. Keine Ahnung ob das Normal ist . Habe Jetzt ein anderes Netzteil angeschlossen.
4,De momento muy bien.
4,Tut was er soll
5,Funktioniert super macht Optisch einen guten Eindruck.Laden ohne laufende PS5 möglich.Würde es wieder kaufen.
4,An sich eine gute Ladestation. Allerdings gibt bei mir eine LED-Anzeige nach knapp 3 Monaten langsam ihren Geist auf. Vermutlich wird in einem halben Jahr nichts mehr leuchten. Bisher keine spürbare Beeinträchtigung der Ladeleistung. Ich sende es zurück. Vielleicht übernimmt der Verkäufer den Austausch.Update: Verkäufer reagiert direkt auf die Anfrage und ist sehr kooperativ/ kulant. Top. 1 Stern dazu.
5,Ich verwende die OIVO PS5 Controller Ladestation seit ca. 4 Wochen zum Laden von 2 PS5-Controllern. Die Ladestation weist keinerlei Verarbeitungsmängel auf wirkt hochwertig und funktioniert bisher einwandfrei. Das schlichte klare Design lässt die Ladestation wie Originalzubehör aussehen.Sehr praktisch ist die visualisierte Ladeanzeige auf der Stirnseite hier wird jeder Steckplatz einzeln mit aktuellem Ladestatus (rot = wird geladen blau = vollständig geladen) ausgewiesen und sieht dazu noch sehr gut aus. Der Ladevorgang selbst nimmt ca. 2 Stunden in Anspruch.Mein bisheriges Fazit fällt durchweg positiv aus weshalb ich hier 5 Sterne vergebe.
3,Habe das Produkt schon Zweimal erhalten beide male der Selbe defekt.Eine LED geht nach ca. einem Halben Jahr nicht mehr. Finde ich persönlich sehr nervig dass man nicht weiß ob der Controller geladen ist ob er lädt oder ob er gar nichts macht.
4,Die Ladestation kam in einem relativ kleinen Karton ohne großen Schnickschnack. Einfach die Ladestation mit Kabel und einer Anleitung.Hab diese jetzt ca eine Woche in gebrauch. Es lädt wunderbar schnell man sieht aus 5 Metern welcher Controller geladen ist und es gibt kaum gefummel beim reinstecken.Definitiv eine Empfehlung wert
5,… das auch noch ziemlich schnell und sieht gut dabei aus
4,Dieser Artikel tut was er tun soll. Controller sind schnell aufgeladen. Allerdings müssen die Controller gut angesteckt werden ( fest reindrücken) sonst kann es sein das er nicht richtig lädt. Also wirklich gut fest und waagrecht anbringen. Ganz wichtig.
4,En general está OK tengo un Dual Sense y lo carga bien.Me esperaba que el interruptor gris que tiene en la parte trasera tuviese una función de conexión/desconexión de la corriente pero no es así parece que sólo sirve para encender o apagar las luces azules/rojas frontales. Si lo mantienes enchufado a la corriente aunque la palanquita esté en posición de apagado continua suministrando corriente a los mandos.También otro pequeño detalle es que al colocar el mando encima no hace contacto a la primera tienes que con los dedos apretar un poquito para acoplar bien el mando y que haga contacto con tal de que empiece a cargarlo.
5,Super Ladestation am Anfang war ich ein wenig irritiert und skeptisch da die Controller einfach nur locker drauf liegen. Aber die Ladegeschwindigkeit ist echt Top kann ich nur weiterempfehlen.
5,The charger arrived reasonably packaged and was easily assembled. I have now tested it for a few weeks and I am very satisfied!I especially enjoy the simple and clean design which is inspired by the original Playstation Charger. However they have added some great additional features here.When needed you can simply turn on an LED indicator via a switch which shows whether the controllers are currently being charged or if they are already fully charged. Additionally there are 2 blue LED-Stripes on the sides which match to the Ps5's design perfectly.The material feels high-quality and the charger is well made. The charger has 2 rubber feet which ensure a firm stand on the desk without any danger of slipping. The controllers are simply plugged in from above and sit firmely in the device. As gamers we will especially enjoy the short charging times which means we can continue our session in no time!I am absolutely satisfied with this great charger and can highly recommend it to you!
5,Es muy cómodo y facilita la carga de los mandos con sus luces que te permiten saber cuando está el mando cargado buen diseño.
5,Moinbin per Zufall auf den Artikel gekommen und aus Langeweile bestellt. Mich hat das ewige laden per Kabel an der Steckdose oder an der Konsole genervt. Die Ladestation sieht recht stylisch aus  und die Gamepads die drauf gesteckt sind machen sofort einen ordentlichen Eindruck auf dem Schreibtisch. Sehr zufrieden mit dem Kauf obwohl ich nie gedacht hätte dass ich sowas brauche.
5,Très pratique et assortie avec la ps5
4,Optisch gut passt perfekt zur PS5. Die Ladeleistung könnte ein wenig besser sein ist allerdings noch im Rahmen. Die Ladestation erfüllt ihren Zweck und ist definitiv eine Alternative zur original von Sony angebotenen.
4,Lohnt sich
5,Super gut verarbeitet
5,Konnte das Produkt auch an ein anderes Netzteil anschliessen. Benötigt wird nur dann z.b. das USB3.0 zu USB-C von der PS5 zum laden des Controllers.
5,Lädt super und Controller halten super darauf
5,Ils rechargent les manettes facilement ! Il faut juste te poser les manettes sur le support.Utilisation depuis 2 mois et aucun problèmeLe branchement sur secteur est un plus afin d'étendre la ps5 complètement.
4,Guardandolo sembra più adatto questo che l'originalecomodo l indicatore di carica e l interruttore
4,He tenido que comprar este producto 2 veces porque el primero que me llegó no cargaba el puerto 1
5,Geht gut zum einstecken der Controller und wird auch schnell geladen.
5,Comodissimo! Consigliatissimo!
5,Tenia varios cables sueltos por la mesa :-) Necesito un cargador para el mando de la PS5 y después de mirar varios me compre el Charger Station de OIVO.Va genial tiene para cargar 2 mandos al mismo tiempo cargar rápido y yo lo tengo puesto sobre la Playstation y queda genial :-)Una compra muy recomendable la verdad.I had several loose cables around the table :-) I need a charger for the PS5 controller and after looking at several I bought the OIVO Charger Station.It's great it has to load 2 controllers at the same time load fast and I have it on the Playstation and it looks great :-)A highly recommended purchase really.
5,Moin zusammenich finde OIVO hat hier sehr gute Arbeit geleistet! Ich habe für meine PS5 Controller eine stylische und gut funktionierende Ladestation gesucht.Vom Design her passt sie super gut zur PS5! Da bleiben keine Wünsche übrig.Sie funktioniert klasse und die Controller passen gut auf diese Ladestation!Weiterer Plus Punkt aus meiner Sicht die Ladestation kommt mit einem Netzteil! Sie muss also nicht per USB an die Konsole angeschlossen werden und könnte somit auch woanders platziert werden.Weiterhin ist es klasse dass man hinten an der Ladestationen diese einfach ausschalten kann! Somit ist der Ladeprozess unterbrochen und man muss keinen Stecker ziehen.Ich habe sie nun einige Tage in Gebrauch und ich bin super zufrieden! Ich kann sie einfach nur weiter empfehlen! Preis/Leistung ist hier top!Liebe GrüßeSpeedy
5,Cuando adquirí la Ps5 me di cuenta que me hacia falta una base de carga para el mando. Y no podía ser otra que está. La presentación es buenísima viene en una caja muy bien de tamaño una vez abierto dentro viene todo bien acolchado. La base de carga tiene un tamaño ideal ni muy grande ni muy pequeña caben dos mandos se colocan rectos  y se acoplan fenomenal. En el frontal tenemos dos led uno para el mando nunero 1 y otro para el mando número 2. Si se iluminan de azul es que ese mando está cargado si se ilumina de rojo se está realizando la carga. Por detrás viene el botón on-off por si nos molesta el led que brilla ( que a mi parecer queda Chulisimo en mi set up ). Se cargan muy rápido y además viene con el seguro de carga para no estropear la batería. Sin duda todo un acierto.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Ich habe mir vor ungefähr einer Woche den oivo charger für die ps5 dualsense gekauft. Ich bin echt super positiv überrascht das aufladen geht echt extrem schnell. Die Controller sitzen echt gut drauf und sind einfach drauf zu legen.Richtig überrascht war ich über die Qualität. Es fühlt sich hochwertig an vom Plastik ich finder sogar hochwertiger als die Plastikflügel der ps5 😂Was ich richtig cool finde dass sind die LED stripes. Hat den gleichen Look als würde man die ps5 starten. Sieht cool aus.Endeffekt macht es das was es soll. Es läd die Controller auf. 👍🏻Ich finde das ist optisch echt eine der besten Ladestationen sieht sehr nach der originalen aus plus der LED Beleuchtung. Technisch funktioniert bei mir alles super.Inhalt ist die Ladestation und bei mir lad ein EU Stromstecker bei welche man auch laut Anleitung nutzen soll.Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung.TOP PRODUKT!!Kann gar nichts negatives dazu schreiben. 👍🏻👍🏻
5,Lädt zuverlässig und schnell die PS5 Kontroller.Die Digitalanzeige lässt das Ganze noch Wertiger aussehen.Für den Preis gibt es nichts zu nörgeln.Wenn man zwei Dual-Sense sein eigen nennt ist diese Ladestation unverzichtbar.
5,Por el momento totalmente recomendable. Me gusta que tenga para elegir “apagado” y “encendido” y no como otros que permanecen encendidos todo el día. La clavija para conectar el mando a la base está muy bien ya que no hay que estar intentando adivinar dónde está el agujero en el mando y lo colocas rápidamente.
5,Sehr schöne Ladestation mit guter LadezeitPasst sehr gut zur PlayStationDisplay lässt sich auch ein oder ausschaltenSchade nur das das USB-C Kabel fest am Stecker istAber alles im allem ein sehr gutes und schönes Teil für Zocker Freunde
4,Loading is ok but to put the controllers in the dockingstation is not easy!
3,Ich habe an meinem Controller eine Silikon Schutzhülle die ich leider immer abmachen muss.Der Controller lädt nur ohne Schutzhüllen.Daher finde ich die Ladestation nicht sehe gut.
5,Alles supper
5,Mein Mann hat sich riesig gefreut das er endlich eine Ladestation für seine PS5 Controller hat.Sie funktioniert einwandfrei sie tut was sie soll nämlich zuverlässig die Controller aufladen und noch zusätzlich optisch anzeigen wann sie geladen sind.
5,Sieht nicht nur toll aus sondern tut was er soll! Zeigt durch LED an wenn Controller geladen sind! Preis Leistung stimmt.
5,Ich war auf der Suche nach einer Ladestation für meine 2 Playstation 5 Controller. Die Controller werden einfach drauf gelegt und werden geladen. Die Anzeige vorne zeigt an ob der Akku geladen oder noch am laden ist. Dazu sieht das ganze noch super hochwertig aus. Würd ich wieder kaufen!
5,Ladestation funktioniert richtig gut wenn die Controller voll geladen sind wird der Ladevorgang gestoppt.Wer die Ladestation kauft macht nichts falsch.
3,Nutze das Ding nun schon seid 1 Jahr und mit sind da 2 Punkte aufgefallenDer erste weniger störend  das die Controller sehr wackelig drauf sitzen  aber nicht so störendDer 2te allerdings ... Das die Controller scheinbar nicht voll geladen werden und das seid dem ich das Ding habeEs lädt bis die LED blau wird ( voll ) wenn ich dann aber zocke ( ungefähr 3 Std ) dann kann ich mein Controller schon wieder anschließen  weil der Akku schwach ist  lade ich ihn über ein USB  hält er im selben Betrieb gute 5-7 durch  je nach was ich gerade mache
5,Der PS5 Controller Lader ist Super. Er macht Optisches einiges her und macht das was er soll. Controller laden.
5,Tolle Ladestation funktioniert einwandfrei sieht sehr gut aus fairer Preis.
5,Es ist ein tolles Feature dass man die Beleuchtung mittels Schiebeschalter ausschalten kann (geladen wird trotzdem).Super Passung - kein gequetsche bei 2 Controllern gleichzeitig!Sehr schnelle Aufladung - wie angeben - stimmt!Tolles Design - die Fotos entsprechen der Realität!
5,ist mega! war ein Weihnachtsgeschenk an meine Brüder und es ist einfach toll! Die Controller laden ohne Beschwerden und dann auch noch viel schneller als von Kabel selbst!! Kann ich nur weiter empfehlen !! Und der Preis ist auch mega
3,Esta base de carga tiene un diseño bonito a juego con el diseño de la PS5. Carga rápidamente y evita tener que estar enchufando y desenchufando cables continuamente máxime si se tiene dos o más mandos...con lo cual se gana mucho en comodidad el problema es que debido a un fallo de diseño tienes que asegurarte que está bien colocado el mando en la baseya que muchas veces no encaja según lo dejas..si se cargase siempre según dejas el mando en la base sin tener que preocuparte de si realmente está cargando o no le hubiera otorgado 4-5 estrellas. Además una vez colocado el mando éste no está colocado de la forma más estable que se puedaya que con un ligero golpecito se puede descolocar (diseño obliga?) Posee dos luces en forma de mando que se ilumina según está cargado o no el mando y adicionalmente una lucecita de ambiente que se puede desconectar. Por lo demás contento con la compra.
5,Bin zufrieden. Funktioniert so wie es soll. Und mit der LED Leuchte echt schick
5,Ich habe die Ladestation ca 2 Wochen in regelmäßiger Benutzung. Ich bin echt begeistert. Controller die gerade geladen werden Leuten rot auf. Sobald der Controller voll ist springt die Anzeige auf blau um. Sehr stylisch passt sehr gut neben die PS5.
4,Ottimo prodotto comodo e veloce nella ricarica
5,Kurz aber klar gesagt:Qualität: Super. Sehr gute Verarbeitung. Die Ladezustand LED funktioniert richtig gut und sieht top aus!!!!Lieferung: Sehr schnell gut verpackt.Preis: Super Preis. Auf jeden Fall weiter zu empfehlen.Persönliche Rückmeldung: Lässt sich super entweder über USB (egal ob vorne oder hinten) oder auch über das mitgelieferten Netzteil laden. Controller liegen gut drinnen (man trifft nicht immer auf Anhieb den Stift für den Sitz und Ladung der Controller aber überhaupt kein Problem). Status der Ladung ist visuell erkennbar. Sieht auch als Ständer seht gut aus passend zum Design der PS5.Wird wohl wegen der Überladung nicht zu 100% aufgeladen aber bei zwei Controllern in Tauschbetrieb kaum zu merken.
5,El producto carga los mandos perfectamente y es cómodo para poner los mandos. El indicador funciona muy bien cuando se está cargando esta en rojo y cuando está totalmente cargado en azul
5,Top Ladestation für meine PS5 Controller. Schnelles unkompliziertes Laden. Passt optisch fast zur PS5.
4,Ich kann es nur empfehlen
5,Macht was es soll zu einem fairen Preis. Kann die Ladestation empfehlen.
5,Ich kann eine solche Station nur empfehlen. Denke nicht dass es Einbußen zum Markengerät gibt
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Geliefert wird nur die Ladestation und das Kabel was dazu gehört .Einfach in die Steckdose und die Controller drauf .
5,sera parfait pour recharger les pads sur le secteur .. comme je le faisais avec les autres pads des autres PS sur secteur pour laisser libre les prises USB .... en espérant que ce chargeur tienne aussi longtemps que les autres on verra bien à la longue !!!!
5,Sin más un producto que cumple con el propósito por el que se compra. Si quieres ganar en comodidad para cargar los mandos es 10/10
5,Super zufrieden damit. Tut was es können Soll! Optik passt auch. Daumen nach oben!
5,Nun seid ca. 7Wochen im Einsatz und es gab nie ein Problem. Kinderleicht zu bedienen sogar unser 3jähriger schafft das.
5,Wer eine Alternative zur PS5 Dualsense Ladestation sucht ist hier genau richtig.Oivos PS5 Ladestation ist schlicht aber elegant in seinem schwarz/weiß Design. Auf der Vorderseite ist eine LED Anzeige eingebaut die anzeigt ob der Dualsense am aufladen ist oder ob der Akku voll ist. Wie auf den Fotos zu sehen ist leuchtet die LED rot solange der Aufladeprozess zugange ist und wechselt zu blau wenn er beendet ist bzw. der Akku aufgeladen ist.Sollte die LED jedoch stören kann man diese mit einem kleinen Schalter auf der Rückseite des Ladestation abschalten. Der Ladevorgang wird dadurch nicht beeinträchtigt.Die Handhabung ist sehr einfach. Der Controller passt haargenau auf die dafür vorgesehene Stelle.Im Lieferumfang ist ein Netzstecker enthalten.Eine klare Empfehlung meinerseits.
5,Vor ca. einer Woche bestellt. Der Versand lief mega unkompliziert ab und das Gerät war schnell bei mir zu Hause.Größter Pluspunkt für mich ist das Design da es wirklich perfekt und 1 zu 1 zu meiner Playstation 5 passt!Auch die Unterlage der Ladestation ist super da sie so konzipiert ist dass ein verrutschen quasi unmöglich ist. (Rutschfest!)Die LEDs und generell die gesamte Verarbeitung des Gerätes ist von höchster Qualität.Ich besitze die Oivo Ladestation nun erst sehr kurz - und möchte schön jetzt gar nicht mehr ohne ihr auskommen.Es ist toll und ohne einem nervigen Ladekabel immer sofort loslegen zu können! Ich würde mir jederzeit wieder diese Station kaufen und kann sie nur jedem empfehlen oder noch keine besitzt.
5,Top einfach top
5,Chargeur pratique qui ne prend pas de c'est top quand la manette et pleine lumière bleue l'or du chargement
5,Funktioniert wie es funktionieren soll
5,Super Produkt Funktion einwandfrei 👍👍
5,Die Controller haben darin eine guten Sitz und werden zuversichtlich geladen. Bin sehr zufrieden damit und sieht gut aus.
5,Sehr gutes Preis/Leistungsverhältnis
4,Da es ein Geschenk war keine weitere Aussage möglich!
5,très bien mon fils est ravi beau design avec la couleur qui indique la charge parfait
5,Da das design der Ladestation recht gut zur neuen PS5 passt wurde sie prompt angeschafft und für gut befunden .sie lädt schnell und zuverlässig und zeigt dies auch so an .Mit der Beleuchtung macht sie ordentlich was her und passt perfekt zum Zockerinterreu…
5,Manettes qui se chargent super vite (usb c) top 👍👍
3,Habe das Ladegerät erst seit einigen Tagen bin aber schon völlig überzeugt. Die station lädt so gut dass selbst ich beim Anfassen etwas von der Ladung abbekomme.Morgens vor der Arbeit fix den Controller aus der Station holen und schwupps wach. top.
5,Funciona perfecto para mandos de ps5 el indicador luminoso de carga es muy práctico y el diseño muy parecido a ps5.
5,En dos horas está cargado el mando.
5,Vom Design her sehr schick passend zu den Controllern und der Ps5.Besonders praktisch die einfache Handhabung. Die Controller gleiten fast von ganz allein in die richtige Position und sind dort relativ fest verankert. Damit Spazieren gehen sollte man aber nicht. Wenn einem das Licht stört befindet sich hinten ein Ein- und Ausschalter. Das war für uns sehr wichtig. Und natürlich muss man die schnelle Aufladung erwähnen einfach herrlich.Unsere erste Aufladestation war ein einziges Rumgefummel und die Ladestation hat weder angezeigt ob Kontakt mit dem Controller vorhanden war und auch nicht ob sie lädt. Ein richtiges Rätselraten.
5,Passt optisch perfekt neben die PS5.Die Kontroller sitzen sehr gut darauf. Somit sind sie immer griffbereit uns einsatzbereit.
5,Sieht aufgeräumt aus und die Funktion die Ladestationen ausschalten zu können ist sehr von Vorteil . Die Beleuchtung könnte etwas dunkler sein aber es stört mich nicht weiter.
5,Tut was es soll. Sieht gut aus.Mit Schalter. 1a.
5,It works great and charges fast
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Nutze jetzt seit einiger Zeit die Ps5 Controller Ladestation und muss sagen bin begeistert.Super Design passend zum Look der Ps5.Controller lassen sich einfach darauf legen und laden extreme schnell.Der Untergrund ist beschichtet sodass selbst mit einer Hand nichts verrutscht beim drauflegen des Controllers.Verarbeitung sieht sehr hochwertig und edel aus und auch die Beleuchtung ist ein Blickfang.Klasse finde ich auch die Anzeige die durch verschiedene Farben den Ladestatus anzeigt und auch leicht aus weiterer Entfernung zu sehen ist.Alles in allem klare Kaufempfehlung!!!!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Quand j'appuie sur le bouton ON OFF de l'appareil pour le mettre en mode off les LED de l'appareil s'éteint mais la manette continue à se charger je me demande bien pourquoi?
5,très bon produit livrer avec son alimentation
5,Lädt schnell sieht super aus und für den Preis ein tolles Produkt.
5,Die Ladestation für 2 PS5-Controller ist im Großen und Ganzen nicht schlecht. Optisch sieht sie sehr schön aus lediglich die Controller richtig zu arretieren damit der Ladevorgang startet ist manchmal ein Gefummel...
5,Man bekommt hier für nen Super Preis ein tolles Ladegerät. Es läd die Controller sehr schnell auf. Die Zeit hab ich nicht gestoppt aber länger wie 2 Std braucht es nicht. Die Ladestation hat auch hinten nen kleinen Schalter wo man es jederzeit ein und ausschalten kann.
4,Das Design ist natürlich Geschmackssache aber mir gefällt es. Abzüge für die schlechte Position des Ein-/Ausschalter (hinten frickelig zu erreichen die Controller werden fast immer verschoben).Weiterer Abzug für den Sitz der Controller wackelig und irgendwie ohne "Führung" an die Ladekontakte.
5,Nicht vom orginal hersteller nichts desto trotz haptisch und optisch äußerst positiv. Funktioniert alles einwandfrei.
5,It charges controllers very quickly! Well worth the money.
5,Sehr praktische LadestationSehr zufrieden damit
5,Forse manca il cavetto USB che a volte. Può essere utile
5,Produit parfait !! Esthétique et pratique
5,Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist sehr gut. Im Ruhemodus lässt es sich komplett ausschalten und verbraucht somit keinen Strom. Die Ladeleistung ist ok.
5,Lädt die Controller zuverlässig auf!
5,davvero utile per chi come me è in possesso di due Joystick per PS5 rapido nella carica dotato di un alimentatore a 220 v.
5,Alles wunderbar! Preis/Leistung ist top Qualität top und Ladeleistung auch top!
5,Bello da vedere perché in stile ps5 comodo e veloce sconsigliato per chi usa cover in silicone. Per il resto prodotto top
4,Super produit je recommande par contre j’ai reçu ma commande Sans le carton de protection tout le monde pouvait voir ma commande
5,Ein tolles Zubehör es passt perfekt zur Playstation 5 von der Optik mir persönlich gefällt das man die controller aufrecht laden kann und nicht kopfüber.Man erkennt auch deutlich welcher Controller voll geladen ist durch den Bildschirm vorne auf der Ladestation Rot bedeutet es wird geladen Blau es ist wieder voll geladen. Preis Leistungsverhältnis ist optimal
4,Very useful
5,Mein Sohn ist Mega zufrieden.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Primero me han llegado súper rápido. El cargador va perfecto se cargan los dos mandos a la vez tiene dos pilotos independientes indicando si se han cargado y cual de manera independiente. Tiene un interruptor detrás por si quieres dejar la base enchufada y no quieres que siempre esté encendida. En definitiva llevo un mes o así y no me han dado fallo. No es la primera vez que compro a OIVO y es genial siempre.
5,Lo recomiendo al llevar su propio cargador
3,Für den Preis ist er in Ordnung. Er lädt schnell. Allerdings ist der vordere Kontakt etwas schwierig. Der hintere kein Problem aber vorne muss man etwas funkeln bis er Kontakt bekommt und läd
5,Würde sie wieder Kaufen.
5,Ich muss sagen das ich sehr überrascht war über die Qualität und Funktionalität der Ladestationen. Klar die Hauptfunktion ist einfach nur laden aber ein paar Punkte haben mich dennoch positiv überrascht.1. Rutschfest... gummierter Boden Unterstützung beim auflegen des Controllers2. Ein und Ausschalter...kein Dauerleuchten mehr der Symbole (kann stören)3. Eigenes Netzteil Vorteil Laden ohne Playstation ;-)4. Tolles Design...passt gut zur PS5Klare Kaufempfehlung...günstiger und mehr  Funktionen als das Original!
5,Für den Preis top! Hält was es verspricht.
5,Tut was es soll passt zum Style der PS5
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My Must Have! I hate to use the cable loading while gaming... This station is so good you can use it while the console is off. The operation is very easy. And I really like the design.
1,Nach knapp 6 Tagen im Betrieb hat das Teil den Geist aufgegeben und ist durchgeschmort. Zum Glück hat das Ding sich nicht entzündet und die Sicherung ist raus geflogen. Hatte auch schon die Station der gleichen Firma mit "Lüfter" der natürlich nicht lüftet und auch nach zwei Monaten ebenso dahin war. Zum Glück hats meine PS5 nicht beschädigt.Lasst einfach die Finger von dem Kram dieser Firma und gebt lieber etwas mehr Geld aus.Werde mir jetzt die Ladestation von Razer holen. Hatte bisher davon nur PC-Zubehör aber alleine meine Maus (Death Adder) hält schon ewig.Wie gesagt: Finger weg von dem Schrott hier!
5,Das Produkt ist an sich super ich kann mich nicht beschweren. Der Preis stimmt auch . Das einzige Manko was ich habe das liegt aber auch nur weil die Ladestation und PS5 und Tv im Schlafzimmer sind ist das das Licht ziemlich hell leuchtet weshalb ich das immer ausgestellt habe. Ein Top Produkt.
5,El.producto la verdad que  ha sido muy efectivo para nosotros porque nos permite cargar al mismo tiempo los dos mandos de la play 5 y así los niños pueden compartir más los juegos entre sí; la verdad es que vale la pena que lo compréis.
5,Bin vollkommen zufrieden damit.
4,Satisfait
5,Habe vor der Bestellung ein paar Tests gelesen die von 3rd Party Ladegeräten abgeraten haben.Das kann ich nicht bestätigen bin voll zufrieden mit der Ladestation tut was sie soll Ladezeit ist auch ok.
5,Merci Amazon Colis reçu rapidement conforme à la description service rapide et impeccable.
5,Muito elegante e faz o seu trabalho.
5,Mein Enkel ist begeistert! Das sagt doch alles.
5,Ein wirkliches Schnäppchen es macht was es soll und sieht dazu auch noch richtig Edel aus.
5,Tolle Ladestation funktioniert einwandfrei sieht schick aus alles bestens.👍🏼
5,Es muy práctico y rápido
3,ottimo prodotto però non fedele alla foto funziona bene ma manca il display che si vede nella descrizione
5,Cómo esperaba
5,Regalato al mio ragazzo per caricare i nostri pad. E pratico e comodo da usare.
5,
5,Comodo semplice e non ingombrante
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Prodotto di ottima qualità e si abbina perfettamente alla nuovissima PlayStation 5!Supporta la ricarica simultanea di 2 Dualsense con la ricarica rapida!L'adattatore di rete è incluso nella confezione che dà in uscita 5v/3A per sfruttare la ricarica rapida in più con i LED di segnalazione saprete sempre se il vostro Dualsense è carico oppure no.Il video che ho caricato spiega tutto.Molto consigliato
3,Sarebbe perfetto se il pulsante on/off avesse senso.Avevo scelto questo carica joypad proprio per non avere un continuo flusso di corrente alla batteria del controller.Ho notato invece che anche se l'interruttore è in posizione OFF il controller con batteria scarica viene comunque ricaricato.Quindi devo staccare la spina per evitarlo.
5,Könnte etwas schneller laden reicht aber wenn man sie für ne gewisse Zeit drauf lässt. Auch bei 2 Controllern ist die Lade Geschwindigkeit moderat. Kann das Produkt dennoch aufgrund des Styles empfehlen da andere Ladestationen teurer und noch langsamer sind.
5,Einfach zu handhaben
5,Die Controller können einfach abgelegt werden und werden schnell aufgeladen ca. 25h bei Vollentladung. Optisch am Design der PS5 sehr gut angepasst mit Beleuchtung!
5,Macht was es soll und sieht schick aus.
5,Unser Sohn ist sehr Zufrieden mit dem Teil
5,Wurde sehr schnell geliefert kann man nur weiterempfehlen
5,Caricabatterie comodo esteticamente valido e pratico con due indicatori luminosi di carica !
5,Sehr gut
5,Einfach und schnelle Lieferung. Ladestation angeschlossen und direkt getestet. Funktioniert einwandfrei und macht sich optisch wirklich gut neben der PS5. Controller werden relativ zügig geladen und man kann an der den LEDs direkt erkennen ob der Controller fertig ist oder noch braucht zum laden.
5,Charge rapide le design est plutôt pas mal  les led peuvent être éteintes avec un simple bouton situé derrière. C’est parfait
5,Good quality works well
5,Für den Preis kann man nicht meckern
5,Die Ladestation sieht sehr schön aus und passt perfekt zum Design der Ps5. Die von Triller lassen sich leicht draufstecken und werden wirklich innerhalb von 2 Stunden geladen. Alles in allem einfach ein gutes Produkt was den Preis absolut wert ist. Klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,Sehr coole und schnelle Ladestation für die Playstation 5. Sieht nicht nur einfach cool aus sondern läd auch extrem zuverlässig. Bin extrem zufrieden.
3,Bello il fatto che abbia il suo alimentatore.Acquistato da 2 mesi e già  si è bruciato il led blu  con il simbolo del primo controller.Per il resto i controller vengono caricati
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Excelente estación de carga con diseño muy similar al oficial. Además añade luces para saber directamente el estado de carga de tus mandos botón de encendido y apagado y luces laterales para dar un toque destacado a tu setup. Sin duda es una opción económica e interesante si necesitas una estación de carga.
5,Lieferung erfolgte schnell und vor angegebenen Termin Ware hat bis jetzt gehalten was versprochen wurde ( läd schnell unkompliziert zu installieren ) Top
5,Il prodotto è ottimospedito velocementefunziona benissimo
5,Die Ladestation ist günstig und lädt die Controller einwandfrei. Man kann sie über einen DIP-Schalter ausschalten. Das Aufsetzen der Controller ist etwas knifflig. Würde ich wieder kaufen.
5,Molto bello
2,Il prodotto meriterebbe una recensione migliore ma non posso fingere di non essere deluso per le consegne gestite da Poste Italiane! Un disastro!
5,Super Ladestation.Schönes Design.Schnelle Ladezeit.Controller passen super auf die Ladestation.Ladestatus wird gut angezeigt.Würde ich wieder kaufen.Preis Leistung 1A.
5,Davvero praticoViene attaccato direttamente alla corrente e non tramite usb alla play e questo consente di avere i controller sempre carichi
5,facile de déposer la manette et petit bouton on/off derriere pour enlever les leds quand on utilise pas la couleur de fin de charge est sympa pour savoir ou en est la charge
5,Funktioniert das gut
5,Ottimo caricatore per PlayStation 5. Utile quando devi ricaricare più controller
5,Très bon produit
5,Arrivé super vite plutôt sympa la couleur va avec la console et en plus cela charge rapidement la manette au top
5,The quality was surprised me. Way better than I thought
5,Die verschiedenen Ladestationen unterscheiden sich nicht wirklich. Aber diese hat einen On Off Schalter für die Beleuchtung. Das ist ein großer Pluspunkt für mich da die Station nicht dauerhaft weiter leuchtet wenn die Controller geladen sind. 👌🏻
5,The product looks and feel very authentic. The wire is about 1.5m long and the charging station takes only 2 hours to fully charge your controller. Once it is charged the light will go off.Fantastic product! Very authentic.I've never owned a charging station before and this is perfect!
4,r.a.s
5,Très joli chargeur l'affichage LED est très utile et sympa esthétiquement.
2,Il prodotto sarebbe anche bello comodo e funzionale peccato che è usato e anche male ed è stato venduto x nuovo. Arrivato con scatola con sigilli manomessi articolo sprovvisto di protezione display e molto graffiato.
1,Am anfang ging das Produkt ohne Probleme aber nach kurzer Zeit werden auf beiden Spots keine Controller mehr geladen...
5,Simple efficace fonctionne bien ne prend pas de place pas cher
3,Eigentlich gibt es an der Funktion soweit ich das bisher beurteilen kann nichts zu bemängeln. Auch optisch durchaus passend zur PS5. Was aber richtig doof ist: Die Auflagefläche ist so klein das die Controller bei der geringsten Berührung aus der Halterung kippen. Sie fallen zwar nicht runter aber sie verlieren den Kontakt zur Ladebucht. Ausserdem ist das platzieren der Controller extrem nervig da man diese nur in einem ganz bestimmten Winkel zum einrasten bewegen kann. Schnell mal zum Laden reingelegt (wie es die Bilder hier suggerieren) funktioniert also nicht. Schön ist allerdings das dem Gerät ein Netzteil beiliegt und man nicht gezwungen ist die Ladebucht an der PS5 per USB oder einer anderen (ebenfalls dann Strom verbrauchenden) Quelle betreiben muß.
5,Sie tut was sie soll. Lädt echt schnell und die Qualität passt.
5,Läd ohne Probleme 2 Controller auf. Alles bestens 👌🏽
5,Ne prend pas de place charge rapide design simple et efficace
5,Perfecta estacion de cargamás barata que la orinaldiseño igual y con Led azul y símbolos de cuando esta cargado los mandomuy recomendada comprarla si no quieres gastarte lo que vale la original.
5,Ottima qualita
3,Man kann leider auf dieser Ladestation keine PS 5 Controller mit Silikonhülle laden. Schade
3,BonjourTrès bon chargeur mais reçu endommagé envoyé avec la boîte d’origine sans cartons supplémentaires ou autre protection cela n’est pas normal.
5,Funktioniert tut was es soll.Gute Alternative gegenüber kabelgebunden
5,Conforme aux attentes
5,Funktioniert ohne Probleme und leuchtet auch noch schon. Würde es wieder kaufen.
5,Beste Alternative wenn es nicht das überteuerte original sein soll
5,es ist besser als des Orginale
5,Fonctionne parfaitement bien led bleue ou rouge qui indique quand la manette est chargée qui peut être coupée via un petit interrupteur.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Questa stazione di ricarica carica contemporaneamente e rapidamente i controller DualSense semplicissima e intuitiva da utilizzare.Design e colori uguali a quelli di PS5 perfetto.Gli indicatori LED segnalano la condizione carica o scarica del controllo comodo
5,Una maravilla bonito y muy cómodo en 2h el mando está cargado y con el indicador de LED sabes el estado de carga. Muy Recomendable
5,ce produit fonctionne très bien. Fidèle à la photo. A voir dans le temps
5,Recharge bien et quand la manette est chargé ça s'arrête tout seul rien a dire
5,Finalmente posso caricare i miei joystick
2,Die Aufladestation konnte ich heute (pünktlich) in Empfang nehmen.Direkt zu Anfang fiel die mangelhafte Verpackung auf. Dieses Produkt wird einfach in dem Originalkarton versendet also ohne ein zusätzliches Paket welches die Ware schützen soll.Nach dem auspacken habe ich sofort diverse Mängel festgestellt. Unter anderem ist das Display völlig zerkratzt und das Teil macht den Eindruck als wäre das schon einmal benutzt wurden.Generell macht die Verarbeitung und die Qualität der Station überhaupt keinen guten Eindruck.Das ist meine erste Kunden-Rezension die ich persönlich schreibe weil ich finde auch für diesen Preis kann man durchaus bessere Qualität erwarten. Ich bin schon fast gewollt zu schreiben dass das Produkt schon fast eine Frechheit ist.FINGER WEG!Billig-Ware!
5,allles ok
5,Die Ladestation gefällt mir. Sie macht das was sie machen soll.
1,No funcionaba ha ido de vuelta
5,Super produit et design
5,Chargeur manettes ps5 parfait conforme à la description
5,Love it.clean and works as it should
5,
1,Gerät lässt sich nicht mehr einschalten. 4 Monate Haltbarkeit sind eine absolute Katastrophe.
2,Ich habe mir die Ladestation bestellt da die Originale von Sony ausverkauft war. Am Anfang war alles gut. Aber bereits nach 6 Monaten ist die Station kaputt. Ich meine 20€ ist jetzt nicht überragend teuer. Dennoch finde ich es traurig dass die Station nur 6 Monate gehalten hat. Werde mir diese nicht mehr kaufen.
1,Generell ist die Handhabung der Ladestation sehr gut und die Controller sind einfach einzustecken.Ladefunktion hat für einen Tag auch sehr gut funktioniert.Nach einem Tag haben aber keine LEDs aufgeleuchtet egal ob Controller eingesteckt waren oder nicht.Ein Test mit einem anderen Netzteil verlief erfolgreich so dass wahrscheinlich von einem defekt des Netzteils auszugehen ist.Gerät wird zurückgesendet. Aufgrund der positiven Bewertungen und der sehr guten Handhabung habe ich aber das gleiche Gerät nochmals bestellt. Ich hoffe dass das erste ein Montagsgerät war.
5,Alles super nach 2 Std ist der Controller wieder voll.
2,Ist meiner Meinung nach nicht zu empfehlen da die Controller mit Gefühl aufgesetzt werden müssen da diese sonst nicht geladen werden und wenn man diese anstubst oder berührt haben die direkt keinen Kontakt mehr und werden nicht mehr geladen🤦🏻 zahlt besser 20€ mehr und holt euch das Original mein Ladegerät habe ich wider verkauft und mir eine originale Ladestation geholt und die ist 1000 mal besser 👍
2,Lo compré para mandos de play 5. El cargador funcionaba pero la pantalla delantera estaba toda rayada. Si los mandos llevan puesta una funda no cargan. Sin la funda sí. Yo sí que tengo así que lo devolví.
5,Kann man bedingungslos weiterempfehlen
5,Ho riscontrato dei difetti nell'articolo ma l'assistenza mi ha contattato tempestivamente per risolvere i problemo. Cosigliato!
5,Sieht optisch gut aus und tut was es soll !
5,Muy buen producto esteticamente bonito y productivo!
5,Funciona muy bien calidad-precio buenas
5,Very nice
2,Defektes Ladegerät erhalten unnötig komplizierte Rückabwicklung schade
1,Ausgepackt angesteckt- Controller draufgelegt Power Schalter ein und gewartet.Keine Reaktion Kevin Ladevorgang.Somit zurück zum Hersteller. Keine Kaufempfehlung
5,Bon rapport qualité-prix
5,Muito bom !! Recomendo..
2,Il ne charge plus alors qu’il a moins d’un an !!!
1,Die Controller laden... ich habe immer wieder das Problem die Controller nicht genau auf die Ladestation zu bekommen. Dann schiebt man elendig lange den Controller hin und her bis Er endlich einhakt.
5,Alles top
2,Achtung gefährlich! Netzteil ist nach nur 2 Stunden explodiert bzw implodiert! Es gab einen hellen Blitz und einen lauten Knall danach war im Wohnzimmer alles Dunkel. Keine Kaufempfehlung!Nachtrag: Der Verkäufer hat sich bei mir gemeldet und es fand eine gute Kommunikation statt. Die Erstattung hat gut funktioniert! Daher 1 Stern mehr!
5,Très bon produit recharge bien et très beau design
1,Leider funktioniert die hintere Ladeschale nicht. Sehr ärgerlich für ein neues Produkt.
2,Produit conforme et en état de marche  dommage que la boîte soit envoyer tel qu’elle sans aucune protection la boîte étant légèrement endommagé.
1,Am liebsten würde ich es austauschennach nicht mal 2 Monatenfängt eine LED vorne an der Ladestation ihren Geist aufzugeben.Leuchtet nur noch sehr schwach.Händler bietet Rückgabe von 4 Wochen.
1,An sich eine super Ladestation aber leider kam sie bei mir komplett zerkratzt an vor allem auf dem Display es war leider auch noch nicht mal eine schutzfolie auf dem Display vorhanden bei mir geht sie wieder zurück schade
1,Leider schon nach 2 Monaten defekt
1,Nach einem halben Jahr bereits defekt. Schade
1,Die Aufladestation wurde heute ohne Umverpackung also im Originalkarton geliefert. Das Display war zerkratzt zeigte Gebrauchsspuren. Habe deshalb gar nicht weiter ausprobiert sondern zurück geschickt.Wenn schon B-Ware dann wenigstens kennzeichnen und billiger anbieten.
1,très deçu par ce produit qui ne fonctionne pas je l'utilise avec une manette de PS5 et elle ne se charge pas
1,Male
2,I bought this as a gift.. and it was used. There were scratches on the screen and the plug had clearly been used. Ugh
5,Really good product
5,The charger seems well constructed and is esthetically pleasing with the lights and charge indicator.
5,Works great. Does what it is supposed to do charge your controllers without issue.
5,This is easily the best charging dock for the dualsense controllers. It's more affordable than the one from Sony and it works just as well. It's great when you can have a gaming session dock your controller on the charger and have it charge overnight leaving it ready to be picked up the next day.Some reviewers have knocked the included power adapter in this SKU but there is another available with a dual USB-A to USB-C cable but before running off to buy that SKU ask yourself why would you want to take up 2 USB-A ports out of the 3 available on the PS5? A wall wart makes much more sense and provides faster charging.The only area this product needs improvement is the front LED panel and the controller icons. Both look really cheap but it's a very minor gripe for what is a fantastic product.
1,Todo bien
5,Work perfectly and much more convenient than using the charge cable!
5,Works as needed. Seems to be well made.
4,Rapport qualité prix
1,It sucks if you have something protecting your controller it doesnt read
5,Keeps my controllers charged And tell you when it’s ready. Just what I was looking for.
5,Parfait pour charger les manettes
5,Good quality product Well worth the purchase
5,Le seul point négatif c'est qu'il faut jouer avec la manette pour avoir le bon angle pour le connecter au chargeur.
5,Carga bastante rápido y se siente de bastante Calidad.
5,Le chargeur es parfait et après le chargement facile à place à une tablette ou ranger
5,Great product. Charges controllers fast. LED display was a bit scratched but everything else is great. Would recommend.
3,Only using one day. So far so good. Will you date in a week.
3,It does the job but there are a couple of issues:1. As a number of people have said the controllers are very precariously positioned and it's a real pain to get them properly positioned to charge. One little bump and they're off of the cradle.2. The light on the front has already gotten dim. I've had this thing for 3 weeks so I'm not exactly optimistic about the longevity. It still works but we'll see how long that will last...
3,Does it’s job in the charging department but lining up the charging pin with the controller is not easy every time it takes a bit of wiggling the controller around to get it aligned. Controller is not very stable and can be unintentionally knocked off.
4,Charger seem to work good so far
5,Simple easy good value... I'm happy. Simple item not much more to say. Controllers connect easily and the design pairs well with the console
5,Fonctionne très bien beau look permet de charger 2 manettes ps5 design similaire à la console blanche. Il y a un adaptateur secteur et ce n'est pas relié par usb. Avantage ou inconvénient cela dépendra de votre installation.
1,So far the blue lights on the front stay on. Controllers light up as they are charging like normal. Works great. Only detail is that they dont clip in. They just sit there loose on the charger. If they get bumped a bit then they wont charge. But still a good product.EDITAfter a few days it actually doesnt charger the controllers. Both controllers are dead now. The charger will only light up blue now matter. Read the vague instructions and no help. I will be return this product.
5,Me gustó carga el control como en 2hrs.
5,Easy to use and it works
5,I just find the light on it to be too bright so I turned that off. It's an button on it. Otherwise its perfect. Charges way faster than the cord that the ps5 came with.
5,Works like a charm!  And with the right 3.0 USB charging block it charges very quick!
3,It gets the job done for not too much money. I would not recommend it to someone with pets because the controller only "sits" on the charger (it's not really plugged in) and can easily stop charging if it's jostled a little bit. Also the lights are very bright and it's disturbing when it's sitting on a shelf in the living room near the TV. You can turn it off with a button when it's done charging but it's annoying while charging.
5,Pareil à l’imagine fonctionne bien
5,The product works well and does what it's supposed to.
5,good
1,Buyer beware produced didn’t even work right out of the package no signs of damage but just literally doesn’t charge and no lights on the front of unit.No idea if it’s the charger or the cord not working but I’m returning this POS!
5,Works great!
1,Charger doesn’t work anymore. The red light turns on which signals the controller is “charging” while it doesn’t charge the controller. I let it sit “charging” for 4 hours and no dice. Worked well for 3 months
5,Simple to use and set up. Nicely lit up  Looks good beside the PS5
5,Works great and easy to use.
5,Très satisfait charge très bien
5,Easy to use fair price
4,Simple and works. Came with power block. No complaints!
5,El cargador es de tamaño compacto lo que facilita el colocarlo en cualquier espacio libre la carga es bastante rápida de los controles y evita tener que usar el cable cada vez que se descarga algún control cumple con lo prometido.
1,En el momento en que lo conecté a la corriente y lo encendí empezó a parpadear y nunca cargo mis controles. No lo recomiendo y cuidado con la compra. Devolución iniciada
5,Super design la manette s'appose parfaitement.  Interrupteurs on/off intéressant.
5,Lo he ocupado por unas 3 semanas y todo bien marca cuando a algún control que este colocado en la bas le falta batería y también indicador de cuando ya está cargado.
5,It work super duper good. You rikey too 100%
5,Lo he ocupado por unas 3 semanas y todo bien marca cuando a algún control que este colocado en la bas le falta batería y también indicador de cuando ya está cargado.
5,Prodotto ben fatto consiglio al 100%
3,Product description says it comes with a 3 year warranty however warranty card with unit says the following3 Year Support45 Day Return90 Day Replacement
5,Fast and good
5,Design and functionality is perfect.
5,A month in and this works great. Wouldn’t hesitate to buy again
5,Great value  and works great.
5,Great stuff
5,I like that the led has an off switch. Controller already lights up when charging. Great product worth it.
5,Nice quality with lights.
5,This charger is great it is the same colour as the PS 5. It has big bright charging indicators and the controllers are easy to add remove.
5,Llegó en excelente estado totalmente sellado y funciona al 100%
5,Parfait
5,It works great you wouldn’t even notice the difference from the original one except for the controller sitting on the charger wobble a little but it’s fine
5,Très beau produit
4,Works great and well just easy to slip off but it’s perfect
4,I've had others in the past that we're difficult to line up.  This one aimed to solve that by using better connection points but it isn't foolproof..  Had it for over a month now and sometimes you need to move it around in order for it to catch.  Sometimes it's effortless but then some annoying moments when you're moving it around until it locks into place.Overall good quality and works well.  I would recommend it.
1,It stopped working after just 1 month. Garbage.
5,Great for the price paid! Works well and look sleek!
5,I bought a PS5 controller not so long ago in order to play games on my computer and I couldn't charge the controller ANYWHERE. The wall USB C USB A any of my computers or other devices.The charging station had a scratch on it already when I put it out of the box though.So I tried this charging station as I thought this was my only option and so far so good!Havent tried the controller yet to tell how long of a charge it makes but its my only way of charging the beautiful controller so works for me!
5,charge bien! les lumières sont cool! aucun commentaire négatif! je vous le recommande!
5,Works good. Only issue was that I can't charge both controllers if I leave the Kontrol freeks on because the spacing between the controllers is too small for the medium sized stick extenders. I just take them off when charging.
5,Parfait pour ce que c'est sencé faire. Un peu "lousse" lorsqu'on met les manettes dessus (ne "clique" pas sur la base ce dépose seulement) mais mise à part ça tout fonctionne A1 donc on est satisfait :)
5,Works great and at a fraction of the price.
5,It's a good item and it looks just like in the picture. I would have done one thing differently it's to have had the power switch at the front instead of the back. Aside from that it's excellent.
5,Carga rápida en 2h carga los controles tiene una especie de resaque que sirve de guía para colocar correctamente el control el display funciona muy bien(rojo cuando falta carga y ya en azul cuando ya está cargado) además cuenta con un botón para apagar el cargador por si ya no se va a utilizar.Es muy buena comprá lo recomiendo especialmente para preservar más el puerto usb tipo c del control además el tiempo de carga es mejor 2h contra 3.xh cargando de la consola
1,It does say 3 year warrantly but imposible to find how to start the process....
5,Très utile lorsque vous  avez plusieurs manettes.Toute une différence avec le led bleu comparé de celui venu avec la PS5. Indique rouge lorsque la manette doit être rechargée et tourne au bleu lorsque la charge est bonne.Très satisfait du produit.
4,Funciona muy bien para cargar los mandos el único detalle que le encuentro es que no los carga con la funda puesta.
1,Worked for a bit. Subsequently died. Asked for a replacement under warranty. Haven't heard from anyone since.
5,Excellent product highly recommended. Fantastic customer service.
5,Bien aimé
4,Charges PS5 controllers every time. LED status light is very useful.
4,When I place the controller on it even when the back switch is turned off my controller led orange charging light lights up on and off continuously just like when I connect it to a usb charger.
5,as promised arrived next day perfect as usual
1,Stopped working after a few months
5,Works perfect.
5,Me gusto es tal cual dice la descripción del artículo
5,This third party accessory looks similar to the official product. It charges low battery controllers in 2 hours and completely dead controllers in about 3 hours.
5,Works exactly as described. The display is simple but looks very clean. Easy to know when your controllers are charged. Charges controllers without a cord coming from the front of your system which is what I wanted. Would recommend.
5,I am absolutely LOVING this docking station for the Dualsense controllers from OIVO!This product plugs directly into the wall which allows you to keep your controllers charging away from where your PlayStation 5 is if you'd like and saves you from taking up a USB port on your console to charge your controllers with.The charger lights up blue or red controller icons showing if it is charged or not. I am not the biggest fan of the icons as they do feel a little tacky/cheap looking but overall they're really not that bad just not as sleep as it would be if it wasn't an icon. The visual signal of charging is awesome though.Easy to attach Dualsense controllers to the dock. Just sit them on it.Also is a great way to display and show off your controllers.Takes about 2 hours to get a full charge from a completely dead controller.Very well built instructions are easy to understand.Has intelligent chip which makes sure the controller doesn't overcharge and stops around 80%LEDs look nice but aren't too bright. Tend to look more purple on camera but are very blue in real life. They pulse while charging and just stay blue when fully charged.Highly recommend getting this! Great product overall!
5,Great product works as intended and the seller stands behind their product! Will help you out with any issues even after return policy. I would buy from them again.
1,Good device at the beginning cool looking cheap construction broke after 1 month
1,Garbage. Doesn't work on either of my Ps5 controllers.
5,Excellent product very easy to use and charges remotes in no time! Highly recommend!
5,Charges well
5,Bought this for my husband's new PS5 controllers. It's nice that it has a light option to display when they are being charged or when they're fully charged. Good product - would recommend!
4,It does exactly what it's meant for
5,So far so good. Not as common in white so that’s nice and it does the job. The on-off switch is a nice feature.
5,All I can say is that it works great!
