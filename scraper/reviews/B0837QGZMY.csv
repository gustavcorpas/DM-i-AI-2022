5,I had reset my MacBook and encountered a screen that required a connection to the internet to complete the reset. Being that apple had the genius **cough cough** idea to only put USB C connections I had no way to connect my cat cable to my MacBook. Found this nifty adapter which did the trick! If you have a Mac or any laptop that somehow only has USB C connections this is a great accessory to have.
5,I have a Macbook with only USB-C ports. I bought this to connect it to a wired gigabit ethernet network. When I plugged in the adapter it was immediately detected and began working as expected. The speeds are good.
4,This works just fine as an extension or an adapter since my computer does not actually have an ethernet cable slot I’ve used it a few times it works as is intended to but there are a few times where you have to completely unplug and replug back in for it to reconnect to the Internet using wire the connection if it’s been a while since you last connected it that’s the only downfall I can think of so far
5,It works perfectly giving my Chromebook wired access to my router when I need it. Quality build.
5,It is just what I needed.  Fits and works great!
4,At least I can connect my MacBook to a physical Ethernet cable for speed.
5,Device worked as advertised. No problems with it at all.
5,My Tracfone Moto G7 phone has a setting to allow USB tethering.  My purpose was to allow my phone to act as a temporary source of internet connectivity if my Xfinity cable internet went out.  However the option remained grayed out after connecting an ethernet cable using this adapter.  I tried USB debugging on and off also tried connecting the ethernet cable directly to my desktop or through a switch.  No joy the USB tethering option in the Moto G7 settings remained grayed out.In fairness to this device the problem is most likely with the functionality embedded into the Tracfone SIM card.  Tracfone is known to be hostile to tethering.I've give the product five stars because it did work flawlessly to connect my laptop directly to a wired ethernet connection.  Max download speed with 5G wi-fi is only 285 Mbps.  Using this adapter enables the entire 600 Mbps of my Xfinity internet service.  Still I'm returning the adapter since it won't serve as an internet backup.  I wouldn't waste your time if your service provider is Tracfone.
4,Works well but is a very tight squeeze when I plug it into everything
5,What is there to say?  I plugged the USB-C plug into my HP laptop that doesn't have an Ethernet port plugged an Ethernet cable from my modem into the Ethernet side and lo and behold I am now have a wired connection that runs about 5x faster than the built-in Wi-Fi.  Notably it works both on Window 11 and Ubuntu Linux.
5,Quick set up. Good product for the money.
5,Met expectations.
4,Worked for connecting ethernet cord to Samsung Galaxy Book Go 5G.. No issues.
5,I am tired of using wi-fi for everything and new computers don't come with ethernet ports.....this was perfect plug and play
5,Completely happy with this product
4,good item works properly
5,Works as you would expect. Good quality and good value.
5,I needed to download more quickly and this device worked great to adapt my ethernet cable to a C port...
5,Doesn't seem to be limited with the listed products.  I plugged this into a standard USB-3 port on a home-built system and it gave me a Gigabit network interface.  Works perfectly.
5,I Highly recommend this adapter it works very well its plug and play out of the box.  Works well for my 2019  HP Laptop 15t-dy100 which has a wifi 6 card that works great. However sometimes its nice to be able to plug in an ethernet cable to get a direct internet connection. Which is where this adapter comes in I needed a direct connection for installing a new operating system on my computer.  I used it help me do a complete Linux Mint 20.04 install from Windows 10 so that way I knew for sure that I could get my wifi driver and initial updates installed correctly. Which it did.  Works for Windows 10 and Linux.My take away from the adapter it works very well plug and play out of the box no software or drivers needed it just works!! Fair price if you are looking for a usb-c to Rj45 adapter buy this one.
5,Excellent fit and finish. Works great. Now I have a good backup for times when wi-fi drops out
5,Same performance for less than half the price of the name brand priced at $45. Enough said!
5,I like that it’s small and I use it for my laptop at work.
5,This here fella is the best adapter for yerr favorite hi speed internet needs. Whooooiiiieeee!!!
5,Odd question on wifi - it's an ethernet adapter.
4,equipo manejable y buen acabado
5,Just got this little dongle. This thing works great and increased my speed so much! I bought a new laptop and was trying to download games but the download would not start. Took the laptop to my parents house and worked instantly so figured it was my weak wifi however speeds suppose to be over 150 mbps. I started another download i did a speed test (pic 1) and speeds was ridiculously slow my cell phone on 3g is faster than this. Plugged this adapter and heard the ready for use sign and plugged in the ethernet cable and boom 200+ mbps (pic 2). Downloaded a game from xbox pass and this downloaded within an hr where as before did not even start due to connection. I would recommend this to anyone with a usb c and has easy ethernet connection you will see a huge difference!
5,Easy to use
4,Works as advertised easy to attach and holds up well. Would recommend.
5,It works as advertised
