4,This is a really nice wall mount. So much so that when I was installing a bedroom tv in my camper I ordered this mount again. Sadly it was NOT the same model that I purchased before even though I just clicked on ‚Äúorder this again‚Äù from my Amazon account. This led to some Frankenstein-ing my mount so I wouldn‚Äôt have to drill new holes in my wall to accommodate the new footprint. But all in all it worked out and it‚Äôs a fabulous purchase. Good range of motion sturdy and tight hold on angles while still being able to move when in place.
5,If I had realized these were so affordable and universal to most TVs I would have gotten it sooner.
4,Works as it should great price for a wall mount that moves.
5,Does what it is supposed to do. Easy install.
4,For the price i was very happy with this one even bought a 2nd one. I was looking for a TV mount that could hold a 40 in and specifically said it could rotate vertical and horizontally. After a surprisingly long search i finally came across this one (most TV mounts don't seem to consider this rotation). It calls for a slightly smaller TV size but i tried it first with a 42 in That used a 200x200 mount and fell a good 10 lbs under the maximum weight limit and fit great! I actually just left it that and about 3 months later it's still working well for me.One item worth a note of caution however is how the rotation is attached. Its a square plate bracket (this is where the TV mounts) attached to the end of the arm assembly using a large nut and bolt. The issue i noticed is the more often you switch between portrait and landscape orientation the looser the bolt gets and at first it easily tilts a little sideways on its own and at first I had to go back and tighten it often but after a little bit of use this became less frequent. Now i just periodically check it but you can pretty much tell if it starts tilting slightly. Also i should note there is nothing to stop the or lock the rotation it could (cables not withstanding) keep rotating in a full circle over and over. Otherwise I'm very happy with this product so far.
5,UPDATE:  the customer service team reached out to me and they got it taken care of and fixed. They sent me a replacement the first time and for some reason it went to another town and so they sent me another one and it was received and perfect. I have three of these and they hold up our TVs really well. I highly recommend this company and this product. And we greatly appreciate and value their customer service and getting this taken care of. We are extremely satisfied!We bought this a few months ago to prepare for our move. I finally gotten to putting it together to try to put up our tv but it's missing parts. Is there someone that can reach out to me about this? Without these missing parts it's useless.
5,Great price and works great
5,It works good. Just wish it would tilt.
5,Sturdy hold the tv no problem with this product
5,came in a nice size box easy to assemble and sturdy for our tv
5,Excellent product for the price will order another one üòä
5,Just as the stars say easy to install sturdy and works!!
5,Reasonable price for a very high quality product. Easy to follow instructions enabled a quick installation.
5,Came on time. Super easy to install. Very sturdy for my 32 inch in the man cave. Five stars
5,It was easy to install.  Clear instructions.  All hardware including screws included. I had no problems.  Installed on a concrete block wall.
5,It did exactly what I needed it to do.
5,This is perfect for my needs. I have my tv in my art studio and the arm allows me to turn (swivel) so I can view from any angel nd the tilt low me to keep the tv level.
5,They put in many different types of hardware for many different televisions
4,I needed this
5,Fast and easy to install
5,Super easy to install everything was included with easy to read directions. Had my 40" TV up on the wall in 20 minutes! Have had it now for 2 months and it is a fantastic product! Great quality and price!
5,Excelente muy buena calidad del materila incluye todos los accesorios necesarios y f√°cil de instalar.
5,Works as described
5,I'm proud that I hung this myself well mostly my teenage daughter helped hold certain things in place. I watched a few YouTube videos to make sure I did it right. I ended up having to buy the drill & stud finder.
5,Easy to install very clear instructions plenty of parts to fit any type of TV extra parts easy to put together parts seem very sturdy and durable
5,Used it to put a 32‚Äù tv on my shed for the summer. Worked well for what I needed it for.I thought we‚Äôll priced too.
3,Would not reccomend to anyone who wants to have an easy installation. That being said once you have anything installed to this good luck taking it down afterwards.
5,Simple easy assembly. Sturdy at the right price
5,I was surprised this bracket arrived in a relatively small box unlike those I have bought for much more at big box stores. However the bracket is sturdy and appears to be quite versatile for accommodating different sizes of TVs. Ours worked on the smallest size so was quite easily set up. We used this to install a 32‚Äù TV into a brick wall on a screen in porch. It is fully articulating and we are quite pleased with the setup.
3,Missing nuts and bolts for vesa mount extenders. But otherwise great product!
5,Easy to install on my 32‚Äù TV
5,This item arrived much smaller than I thought it would be but when installing it on our 40 inch Samsung TV it worked perfectly. I had to flip the little hands around because I put them on incorrectly the first time but I eventually figured out that detail of picture instructions. Lol
3,First of all never try and install something like this by yourself because you will need help attaching it to either the wall with the TV or attaching the TV to the bracket after it is on the wall.  It says it will hold up to a 40" TV well I have a 32" (not heavy) and the TV will not stay in a position when hung on the wall. I have taken it down and will use it on maybe one of my smaller computer monitors.
5,Easy to assemble and the directions of the tv
3,The screws to mount monitor to mount don't fit. Trying to find the right screw size. I have use the mount before and it works good. Need to add 4 each M5 X .75 mounting screws. They have M4 M6 M8. But no M5
5,Worth the money. Easy to install.
5,i bought it for my kitchen 24 inch tv installed it with no problems it looks good on the wall i wood buy again
4,I had a hell of a time finding a stud as my basement wall isn't framed 16'' on center. My stud finder helped me plan on where I wanted to install the bracket. I drilled preholes so the bolts would go into the studs a bit easier I am pleased with the end result I just wish it stayed in place 100% of the time. I often find the TV slightly off balance after using it for a while. I have no qualms about the bracket not being sturdy enough. As long as you get your two bolts into studs you could probably hang off this thing and it wouldn't budge. If I had a much larger/more expensive TV I'd probably get a higher grade bracket or have it installed professionally. Overall the bracket did what I wanted it to do and was fairly easy to install. For those who are not handy or have no idea how to use tools it might be a learning experience!
5,You get your money's with this mount.
4,Although it was a snap to put together a real challenge to install
5,Second one we bought.  Great product
5,The only bad thing about it is the cheap lag screws they provide for wall stud. Took a while to screw in because the tips of the screw wear down quick but other than that works perfect for my TV and gave me more space in my little apartment.
5,Easy to install on Sheetrock but additional tools will be required to install on a concrete wall. Product seems to be well made and extremely functional and useful.
2,I bought one of these and the product functioned correctly and was as stated. I then purchased a second mount that was supposedly the exact same and they apparently changed the design so there is now "kunckle" on the back rather than a slide up/down. This is not the same product which is not trust inducing becuase it was supposed to be. This knuckle is difficult to keep any alignment regardless how tight the fiddley little adjustment nut is. They should have stayed with the first design. I wont be coming back to this manufacture because they no longer have my trust.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It was a great fit for my new Vizio smart tv D series "32" in . Super easy installation and works great! I visited Walmart on Monday and their mounts were $40-$50 and even $70
5,This was easy to install and allows you to adjust your tv to be viewed from many angles. It‚Äôs sturdy and worked great for my 40‚Äù flat screen!
5,Once I finish putting it (correction) it did and now I'm happy to do mine.
5,Love it.. needed small TV stand for my small library at home
5,Perfect
5,Needed to hang my Samsung curved monitor to get it off my desk to give me more surface space. Works great and is easy to install.  Love how I can move it around and move it away from my desk so I close my rolltop desk now without having to unplug my monitor.
5,The wall mount is very sturdy. It was fairly simple to hang up onto the wall. The thing I love about the product is that it has very great range of motion. It extends out pretty far. And moves from left to right without any troubles.
5,Working great for our patio TV
4,This was not the easiest thing to mount to the wall with only one set of hands. You have to get the lag screws into the stud (not just the drywall) before they start biting enough to use a socket wrench. And the mount was a little heavy to hang onto while doing that. However once it was installed I had no concerns about sturdiness it‚Äôs a good mount for the money. It was also the best mount I could find for my needs. I needed 100x200 VESA mounting which is probably the least common small VESA mount pattern at least it appeared to be according to my searching. I‚Äôve attached a picture that shows how I achieved the 100x200 mount even though the printed instructions that came with the product didn‚Äôt show this pattern as an option. I knew the Amazon listing showed it as an option so I tinkered around until I got what I needed.
5,TV mount is installed in bedroom with a 32 inch TV. It is very stable and works very well. It is easy to adjust folding and unfolding
5,Solid construction and works as expected.
4,un poco de problema parese que mi TV es diferente modelo.
4,Using this in an RV works great and could not beat the price
4,Good product for the price‚Ä¶
4,Producto muy bueno
4,pretty easy to mount the only issues I saw was the drywall mounting clip things it tore up my wall when I was taking them out. You might be wondering why I would take them out the answer is it wasn't tight enough. So now I have two holes in the wall. I had to go get plaster and patch up the holes I had to go out and buy actually good clips too but otherwise its really well built and easy to use.
5,The device is easy to put together. Easy is versatile for different televisions
5,Product fit my TV well and was easy to install
5,I had my tv up on the wall in less than 15 minutes!
5,This small mount is very sturdy and moves easily into different positions.
4,Grate Item.
4,Other reviewers say this was an easy install. I had never done this before so I found instructions hard to understand.  Also they gave me hardware that the instruction s said to use and note on lag nuts said not to use.  But it is installed nicely but would like it to be less wobbly when moving the tv.
5,I used the product on a wall with limited studs and was perfect for this application
5,Easy to assemble
5,Summary:  Works as advertised!Details:  I‚Äôm using this to hang a 24-inch monitor. It was easy to install and is very sturdy. The adjustments for extension tilt etc. are the right degree of tightness not too loose and not too tight.
5,Super easy to put the mount up bracket on the tv and then slide the tv with the bracket into the socket on the wall and put your two screws in.  Would be a little easier to get the tv bracket into the arm if they added small angled ears to guide the tv mount side into arm side cause it‚Äôs a tight fit  But it‚Äôs cheap and easy to mount and unmount my 43 inch tv I have 3 of these brackets so I can just move my tv/soundbar to my cabin garage or gym in just a min of work.
5,I purchased this to mount a 2013 Apple Thunderbolt monitor to a cinderblock wall that my office desk is up against.  I needed something to hold the girthy 24/25 pounds of monitor and hold it in the portrait layout.  I am using this as a 2nd monitor and wanted it in an orientation that made it easy to read and review documents and technical drawings.It was super easy to install and easy to get the monitor in place and turned to the orientation that I wanted it.  I didn't even require a pair of 2nd hands to help.  I would highly recommend.
5,Pro: easy to install (two of us had these up in minutes!) rotates & extends easily sturdyCon: no cord channel but fine to zip tie came with lots of hardware except wood screws.So be sure you have some if needed!I love the extra desk top space now the monitors are on the wall. Happy with tilt and rotate options as well as flexible options to extend/adjust monitor locations (either next to each other or separated. Something to think about when installing.  When the monitor rotated cannot tilt up/down so make sure you are happy with installation height if you rotate the monitor long ways often.
4,Does what its supposed to
4,Easy to install and made with quality materials. Package arrived in a nice lil box tightly packed and all hardware well organized in sealed and lettered packages.My only complaint and the reason for four stars is i would've liked to have a plastic cover that goes over the wall mounting plate to cover the hardware as I've gotten with similar mounts.
2,Not an easy mount to install. Had to do modifications to get it installed. Just glad I was not installing a bigger tv then a 32‚Äù.
5,This mount is super easy to set up and use. I‚Äôve used it on 32 inch and 40 inch televisions and it works great!!
3,Screw broke off in the TV and couldn‚Äôt get it out.  Otherwise the mount was nice for the money.
5,Purchased a small TV for my son's room. Wanted something I could pull out easy enough to add to remove cables as needed. This mount extends very far tilts and rotates. Instructions were pretty clear and the tv manufacturer was even kind enough to add a label of what screws were needed for the wall mount these were provided with the wall mount.
2,did not have correct screws
5,I‚Äôve had this mount in our camper now for 3ish months and it has held up. It‚Äôs a little more tedious to put together but for the price it‚Äôs worth it.
3,Did not like the the assembly process.
5,Very easy to install very very sturdy the whole job took about 30 minutes
5,Easy to install and works great.  Great quality at a terrific price.
4,Muy bueno
4,Stand was a bit smaller than what I expected.
5,This is a perfect mount for my lanai tv‚Ä¶very easy to install and very versatile
4,Easy to install
5,I was very satisfied with this product.  Everything I needed was included and very easy to install.
4,Works good
5,Perfect fit for many arrangements on different tvs. Sturdy. Moves any direction you like. My hubby finally has his backyard sports pool oasis & can fully annoy me with a game at any time. I durprised him w wireless earphones so I us girfriends can enjoy music instead!
5,I believe this mount was very easy to install and perfect for a small room! I have my brother install it and it took him less than 15 minutes without instructions. It‚Äôs sturdy and very easy to move around. Overall I recommend this product.
4,The product is great and sturdy the directions were a little challenge but was able to get it together in the end
4,A good value. Did the trick. Am going to buy one for my office. Thx
5,Great mount
5,Basic but great value
5,Easy to install and adapt.  Moves smoothly.  Sturdy but not bulky or heavy.  Worked perfectly for my 32" TV
5,Easy to install
5,Bought this to put a flat screen on my boat.  It worked perfect and what I like about this one is the tightness of the movements.  It‚Äôs simple and easy to move but tight enough that it won‚Äôt move on its own out on the water.  Great value
5,I purchased this wall-mount for a 27" Vizio and needed one that didn't stick out too far or show on the sides. It was easy to install on a stud and swivels as needed for my two viewing locations. Quite satisfactory for my smaller tv.
4,Good product works as advertised was easy to install I just wish there were more than 2 bolts holding the tv to the arm of the mount it doesn‚Äôt seem very secure
5,Product met expectations
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†This tv wall mount is very sturdy. Not hard at all to put up. I will say that you will need help(an extra person) when it‚Äôs time to put tv on mount
1,this arm is no longer than the one I have for my 20" kitchen tv. for that size it works great. for the bigger end it lists 32" and it is just not really functional at that size. the arm doesn't stick out from the wall far enough for the tv to actually articulate to the side fully. it is usable it is not what I expected at all. we ended up just buying a tv stand for the floor.
5,I loved that it arrived right away and it was easy to install. I especially loved that it is a desk space saver. Whatever size TV I purchase in the near future I will purchase a Perlegear full motion wall mount....that's for sure!
5,Great
5,Used this to install a TV in my Utility trailer. Looks and works great.
4,I didn't like installing this mount because the top hole needed to be up higher so I could use my ratchet with socket to screw in the lag screw.
5,When I saw how small this was out of the box I didn't think there was any way it was holding this 42.5 inch monitor. It's at the maximum rating for this mount so I decided to give it a go. It works! Can't be beaten for the price!
5,It solid and easy install Also I like the fact that you can take it down from the wall in 2 seconds Great for my camper
4,Mounting my daughter tv work great
5,Just what I needed to hang an older sony flat screen.  Easy instructions to follow and install. And it tilts more than others.
5,Quick shipment quick assembly and perfect fit for my 32" TV in a rather tight corner.
4,Quick and easy lightweight and uncomplicated. Not for larger heavier units but it‚Äôs quick and easy for the 32‚Äù unit I have.
5,Installation went smoothly and I was happy to find a bracket for a smaller older TV.
5,Fairly easy to install. May need a helping hand to mount tv on the arm once it is attached to the wall
5,I like that is was adjustable for different holes in different t.v.s
5,This product is very easy to install and is very well constructed.  Very much worth it this is the second one that we have bought because we love the first one so much we now have 2 installed in our home.
1,After opening and seeing how many pieces i hit ‚Äúreturn‚Äù and went down to harbor freight for their two piece 12.99 wall mount kit. first pic this kit. 2nd pic 12.99 harbor freight kit
5,The basic configuration fit the new TV exactly without additional arms etc.
5,It was easy to install. Sturdy and does what it's supposed to do. I saw other reviews were people had problems with theirs. If you know what you're doing and know the weight of your tv. It shouldn't be a problem.  I recommend this tv mount.
5,I have bought 3 of these. Very easy to install and well made. I have had several other brands and these are by far the best I have purchased.
5,Its holding up my 42" LG TV which weighs in at around 35lbs. I did lag bolt it to a stud so no worries there. Does what its supposed to for a very low price. A good unit!
5,liked first one so much bought another
3,So the M6 12mm I needed were smooth on the top (see the screw on the right) so it can't be tightened like the one on the left that I had to buy separately. I guess if you are machining millions of screws it happens.Also not good the tilt up and down adjustment does not use locking nuts so you have to use a screw driver if you want to adjust the view-angle (up and down).
5,great product.the bolts it came with for installation to a wood stud were not standard size. I believe they were metric
5,Are use this product to install a 32 and TV monitor for my cameras very well-made perfectly happy
4,The hardware it comes with is awful. Had to purchase better hardware to keep it secure.
4,Good value for the money and doesn't feel cheap
5,√∫til! de instalar y su robustez!
5,I used it to mount an 18‚Äù outdoor fan so that I could easily move the fan. Works great!
5,Just a little short
5,Solid mount for my 32" LED TV.  Very sturdy and easy to maneuver.  Would buy again.
5,Finding a mounting kit that works for a 100 x 200 VESA television is somewhat difficult.  Most tv's come in a 100 x 100 configuration.  This worked perfectly for my 24" Insignia television.
5,Appears to be well made by hasn't been installed yet.  Movement appears to be some what limited.
5,Was easy to install works well.
5,Nice overall quality everything you need for multiple installation settings and super easy ( as in 10 min) install
4,Works as advertised easy to install.
5,Very sturdy and easy to install.
5,Worked exactly as advertised. Used for a 32" tv.  Very easy to install.
5,It was easy to Instal and easy to assemble.
3,Mount is ok for the money.  Not as good as my mounting dreams mount.  Pearl gear mount feels very wobbly when moving the tv.  Tv mount is very secure.  No movement.  Every time I move the tv I have to level it so it is straight.  Movement is not smooth.
5,Great for a small flat screen TV in my laundry room - with treadmill. Easy to install and holds the TV very well. Great purchase.
5,Not as sturdy as another model I bought for less money.  But if your not gonna move it around it should be fine
5,Perfecto.Alta Calidad y facil de instalar.
5,great quality but takes some time to put together.
5,I bought it for a 40" flat screen. It worked perfect. Easy to install and fully adjustable. Great product for the money. Would defiantly buy it again.

4,Good value.
4,It works out for our new tv
5,Does not include screws for the smaller square which I needed for both monitors.
5,At first I thought the product was too small for my 32 inch tv but it is actually really sturdy! It was easy to follow the instructions!! ((:

5,Super easy
5,F√°cil y practico
5,Great product
2,The screw/ holes to attach it to the wall are too close to the arm screws. My socket wrench got stuck and I could not finish using the socket wrench. I almost stripped a screw trying to force my socket wrench out. I had to use a regular wrench to finish the last 1/4 of the screw.I've put up several tv mounts. Get a different one.
5,My son loves it
5,Great value
5,Amazing.  Practic and nice to install
5,As expected Will rebuy
5,Very cell made ! Sturdy.
5,good product
5,Definitely worth price
5,N/A
3,read above
1,Bad material‚Ä¶will crack after 2 months and all the screws come with it gone bad
2,It was very hard to install
1,Awful instruction measurements. Told me to use a 4mm bit which should be equivalent to 3/16inch and it was way too small for the anchor to fit. So i went up to a size 1/4inch just by looking at the diameter of the anchors  and one of the anchors broke. Now i have to look for parts just to salvage this purchase.
1,doesnt work with viotek monitors  hate both companies
1,The hardware was garbage made a large hole in our wall that was just freshly painted. Now we have to purchase better hardware the anchors and repair the wall. The mount itself isn‚Äôt very well made neither.
1,This came in a very small box with so many parts to assemble ! Now I realize why it was so inexpensive!
2,This mistake was my fault. I ordered the wrong size.
1,The included screws for mounting claim they need a 3/8" socket wrench. I used three different wrenches and the screws are too large for 3/8" socket and too small for 7/16".Unfortunately I had this sitting around for too long or else I'd have returned it.
1,Had to return it
1,It was too small my TV is barely hanging on
2,Do not recommend for purchase tool pieces are cheap & will not keep the mount at a sturdy hold
2,Little complicated but sturdy
1,Missing parts please send another mount or refund please
5,Works great. Easy to put in. Holds the TV nicely.
1,It is not big enough for my 42 in flat screen tv!
1,come on guys a use product that was repackaged missing parts.
1,To small for my tv and it was supposed to fit my 50 inch tv
1,Mount works. Be prepared to purchase your own wall anchors. They do NOT include.
1,Does NOT fit my 42 in tv
3,For what it is it works but I would highly suggest you get higher grade Hardware
5,Easy to understand the directions seems pretty beefy. Good value for the money
5,Installing all the nuts & bolts
5,It is what I needed
1,I put my 42' tv on the wall and the mount had a sag in it
1,Not as described !Size not even close to fit tv sizes as described
4,Very happy with almost everything about this. It does all it should and my 27" monitor is now in a perfect position. The last rivet holding the last joint behind the monitor mounting came in very tight. (I used a couple types of oil to get safe movement from it and was successful.) All is working and this customer is happy.
5,This mount was really affordable and exactly what I was looking for. The installation process was easy I had it installed in under 15 minutes. I love the tilt and swivel features which makes viewing from different angles awesome.
4,Comes with all the hardware you'll need.  This was a good inexpensive mount that should only take about 20 minutes to install with the right tools.  The screws that were included we're too long so just use spacers. I didn't like the plastic anchors since I installed this on a concrete wall. This was solved by using Tapcom screws so anchors were not needed.
5,Muy bueno que compre 2 mas
5,Have to travel A bit to See how sturdy it realy is . Easy to install easy to work.
5,F√°cil de instalar. Exelent thanks
5,Muy bueno
5,This product was easier to install then I thought it would and an added bonus was that the range of motion was greater than I imagined!! I just wanted to be able to position my tv into a corner so it most definitely exceeded my expectations!
4,Would have given it higher ratings if all parts listed had been included.
5,Easy to install works great for my room exactly what I wanted! Great product.
5,muy buen producto ya he montado mi tv
5,Loved it
5,Excellent product
5,I bought this mount since it had good reviews and to honest because the base looked a lot better aesthetically compared to some of the clunkier ones out there.  I always read the bad reviews first and I'm sure some people had some missing or bad hardware because stuff happens but most of them were unwarranted.  I was pleasantly surprised I was fully expecting to have to buy hardware to connect it to my TV but the correct size bolts for everything and more came with it.  It was easy to mount by myself with a level and hand tools.  I installed it at my parent's house with the black Friday TV I bought them and forgot my power tools but still had no problem hanging it and the TV.  It is more than strong enough to hold the 32 inch TV and flexes easily but not so easily that it drifts.  My parents are happy with all the possible viewing angles and move it often in their kitchen.  It is one of my better cheap buys on here!
5,Smooth movement easy to install and solid construction.
5,Worked well and fit TV with no issue
5,Exelente
1,Had to return it because it seemed too complicated. Easy return. I just bought the wall unit that you just hammer in the wall with the nails! So much more simpler
5,Perfect just what I ordered.
5,Super easy install pretty sturdy design
5,If purchase this mount because of positive experience with the same mount previously. Gr8 price.
5,Easy install clear instructions versatile
5,Easy to install offered fitment for every conceivable option. Buying three more for the rest of the house.
5,solid bracketthis is my 3rd one
5,Did exactly what I needed and easy to assemble and install.
5,Good product
4,I bought this to fixed tv so far so good. It‚Äôs easy to install however you have to make sure your wall back is hollow or not. Otherwise it cannot work.
5,Works great and didn‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg.
5,Built strong and easy to install everything you need included
5,Very easy to install well built sturdy construction. I highly recommend this wall mount. I mounted my 28‚Äù monitor and got rid of the bulky stand and now have more room on my desk.
5,This compact wall Mount is strong and sturdy. It‚Äôs holding up my 48‚Äù Sony .
4,It's a ok nount
5,Used for a 24‚Äù tv in the bathroom so I can watch tv in the jacuzzi. Easy to mount and very well built
5,Worked perfectly for my 32 inch tv I installed in my kids room. Came with a lot of different screws and bolts of different sizes for installing the tv. The arm was really stiff hard to move the tv from side to side. Probably could loosen the arm screws I didn‚Äôt really bother me so I left it alone.
5,To mount my tv
5,Great for all sizes
5,Arrives in a small box but when assembled moves in almost every direction. I had this on the wall and ready to use in about ten minutes.
5,An excellent product.
5,It was so easy to install it holds up my 32-in TV like it wasn't even there it's a great bracket
5,The wall mount is sturdy and easy to install.  Nice movement.  The only problem is the lag screws needed to mount to wall. The screws strip and I was unable to use my electric drill. I had to use a adjustable wrench to put them in.
5,I like that my TV is now on the wall.
5,I like it and have no issues with it
5,Sturdy shipped fast
5,It was easy to assemble and had a variety of screws for various types of flatscreens.  Material is very strong.
5,Very strong and very heavy (almost as  heavy as the TV).  Easy and straight forward installation.  Whereas the motion in and out and left and right are very good the screen tilt is limited but okay as long as you plan for it before place the TV up.  There could be a problem when the instructions warn that the mount is only to be used for concrete walls or into a wood stud.  Not drywall or any other type of wall.  Luckily I found a well placed stud but the company really should offer some solution for other types of walls.  Also know that this is a two man job.  Once the brackets are on the wall and TV one person must hold up the TV and another person has to reach behind it and guide the hooking attachment into place.
5,Easy to install fit perfectly very sturdy and easy to adjust. Highly recommend this product. I have an AOC 27" curved gaming monitor which fit the VESA bolts perfectly I was concerned with the curved aspect but had zero issues. Again great product.
5,Unit had a little play but it was easy to install. The price was great and free shipping.
1,This is trash
5,Honestly it was smaller than I expected which was perfect for my 32‚Äù tv. What I will say is that you probably don‚Äôt want to go to much bigger than maybe a 40‚Äù I like it and find it sturdy but I will say that the arm swings a little too freely. Perhaps tightening those screw will help if that‚Äôs an option. Overall for the price and my tv it‚Äôs perfect. Seriously tho. Don‚Äôt go too much bigger. Not that it won‚Äôt hold it‚Äôs just not as tight as the one I have on my 50‚Äù. Hope this helps.
5,Have any old 30" coby TV we wanted to put on our back porch. The hanger kit looked great and installed flawless. My TV is 100x200 mount and the mount worked perfect once you figure out which way then tabs needed to go. Did not use the supplied stud screws. They looked great but used 3" concrete tapcons since my wall is cinder block. We in florida lol. The adjustability and tilt feature was great. Now complaints what so ever. Zip tied all my wires to the mount behind TV to clean up the look.
5,Easy fit to most TVs and works great
5,I like how easy it is to install! I don‚Äôt like the labeling on the hardware was kind of confusing.
5,I loved this one because it pulls out from the wall and rotates. I do however wish a small leveler came with it but I used the one I had from my other mount. It's really a really good buy.
5,Me agrado porque no es muy grande es c√≥modo y en cualquier sitio de la pared puedes ponerü•∞estoy bien super content√≠sima ü•∞
