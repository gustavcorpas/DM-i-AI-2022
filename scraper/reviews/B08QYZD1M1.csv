5,It seems to scratch easy from regular use.
5,Muy bien
5,Most in-store prices are insane. I found this one on Amazon and it works just fine. Iâ€™m glad it came with multiple replacementsâ€”as I find my self having to replace screen protectors multiple times a year because of the work I do. No complaints. Easy to install. What more can you ask for? ðŸ˜Ž
5,Excelente
4,Was kinda hard to put on but I finally got it. And I love them.
5,Nice
5,This is my second purchase . These are great. Dropped my phone on its face twice. Saved my screen. I still have not got it on perfect. But I donâ€™t take the time and it doesnâ€™t bother me.
4,As the title states I put 4 stars only because both of my screen protectors have lifted terribly a few days after I put each of them on. The only problem is I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s user error or just fault glass my camera protector has stayed on great but both of my screen ones havenâ€™t. Other than that if it is user error theyâ€™re great!
3,Screen protector - great have not had a problem. What I do have a problem with is the camera lens cover. Created a glare in my pictures so I attempted to take it off. It would not come off even with a hot hairdryer to loosen the adhesive. Once it did finally start to come off it came off in (Iâ€™m not kidding) 100â€™s of shards of glass. After two attempts that literally took a credit card scrapping back and forward to help remove the lens protector not only is my credit card now damaged on the edges the glass on my actual phone around the lens is permanently scratched due to Im assuming a 1/500 shards of glass scrapping back and forward as I attempted to remove the thing. Great idea for a lens protector terrible execution.
5,Me gustÃ³ todo el paquete.
