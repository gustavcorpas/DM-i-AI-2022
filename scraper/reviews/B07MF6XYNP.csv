4,Had a case just like this worked great for 3 years then one day someone stepped on it while the stand was out and broke it so I decided to get a similar one and got this one...Pros - The face cover is great the screen was a little cracked and the face protective cover helped.The rubber siding is good for impactThe plug cover is good goes into the slot keeping it safeThe handle is a nice touch even though I took it off...Cons -The plastic for the stand is not very strong it broke only a week after I got it the stand and the hand guard was what I bought it for I found it to be a little difficult to keep putting the stand down I pressed the area it said and nothing then pressed and pushed down the stand broke off completely meaning now it doesn't have a prop for me to see at my desk and I am back to using a pencil holder to hold it up... I did get an impact as it fell of the arm of the couch an it fell on the corner which is heavily padded but somehow got another crack in 3 places...  So it didn't protect it as much as I thought it would I am sending the pad to the shop to get fixed and I will trash this one and get a book kind they seem to be more protective...Overall - For the price its not too bad and most of these don't come with a faceguard and carrying lanyard... So as I didn't have the best experience I would still say its a good product just didn't work out well for me... It might for you..UPDATE - They did contact me about the issue and sent me another one that has a magnetic stand and a book style rather. than the open face with screen.. Its good enough to work for me the only thing is I would have loved to have the screen protector too as the screen cracked when it fell and that helped with my fingers but I will get it fixed thanks for taking care of this for me.
5,I am a Denver Bronco fan so I really like the orange color. Also I like the rubber stiffness it's much better than the plastic. Great product..Bob
5,Bought this for my daughter to take her IPad to school.  She loves it and the protection for dropping the device is good.  This is the second one she has used and has saved me many in repairs.
5,Very easy to hold and sturdy.  Very strong cover the best.  Thank you so much
4,Trouble with stand staying latched. Fell over a couple of times. Just make sure it is latched. Otherwise extremely durable with many options. Well worth the price. Definitely a first choice if I need another case.
5,Love the fit and look of the case. It’s great having the option of adding a protection screen or use the case with the protection screen included. Great price!!! I’ll check back in a couple of months and add a comment of how it held up. I’ve had it a couple of weeks and so far it’s great!!!
4,Alright went thru 2 of them  the little piece holding the kick stand will break for sure after two or three months depending on usage. Very poorly designed and I don't think there is a way around it everything else is good.
5,The main reason for purchasing was to have the adjustable hand hold leaving the other hand free and I love it. It also comes with 2 front pieces one with screen protector and one without. You decide which one you need. I went with the screen protector and it works great no issues. Glad I got it to protect my iPad which I’m on most of the day and night.
4,This is our second one in two years. These are decent products for the price. Screens become loose and dirty quickly. Overall good product though.
5,It is great that you include the extra case cover the tools and it’s easy to install
5,Great protection for iPad that is frequently used by kids. Has hand-strap shoulder-strap swivel-stand screen protection just as advertised. We used to have to remove old case for charging but no problems with this case.
5,Have 6 on all in that house
4,Nice case and will help protect the tablet well.
4,Ordered this for an older ipad used for work. I always worry about ordering accessories for older products especially online but it fit great
5,This is great for kids and the car so many different ways to hold and even attach it to places in the car and at home. Fun bright colors and durable.
5,This case is perfect for my 9th Generation iPad. The old case I had was tearing in half so I wanted something that would protect it from all angles because let's face it Apple products break very easily. It's already slid off the table and hit the floor good thing is it just bounced but didn't crack. So I'm very happy with this. And the color is a more vibrant purple than I thought it would be. Overall I give this 2 thumbs up.
5,needed a case for my kids' ipad air 2. this was by far the best choice ever! i love the straps it comes with (especially the handle on the back!) the hybrid case (both hard case and silicone!) together they make the most perfect compination for kids i love the plastic shield attached to the hard case part it makes my life easier cleaning them my kids love the stand part in the back and they absolutely cannot live without it! all in all it was the best decision ever!
5,I've had my iPad (5th) generation for a while now ... and hardly EVER picked it up (for years).  It was just too hard to hold and would slip out of your hands easily.Until now! This case is so great I feel like I have a whole new tablet that I can use and create with!It even makes the dumb iPad feel more 'dependable' somehow like a it's a real tool and not just a silly toy.I love it ... the case is a great value for the price and is extremely strong ... it's great.Good luck with yours too!😀
5,Sturdiness but a little heavy to hold
5,Works as described
4,There needs to be a way to clip the wrist strap thing that you can use to carry it like a handle on to the back of it or to the shoulder strap when your not using it. Also the back button you push to put the stand down needs to be easier to push. At least on mine it's difficult to push. I often have to use a pencil or something similar to push out with our have my husband so it. I know I have small hands I know I'm not super strong. I'm also not a sissy lala either but I can't push out in with just my fingers and even when I do get it pushed in once in a while it still takes some wiggling to get it to go down. Not every time just now and then 🤷 The only other thing is the screen saver on one side and only in one spot I have a hard time getting it to touch or swipe. But it may also be my ipad I just got this one because I killed my last one which is why I bought this case 😜 I've learned just because it's brand new out of the box doest mean it can't have issues. I'm sure the ones they warranty them with are refurbished. And that's fine because they always look amazing and usually work great! So that's why I'm not sure if it's my Ipad or the screensaver. Other then those tiny things I love this case! It's very sturdy yet it's really light I have neck and shoulder issues ask I can feel even the slightest change in weight. And if it's even just a few pounds it can cause more issues. This i can carry and it don't give me any issues. Just enough weight to know I have something there like a small day purse big enough for a few cards a phone and maybe a small lipstick. For the men folk it would be like carrying air 😜
5,I bought 2 of them and the quality is great! They’re for my sons so durability was a must for me so it was definitely a successful buy!
4,protection is good but this is super bulky good for kids to protect from dropping
5,Easy to install. I like the handle in the back. The carrying strap frees up your hands when traveling. I highly recommend this sturdy product.
5,Very good case we use several of these in our warehouse for stocking items. It does a good job of protecting our iPads from incidental damage.
5,This case fits my ipad 5th Gen 9.7 in screen perfectly.  It appears to be well made and sturdy.
5,This fit my iPad perfectly and it's very durable to protect my ipad
5,The design with the rubber all around makes it very easy to holdvery nice product
5,We love our new case’s they are very durable and easy to use!!
5,Safe case!
5,So far my son loves the case! He likes the hand strap a lot & the kickstand swivels for both rotations. He also used the longer strap in car to hang it on headrest.  If it matters the iPad will not lay flat bc of the hand strap.
5,Yup. The iPad is already very cool as one knows. And slick. Definitely too slick for younger users. This iPad case is exactly what I needed for a nine-year-old boy who is generally a bit rougher with electronics than the electronics can bear. The case is a bit tricky to put on though it comes with handy tools to assist with this process. Once it's snug the case improves the iPad experience considerably. How is that possible you ask? Thoughtfully. In every detail. First the sides are thick (but not cumbersome) and help the user to keep a steady grip. The back has a prop stand which is great but lots of covers have a prop stand. This cover also has a hand "belt" so you can loop your hand into the back carry it easily play games or just generally feel cool. As one does. The coolest thing about this feature is that it rotates so you can use it simply and easily based on the orientation you choose for your screen. There is no "delay" with touchscreen capabilities which was a concern of mine. The thin screen allows for unhindered interaction with apps. The volume buttons (and all side buttons) are accessible by pressing on the rubber sides of the case. The only issue--and it's a small one--is the charger port isn't super accessible; you have to push back a flap of rubber to gain access. This obviously has many more plus sides like it keeps the port clean of dirt dust and kid grime--especially when shoved into a bag. After I saw how great this cover was I ordered one for myself. Fun fact the "belt" at the back makes it easy for my kid and I to air high-five with our fancy gadgets. I don't use the iPad a lot but when I do this cover makes me feel great about packing it up for travel. Also this case allows you to grip the iPad in many different ways all ergonomic--this is a great treat for my fingers that are perpetually cranky from typing. When my husband saw all the great features--and our worry-free air high-five--he bought one for himself. He uses it more for work and needs to be able to slip it easily into a messenger bag and he can do so with confidence since all aspects of the iPad are protected with this cover. So it's quickly become a family favorite and the colors are fun. It's an easy five stars from all three of us who use the iPad for very different applications and across wholly varied settings. Highly recommend.
5,Was delivered the day after I ordered it. I carry around my iPad and love the fully adjustable handle (adjustable size and 180 swivel). The rubber sides and corners make it feel so durable. I went big ticket item shopping today and used the shoulder strap to take my iPad with me to compare prices. Loved it! The stand works great once I figured out that you have to push it down until it clicks into place. The hardest part about putting it on my iPad was taking off the blue film. Took a minute or two to peel it away from an edge. Bottom line… 100% love this iPad case!
5,I work as a outside plant tech for a public utility company.  I recently had a work iPad replaced and was referred by a co-worker who recommended this product.  I wanted a case that had a wrist handle for the comfort while in use and the prevention of slipping.  The handle can rotate which is an added benefit while viewing.  I also wanted the strap to carry around my shoulder for ease while traveling.  The product was easy to install and fit perfect.  It came with a short strap and a long strap for carrying.  It also came with 2 screen frames-One with a plastic protective plastic screen and 1 without.  I’ve used the product now for almost 2 weeks and durability and sturdiness is pretty solid.  I don’t write much reviews but I’m quite impressed with this product and would honestly recommend this product to others.
4,
5,The kickstand
5,Casing and built in protector very sturdy.The handy and versatile built in stand hand holder and removable shoulder strap makes this case a great deal for the price.Love it.
5,This case is great! Super durable and protects my son’s iPad. He’s already dropped it several times and everything is perfect! Great price. Highly recommend!
5,We were in need of a case that was highly durable for our son because he takes his tablet everywhere him but also because he leaves it on the edge of his bed or on the edge of a countertop and we needed to protect his iPad. Upon receiving and putting together the Seymac stock drop proof case it was obvious this was exactly what we needed for him We attend meetings two times a week and he uses his tablet to take lots of notes on it. He really enjoys the 360 rotating hand strap design because of it’s ease of use.
5,Good product for a good price! Easy to follow instructions and fits perfectly and seamlessly with my refurbished iPad.
5,Quick shipping. It has gotten very hard to find cases for newer devices that have a built-in screen protector. Most want you to use that glass that "glues" onto the screen of the device. I don't like that. So glad I found this one with Built-In. The strap in back to hold it plus the rotating kickstand are both big pluses for this particular model.
5,Although I have only used it for a short time I can honestly say it is great! I ordered this case for my Preschooler’s iPad after he cracked the screen and had to have it repaired. I can only describe the amount of protection that this product offers as equivalent to what my otter box does for my iPhone. It has multiple layers of protection not to mention the screen protector that is included. It also had a face without a screen protector if your prefer it. It also has a hand strap on the back and 2 straps to carry by hand or shoulder. Highly recommend it for its quality and price!
5,Nice sturdy case! Got one for all of my kids school iPads. Easy to instal the iPad.
5,I purchased this for my dad who suffers from Parkinson's. It makes him comfortable and gives him the confidence he needs that when he drops it he won't break it.
4,Works well.  Keeps my iPad safe.  The stand holds up well without tipping. Only downside is my after marker cord will not fit so I have to use the apple cord. I’m sure a different cord would work fine.  Pics of red cord is the style that doesn’t work
3,The stand broke in one month and day for me from normal use.  There was no accidents it just broke.  I had a little cheap cardboard one that lasted for much longer time than this.  A chain is as strong as it’s weakest link and this definitely has a weak stand.  I bought it because It was an Amazon Choice product now I know you must read the reviews also.
4,The case itself is nice.  The screen protector on the other hand is not.  It smears terribly and leaves finger prints making it easy for someone to at least determine the numbers used for your password. I don't like that.
3,The case itself is ok but the kickstand constantly collapses on itself so my iPad is always tipping over after I place it where I want.
3,While the product appears sturdy enough to protect your iPad if you should drop it if you prefer resting your iPad on a surface that’s where the product fails. The kickstand and the soft wrapped handle interfere with each other. The kickstand slides shut when you try to prop the case on a LEVEL surface. I have carpel tunnel issues and cannot hold the case for long periods of time without my fingers going numb which then causes awful shooting pains in my neck. I need a decent integrated prop to securely set the encased iPad icon a table or other surface. Also the strap if you attach it just gets in the way and catches on things like door knobs and drawer handles. I’ve already found a different protective case that does what I need it to do - and for a better price.
5,The screen cover is great--you don't even realize it's on.  It doesn't affect touch sensitivity in the least!  We struggled to assemble the case but after watching the video realized that the two hard shell pieces don't connect directly with each other (the rubber layer goes in between them).  The case fits the iPad so well and is very heavy-duty!  I am very impressed and feel confident letting my kids use and walk around with the iPad now.
5,Primarily used to keep my 5 year old twin grandsons occupied with kids YouTube videos for a short period of time. The device has been dropped and yanked around between the twins and case seems able to withstand the abuse.
5,Good quality and value
5,I got this because our last 2 iPads got cracked screens when they were dropped.  I feel much more secure about this ipad.  The rubber bumpers are substantial and I think that IF I dropped it it would bounce.  The front edge of the case comes out from the screen at least 1/8th of an inch so even if I dropped it face down I think the screen would be protected.  I’ll probably upgrade the plastic screen protector with tempered glass though.
4,I bought this case to replace my Otterbox case. It is durable easy to install and I like the handle on the back. The only issue I have is the weight it adds to the Ipad. It does make it heavy.
5,Pictures don't do it justice it's an amazing iPad case.
5,We tried other cases and they always broke. We use this case on all our ipads now and they have proven child proof from drops and spills. Great product!
4,Overall the case seems durable and looks like it's going to protect the iPad.  The stand however seems a little flimsy.
5,We got this for the first time a little over 2 years ago. Our little guy used it to watch his shows and he has frequently tossed it (easily over 100 times) onto our kitchen floor. He’s also spit up on it many times. It has helped our iPad stand the test of time!The only downside is the kickstand in the back. Like many plastic designs the more you use it the less it works.For us our son (at the time 3) trying to put it down by banging it on the table destroys its ability to actually work (again taking about the kickstand in the back).Otherwise this has held up great and we just bought it again to replace the one that was simply worn out by use.
4,The silicone edging that holds everything together is a bit annoying. It fit really tightly when I got it but after I put my iPad in the case the it doesn't really fit as well. It slips off a lot and I'm constantly adjusting it so that it fits.But don't get me wrong I love this case. The hand strap is perfect for almost every thing that I do on my tablet. I love the little stand for playing the vertical games or reading at lunchtime so that I can ignore my coworkers.Honestly the only gripe that I have is the silicone casing. Like I said it slips off a lot. It also picks up every single cat hair that my cat sheds. That's the only reason it's not a 5 star product.
3,Nice case but this is the second one I bought where the stand broke.  I didn’t bother returning.
5,This is my 3rd case. The first first one from 2 years ago still going on strong even though the stand only lasted a year (with a LOT of banging it around). Just bought 2 more cases for my very destructive grandsons. The best part is the extra screen cover. Love it!! I highly recommend
4,It fit the iPad well. Seems durable enough to stand up to the rigors of my garage hands.
5,My kid loves her case very versatile.
5,Great product. Easy to hold durable and functional.
5,It’s exactly what I needed & it’s very convenient! Being able to rotate the handle & kickstand on the back makes it even better. The screen protector does not make it harder to touch either!
5,Fits perfectly and securely protects the iPad. Easy to find.
4,all around good product
4,Great case for the money even though it isn’t waterproof it surely protects against light splashes and such..:
3,I used this product for my iPad while out writing reviews and editing novels when I was away from home. This allowed me to view the screen while still using my keyboard connection. It was nice for a while. However after several uses the stand (which was the whole reason I bought it) broke. The entire bracket slides but the frame no longer stays in place when a tiny piece cracks or breaks.I love the product but I wish it would hold up better.
5,Exactly what I wanted and what I received.
4,(Update) Our tablet broke while using this case to protect it. It had the front and back cover on it. The screen shattered. It only fell about 2 feet. I wish I would have bought a better case!We bought this a few months ago and it has worked as it supposed to. Thankfully it came with two plastic pieces that go on the front of the screen. One had a screen protector and the other did not. The piece that went around the screen that didn’t come with the protector piece in it for the screen. That one broke immediately. Not sure if it was just a defective piece and had a weak point in it or if that’s how the product is made. The other piece and the case are serving its purpose.
5,Bought this for my son iPad .he hadA really old simple case .when I got this and put it on he was impressed!now he can hold it with the holding strap on the back he can now carry the pen also good shoulder strap too! it’s great for kid that love to sketch on the iPad I recommend this  has a great Rugged look love the fact that it come with two face plates one with screen scratch protector and one with out since my son is in to drawing and sketch I when with the open screen one it’s better to use the pen  thank you SEYMAC STOCK ! For you new release item my son was happy with your product!
5,Works great for all my kids.
5,This is priced great for the quality. I did not use the screen protector that was included but the case itself has worked great for us.
5,Needed a new case for my Ipad 6th generation tablet. Case fits perfectly and has a strong protective feel. Included straps make tablet easy to hold and carry. Includes screen protector frame AND empty frame to use your own protector. High quality product quick shipment easy to put together and convenient and protective use of tablet. Very happy with product and company.
4,The case was easy to put together looks nice and protects well. I liked that it came with two face plates so I could choose whether I wanted the screen protector or not. The hand strap makes it a little bulky and the pull out stand sometimes doesn’t fully click into place but overall it is a good product for the price and does the job just fine.
4,The product is sturdy but the iPad options of dragging down the brightness from the upper corner is limited. Sometimes it just won’t pull down no matter how many times you try.
4,Just what I was looking for
5,A hard case and a screen protector. What more can you ask for.
4,This is a great iPad case with many positives especially if you need it to handle a couple of younger kids who can be rough on devices.1 - the various handles and straps make this a great iPad case for not so careful kids.2 - The color options enable some personalization for each kid and make it easy to spot when not put away properly3 - Very good shock absorption and screen protection.4 - The plastic stand did not stand the test of a 6 year old using this to watch movies... it broke pretty quickly2 - The screen cover has a hole for the home button which enabled a messy kid to get some pretty disgusting crumbs and dirt into the screen. Since this is a pretty solid case it's a pain to get the whole thing off and clean this out. Would recommend a cover with a softer flexible plastic over the home button that kept it functional but also the rest of the screen protected.All in all a good case and would recommend.
5,I would highly recommend this product. The build is really good and it's alot more solid than I expected. Came on time and the packaging was sufficient as well.
5,Purchase this for an iPad we use at work it’s a sturdy case and seems like it will hold up well
5,This case works great for my daughter I would recommend!
4,Great case for the money.
4,This case is as described. It is durable colorful and fits my 6th generation iPad perfectly. It is  a bit thick. I primarily read and do quiet merge-type games and the case gets heavy and a bit cumbersome after a few minutes. The hand strap on the back impedes the fold-out stand but that is overcome by keeping the hand-strap a little loosened instead of flat to the case when not  in use. Because of this strap it does not lay flat on the table or on my PadPillow. I have a glass screen protector and so I removed the plastic screen protector. These things are not bothersome enough for me to not like or use the case. It can be hard to find accessories for an older iPad and this case fits and serves me well. The carrying handle is heplful. I have not used the optional extended shoulder strap. Would buy again.
2,This case is just ok.  We've only had it for about a week so I can't really say how durable it is.  The best thing about it is that its cute and my daughter likes the color.The main reason I bought a new one was for the stand the stand on our old case was broken so we bought this one.  The stand on this one is too flimsy to hold up the weight of an ipad so its basically a waste for us.Smaller details: 1) The charging port is covered by a rubber piece that opens from the backside which is backwards compared to most other cases I think its only a matter of time until that rubber piece is accidentally torn off from trying to open it from the front repeatedly.  2) The adjustable velcro handle on the back is bulky and so the ipad never sits flat when you lay it down face up.  Not a huge deal but it could be an issue if you wanted to use the ipad on a flat surface for anything.The only thing about it that I'd recommend it for is the carrying strap which could come in handy for a kid who takes it everywhere (we don't) or for hanging it to watch in the car (we haven't tried this yet though).
4,Once we finally got it on it works great. Limited instruction on how to get it to fit on. We were going to return it but finally got it on. After it was on it was great just hope we don't have to take it off for a long time.
5,Great product just as described fast shipment would buy again
5,Super sturdy easy to hold my daughter loves it!
5,Bought as a replacement case for my 10 year old who is not kind on his iPad. This case has worked well so far. He has dropped it several times and his iPad has been protected. It fits well and was easy to put on but won't easily come off. He loves the choice of straps for easy carry. He uses the stand and it has maintained and not broken.
5,If you dont want to spend $50 for an otterbox ect. this case fits the bill.  Has actual rubber ends not the semi soft plastic bumbers. Also like how kickstand rotates.
5,This product is awesome! My son is so hard on his iPad. This case we are able to have a tempered glass screen protector under the build in screen protector.
5,This tablet cover has been good.  It is sturdy it was easy to install and the bright yellow makes it easy to find at night in the dark.  Pleased with this.
5,My 5 year old loves it. We ordered the the blue case. We all love the strap. It’s perfect for when she needs to hold more then one item at a time. Even great great when getting of the car I do t worry about it falling. The case is durable. She drops her tablet alll the time and it all stays intact
5,Bought for my grandsons ipad because previous case allowed his screen to crack so far this seems very sturdy even though he has already dropped it a few times.
3,To big piece ripped of trying to get it on my ipad. No worries.
5,Product came neatly packaged and provides great protection. Comfortable to hold and shoulder strap adds convenience and mobility for inventory applications.
5,I love the design of the case and The slip in the back for you hand and how it rotates. And of course with kids they dropped it and it held up real great against a fall. One small problem the volume buttons don’t line up but it don’t bother me due to the rest of the case features that I love.
5,Great product I use it for my work IPad to set it up on the stand the neck strap was a great quality and the back handle feels super comfortable and secure. All in alla good product for a good price.
5,All around great case for kids iPads! There’s a stand feature and 2 different handles for easy carrying. The case is durable and easy to put on/take off. My daughter has been using it for 6 months and it has held up great. Definitely recommend!
5,Love the ability to use the stand for desktop viewing. The neck strap is extra security in carrying. One never plans to drop an expensive device but I believe this will keep a device from breaking if dropped.
5,I have purchased this iPad case for my daughter multiple times. The adjustable strap allows her to wear the iPad as a purse or wrap around the headrest of the front seat for hands free viewing while in the car. The kickstand spins to allow 360 viewing. The reason for multiple purchases was the little plastic piece on the kick stand broke but my daughter was very rough with it to cause the breakage. Although we prefer the faceplate without the extra protective cover when she was younger the extra protection was useful. Both with and without the faceplate are included with this item.  many color options available.
5,worked out great
4,Good protection for your tablet and shoulder strap is nice. The screen protector is a little stiff and I have a little trouble closing screens but otherwise good product
5,This case feels great in my hands!  It’s very durable and even includes a kickstand for watching hands-free.  In addition it has a Velcro strap for holding with one hand and a long strap for hanging from your neck.  So many features for an already great case for such an amazing price!  If you’re looking for an iPad case this is definitely the one to get!
5,I like the strap on the back that makes it easier to hold for long periods of time. The plastic screen protector is great. I almost didn’t get this due to a couple reviews saying that it didn’t fit right but mine fits perfectly. The stand turns so you can sit it sideways or up and down. I am glad I bought it and if the size of my iPad changes when I update I will try to get this case for that one as well.
5,Absolutely everything about this case I loved! Until the clip for the prop broke within a few weeks of using it. Since then I have been finding ways to prop it up on my own. The other drawback is that if you have an L-shaped iPad adapter it won't plug in all the way and you cannot charge the unit without removing the case.
5,This case came with easy to follow instructions. It’s very sturdy and it fits my old 6th gen. iPad perfectly. The features make it so versatile and convenient for safely using and moving my iPad in and to different locations Before I got this case I had dropped my iPad so many times that the glass is cracked badly. This case which comes with a protective screen covers up most of those cracks so it looks better too. I had worn out the original case and then two years ago I bought a foam lap stand for it but the edges wore out and that’s when it started slipping out and falling. I wish I would have had this case from day one; I never would have messed up my iPad if I’d had it!
3,Upon 1st receiving the case (I've had it a year now) I would have given it a higher rating than now. It is still useful but it's no longer serving every purpose for which I purchased it. Although I never found it to be aesthetically pleasing this case initially addressed every functional purpose that I had in mind. The rubber edges are great shock protection from drops and bumps as long as the impact is not toward the ipad screen. The different sized secure straps are useful for various ways of handling and carrying it but the stand that is supposed to prop it up for viewing on a table top no longer works. A spring used to keep the stand in place is broken so now the stand doesn't support the weight of the ipad and it collapses causing the ipad to fall over. Since the stand no longer works I sometimes use the small sturdy handle strap to hang it from the banana holder on my kitchen table when I want to stream movies or whatever.The charger and headphone covers are easy to use and good for keeping out dust and other objects but the cover over the power switch was problematic for me. I couldn't always get the device to turn on by pressing that cover so I had to use scissors to cut a hole big enough for my finger to fit through to the power button.The semi adjustable sturdy wrist or hand strap on the back is a good feature and has come in handy. Sometimes I'm tempted to remove the case because of a desire to use it while admiring the aesthetic beauty of the device but I found it difficult to put the case on and off so I just leave it on.  I wish I could still have the all original functionality and aesthetics of the device highly visible. Guess you can't have everything.With those things said I give it 3 out of 5 stars.
5,I purchased this case because I often drop my ipad and needed something sturdy and strong to protect it and I have to say this definitely does the trick. This case is very strong and thick and it keeps my ipad very secure and safe. It was slightly difficult for me to figure out how to put it on however but not a huge pain as a lot of things can be. I like the nice touch of the velcro handle on the back and that it came with two different case fronts. It came with one with a screen and one without a screen. Only thing I have to really say that isn't great about this case is that one of the front cases you get with the screen does not fit well onto the tablet. The screen is way too far away from my tablet and every time I try to click something I literally have to press down the screen a good couple centimeters. I don't like using tablet screens like that anyways so it's not a big deal to me but I can imagine that that would be something bothersome for a lot of other people who do want to use a screen. Despite that the case works really well and keeps my ipad nice and secure which is exactly what I wanted when I bought this.
5,My daughter is deaf and needs a communication device. Her being 12 needs a good case for the abuse that her IPad suffers. This case has performed admirably. The adjustable hand hiler fits her great and the carry strap is long enough where she can wear is cross shoulder. The case is quite well made and durable. For half the price of the otterbox case it exceeds the quality of one.
5,This seller was great to work with. We realize we ordered the wrong size and he easily exchanged it for the correct size. The product itself is fabulous.
5,I ordered it the first time and when I was looking for a new case I had to buy it again! This case is amazing and highly recommend it.
5,Seems extremely sturdy and durable. Was super easy to put the screen protector on and the case itself was not bad either. Seems like it will hold up to a good amount of wear and tear.
5,The case was easy to install.  The apps are still accessible with the front cover in place (sometimes you end up having to press hard to open an app).  The option to use the long strap or the shorter one is a definite plus.  Overall this will work for my work ipad.
5,We bought this for our toddler’s iPad. It has been great no issues even if he drops it. Would recommend if you need something for a small child.
5,I got one for each of my young’s boys. One in red and one in purple. They look amazing protect great. My kids are horrible with protecting their tablets but these have the hard tablet cover on the inside and the silicone protective cover on the outside. It does come with the protective screen layer but we took it out and put on tempered glass only because that what the boys like better.Great buy!!
5,I love this case. I use my ipad for work on AV sites and it’s durable to keep my iPad safe from falling off stage or banging against a piece of truss. Easy to hold straps for hand and shoulder. Definitely recommend this
5,Have been using this at the pool gym and travel for everything. Kickstand is perfectly set and rotates 360 degrees from portrait to landscape to portrait to landscape so that you can plug in the charger on any side. Very durable and sturdy. Shock proof durability is excellent. If you have a tablet. Or iPad I recommend this inexpensive well made protective case. Super easy to set up.
5,Once I put the case on correctly there was absolutely nothing wrong with the cas. It fits perfectly. The screen protector is not loose. I’m able to move my finger and type without any problems. It is easy to hold and all the sides are well protected. All the ports are accessible and all of the buttons work.  For the price it is definitely worth it.
5,Great product. I was pleasantly surprised by the durability and ease of use. My iPads are more secure. The hand toggle and strap are a great feature. As a sports coach it’s perfect for sideline and dugout use.
5,Great product my nephew loves it
5,Top quality well made easy to install all around great product
5,A great fit and it's durable. Carry my iPad throughout my work day and I've had it accidentally fall from a shelf from time to time. This case holds up very well and I've been able to count on it to protect from damaging my iPad. I just updated so I needed a replacement case.  If the iPad was the same size I'd still be using my 1st one. I'm sure this 2nd purchase will do as well as the 1st.
5,I love this case..it does everything I need it to. My ipad is well protected and the case works better than any I've had in the past and the price is very affordable compared to high priced cases with less quality and durability.My only complaint? Wish I could buy one for my iphone. lolDefinitely would recommend this case.
5,[TLDR; amazing product works like a charm comfortable durable amazing design great for artists]Details:This is amazing and has changed my tablet usage tenfold. I primarily use my tablet to draw on procreate but often need to rest because I have hand and wrist pain and often drop it because I have no stand. The 360° turner literally gives you any angle as advertised not just up down left right. The hand strap is very sturdy adjustable and doesn't cause pressure pain. The kickstand is very durable and turns with the hand strap and locks in place (has release button when you're done). Very sturdy came with replacement front case pen holder fits off brand pen fine. The protective glass cover doesn't interfere with my stylus pen at all and I had zero issues with bubbling (a first on any electronic for me). I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Company was very kind in an email to mention an installation video and may have delivery delays since it's a new product (but it came on time).
4,Purchased for my grand daughter and it was perfect design and durability.
5,If you're thinking about what is the best case you can put your tablet in this is the right one baby!This is not just a nice case for your iPad or other tablet. This is best case you will always be glad you put your gear in. When you take it out of the box you're gonna say "I'm never gonna use this shoulder strap"! But once you've gotten your gear tucked away inside of this new protective shield and adjust the hand grip on the back you are not gonna want to put this thing down!But let's be honest after you drop your pad and notice that this case is designed to laugh at those drops as it still protects your pad you will go hunting for that shoulder strap that you thought you would never use.WARNING: The strap is not for protecting your pad. It's to help you not loose your pad.ADVICE: This case is your pad's 24/7 on duty protection.
5,This case is sturdier than I expected. It’s durable and I love the colors. Some people said they have trouble with sensitivity with the screen protector but I have no problems with it. I’m pleased with mine!
5,Like the product
5,I can't live without it and now I can use my iPad with confidence and not worry about dropping it.  You have the ability to use it all the time and its so easy to move around now.
5,This is a lot cheaper then an Otter Box.  I think it looks better and has a few extra features also.
5,Well constructed excellent protection for your iPad excellent value
5,I love it! It’s perfect for my 8yr old son to carry around and keep his iPad safe! Highly recommend! It’s our second one. The strap broke so we got a new one. It took two years to break and it got a lot of use.
5,Bought this for my 10 year old after going through 2 Speck cases that broke after normal wear and tear so I am hoping this one lasts a bit longer. The rubber on this is really nice and cushy/soft the color options are cute and it goes together fairly easily with the instructions provided. My daughter is excited about the strap to hang it on the seat in the car too. The kickstand and hand strap on the back (both of these rotate to use the iPad in either portrait or landscape mode) are nice additions that work well too. This also comes with 2 front frames one with a screen protector and one without. We already have a screen protector (Zagg Inivsishield) so we used the front frame without the protector. I can’t speak for the quality of the screen protector as we haven’t used it and don’t plan to. FYI this does add a bit of bulk and weight to the iPad but I don’t see it as an issue since I’m more concerned about protecting the device rather than it being slim and lightweight. A good buy for the price and I’m happy with it so far!
5,My son saved his birthday and Christmas money to purchase an iPad for himself. so I bought him this case. It’s the ame as the ones we use at work. I have seen them thrown against a wall stepped on and spilled on. The iPads they have protected survived the assaults without any damage: no cracked screens and no scratches. They come in a wide variety of colors and the strap makes them so very easy to carry if walking around or traveling. The straps are adjustable so it fits adults or children. We (@work and @ home) especially like the built in stand. It does swivel so you can turn it according to your need. I have used other cases with built in stands and this one will hold up against abuse. The stand also has an adjustable hand strap that makes holding the iPad so much easier especially if you are using while in motion. Will definitely purchase this case for all devices that it is available. Definitely worth the price.
4,Review edited after input from seller regarding set up of cover.
3,The instructions are very poor and seem to be for a different model. When using the stand it puts the volume buttons on the bottom. When using the iPad for a game and laying it flat the hand hold makes it unstable. i removed the hand hold.
5,I found it covers yhe iPad completely with several carrying option and a stand!!!  My grandson spends hours saying look at screen....the stand helps keep my hands free.
5,I have been an user for Otherbox for decades but I found this product equally strong or better for 50% cost of the Otherbox. I have been using it for a week and I am a Happy Camper!
5,I Bought  this  Case for my High functioning Autistic Daughters new iPad .she had a similar case on her last iPad  but the quality sucked on it and she ended up braking her screen.  so  when  I  bought  her new iPad decided go with this case because of the 3 Layer protection and it had all the same features that the other case had (Minus the 3 layer protection ) . This case is defiantly  more durable than her last one. She has defiantly dropped her iPad a lot since I bought it . she told me the other day that  she tripped while using the hand strap feature she smacked the iPad hard when she fell on the ground .  Thank God she is ok and so is the iPad looks  this case is doing its job  protecting her iPad  . I would  defiantly buy case again
5,very good quality. Ipad very well covered.
5,Easy to get on. Looks great and most importantly my iPad didn’t break when I dropped it! Butterfingers!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This iPad case is so comfortable! The Velcro handle on the back allows me to slip my hand in and hold it without having to grip the iPad at awkward angles with my fingers. And the protection the case has is awesome my kitty can play with the cat games on it without me fearing my iPad being damaged.
5,My daughter likes how secure it holds her iPad and easy it is to carry.
4,Just got my case for an iPad at work. It’s a really good case and the handle and kick stand on the back are really useful. Especially the hand wrap handle  as I work in the oil Industry and carry it up and down rigs doing inspections. You get two face covers with the product. one has a plastic screen cover Protector. One without. the one with the plastic was kind of a cool though but when you put it on it warps a little making the touchscreen harder to use. It’s a flimsy plastic. If they used a stiffer maybe harder type of plastic it would be perfect. So I just got a glass screen protector and used the faceplate without the screen protector and it works perfect. All in all it’s a really good product but 4.5 stars if I could for the flimsy plastic face plate. Also the pen holder built into the handle on the back is really useful so I don’t lose the pen or forget it and have to go back for it. Awesome product!!
5,This an excellent case. It is sturdy and protective. It is very easy to hold especially while reading. The stand in back is very handy as well. The only real issue is a minor one: the stand is difficult to release.
5,Updated Review:  I broke the old case and reordered I use my iPad for work and I am in and out of crawlspaces attics and other spots and am rough on cases.  The old case was dropped numerous times bumped on many different objects and it finally had enough.The new case came with to screen bezels; one with a screen protector and one without a nice upgrade as I ended up removing the screen protector in my old case.I did have problems with the old straps breaking.  the 1st time I contacted the company and without question they sent me a replacement one.  The 2nd time I did not contact them I decided I needed to come up with a more durable solution I ended up using a carabiner and single point rifle sling attached to the hand strap and that has worked great but is also the reason I had to buy a new one.Original Review:Case fits great other than the built in screen protector which is loose in some locations which causes touch to not always be recognized in these areas.Hand strap is great though I wish it was off set to one side rather than the middle but that's just a personal preference.Received quick and in time.
5,So far so good
5,Love the way it’s easy to hold on to and the way it protects my iPad.
5,Rugged ample color selection this case is made to last and protect your iPad Gen 6. My toddler and 5yo both are rough handling the iPad drop it toss it etc... and no damage at all because of this case. I bough 3 cases a black an orange and  a teal. I use mine with the face without the screen protector because the protecting film doesn't sit flat on the iPad so as I press there's a little slag or bounce back from the protecting film and its bothersome to me. My wife doesn't mind and she uses her with it. I give the seller extra points because the case comes with two face options with or without the film and the delivery was fulfilled quickly. I must point out the stand clip on the back of the case the first few usesit give me bit of resistance to open and close in one of the cases then it was smooth. Beware if you are too rough trying to get it to open or close it can break.
5,Fits perfectly on my iPad love it
3,I really wanted to give this 5 stars.  Loved the color and it does feel secure once ipad is set into bottom of case.  The top with the screen protector had a white sticker on it and when I removed it it left a sticky smudge on one corner(see photo).  I'm not sure if I can remove it without ruining the protective film.  The main issue with it is that the screen protector film does not lay flat.  There is a large wave right in the middle of the screen going all the way across the ipad.  It looks and feels very cheap I wish it was a tighter fit around the frame without all the waves in it.I like the hand strap on the back seems pretty secure but it would be nice if it could be removed.  The stand on the back is ok it's kind of hard to rotate.  It took a few tries to get my thumb print to unlock the screen.  I have average sized hands for a woman at first I wasn't able to unlock the screen but after I got used to exactly where to place my thumb I am able to do it.  You just have to hold your finger a little differently than you normally would kind of more at an angle because of the ridge right under the home button.I was going to purchase one for my son's ipad if I liked this one but will hold off until I decide it I'm going to keep this one or not.
5,The case is beautiful and it fits my IPad perfectly. I love my new case. If anyone is looking for a seller that has a sturdy durable iPad case SEYMAC STOCK is where you will find it. Thank you!! A+++++++++/Excellent purchase
5,Durable reliable and great product
5,I purchased this to use on my iPad while I work as a nanny.  I just throw it into my backpack and do not worry if it is going to break.  My backpack has fallen off the table chair etc. and no problem with any damage.  Great product and I love the colors!!
5,I bought this case for my four year olds iPad and I know that. At seem like a little too much flebitis we love it. It’s super durable and easy to take off if need be. I like the stand the strap and the hand Velcro holder thing. I can even put a pen in the little strap thing on the back. It holds everything. My son can carry it himself. It’s great. Highly recommend.
5,Great product. Easy to put on protects well lots of cool functions. Highly recommend!
5,This sturdy case is perfect to protect delicate iPad from damage when used by anyone who may have problems with manual dexterity.  It has a comfortable hand strap that helps support the iPad when in use a screen protector and a longer neck strap that ensures that the iPad will not be dropped or lost.Took a little struggle to get the on/off button correctly positioned so that it works qith the case in place.  But persevere and it will be fine.Very helpful.
5,I got this iPad case for my nephew and he love it easy to hold and it very durable good for small kids really love it
5,I bought this iPad case for my 10 years old daughter she needs her iPad everyday at school or wherever she goes. This is her 2nd iPad because she dropped multiple times with her previous iPad and she broke it. This iPad case is very well made and stable she loves the color of the case as well as the long strap she can wear it like a purse 👛 also she can carry her Apple pen 🖊 attached with this case which is very useful.I recommend to anybody who is looking for a strong stable reliable iPad case this one is good to go.Thinking of buying your myself as well in near future.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Compré este protector para mi hija. Ya destruyó una tableta antes así que busqué algo contra impactos y caídas. Es fácil de manipular fuerte y resistente. Lo más que me gustó es que el protector de la pantalla aún permite la sensibilidad del dactil. Y mantiene la nitidez de los colores.
5,Wish I would have had this for my sons iPad years ago! So sturdy and exactly what I wanted!
5,I have dealt with shotty cases over the last two year but this SEYMAC Stock Case takes the winning ticket to be the best built case ever and that includes the sturdy kickstand which is an added bonus.
5,I bought 3 of these for our tablets. 2 autistic boys age 6 & 7 own 2 of those tablets and I can definitely say they get tested daily! I would highly recommend these
4,This is for the SEYMAC Stock [Full-body] Drop Proof Hybrid Armor Case.  My kids really like them. I would have given it 5 stars but I’m skeptical of 5-star reviews. I think too many of them are bots or reviews of other products.As for this case the iPad fits well and the kids find it easy to hold and carry. It doesn’t lie flat and it’s pretty thick with the back handle so it may not work with some charging stations. The sleep button is sometimes difficult to hit and nearly impossible to hold (if you need to reset it or restore it like I did).Otherwise no complaints. Kids love it in the car and at home.  Great to have the option of the included screen protector or a 3rd party tempered glass cover.  I wouldn’t hesitate to buy another.
5,This case is well worth the price and provides great protection from falls dings or scratches. Openings for charger port and headphone jack with protective rubber covers easily flippable to protect from dust or dirt entering. The screen protector does not hinder the iPad touch screen performance whatsoever. The handy and adjustable slip on the back allows one to slip the case onto one’s hand and adjust the strap for comfort. The “kickstand” has a swivel to adjust the iPad to stand up or down or lengthwise. Nice touch. A breeze to assemble and like l stated above gives outstanding protection against falls. The carrying strap is also a nice touch to place around your neck or across your shoulder. I dig this case cover. One of the best investments in protecting my iPad. Definitely five stars⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,Excellent purchase and timely delivery
4,Great case. Only complaints are the on/off switch doesn’t line up properly to the iPad and can be difficult to turn on/off. I’ve removed and reinstalled the case numerous times and it doesn’t fix the issue. Also the kick stand on the back can be a little hard to slide as well. I do love that it comes with a safety screen and gives the option to not use one as well. My 6 year old and 2 year old are able to use the handle and has a very comfortable grip. Haven’t had any major drops but it has been sturdy enough for the smalls drops from the kids.
5,My kid’s last iPad case didn’t last a year. First the plastic case part broke then the stand accidentally snapped off and broke so it was toast. This one looks a lot sturdier and I like that the stand swivels so it can be used in portrait or landscape and has a Velcro hand strap. The silicone bumper part is thicker than the last one and it comes with a shoulder strap too which is a nice bonus. Also this case comes with two plastic faceplates one that has a clear plastic screen protector and the other one is open which is nice because we already had a screen protector on her device. If something ever happens to the one we have on it now we can always replace it with the extra one. It seems to be a great value for the money.
5,We just absolutely love the sturdiness and durability of the case. We got it for our son’s iPad and it has been on of the best cases so far. Highly recommend!
5,My daughter loves it for her iPad! She dropped it a few times with the case and there is no harm on the iPad or the screen! :)
5,My son loves it and it’s super easy handle it. And the best of all 2 for the price of 1. Not that bad.
5,I bought this case for my son's ipad. His cousins have it as well. They are very durable and work great. My son likes the strap around his neck when he is walking around with his ipad either taking videos or just moving from room to room so that he doesn't drop it. Would purchase this again.
4,We use an ipad in our store to upload items to our on line store.  We needed a case that would protect it if dropped but also be easy to use and hold while taking photos.  And stand out in the pile of materials that clutter our work . areas.  We ordered the SEYMAC and another brand - that we returned as the Seymac with its back "holder" was the easiest to use.  No complaints.
5,Good protection and easy to hold.
5,I really like the durability of this case. It’s kind of difficult to put on but not to bad. Just make sure your screen is clean. I really like the stand and the option to hold in hand. I highly recommend this case! Fun teal color too.
5,This was exactly what my dad was looking for!
5,Fits Perfect Very Sturdy and Durable. And it looks great too
5,I got this for my daughter as a smaller Alternative to her other iPad case. She loves it and says it’s pretty (she’s 5)
5,Bought this for my son and he loves it!  Very functional and very sturdy.  Keeps the iPad safe from getting g damaged.
5,Very sturdy
5,Love all the accessories that come with it. Allows me to hang it from almost anywhere. The rotating kick stand is great.
5,I like this product it protects very good the i pad
5,I accidentally ordered this iPad while looking for a case for it.  I thought I would return but it was in like new condition and the price was right so I kept it and have been happy with the accidental purchase.
4,I have gifted this to a person and they absolutely loved it.
3,i was disappointed to only receive a very very short strap. It appears this short strap is useful for maybe hangin on back of car head rest. The long strap as pictured did not arrive as expected.
5,This keyboard for the iPad is super sleek and looks professional. I love it.!!
5,so far its a really nice case for my tablet.
5,We use this case on our ipad for our baseball team to keep stats on during the game. Very durable and easy to hold on to.
4,Bought two of these for family members.  The case is very protective of the devices and I really liked that they came with 2 covers: one with a built in screen protector and one without.  I have a problem with the durability of the stands though as the tab that locks the stand open has already broken on both of the cases I purchased and I’ve only had them a month!Update: I’m updating my review from 3 stars to 4.  SEYMAC responded to my review and quickly replaced the broken cases.  I’m very impressed with their outstanding and responsive customer service.
5,My 5y/o received an iPad from his grandfather and trying to find something durable for him was a bit of a challenge. But after looking and considering this product for the iPad. It has held ip great to him. It is sturdy easy for him to hold and carry around. I like that it came with two different tops one with a screen protector and one with and one without. I can tell you that after putting a glass screen protector on and then trying the top with the screen protector on. It works great still and sensitive to touch. One great product that I would buy again if needing to.
5,Love all of this product features
5,Product works well however the stand clip fell apart after 3 weeks and will not clip back.  Very annoying as it works well hand held but cannot stand on its own.  Changed review as company replaced my item and they were a pleasure to work with !
5,I had a LifeProof case at my last job and really liked it but I didn't like the price so I tried this and can't tell the difference
5,I love this design it is very durable and has a vast number of protective layers to prevent any iPad from getting damaged. I love the that they included an additional protective layer for the screen. I have a very rough 7 year old so the design is perfect for him when he’s on the go. He thinks it’s cool and really enjoys the various straps that allow him to hold the device in any way. It does have a stand so it’s very easy to prop up and the rubber grips prevent it from sliding so there are plenty of viewing options. Not only is this a good product but the customer service is impeccable! That’s really the only reason why I am doing this review! The seller notified me every step of this process (with tracking info etc) and For that reason alone I will continue making other purchases with this seller.
5,I ordered this product for one of my clients who is Autistic and has destroyed other tablets that his family has purchased in the past and he has bitten the tablets and cracked the screens. This is working out perfectly!Thank you
5,This iPad has case has been perfect for protecting my iPad Pro from my preschooler! I would absolutely recommend it. I like that it has a stylus holder on the back as well.
5,I'm very happy with my purchase. It's durable and fits perfectly. I would highly recommend it
5,This case is so rad! The iPad feels so secure. You get so much for your buck! 100% recommend.
4,Es muy bonita luce bien lo que mi no me gusto el color esta muy apagad o opaco  no se ve tal como en la imagen con el color vivo pero los tonos y la combinación son bonitos cumple bien su propósito  contra de golpes y ralladuras
4,It was easy to put on and seems durable and the color is really nice too
5,The color is great and it's functional
5,Ok it’s probably not bomb proof but my wife had cracked the screen on her ipad (on every device she owns to be honest) and I needed to use the ipad for doing math homework/study while at work. I work doing security and I work graveyard so I didn’t want to risk doing more damage to the screen or having to deal with the slippery thin fall under the seats ipad without a cover. This one has great protection and holds my tablet pencil so that I’m not fumbling around in the dark looking for it. The little strap in the back is great too as it makes holding the tablet very comfortable and as a bonus I can strap my ipad to my steering wheel if I feel like watching something without having to hold the tablet at all.
4,I purchased this for my son's I pad we had a similar case for it. I choose this case because the I pad is completely contained. When we first put the case on I was thrilled and would have given 5 stars but after 1 day of use the shield that covers the screen is ready scratched. We decided to purchase a screen protector  to put directly on the I pad and use the spare cover they sent with the product.  This is not what I had wanted because moisture could get inside but I had already opened the product.  We did not like the velcro strap and removed that so we could use the kick stand.  The straps might come in handy during car rides for movies.
5,Every phone case and every iPad case he has ever owned he has destroyed. This is the first one that he has owned that he has not broken. He is a carpenter foreman always out in the field always using it to look at plans and blueprints. The handle on the back is very ideal. The protective corners and hard plastic are also ideal.  the fact that he stores it in his lunchpail when he’s not using it Is proof of the thick plastic protection. I will be purchasing another one for my own iPad based off the durability and protection of this one. We bought blue and it’s beautiful
5,This is a great case. Needed it for my iPad a work and it was exactly what I needed! Highly recommend!
4,Good
5,It’s really easy to put on. Easy for my child to hold since it’s not that heavy. It has multiple ways to hold it or prop it up which I like so no matter what my child it doing they have a way to hold and watch the iPad. Plus it comes in multiple colors
4,This case was good did everything that I wanted and needed it to do. I’ve owned mine for a little over 3 months. The fist one they sent had a crease in the plastic protector this 2nd one was better. Now 3 months and the back plastic clip that keeps the stand up broke. Amazon there to help nope contact the seller for their help.Update—Was contacted by Rain from the company shortly after my review and they sent out a replacement. I received it today. Installation is easy and got everything changed around. Hopefully the clip lasts longer this go round but at least I know I will have a good experience for customer service if I need it.
5,I do love my case! I no longer worry about dropping it. If I had one wish I would like it to be lighter my hands are arthritic and frequently I have to put it down. But it does the job it is meant to do protect my IPad! Thank you.
4,The first case a received had an issue with the strap's stitching it happens with mass production but the case itself was fine and I rigged the strap together with my quarter baked sewing skills to make it funtional. Once I mentioned this to the vendor they sent me a replacement for free that did not have an issue with the strap.The case overall is very good and feels like it can protect the ipad from a pretty good fall barring the unlucky strike directly to the screen. It comes with 2 fronts one with and one without a built in screen protector so that you can choose to use a different svreen protector
4,The case adds some weight to the tablet. It is very easy to hold the rubbery edges keep it from sliding off smooth surfaces. The handgrip is very adjustable.A lot of thought has gone into the design and I am very pleased with my purchase.
4,i wish it would stand up straighter it seems to lean back farther than i like overall a really nice protecor
5,I got a cover with the screen case and one without a screen case so if I did not want to have a screen case put on the 2nd cover! Thank you SEYMAC. Please buy this product
4,Overall the product is very good. A couple of small things the areas where power/volume buttons could be improved I find it a little difficult to use.
5,Bought this for my two year old nephews iPad and I am so happy I did. This thing covers allPony’s and is toddler approved and proof. He drops it gets all kinds of smudges on it - seeioiyyou name it - he does it nothing has gotten inside (fluid dirt? Sticky stuff$ and with just a clean cloth with a littleThieves spray ams it’s super clean qms ready for him to use it’s also super easy to access the charging port. If it came in more adult colors I would get one for my teenagers
5,Awesome case my daughter loves it. It’s well built and does an awesome job protecting her iPad from falls scratches and the screen getting cracked. I would definitely purchase this case again if I get another iPad.
5,Es para el uso de mi hijo y a sido muy durable ya que se le a caído en varias ovaciones y su ipad está muy bien !
4,It's pretty much what I expected. My iPad got cracked from the case I had prior. Couldn't trade it in because it was damage pretty good. Needed to get it back to working for me. Found a spot near the house had my iPad fixed and got a screen protective put out on so I'm not paying much for it to get fixed again if there's a mistake. This case for just right. Best way to describe it is like an Otterbox. I'm extremely happy with the purchase. If any updates I'll come back and say something. Seems a bit flimsy when putting on but it's solid enough to protect the iPad.
5,I was looking for a durable case to purchase with a handle on it and this one has so much more! I love the quality feel and the kick stand is coming in very handy. My much more expensive Lifeproof case failed me so I wanted one with rubber around it for the inevitable drops. I got a cracked screen with my old iPad using the Lifeproof app case. The handle is great because I’m a Realtor so I can carry this easily while showing properties or at listing appointments. Having the added screen protection is great also and the price is so reasonable. It is very easy to assemble and install unlike what some other reviews say here. If you’ve ever had an otter box case it’s pretty much the same installation. Very easy. I highly recommend this.
5,Case fit perfectly. Although there wasn’t a slot to hold the Apple Pencil I’m still satisfied with the purchase.
5,Use this out in the feild everyday.  Perfect for these conditions where you need both hands strap comes in handy to free up by our hands and I dont have to set my device on the ground.
5,This product was purchased for an iPad for my daughter to use on an airplane. But we have been using almost daily. It’s very easy to change the orientation of the stand super durable and very stylish! Highly recommend this product.
5,Overall good product! Worked perfect for my toddlers repurposed iPad Pro
5,So I ordered a different case before this one and it didn't hold up the rubber was already dry-rotted and basically I got about 2 months of protection out of it. Mind you I have 3 kids all 5 and under so they are tough on our electronics that being said this case from initial impressions is hands down worth 3-4x its cost. Its bulky yes but they have dropped it from the counter (at least 4 ft) and nothing not a scratch no dent no broken pieces. The other case took one fall and I lost the stand this one took it like it was meant for it. Very happy with these cases and the colors are spot on from the photos... that was another gripe about the other case that will not be mentioned... LOL
5,They fit snug and do not pop off if the device is dropped.I have owned several of these and my only complaint is that the covers for the headset and charging port tend to break off easily.
5,This is one of the best iPad protective covers I have ever owned. I can rest assured that my iPad is protected and feel very safe to had over to my grandchild (3 yrs old) to use anytime.  I like the stand feature in the back and the fact I can hang it up in my minivan "between" the back seats is the best feature. I highly suggest this cover and seller!!!
4,I really like this case. It is strong and I really like the stand on the back as well as the elastic band for handheld applications. The only thing I did not care for was the built in screen protector. You have to push on it a little harder than I would like. BUT included with the front assembly with the attached screen protector they also sent an open assembly that you can use with your own screen protector if you have one that you like better.
5,It has layers of protection. Idea for kids for protection.
5,The plastic case fit great but the silicone is too big.Edited--- the seller reached out with instructions since they were missing. The case fits great I was just putting it on wrong.
5,Great product. Easy to use. Easy to install. Needs better instructions but great protective device.
4,Great product. Everything is just as described... excpt there is no way to turn off the iPad. The old case had a magnet on the cover that shut the iPad down. I've set the autooff to one minute but that sometimes interferes with use. Other than that it's a great case with a handle.  I was beginning to get a callous on my pinkie from trying to hold the iPad. Recommend a careful look at the colors. My RED turned out to be bright ORANGE.
5,I would have given this case 5 stars but the back stand was broken upon arrival. Also the volume buttons are off from where they are in the iPad but my son doesn’t care to much about that. We were most disappointed that it won’t stand up. Otherwise it’s a great case with many good features.Edited: The company reached out after reading my review and sent a brand new case. Everything arrived on perfect condition and they even followed up to make sure it did. I would recommend them for sure!
5,It’s so dope. Keeps my iPad safe and secure.
5,My daughter is rough and tough and this case is fantastic. It’s easy to hold and very sturdy. I would highly recommend. I think this will hold up nicely.
5,
5,I love this for my kids. I bought one for each of their iPads. 3 total. Love that they have different colors also.
5,Ordered this case with kids in mind. I let my daycare kiddos use the iPad once it had this case on it and it has worked out nicely.This case comes with two screen options. There's one frame piece that allows you to use the screen without the protector and then there's another frame piece with a screen protector built in. That's the option we went with.We haven't used the shoulder strap yet but plan to this weekend while we are out and about.Super easy to put together. I had it going and my daughter took it and thought I was doing it wrong. Once she saw I had been doing it right she even commented on how easy to assemble it was.Would definitely buy again if I had another iPad.
3,As far as the product I liked how it would stand for my grandson. He could also hold it or carry it because it had a handle. I am not sure how or why but it didn’t protect his IPad Air and some how the screen is already broken around the edge of the IPad.
5,So much easier to hold and carry my iPad. The flip stand makes for easy use at work as well as viewing streaming.
5,Really love it got if for my little brother and it’s great it has a stand so when he’s eating he can watch a video and the case is really well made highly recommend it.
4,I purchased my cover for a new iPad. The high points of the package were that it came with 2 small tools one for opening the case and a 2nd for attaching the strap. I managed to get the case together fairly well except for a slight problem with the rubber by where the charging plug fits in. all was well until my wife pointed out that I had forgotten to remove the protective cellophane inside the screen protector. The rubber did not handle having the case disassembled a 2nd time and tore at the bottom. The moral to all this is if you buy one of these assemble it correctly the first time. mY wife admired it and wanted one for herself until I tore the protective rubber. I will probably eventually find some sort of glue to repair it.
5,Love the design and sturdiness of it
5,I love this case. It's so versatile that I can handle it easily in any situation without fear of dropping it. I love the shoulder strap and the hand strap that rotates. Would buy again.
3,The stand gave out a month ago. Apparently the plastic wore to the point that the iPad falls over because the stand collapses with e en easy use.  I will have to look for a case that has hinged stand like cases used to have. My e impossible because it papers that most of the cases have the same type of stand s this one. It does protect the iPad when it falls. My grandchildren have caused it fall several times and there has been no damage to the iPad.
5,Looks good feels good.  Very sturdy!  Well worth the money.
5,This was so easy to put together to protect my iPad.  This was the only place I could find this case.  My iPad is older and no one including Apple stores care this case.
5,I used this case while doing a door to door sales job dropped it while on my Segway and my iPad was fine. My coworker had a different brand and style case (around the same value) and dropped it his iPad literally came out of the case and shattered his screen. This case is great it has an odd design to put on the iPad but it’s extremely secure. I know my iPad is safe when I’m using this case.
3,Kick stand didn’t hold fast weak and flimsy.  Very frustrating.
4,It seems like it protects the iPad well enough but I've had it for little over a month and stand is already not working. It won't lock anymore and the rubber coverings protecting ports are tearing off already. My toddler has dropped it a few times and it hasn't broken my iPad so that is a plus. It shouldn't be falling apart after a month though.
5,I’ve purchased at least 5 different brands of cases for my iPads varying in price from $20-$80 and have never been this happy. This case is perfect! The color is beautiful and it feels rugged and tough without the weight and bulk. The carrying strap is a godsend and something I didn’t realize I absolutely needed. The kickstand is perfect height and the hand strap is very secure. I’m usually juggling 3+ things with my iPad and this case has definitely eased my anxiety with the straps.
4,Works as advertised
5,I love this case. It is easy to hold with or without the strap on back. The neck strap unsnaps when not in use. Comes with 2 face plates. One has clear plastic in it and one is for use if you are using a tempered glass screen protector. I put on the one with clear plastic witch became scratched up just looking at it so I will get tempered glass and use the other cover. It came with little tools and extra pieces for the neck strap though I don’t know why you would need them as everything seems sturdy and well made. I am very happy with my purchase
5,Grandson liked it very much.
5,Great product for a great price
4,The main issue I have found right now with the case is the on/off button will not work no matter how hard I press the button.  I may have to actually carve out the rubber around the button or use other methods to restart the iPad.It was easy to put together for the most part.  The charge port rubber cover is fairly sturdy but I had to use visual line of site to get lightning cable attached properly.  I'm sure over time muscle memory will kick in and that won't be an issue any longer.
5,This product has already proven itself. My daughter has already dropped the iPad twice and zero damage. It’s sturdy well designed and overall I amextremely satisfied with the product.
5,Originally I bought this to use for my work iPad and I loved it so much that I ended up buying the same one for my personal iPad. I love that it has a 360 rotating multi-use kickstand and holder. They literally thought of everything and I love that they included a bunch of optional attachments as well. I will definitely buy from this company going forward. The only negative is that when you initially open the package there is a super strong chemically plastic smell. It does go away but it kind of made me gag for a few days...
5,I bought this case to replace the one that I had that broke it’s actually a fantastic case well-made easy to use very sensible and it’s a good price my neighbor down the street like there’s so much he bought one too she basically got to sales out of the city of Lynn from us and I’ll be more than happy to recommend this to someone else because it’s a great case is well-made and it takes really good care of my iPad thank you very much you did a good job on this
5,Product seems very sturdy should hold up well for my son. I really like all the option with this case the strap and hand holder on back are very nice.
5,I like that installation of this case was a breeze. There were instructions and tools in the package to assist with installation a cloth to clean the screen and a bonus top case that has a screen protector. I opted to use the open faced top screen for now. The straps are super helpful. I recently traveled and wanted to keep my iPad handy but not in my bag. The short strap was helpful in letting my just hang my iPad on my suitcase handle. The hand loop is great as well. I currently don’t have the shoulder strap attached but it’s durable! All of the ports are accessible.  I like to play games and stream shows to my iPad so having the rotating prop stand was a must! It rotates well is simple to use and sits the iPad at a great angle and even remains upright on soft surfaces.  I would recommend this product to people of all ages!
5,This makes my iPad easy to hold and is very durable.
5,Loves the two options for carrying it. Either over the shoulder with strap or in his palm.
5,Item shipped quicker than expected and is a well made product.  I needed help because the kick stand did not work any longer and Rain with customer service was so helpful getting us a replacement that worked.  Beyond satisfied!!  I have purchased the same case for multiple people and will continue to buy for future products.
5,it is awesome my Dog got a hold of My Ipad and chewed on it all night  and it was in this case the dog ( chow /husky mix ) had a great time with it but no harm was done to the ipadThanks for a great Product
3,the rubber cover sags on sides and looks sloppy.
5,This is a great case! It's well built. I like the stand option and the ability to hold it with one hand - it would be perfect for a restaurant waiter/waitress or someone who works in the field. It was a little difficult to figure out how to put it together but after a couple tries I got it figured out!
5,This case has two layers the hard plastic layer and the rubber layer. So far seems to be study and fits well. I like the handle on the back.
5,This was the perfect case for my special need sons iPad that he literally carries around EVERYWHERE as it’s used as a talking device (he is non-verbal). He even chews on the edges all the time and it still holds up very well. The iPad has sustained NO cracks or scratches sense we had this case which we bought over a year ago. I especially love the carrying straps as he keeps it around his neck continuously anywhere we go. The strap broke pretty quick on the part where it connects to the iPad but we just tied a knot in it and that has worked fine.
4,This is my 2nd purchase of this case bought one back in August 2019 and I have to say its a great case for the price. The stand is very sturdy in the beginning but give it about 6 months it begins to loosen up. The screen protector is good but dirt can slip under causing it to be a hassle to take off to wipe the iPad screen. Overall I like this case that's why I bought a 2nd one.
5,I'm always on the run and love the fact that I feel safer now carrying my iPad to my accounts
4,We received the case in good time and good condition.I like the case.  It fits my iPad well and protects it.  I like the stylus that came with it.  I wish there was a place to store the stylus. on the case.I really like the swivel stand.  It is easy to set in landscape or vertical. Sometimes it is better to view the iPad in vertical position.No instructions for how to install my iPad into the case were included.  That would have been helpful.  We pulled the wrong side of the screen protector off first.  Other than that we figured it out fairly easily.We have not tested the drop protection.  It looks like it will protect it from moderate falls.
5,My husband loves that you can slide your hand on the adjustable back strap and turn his iPad in many directions. He is also clumsy and occasionally drops his iPad. This case has proven to be very sturdy and durable. Definitely worth the money!  I would 100% buy it again! 😊
5,Firmeza
5,Like the quality and the toughness of it. I’m not worried if I drop the iPad. Looks good also
5,Love the style it's durable and my iPad fits nice and snug. I love how it has a strap and pencil holder. I definitely recommend
5,Using it now. This is my third but I think my last iPad case. It’s sturdy. I dropped my iPad a few times tripping over the charge cord and had to have it repaired. This has a nice grip and a sturdy cover. I think I’m safe. Yes I did drop it but the case is like a shell. It really protects the pad.I have a Gen6 and it fits perfect. Everything lines up perfectly. I like that the stand swivels easily but doesn’t collapse once you set it.Great case for the price.
5,Love the stand up feature.  It frees my hands.  Also love the carrying strap around my hand for secure carrying.
4,I absolutely love the color of this case (I got the sky blue/black) but the only thing I do not care for is the screen protector does not sit completely flat against the screen so the touch screen is not as sensitive as it was before I switched my old case to this one.  I still love it though!It came with a non-screen protected front piece so you can put your own screen protector on it.  So that is what I most likely will end up doing!
5,I am thrilled with this purchase but more importantly with the customer service. Their customer service is impeccable. I mistakenly purchased the wrong-sized protective cover and contacted the seller to see whether an exchange was possible. Not only were they quick to reply but the seller offered to send me a brand new one at no charge without hesitation (I didn't even have to send the other back). Really happy with the service and the product! I love the variety of colors I had to choose from and so far the cover seems really sturdy. I also really like the hand strap and the fact that I can carry my Ipad around easily using the long adjustable strap. The screen protector does not affect the sensitivity of the screen and the installation is super easy. They even throw in a step-by-step guide to help you out. Couldn't be happier and would highly recommend!
4,I just put case on my sons iPad. The bumper seems good. The rubber and strap in the back of case smell bad. I chose this case because it has a spot for his stylus pen. The major con is the stand in the back. I can already tell it won't last long. Its cheap hard plastic that gets stuck when sliding into place. I give it a month if that.
1,I bought a this case to replace another child shockproof case I had been using on my child’s iPad for the past 2 years that he had since he was 6 years old. When I took the iPad out of the first case even though it was probably 2-3 years old this iPad out of the case still looked in amazing pristine condition! I replaced the case with this one & my now almost 9 year old loved it & took it outside to take pics of cars driving by which he loves to do & within the same hour he came in upset because his friend dropped the iPad on accident & several cracks appeared on the front screen. It being thrown dropped tossed etc was nothing new but falling to the ground from the hight of a 7 year old child was ridiculous!! I through away the old case so I left the iPad in this case until the other arrived within about a week. BIG MISTAKE…By the time I received a new case which I ordered the identical case I had before this one that stood up to probably almost anything a 6-8 year children can put an iPad through the entire iPad needed replaced because both back & front were cracked & on the back side that I couldn’t see until I took it out to replace the case  shards of huge pieces of glass had fallen out that the case I assume had been holding in place until removed!!!
4,Bought this because of the built-in protective screen.The case fits well and seems to protect well (3 months in).I didn't want the straps or handle on the back so took them off and threw them away.4 stars for not giving me a simpler option. Also seemed overpriced given that prior models of the exact same cover are half the price.
5,This is the best iPad case that I have seen. It is very well designed. The case appears to be very rugged and should protect from at least normal falls. (I will admit that I have not tested this yet.) The volume buttons have been designed so that you can tell which one is volume up and down just by touch. There is a support on the back which you have to find the release button when you want to push the support back in. That would be the one warning about the design. I have and will recommend this to anyone in the future.
5,the screen cover with the plastic screen protector sux so luckily it has the second windowless one as well (Pencils especially bad with the uneven lumpy plastic cover so just spring for a quality classic adhesive style for the ipad screen itself).  The case itself is strong good looking and durable without being too heavy so very nice.  But the strap to carry it like a messenger bag or purse the rotating grip strap the Pencil holder & flip out kickstand are all double win!  I got the orange bright and pretty to go with my Logitech Crayon pencil also orange and when I wear it out take it out to use or just have it sitting on my table at breakfast while I watch the vlogs.. I feel fly all day.
5,Came with extra bezel and tools to remove it rivals the otter box especially on price the 360 degree handle and straps are great easy to put on
5,Our daughter broke our last iPad screen when she dropped it.  We needed to get a heavy duty case which this certainly is.  And I like how it can stand up and rotate too.  Very helpful for her.
5,I buy three for my work and they loved. Good job with the quality
5,Well built and sturdy. A bit of a challenge on how to squeeze in the iPad but the results are worth it.
5,Great value. Shipped fast and exactly as in description. Good fit and easy to install. Would definitely buy again.
5,I was very impressed with the quality of this cover. Great buy
4,Case is protective and easy to clean plus the Velcro strap handle is nice.My kids have gone through several of these each though because the built in stands for these wear out rather quickly and eventually break. This has happened within 3 months on every case we’ve purchased.
5,I had dropped my last iPad flat on its face shattering the gorilla glass so I knew I needed an extra-sturdy case for my new one. This one absolutely fits the bill.I also wanted a stand that would fully rotate and although getting the stand to fold out was awkward at first it now is easy to fold out and back in and rotate whatever way I want. I thought the handle was silly at first but honestly I love it. It makes it super easy to carry my iPad without worrying about it sliding out of my hand or off a pile of things in my arms. The little 'cuff' in the back makes it easy to hold up too if I need to. The rubber is nice and firm and protective. I am completely satisfied. Will buy again.
5,This case was a perfect fit for my 6th generation iPad. I really like that it has different options on how to hold it. With the hand strap on the back to the lanyard attachment. Not to mention it was my school colors.  It is perfect for me because the iPad I put it on is used in a kiosk mode and passed around through many people. I haven't had it long enough to know the durability but from feeling it I believe it will last a long time.
5,I love how versatile and protective this has been for our iPad. My toddler walks around and drops it and hits everything she can with it and the iPad remains undamaged. Great great cover to buy!
5,This iPad cover works great. I’m using it to keep my iPad safe while my baby watches videos in the vehicle. It has a perfect strap on it so that it hangs around the head rest. I feel comfortable with the protection level that this case offers. This case came with tools to put it on your iPad a cleaning cloth a strap and two screen covers (one with a screen and one without). It came well packaged. I’m happy with my purchase.
5,This was very simple to put together. It is very durable and lightweight which is great for my kids. The protective screen registers all movement without glitching. Great purchase.
4,This case looks great and does its job of protecting my device very well.  The stand and hand strap located on the back (which I didn’t think I needed) is great. However the screen protection is not as sensitive to touch as I hoped it would be.  Around the edges of the screen a heavier than normal touch is required to select or open or close or type.  I would recommend the case - just not the screen protector.
4,I bought this case for my 13 year old son just two months ago in September and the carry strap has already frayed apart at the buckles.  He loved having the strap and used it all the time to hang his iPad for hands-free video watching.  The rubber edging and frame are a bit difficult to get on and off but the instructions are easy to follow and once on it stays snugly in place.  We didn't use the screen protector because it's kind of plastic-y and feels annoying but we used one like it on my son's first iPad when he was little and it worked great then.
4,Good case.  My 3 year old figured out how to take off the rubber part of the case so we are frequently putting that back on.  Not real clear on how to attach the shoulder strap but nice to see a needle was included to assist.  We really purchased it for the standing up feature of which it works great even on softer surfaces (blankets/bed).
5,Sturdy enough for me it has a screen protector and a hanging strap that can be used in back seat.
5,So far everything is great don’t for see any problems. Arrived on time and as described by the seller. Seems very sturdy.
5,Good fit
5,100%
5,Easy to assemble on the tablet & protects it well. My daughter is 6 & plays rough it holds up well.
5,This case is extremely durable!!
5,I absolutely love this case! I originally got it because it had a slot to hold your stylus/Apple Pencil but I’m have enjoyed that feature plus some! The handle that wraps around your hand while you write/draw moves and spins for you to get the most comfortable grip and the kick stand works amazing I’ve watched quite the tv shows and movies while having it propped up on the kickstand! If you’re considering getting this case- don’t hesitate- get it! You’ll be happy you did!
5,This product is very sturdy and high quality. Our grandson is enjoying it.
4,I really like the design and it’s very easy to use. I wish it came in purple like the smaller size ones. I don’t like how one corner won’t stay clamped shut.
5,I'm the Cubmaster for my son's Cub scout Pack. Since we're meeting outside as much as possible these days I decided to switch from paper to my iPad. This case is nice as I can let the iPad hang from my neck when I don't need it.  But when I'm using it the wrist strap on the back helps me hold it without my hand getting tired. The iPad is protected and I can wipe off any mist or dew  and it's easy to sanitize.  Plus my iPad can handle a slight wind gust without rolling or folding etc.
5,I bought for my son who's never staying still. Easy to carry and very functional. He's really liking it.
5,I was looking for a durable case that could stand a decent amount of field use incorporate the Apple pencil and be easy on the hand when reading at home in the evening this really fit the bill! Highly recommended!!
5,I was surprised how much I love mine and how many ways I can use it. It’s honestly one of my fave Amazon purchases of all time. No complaints.
5,It fits my iPad perfectly. Seems to protect well. I like the shoulder strap. It's handy.
5,This review is a first impression. I just got the case today when I only ordered it on Wednesday. So the three day shipping fulfillment was definitely a good start. The one criticism I have is: some guidance on assembly would have been great. It was basically a "play with it till you get it to do something" method. Beyond that once it was together I was a bit more happy with the construction and it seems like it will be a good protector in the long run. I will come back and edit if anything happens to change my mind on that.
5,I have had this case for a month now. I really like the rubber edges and corners as it helps it from sliding around in my truck. As for the back strap it makes it very easy to hold. The stand could be a little longer so that it would hold the IPad more upright but overall I really like this case and wish they had an identical one for my IPhone 12
5,Perfect case for kids. I bought this for my 6 year old son. He loves it. He’s dropped his iPad before and no damage done. Comes with a carrying strap. I can hang it on the back of the seat when we go on trips. It comes with 2 front screen cases. One is just the frame so you can use your own temper glass and the 2nd one has a plastic screen attached to the frame.
5,I got this case for my IPAD for multiple reasons main one was incase it got dropped on concrete at an  event. it is easier to hold that the slim IPAD alone versatile and stylish in multiple colors. It was dropped hard shortly after the new case was put on and it saved the day! My only problem is the screen protector it makes the screen look...strange (for lack of a better word).
5,After having two stands break on a similar other brand I bought this one for my I Pad 5th generation. I absolutely Love the design and durability. I liked the 360 degree stand. The strap allows me to hold it also in any direction. It comes with the ability to case it if you already have a tempered glass screen or has it’s on screen protector. Nice over the shoulder strap design if you have the need to carry it around a lot for school or work. I love the colors they come in also. I literally have nothing negative to say.
4,The case fits as expected.  The stand is a little clunky though it may loosen up with use.
4,I needed a sturdy and durable case protector for my IPad and this one has worked well.It does make the pad a bit more bulky but overall better than a broken screen.The handle on the back is great for carrying while I’m working however it does not fit my style of holding while I’m using the pad; I like using both hands to type and navigate my screen.
5,I liked the fact that they provided a front cover without the plastic covering my screen. I tried the plastic covered one first and didn’t care for it because I had to firmly press on keys when I was typing in order to get the correct spelling of a word.  Love the handle strap in back sometimes it gets in my way but it is very handy when I want some privacy I can hold my iPad up. I have a lot of recipes on my iPad and the stand in back helps to keep it at a slanted angle for better viewing.
4,Liked
5,nice tablet holder/carrier it make everything easier
4,I like how sturdy and durable this case is. The only feature I dislike is it seems difficult at times to power on and off my device due to how thick the material is over the power button.
5,This case is amazing! So we bought a second IPad for our son who has severe Autism because he broke the first one since the case we got him was not that great. Plus he likes to smash things when he gets upset. He literally makes holes on the walls when he throws things. Once we got this case he  tried to smash the IPad made holes on the walls break mirrors with his IPad (while inside the case) and nothing happened to it. Nothing! When he’s upset he uses his iPad as a....weapon but nothing happens to it. The iPad is intact. This case is very well made and can withstand our child. I thought we were never going to find anything like this. Buy it now!
5,Tried different ones before but didn’t like itBut this is really a good one choice
5,Bought for my son's iPad he received for Christmas.  So far so good.
5,This item is exactly what I ordered!!  The company reached out to me a week later to make sure I was happy with my purchase and I LOVE IT!!Thank you for making a product that is perfect for me!!! I use my ipad for work with small children and the strap really let’s me hang on to the ipad easily.Thank you again!!
5,Does a great job of protecting my IPad
5,Product is amazing. Got two for both my children’s iPads and it has held up perfectly!!!
5,I was very happy with this. I love the color and the stand rotates for a horizontal view as well. I do not use the stand much and it broke out of the blue. It won’t hold now so I can’t stand it up.  Does anyone know how I can contact the seller? It’s cumbersome to have to hold it.Update! I contacted the seller directly. I emailed and Rain the rep immediately responded. He apologized and I already have a brand new one! He also said to keep the one with the broken stand. Excellent customer service experience!
4,This is a great case for kids.  My daughter really likes the color and I like that it is very sturdy.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that after 1 month the velco doesn't stick anymore.  So the part where you use it to put your hand thru isn't sturdy.  You have to hold that part together and it makes it awkward.  Otherwise it is a great design and can be used in so many different ways.
5,It’s not retry sturdily. It’s thick has 2 layers and a screen cover. It comes with a second if you need to replace which works out great for us. We don’t use the strap but it has a stand! The stand and hand holder works great! Especially for gramma bc of her hand. She has some numbness so it’s good that it’ll stay on her hand.
5,I love this case. Not only does it come with the rubber and plastic case which make it super secure but I can hold my iPad now without fear of dropping it. I wanted a case that would allow me to prop up my iPad to video chat along with holding it securely in my hand if needed with a srap. This has all those features and it also has a neck strap so you can carry it around your neck if your traveling with children. Easy installation as well. Light and durable.
5,Very sturdy and protects my iPad but make sure you order a screen protector first and then put case on.  👍
4,Great case so far! We like the handle on the back that swivels around as well as the stand. I feel like it will last and will protect our iPad. Only gave it 4 stars as we haven’t had it long so we can’t say how long it will last but so far so good!
5,This is an awesome product for the price. Overall give us a five star review. I do seem to have a little bit of offset our problem with the on and off button overlay but everything else works really well and it’s super sturdy and really like the hand grip/stand on back
5,I bought this for my son's ipad. it looks very durable and hard. it is perfect for kid keeps dropping his ipad. the only thing my needs improvement is the access to the buttons.  it takes time to find where they are at the beginning as they are slightly covered with silicon case. However you get use to it and find easily later.
5,I love this case I have options for what ever I need. Fast shipping and with doubt an awesome purchase.
5,I am not disappointed with this purchase at all. The case fits my daughter's ipad perfectly and has the features she needs to protect her device and make using it enjoyable. I didn't attach the strap but what a genius idea. The kickstand in the back is sturdy and simple to use. All of the ports are covered. The case comes with two options for the front piece: one with a screen protector and one without. The handle in the back is large enough for her to hold it securely. Also it's pretty.
5,I bought this case to the iPad to my kid in school I read a lot of reviews but here is my honest review I love it!the case is everything proved shock throw and I see  a lot of kids taking the iPad and well kids it cames with instructions real clear  with a screen protector but it depends how we feel comfortable with but in my case I bought separately Glass screen protector the case provided two choices the one that came with case but if you don’t feel secure you can add glass protector that is not to expensive for the price of the case and comes with another plastic frame that you can  replace.  I will give more than 5 stars I Highly recommended. I’m very pleased with the case
4,I work in the HVAC field  out at customers  sites every day. Our company issued us iPads lately and most of my co-workers got ones with keyboards. I ordered a keyboard one and found it flimsy and slippery so I exchanged it for this. Much happier. I got mine in bright orange which makes it easy to find. It has a handle on the back and also the strap. I can put the strap over one shoulder and the iPad under the other arm and it stays in place.
5,I bought this to protect my iPad for my 4 year old granddaughter who is very tough on it. Love the stand carrying strap. The instructions to put it together were very helpful too.
5,Awesome 👍
4,I purchased it for an ipad I recently purchased. It is great for protection. My only complaint is that it is difficult to feel the side and top buttons on the pad.
5,This is a great case and an excellent value. I replaced my Otterbox case with this one.  I work in construction and have to carry my iPad in the field everyday. This case is more versatile than my Otterbox.  The strap and stand can both be used without having to modify anything.  I had to remove the carrying strap from my Otterbox case if I wanted to be able to use the stand.
5,I loved the first impression it came with tools to self secure the product. I feel happy that it’s a good quality purchase
3,Update ** 8 months later ** the silicone charger cover came off.  Most likely due to constantly having to be pulled to put the charger in.  The case around the button has cracked.  Which happened after the silicone piece broke off. Wish it would have lasted longer than 8 months.It is a good case.  Seems very sturdy so far.  Only reason I gave it four stars is because the silicone to cover the charge port is a bit flimsy. I feel like after awhile the constant pulling it up and down will cause it to tear off.  My toddler uses my iPad lot and this case keeps it from being destroyed which is a major plus.
5,It was a gift for my little brother i looked up the model this one popped up i took a quick look right away i liked that it was bulky but not to bulky it looks like it can take a hit comes with two scree covers( one with the protector on it one with out) my brother likes the one with out the protector the colors are nice i got the blue one
4,I ordered this case for my 6th Gen iPad and it is sturdy and does protect the iPad. The screen protector it comes with is not what the description states however it does come with another cover to allow you to purchase your own screen protector which is a good option. I would prefer it to have a wider rotating stand and no hand strap-it gets in the way and when I place the iPad on a flat surface it does not lie flat. It was easy to install and the material is good quality and the purchase cost was great!
5,This product is amazing esp having young kids
2,Kickstand is difficult to lock in place and most times even after locking in place it will collapse and fold back in. The case did offer good protection but we’ll be returning because it’s not worth the money in my opinion.
4,I love most of the features listed but the one downside odds the kickstand only locks in one position which is too low for video calling. It’s an up the nose position which Is okay for creating a crick in your neck.
4,I was looking for a case that can protect my ipad air2 and found this. It came earlier than expected. Its pretty easy to put together and looks durable enough to withstand side bumps. The straps are an interesting addition to this case for people who likes carrying their ipad around without a bag. I like the stand which makes it easier to read my ebooks. I recommended this to a friend and he asked me to get one for him as well.
5,This is the the holy grail of cases 🙏🏽 It has a kick stand that can turn so you can hold it up either way super durable (my child decided to test it and threw the iPad across the room and nothing happened) and it looks sleek. Would def recommend 🤗
4,I use fingerprint id and it can be hard to get your thumb on the button correctly.  If you decrease the chamfer angIe to make it wider it would be better..  Would also like to be able to remove the hand strap without having to do so permanently.  the attached screen protector doesn't lay completely flat so it produces variable glare.  Id really love a tan and a dark red for colors.
5,Bought this for my daughter which she is 10. She loved it and I happy with how secure it felt and has been so far. Shipping was on time and product has been as described. All the feature I wanted for her and a fair price. Will buy again from provider on ither items
5,I like this case. I have large hands and was worried about my hand fitting in the hand strap. It fits my hand comfortably but slightly snug so that it does not move. It sits at a great angle to see the screen. I also like the 2 bezels included. One has the protective screen cover like an Otterbox. The other bezel is an open face so you can touch the screen allowing you to place a glass screen protector or leaving it off all together.
5,The Velcro handle
5,Totally recommend. Its a lille tricky at first putting it together but worth it. I have no issues with touch screen and now my ipad can be safe from my toddler.
3,Too much rubber!
5,I purchased the neon green color. This case is super thick and has such great grip. It also has a little slot to hold my Apple Pencil. Great case great value
4,I do like how durable it is but I feel that this was the main focus on this case. I am an artist so the plastic screen isn’t completely flat which makes it hard for me to draw on my tablet. I honestly do not use it when I am drawing on it because of the screen covering and it is a little bulky. But I think it’s perfect for traveling with. I just wish the plastic cover was more secure and not so flimsy so I could enjoy my tablet in its case.
5,I love this case I have bought soo many cases for so much money for my 7 year old in the past.. This one is affordable and durable  is not too heavy.  It also come with and extra cover in case the first one breaks. I got my son's in blue.My son has drop it soo many times and the tablet still like nothing. I remember getting a case like this before paying way more.... I really recommended to you for your kids if you don't want to be replacing tables or paying crazy money to fix brokes or cracked screens. 😉
4,The case arrived promptly as promised. Very durable and sturdy. I was not overly impressed with the thin screen protector attached to the case.  Plus I noticed the touch sensitivity was somewhat diminished through the film. However I received an email from the company asking if I was pleased with their product. I explained my concerns about the thin screen protector.  I learned that I could add a tempered glass screen protector and the case would still fit. I ordered one and just put it on today. As instructed I removed the original screen protector. The case still fits perfectly. I am extremely pleased not only with the product but with their exceptional service.
5,Got a new case for my Daughter’s iPad. She is only 6 and pretty hard on the cases. This one is very nice for her. I love the color also. The color was the same as the pictures. We have not used the bigger strap we use the small size strap to carry it around the house or out to the car. I am very happy with the case for her.
4,It seems to be very protective of my iPad but the sound from the speakers seems to be muffled probably due to the hard plastic piece near the speakers vibrating. I wish it was easier to use the push buttons on the iPad through the silicone cover just a trade off for the protection I suppose.
3,Case is awesome love the durability and options to hold/carry. Also love the screen cover. Only issue I had is when it arrived the company packaging was ripped open and the case was covered in what looks like dirt grass and saw dust. Pretty sure this case was dropped on the ground the the warehouse. Hated that I had to take the extra steps to take the whole case apart and wash it dry it and then put it on the iPad since the debris would stick to the rubber.
5,I carry my iPad with me on my motorcycle and needed a case to handle some pretty rough roads. Also now my son can play on the iPad and I don’t worry about him breaking it.
3,So at first I was very excited this item looked so sturdy. It definitely is durable but the stand is not. The stand is hard to open and close and it broke in 2 days. Unfortunate because it has everything a kid needs.
4,Great case. Great price. A bit tricky to put on but good quality.
5,It is easy to hold very light weight.
5,The tv show I work on went paperless and I now have to use the script on my iPad. This amazing case is super sturdy and feels very secure on my hand since my hands fling around so much when I’m in a scene! It also comes with a strap which I have seen a few other people on set utilizing so we don’t need to carry the iPad for 16 hours a day. I may try that this episode! It’s great and makes my job a lot easier.
5,I have been buying $100 cases for years for my autistic son’s iPads which he ends up pulling apart and then biting the screen cracking it. This case is amazing!!! He is unable to wreck it or remove it. It protects the iPad when he throws it on the floor and there is plenty of space around the edges so he cannot bite the corner. This case has been a lifesaver!!
4,Velcro wore out was to fast other than that it has saved my iPad from damage
3,The rubber case does not stay on right at all it always comes off
4,Fit was not perfect but functio al.
5,This is a great case! My kids can use the stand in the back to prop it up to watch shows and there is also a handle that they use to hold it and carry it around. It also come with a strap (we haven't tried to use it yet) for putting it on the back of a car seat so the kids can watch shows while driving. I think this case is sturdy and durable. Overall I am happy with our purchase and I think it will last a long time.
5,The price was good for me and it seems durable...My 8yr old says it's amazing.
5,I'm very happy with this case. I've paid a lot more for cases that didn't hold up but this one does! It's has been put through the ringer with my 5 year old. Dropped more times than I can count had spills and been slammed....and his iPad is still in perfect condition!
3,I purchased this to help protect my sons iPad (he’s very destructive). He likes it. The screen cover is very responsive to touch. The only thing I didn’t like was the charger port cover. Felt very flimsy and could come off easily. It doesn’t stay closed and thought I was going to rip it just by trying to cover and close the port cover.
4,I really like how durable this case is and I like the way the rubber sides make it easy to grip. I didn’t care for the loop to help hold it so I took that off and I like it very well without it. My only dislike is the cut out at the bottom to push the open/close button. It is to small. If you want to use the thumb or finger print to open - it’s not going to work.
5,I really enjoy the protection this case offers. The strap on the back adds great feature to hold tightly in your hand and its adjustable. I also like that it has a stand that swivels. It has the option of putting the screen protector on or off. The only issue I have is that it is very bulky and thick. Also with the screen protector you have to push down in order to do the functions. Other than that it does its job very well! It even brings an adjustable strap!
4,I like the color.  The cover was questionable at first.  It seemed to be able to come off too easily and not snap on a sturdy as I thought.  I kept it though because my son liked it.  It actually is working better than I thought it would.
3,UPDATE:  The company contacted me and asked if they could send me a replacement case.  Of course I said yes.  In about five days I received a new case.  So far so good.  One of the reasons I selected this case was because one of my students had it and it seemed very sturdy.. Obviously the first one we received was inferior.  I thought this was going to be perfect for my grand daughter’s iPad.  However after 4 weeks the stand broke and will not stand at all.  The return time had just passed.  I am very disappointed.
4,So it’s a good thing that this case with an extra rim without the protective plastic for the screen because that thing doesn’t work with my Apple pen or even with my finger sometimes because as it can be seen in the pic the plastic is all bumpy and it only sticks to the screen in one spot in the middle so I have to take that off and use it without the protection leaving my screen vulnerable to scratches but hey it was 25$
5,I previously wrote a review about this iPad case. Yes the clip did break off but other than that it has been the best case I have ever purchased.This is a reputable company who has replaced the case. Nice to see your company stand by their product
3,First off it’s a complete pain to get the rubber part aligned and put in its place.Other than that the case is OK.We’ve always used an Otterbox Defender so we’re used to that quality.  This is a cheap version of that so because of the price I’m ok with it. We’ll see how long it holds up.
5,I bought this because I was gifting an iPad to my grandma so she could FaceTime and text me whenever. I love the strap and the straps on the back for your hand. Also it came with two front faces and one had a built in screen protector. She’s had it for a few weeks and she loves it.
5,It’s perfect my son love it!!!
5,I have been using this case for a couple weeks now. It is well made and the handle on the back is super helpful since I use this for work and have to show people the screen.  The opening for the power button didn't line up quite right but the button can still be pressed. Also the fingerprint scanner doesn't work with the screen protector piece on but that isn't just a problem with this case. I have noticed touch sensitivity decreased with any of the built in screen protectors I have tried. I do like that this case came with a front piece that I could use instead so I didn't have to use the screen protector. Overall I am very happy with the purchase and would buy it again.
3,Replaced the screen on my iPad and needed a case that would protect my new screen and handle a 3 year old. So I bought this case. Overall the case is well built. However the day I got this I also got my Ipad back and had a screen protector put on. I used the case without the plastic screen because I had the screen protector installed by a professional. Within 2 days the pressure of the case cracked my screen. If you remove the case you can see where the pressure pushed down and cracked the screen (under the plastic where it can't be touched). Only reason I got this case was because it was supposed to protect my new screen. Overall its ok. Just watch your screen.
5,Great case easy to install the strap in durable as I work in construction and it's well made very good bang for your buck highly recommend !!!
3,I guess for a case for a kid 6 months is ok? His others lasted longer. The kickstand snapped n last night. It’s a little awkward with the strap as well. Trying a different one now!
4,Good and solid
5,The case is easily assembled it and makes my iPad feel much more secure and the built-in stand it’s quite handy.
5,I bought this cover to replace a different cover that didn’t have all the protection I required.  I simply love this cover here.  I can handle my iPad with ease using the hand grip.  The kick stand is sturdy.  My last cover was terrible with letting me take pictures or video chat because it kept covering parts of the camera (it was cheap).  But this cover I have now I don’t have to worry about the lens getting covered.  So yes very satisfied.I will note:  it was a little task getting the cover on.  But I figured it out with the help of the instructions the package came with.
5,I really like this case for my IPad. It gives me a free hand to use the rail as I go down the stairs in my home. It also is durable if my 2 year old drops it. Also the swivel hand strap makes it easy and securely hold no matter which way I turn the tablet.
5,If I could actually install the case properly maybe I could have wrote a review based on "easy to hold" "durable" or "sturdy". It was way to complicated to assemble and the fit was terrible. My husband and I tried get this case lined up for 30 minutes! I just gave up. Since I can't return ill just donate it to person who has time to figure it out!
4,This case was easily assembled and looks like it’ll hold up well. The color in the picture looks red whereas the case is almost iridescent orange... like road cone orange... a little disappointed in that. Oh well.
3,I got this for my daughter for distance learning because her class issued case did not have a stand. Honestly I don’t really care for it. The strap had loose threading and we ended up taking it off. It was in the way anyway so I guess that’s fine. But the main reason I bought it was for the stand and it’s pretty low quality. It only offers one angle and it collapses with the slightest pressure so if they are trying to push the buttons which are much harder to get to now the stand collapses and it falls down. The viewing angle isn’t ideal for Zooms so I’m having to prop it up anyway. Wouldn’t really recommend it and I’m not convinced it’ll protect the ipad much either.
5,Love this case I bought my son an iPad and I needed something that was going to make it through his hands. Literally this case is everything it come with a hand holder a strap for car rides (genius) a strap to carry while walking or activities this is an all in one. Not going to lie at first I thought I wouldn’t need all the different straps but we’ve literally use all of them and we got the case about a week ago. Definitely a must have !
5,Great Product and received super fast.
5,Easy to handle/use. Feel much more comfortable knowing I can’t crack the screen if dropped. Number one reason for purchase
5,I purchased this for my 11 year old granddaughter. She hasn’t owned it long but we are very happy with the options. We bypassed using the included screen protector and installed a different one then put the 6th gen iPad in the case. The wrist strap slash kickstand disc works great. The loop for the pencil expands well enough to accommodate the Logitech pen I purchased as well.  My granddaughter is ecstatic about the strap and the color. This case really put the frosting on the iPad purchase. I feel confident that the case is securely protecting her iPad.This item was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect shape.
5,The case is sturdy and looks good!
3,I use my iPad for work and I wish the hand area was removable so it would lay flat on a surface. Other than that it is great.
5,I like the way it looks! Great case for our 8 year old! It truly protects the iPad
3,I originally bought this ipad case in October 2020. My son can be pretty rough with his ipad and this did a good job of protecting it from breaking. I did use a tempered glass screen protector along with the one included with the case.  I ended up getting another case for another ipad. Firstly now there is a message saying the case is not compatible with a tempered glass screen protector. Also the screen protector that is included is a weird plastic and hazy (yes I did remove the blue covering on the back). I will be returning.
5,This case offers great protection for the iPad.  The iPad is primarily used for my childs elementary class.  It is in and out of his book back everyday.  I don't worry about him dropping it as I know its protected. The only thing negative that I can say is the hand strap on the back does not allow the tablet to be placed flat on a table.
5,Item arrived right away. The case was better than I anticipated. It not only came with plastic protector cover but it came with another cover that does not have the plastic film which is really nice because I have a screen protector already. Love the strap.
4,I didn’t like that the holes were not covered to optimum coverage of the iPad.  To keep elements out like dust or water.  I know it’s not water proof but I was expecting the holes to be covered.  Other than that the girls really love it.  It was very convenient while we we’re traveling.  Being able to hang their iPads around their necks kept their hands free to roll their carry ons.
5,I needed a durable case for my iPad  just be warned though they clearly state in the instructions remove plastic from the case first for the screen protector it's a very very durable case
5,I love my new case I just had a knee replacement surgery and can carry my iPad around easily with my walker and bring outside without worrying!  For the price I paid it turned out to be even better than expected!
5,very good product and as advertised
5,I absolutely LOVE this case! I purchased the black/blue case for my 4 year old son and it was definitely worth it!!Perfect fit. Easy to hold and handle. My son loves the different ways he can carry it around. Even when in the car and on road trips he attaches it to the seat headrest and watches movies that way... I will definitely be purchasing this item again when it’s time to replace the item.. I purchased this item December of 2019. It’s been a month with this item and so far so good! I have nothing bad to say about this item whatsoever 🙂
5,THIS IS PERFECT IF YOU HAVE LITTLE POOPS AROUND MY NEPHEW TOSSES MY IPAD AROUND SO THIS IS GREAT ! ONLY THING THE SCREEN PROTECTOR IT COMES WITH HAS A WEIRD TEXTURE SO IT LOOKS OILY IT BOTHERS ME ONLY A LITTLE BUT MEH MINOR DETAIL IT DOES THE JOB OF PROTECTING THE DEVICE ITSELF
5,My husband really enjoys this case. It is very durable and easy to apply. This is a very good investment.
4,So far we really like this case only had it about a week but it seems like good quality I especially like the screen cover that comes with it wasn't expecting that but it is very nice. Only giving 4 stars because we haven't used it that long and are not sure about durability.
5,I actually ordered this by mistake. I saw on I liked on Amazon that was near this one and saved it for later. I went back the next day to order it and accidentally chose the wrong one. However I really like this case and wouldn’t trade it now. I don’t use the fold out stand much because the angle isn’t real comfortable. I use an aftermarket stand to set it on instead. The big loop for a hand in back was not attractive at first either but I’ve grown to like it a lot.
2,The kickstand doesn’t work as designed and advertised.
3,A bit bulkier then expected was a bit difficult to put on my iPad love the handle on the back I give it 3 out of 5 stars.
4,This is a really cool Ipad case.  Its only issue is between the velco hand strap and the useless built in table stand.  The table stand too small and unstable and poor viewing angle.  The hand strap is cool but a little hard on the hand itself.  Otherwise...really COOL case.
5,This is very convenient to use it totally protects the iPad and has server Al ways to hold it or stand it up.
5,This does not affect your grip on the iPad at all. It is comfortable to hold especially with the hand strap it has on the back. The case is very hard sturdy plastic and not at all flimsy or look like it’ll crack. I have dropped the iPad many times now while standing and this has saved it. The shoulder strap it comes with is detachable and helps when lugging the tablet around so that you don’t have to constantly set it down. 5/5 recommend.
5,My toddler hasn’t been able to destroy his new iPad in the last 6 months so that’s something! Good case. We take it everywhere it has a strap. You can wear it like a crossbody or on the shoulder. The built-in plastic case is also easy to wipe clean with antibacterial wipes and hasn’t eroded at all from wiping with pure rubbing alcohol.
5,We’ve only had this for a couple months but it seems very sturdy and the handle is awesome. I can trust my kid with an iPad in this case.
5,I like the quality of the case . Love the handles and the strap. It is very easy to carry around
5,Sturdy! Rotates as stated. Very durable as my 3yr old likes to run while carrying it and has dropped it already a couple times. I did not expect to use the hand held feature on the back but it comes in handy lol! We haven't traveled much due to covid but definitely plan on using the straps for the headrest whenever we do get out. So far the only issue is sometimes its hard to pop out the kickstand without the little tool.
5,Listen there is nothing in this world that will break his iPad thanks to this case. The durability is amazing! Buy this don’t think twice!
5,I absolutely love this case. I am a real estate photographer and use my iPad for my Matterport camera. Training the newbies I was so nervous to give them my iPad because of how they treat them. I bought this case because of the long strap hand straps and stand as well as a pen holder so they'll stop losing my iPen. It's since been dropped numerous times and used for home-schooling during the pandemic by my teenager and my iPad still looks brand new. Greatest case ever.
5,Used for iPad Air - very easy to put together and sturdy
5,Fits perfect and protect very well. Love it!
5,So far so good
5,Bought this for my 7 year old it’s perfect! Case is durable and it came with all of the accessories listed in the advertisement. You have the option of using the case with or without a screen protector which is included. Great to use with the hand held strap. The carrying strap makes it easy to grab it and go. And of course the built in stand on the back of the case is perfect for viewing/playing on a table top. Well done!
2,Although I love the durability of the case I hate that the stand is very limited in extension thus causing tablet to fall over when you have it standing up.  Only one way to prop it up vs other cases that allow vertical and horizontal stands. Plastic cover requires a more firm touch when working with the touch screen.  I will be purchasing another oneGood price nice color just need to work on the stand.  Great case for kids
5,Got this a couple weeks ago. Seems sturdy. It was easy to put on and the holding strap has helped my girls not drop it. We haven’t used the neck strap but do have the smaller strap so we can put it in the car when we go on a trip.
5,I bought this to replace my leather folding case. I do real estate appraisals and am out in the field inspecting houses. This thing is great!  I have the strap on it and can carry it around and it has the little kickstand on the back so I can prop it up and use it in the office. It feels super durable and I feel my tablet is really well protected. I would recommend this product!
4,It’s a nice case. Bought for my 5 year old’s iPad. The strap is awfully long for hanging on the back of a seat will need to tie a knot or something. The screen protector doesn’t stick to the screen as it suggests. Followed all of the instructions and it just didn’t stick so now it’s a dust/crumb trap.
5,I like it because it has a 360 degree rotating stand it's shock proof a screen saver and hand strap!
4,Overall a great case for an iPad. Feels tough and durable. I’m sure will hold up to a fall. Reason it’s not 4 stars is because the part that covers the screen is not a tight fit. So when you press down you can feel the gap.
5,My daughter loves this case. I like that there are two different front options. One with screen protector and one without. They are easy to switch on an off also. My daughter loves the strap the handle on the very back. So far enjoying it.
4,Case protects iPad very well!
4,So far so good! Just received it and was a bit of an uphill battle with assembling it. However we succeeded and look forward to being pleased with it. The true test are our 5 and 3 year old boys. Looks like it will work great hanging on the back of the car seat! Fingers crossed 🤞🏽👍🏽
5,Great value for the money easy to install. will recommend it to everyone who owns an iPad 5th/6th generation.
5,Have only had the case for a month now but I love it! Easy to natal and use.
5,I use an iPad 12 hours a day in the field and need something protective and easy to hold. I have always used Otter Box which is definitely protective but not that easy to hang on to. With the adjustable hand loop on the back; it appears that this will accomplish both. I’m not sure about the durability rating because I just received it but I am sure that I will still have this case after I have moved on to a newer device.
5,Great product.
5,Just got an older iPad for work and this case fit perfectly and comes with an extra piece in case I don’t want to use the pre built screen protector great shipping as well
5,This makes my tablet look like a brand new tablet! It has everything I need in one. If I need to carry it by hand I can. If I want to watch a movie it has a kickstand. If I let my soon use it it has a shoulder/neck strap! I love this case. I like the option of it having a screen protector or the face without the screen protector!! Overall great buy and I wish I would’ve bought one sooner!!!
5,My kid is super hard on this he loves how you can hold it- rubber grips around it help with holding and the hand strap in the back works like a charm. The kick stand broke after 3 months use- I don’t think it was the case’s fault- just a careless 10 year old.
5,Best purchase ever my 2 year old can’t break the iPad!!!
5,The SEYMAC protective cases are just as described.....very sturdy.  After watching  the installation video as suggested by others the installation was a breeze.  I purchased two .... one grandson is 10 the other grandson is 8.  They were excited with this IPad case having the stand so they can watch videos while doing other things.  The  carrying handle and strap were also big hits.  The cases appear to be very durable and well constructed. The Seller gets a 10 in my book.  We received an email and installation link from the Seller just prior to arrival.  Another email to ask if the cases met our expectations.  Highly recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The product is perfect
5,I was searching for a case with a shoulder strap in order to use the iPad while photographing. This case is versatile with a 360 rotating hand strap stand and shoulder strap very easy to instal with the option of using the screen protector or not (I don't use it as I have already a screen cover installed). I wish I would have bought it earlier before my 7y old dropped the iPad and cracked slightly the screen cover.If you want good protection and handling for your iPad with a versatile sturdy case you cannot go wrong with this product.
5,Works perfectly! Fits properly and each component works as it should. Very helpful for arthritic hands! Great purchase.
3,I like the color and everything that comes with it. But once the iPad is in the silicone part doesn’t fit properly as it should.
5,This is very study and protective. Two top covers. One with screen protector one without if your iPad already has a clear screen protector.  Very easy to put on. The stand is easily adjustable for horizontal and vertical orientation. Nice carry strap on the side  and Velcro holder on the back. Kid proof. Best case I have had.
5,Unfortunately I do drop my iPad but fortunately the case really protects it and nothing breaks.  The thing I don't like about it is trying to click on things around the edges of screen.  I did find a solution to the problem by using a stylus.Instruction on how to put the strap on was not included but it was easy for to figure out how.
5,I had an Otter before for my iPad and the last time I went to clean my screen it fell  apart...this one has rubber sides and a grip on the back which helps a lot because of my arthritis in my hand...I like it a lot better.
5,I am so happy with my new case and has so many features.  Thank you so much
5,Very strong
5,I work for a beer distributor in Florida. So being in coolers much of the day and most of them has very little light the fluorescent green I purchased works great easy to spot. I'm very pleased with this product.
5,I liked it so much I ended up buying a second one for my husband.  Comes with 2 faces; 1 with built in screen protector 1 without.  I like the stand.  I use the headrest strap as a short carrying handle; less bulky than the shoulder strap.  Shoulder strap would be nice to use during travel.
4,Great cover (with screen protector). Was a little confusing why there were 2 front covers (1 with screen protector and other without). Overall sturdy and was a good change to an old worn down case.
5,I needed a case that would fully protect my child's new ipad. I love how you can choose either the front with the screen protector or the front without it. You can change it to your liking. We are getting a second one for our other ipad!
4,It difficult to push the power button and I find it takes a more seconds than necessary to connect the padding to the power button hard enough to shut on and off the iPad.  Other than that the case is working great
5,After a screen repair I was looking for a case that could withstand the rough and tumble handling of an 8-year-old boy. This case seems to be the right choice. A firm case with an adjustable handgrip in back it also has an adjustable stand. It came with a screen protection cover for optional use. Today I purchased another one for my wife’s iPad.
5,I purchased this case after my iPad popped out of the previous “heavy-duty” case when dropped by my 3-year old grandson. I feel very confident in saying this new case is much more protective!  Great purchase!
5,So far this is working great for our iPad that is used primarily by my 8yr old. Lots of ways to hold it and it seems sturdy and protective. My only complaint is the kick stand it's not sturdy and doesn't hold the weight of the unit so we just don't use it.
5,This case was purchased for my iPad that is used by my grandson for remote learning. We like the stand on the back so he doesn’t have to hold it while trying to work on school work. He likes the hand strap when he carries it through the house.
5,Our 5 and 8 year old daughters have iPads and we wanted cases to protect them. These cases are great! They come with easy to follow instructions and come in an assortment of colors and designs.
5,I’ve had far more attractive iPad covers but never one as sturdy and universally convenient for all my needs.
4,I this had a slim fold over to further protect the screen it would be perfect. However as is it's the best I've had and this is the 3rd case I'm trying.
4,Fit perfectly.  Feels sturdy.  The stand is too small to hold up the Ipad at a good angle.  If you just want a little lift this will work but not good for holding it upright.
4,Feels very sturdy
5,Durability is out of this world.Great price.Only critique if it could even be considered one I struggled opening the case up in order to separate the parts. But I firmly believe it’s due to the true durability of the product and quality.
4,It is easy to hold but  it sure how long it will last. Plastic seems to be thin around my iPad. But over all I like it and will use as long as it will last.
5,This is a great case for my child! I love that it came with 2 face plates one with a screen and one without. My child loves that she can carry it around her neck as well.
5,I got this one as a replacement for one that had the hard plastic break.  But the case worked well and protected the Ipad in it.  They also included a longer strap which I much appreciate as the last one from a couple of years ago didn't come with.  There were also tools for opening the case and threading other straps onto the case.  I am quite happy with my purchase!
5,Good quality
5,Absolutely love this case! I love the handle and how it turns 360 and the kickstand! It’s very sturdy. It came with two screen cases. One with a protector and one without. I don’t use the protector because it leaves spaces between the screen and protector which makes it hard to use the screen. Like pushing on it harder but overall I love it
5,Bought to protect iPad when grandchildren are using it and it does just that! It also looks nice and makes it easy to find.Love the pop out stand as well
5,This is an excellent product for a child’s tablet.  As you can imagine my son drops it multiple times.  It has kept the table safe.  I recommend this protector for anyone but especially if you have children!!!
4,I really like this case it makes it so easy to hold on to while going customer to customer
5,Awesome case. Bought it for my son’s iPad. Love the hand held spot and the strap fits around the head rest on my car so he can watch Netflix. Would recommend this 100%.
5,My 9 y/o son uses this on his iPad. He’s rough and rowdy and it holds up well with him. He loves this case. I would highly suggest it for any child. Between the neck strap and hand strap we have has minimal drops which is nice.
5,This has protected my sons IPad from damage. I love it
4,Great item for my 4 yr old sons tablet. He drops it on hard wood floor and tablet not hurt at all. Like the strap for hanging tablet in car.
5,This is a great case. I bought it for my 10 year old’s IPad and it fits great. I love how the rubber grips over the edge and holds.I definitely recommend this and the sellers were super easy to work with.
5,Bought this for my 10 year olds iPad. He is rough on it and drops it all the time. This sucker is sturdy and does a better job protecting his iPad than any other I have bought! He loves the kick stand and the velcro strap it was super easy to install!
5,This is a great cover. Well made durable and available in great colors. I bought this for my wife as a gift and she loves it. I do too because my wife is a bit reckless with her electronics. This prevents any accidents she may have!!  And it was a great price too.
5,I got my family each their own case. It fits well with a iPad 6 and 5. Easy to hold using the strap in the back. The kickstand is study but if your standing it up vertically it doesn’t stand tall just only horizontal. It leans back when standing it up right. We like the pen holder. Well worth the $25I do have to say the screen protector is not as thick as the real otter box one but other then that I would still recommend it to anyone.
5,Super easy case to put together. 1st attach little straps to base when  the rubber gasket in is place. Then loosen the corners insert iPad realign corners and port covers snap on top.  Obviously you need to remove the blue coating prior to snapping the top portion on to the base. Remove the clear layer (top side) after install to prevent scratching.  5 minutes tops.
5,This case is amazing. So amazing I left my iPad outside on a lawn chair in a thunderstorm/downpour and it protected it so well my iPad still works perfectly. The case was soaked but my iPad inside was perfectly dry. 10/10.
5,I like this product but it could be better. 1. The strap should have a male and female end so that you do not need the short strap when you are not using long strap.  This would also help it be more sleek and useable.  2.  The “door” for the lightning cable plugin is not great.  3. The buttons do not always work well.  Especially when trying to do a screen shot.  Rating a 5 because it is what I was looking for but it does need some refinement.
5,Easy to install super strong my pad has never been so secure. Recommended!
4,This case is very good for the price. It's very well made well put together and very easy assembly. I love that it also has the holder for an apple pencil. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 out of 5 however is because the protective screen is not completely tight. It also causes a little bit of a bad connection with the pencil near the edges. But nonetheless still VERY pleased with this product.
4,Good protection for your iPad.  But the stand could use some work. My stand broke very quickly.  I may have been just a bad part. The quality of the case is good. Just the stand not very sturdy
5,Very good quality!
5,Works Perfectly
3,This case is just not conforming to the plastic form.  I am frustrated with this case.  I have an Ipad 6 gen and I for the life of me cannot get the rubber molding to consistently conform (clip into) the plastic base on the sides.  Rubber consistently pops out and I'm just over it. I would not recommend it for use in a professional situation.  Heck if I had kids I would not get this item as it just does not stay in place.  All-day I find myself reattaching the rubber mold.  I'm returning. Plus it's just darn bulky and it doesn't fit in my briefcase well.
5,This is a great product. Replaced a similar one where the kickstand broke... essential for my Mom as she is in a nursing home and the easiest way to communicate is via FaceTime... she was so happy to have a functioning kickstand on this new holder again and loved the color!  Durable product.
5,The back swivel is very comfortable and the ease of the screen is unmatched. There is easy access to plugs. The armor has very easy to put on and works great. I give it a 10 out of 10. For the money this is perfect we use it at home and on the plane so what we needed it is awesome.
2,Within in 1 month from purchase the stand in the back broke. This is the feature I use the most.  Otherwise it is as advertised.  The frame is solid.  The grip on the back works.UPDATE: Seller contacted me and replaced the case with another style that works better for me.  They were very prompt and professional.  I really appreciate such a quick response and replacement.
5,Our son loves the versatility and we love the durability.
3,It is a great case the only issue we have with the case is the handle on the back makes it hard to put the stand out or put the stand back. The handle should be in a different spot. But all around it is a great case.
4,Would have liked a little better screen cover but it works good
5,The case is very sturdy without being overly heavy. Less than 3 hours after I got it my iPad fell off of my desk and hit the floor right on a corner. Without the case I would have a broken screen now but just bounced once and laid down. The adjustable strap and swing out stand are both great also.
5,Love the look. You can choose between a handle and a strap.
5,Great for protecting my IPad at construction sites!
5,When I got this product taking into consideration the price I wasn’t expecting superb quality but when you get this case you won’t be disappointed. I can’t emphasize how well built the case is as well as how nice it looks. Also considering how many accessories are included the weight isn’t that much and still keep a nice slim profile. Overall 10/10 for this case all around. Highly recommend!!
5,I love that it has a protection on the screen. Easy to carry and hold.
5,Let's just say this. 25 bucks for ipad case i did not have high hope as far as durability. But today I forgot I had set it on top of my car and rushed my daughter in her car seat.  I pulled out the parking lot hit 40mph and saw my ipad fly off the roof and bounce on the road. When I got it back there wasnt a scratch on it still worked and the case is in perfect condition.  Saved me alot of money. I'd recommend this case because it's the only one I'm ever buying again
2,It was the wron one and it is too small
5,I grabbed 2 of these for my kids school issued ipads. I am very impressed with how sturdy these are! The case from the school had very little protection in the back and zero for the front glass. These come with 2 front covers one with a built in screen protector and one without. Fast shipping durable and great quality. Very pleased!
5,Great case! Was easy to put on and I liked the option of having 2 front panels. One with the plastic covering or one without.
5,Very strong and protective.  We use this case at my retail job so we are always moving and bumping into things or dropping the iPad and it protects it real good.  The stand is great and is very sturdy.  Side buttons are easy to click and the strap is comfortable enough.
5,For starters its exactly what you pay for comes with cleaning wipes an extra front piece one with screen protector one without
5,Bought this so my 2 and 3 year old won't break the iPad.So far they have thrown it dropped it stood directly ontop of the screen and yet it is still not broken.The case works.
5,This is worth it. My son is very clumsy and tends to break iPhones and iPads like nothing . Bought this for his iPad and its wonderful. He has dropped it many times and it has not affected the iPad at all. Highly recommended!!!
5,This product has been great for my son who drops his device often. He loves the design and I love the durability. A great product!
4,Loved the fit  quality and durability ie has fell like 6x ... not a scratch or crack..Only the stand broke but somehow still holds up 😁
3,I have owned this for several months now. It was difficult to put together and the plastic over the face of the screen is not tight so everytime you touch an area you hear the plastic almost like a bubble popping.  The area for the home button stopped working after about a month. My ipad doesn't read the fingerprint through the plastic anymore which is frustrating. Overall it's made of hard plastic and is durable. I haven't dropped my ipad to see how well the case does on impact but would imagine it would protect the ipad. It's good for the price but I would not purchase again because the issue with the plastic over the screen and home button drive me bonkers. Will be looking for a replacement soon.
3,Just received the case. It fits my 5th generation IPad. I feel putting it together was a little more tedious than most cases I’ve ever purchased. I wish it was a little more lightweight as I bought this case in order to preserve my iPad from child’s rough manner of using it. The hand strap located in the back gets in the way of the kickstand feature. Once you pull the strap out of it to clear space for the kickstand to work fully it’s very difficult to insert the strap back into the slots and pull it back out to fasten the velcro.
5,This case is perfect for my grandson! He is 3yrs old and autistic so we needed something that would really protect his iPad and this case does just that! We can tell that he loves it as well. The carry handle allows him to take it along easily! And the color coordinates with most of his other items!
4,Love this case! It protects my iPad from drops and spills. I gave 4 stars because the back kickstand broke quickly after I got it
5,Very easy to hold. Gives multiple options for usage (kickstand hand strap etc) which makes my life much easier when trying to keep all my files updated as I go through each site at work (I build houses).
5,I use my SEYMAC iPad case for work. Works great and easy use for holding my iPad. Protection is unmatched. I highly recommend for all iPad users!!!
5,We use this case primarily outdoors in a dusty environment and it does a terrific job of keeping the iPad protected and dust free.  All the buttons that are covered still work great and the straps and handhold are really nice features. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!
5,I really enjoy this iPad cover. Holding it now is super easy and honestly I think I use my iPad a bit more now than I used to. It’s got a nice kick stand that I use all the time too. 10/10 would recommend this cover.
5,Es para mi hijo. Excelente producto
4,Much thicker case than it looks online.  Should hold up and protect well against drops but it is a bulky case
5,This case is extremely durable.  It’s easy to put on. It has a great “kick stand” to pop out and hold up your iPad.  The strap is a great feature.  Love this product!
5,Was Surprised at over all build.  Very happy for the price.  Would buy again.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Very handy for carrying around.AwesomeOnly thing I disliked was it didn't come with front clear protection for screen.
5,It is exactly what I am looking for and the Orange color was an added bonus.
4,The case is very easy to hold and seems very durable the only downside is that the screen protector doesn’t sit snuggle agains the screen of the iPad and can make it difficult to use the touch screen some times. Overall we are very happy with this purchase and would recommend.
5,I purchased this case for my 11 year old son. He’s pretty rough with his electronics. We are very pleased with this case and he loves it!
5,This is a great case — it’s well-built and sturdy and holds up well under rugged use. We’ve had it for several months now and no complaints.A tempered glass screen protector fits perfectly underneath (if you don’t use the plastic one it comes with) and my son loves the shoulder strap and handle that comes with it (as well as the vibrant color).All in all great case for a great price.
4,Good protection if dropped
5,This case was a great find I bought it for my 8 year old grandson. This case is really awesome it's sturdy and fully protects his iPad he also really likes the different options to carry it. I would highly recommend this iPad case to anyone looking for a really high quality sturdy case for a great price.
4,Daughter loves this case and the handle options it includes. Only complaint is that the back handle doesn’t fold completely flat like other styles we’ve owned so you can’t set it down flat on a table/desk. Otherwise it’s not an issue if just setting on your lap or while standing.
5,Súper resistente
5,Very nice
5,Sturdy easy to hold easy assembly.  My 5 year old Granddaughter initially had trouble retracting the stand but she got the hang of it.
5,I bought this for my daughters iPad.  It arrived fast and was packaged very well.  There was even a screen protectant layer over the plastic screen wish was nice.  It appears to be built very well.  Although I found the rubber casing to be a little difficult to remove and reapply I'm hopeful that it remains tight like that throughout its duration to prevent from dirt creeping in.  I can't review the durability yet but will update it after my daughters uses it for a bit.  She loves the different options for carrying it and holding it for doing art.
5,We bought this for our son to carry his iPad in and it is so sturdy and durable. Love the additional straps for use in the car or just to hang where convenient.  He kept the top screen protection off because it required him to press so hard to activate the screen. Otherwise we are very happy with this purchase!
5,This is like an otter box defender for my iPad. It’s a little bulky but I want to protect my device. It also has a nice place to put your hand in the back as well as a stand for either portrait or landscape viewing. Way better than the flimsy covers I’ve had in the past.
5,This case works well and is protective of the iPad. Anyone who owns an iPad knows that it can be pretty slippery at times. The case is easy to apply and the silicone rubber is easy to grip. I accidentally dropped my iPad from 3 feet when unplugging from a charge no damage.
4,Great value and product. Really good features and products. Comes with two covers one includes a screen and the other does not.  The one that is included is poor quality but still of value.
5,My sister bought this iPad cover in black for my neice and I loved it!! I wish I can give it ten stars! Anyway I bought for my son the geeen colored one As well! The think i love about this case is it comes with the iPad screen protector .. and not only that an extra cover just incase you want to use it with out it!! So worth it buy!! ❤️❤️
5,I like cases on my tablet and phone and this tablet case is super awesome to hold and carry… maybe I should look for a phone case if they make them. I like this case!
5,The colors are bright and my toddlers love that.. I got blue for my 4 year old son and purple for my 2 year old daughter! They are very sturdy my toddlers have already dropped them several times.. The stand works great as you can see they are using them while having a snack and they both like putting their hand through the strap in the back while walking around.. Overall very satisfied!!
4,This case is pretty great. Durable fairly light and offers a lot of protection. wiwish the pencil holder was more secure and protected the pencil a little belter. And It would be nice If the button Covers allowed a more solid connection to the Buttons. I take screen shots often as part of my use of the IPH- and taking screen Shots with case on requires A LOT of attempts. But overall- great case.
4,Great case that protects very well. My 12 year old son loves it and actually leaves it on! Total win.
5,I just bought this case and will update in the future:First blush this is a great case.  Seems like very solid construction parts fit together easily but securely iPad fits perfectly without any movement touch screen is responsive all ports are accessible even to third party cords all buttons work every time you press them the kickstand hand wrap and neck-cord are awesome and work quite well.One small con is the plastic shell construction makes it difficult for me to get my slightly larger than average thumbs on the home button well enough for my thumbprint to register.
5,I bought one for my mom and she loved it. I figured heck I need to try to and I did and I also love it. The stand is probably my favorite other than the handle to hold it while you’re standing up
5,My son is using this case while working construction.  He needed something durable and that allowed him to hold it securely while on a job site making notes.  The hand strap fits his large hand perfectly and makes it easy for him to carry.  He is very happy with the prodct.
5,Love this case!  The stand on the back is sturdy and the hand grip helps so much!  The shoulder strap does get in the way but I would have to take too much of the case off to remove it. Plus I use it occasionally.
5,Dislike kickstand. Purchased 4 and same issue each time. Not sturdy/durable enough for such a heavy case otherwise a good product.
5,Awesome product. Does exactly what I need and more. The handle is super nice and moves so you can adjust it. There is also a stand to stand the iPad up and it perfectly aligns with vision as well. The case is so amazing color wise and use wise. All around a perfect case. I’d been trying ones out for a while and finally found the last case I’ll ever need!!
4,My IPad
5,Love love love!!! Perfect for my sons ipad and the handles make it easier to carry. I love how they are able to use it to hang their ipad on the back of the seat in the car during our long driving trips. Plus the screen protector that comes with it!!! So happy to have bought this.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 After dropping my iPad I knew I needed a case. I’m glad that I picked this one. Great protection easy to hold while taking inventory. Highly recommend.
5,Just bought this but so far very excited about the product.  It is doing what we needed it to.
5,Bought this for my 8 year old. Hands down the best case he has ever had! The strap to carry it like a “purse or bag” never could figure out how to connect it. No instructions for that but didnt really want to use it anyways. I 100% recommend this. Especially for kids.
4,The case is  loose and bulky and frankly not very attractive but it protects well especially when my grandchildren use my iPad. .
4,I like the setup of the product as it makes utilizing my work IPad in the field substantially easier.  I’m curious to see how it holds overtime as it seems a bit thin but so far so good.
5,The grip on the back and shoulder strap are amazing. When shopping for a protective case those features really sold me. Handling is easy and with grandkids it’s a big plus just knowing the IPad is safe and secure at all times.
5,We have a delivery business and our drivers use iPads for their jobs - these things get put through the ringer and this case holds up great.  We've had it for about 3 months now and there have been no issues at all.  I'm very satisfied with this product and when we need to replace another case we'll definitely get one of these.
4,Love the case  very easy to get the IPAD into it.  The only issue is the plastic screen cover is very flimsy and its causes issue with using the touch screen.  I tore off the plastic screen cover that came with the case and purchased a much nicer screen cover that really did not add that much to the cost.
5,It’s easy to hold and my son can wear it around his neck whenever we’re out running errands
5,I was very pleased with this case.  It seems well made and affords good protection.  A nice touch is that it comes with 2 options for the front one with a screen protector and one without if you already have one installed on your iPad.  I like that the hand loop on the back swivels to accommodate portrait & landscape viewing.
5,I’m a new iPad user for my business and I couldn’t leave it unprotected so after browsing amazon I took a chance with this case. I love it it’s easy to install just follow the instructions long video if you’re a visual learner like myself. I got the royal blues case...  the only drawback is my screen cover has a blue tint to it and I’d rather it be clear but otherwise it doesn’t outweigh my overall satisfaction it’s the product itself. Not sure if the other colored cases will have the same thing the black case looks to have a clear screen from the video.
4,I think this should be better by having the rubber around the iPad lock in better cause when you grab hold of the rubber it comes  off of the iPad and it’s really a pain to have to put it back together.
5,Love my new case. The velcro  strap that goes around your hand is really handy. Would highly recommend. It was a great buy.
5,I’m so glad I came across this case. It’s durable lightweight and even comes with a screen protector if your iPad doesn’t have one.  Most importantly it withstands my 4 & 5 year old. Highly recommended!
5,Bought three of these for elementary hybrid learning.  The cases are fantastic!  The blue light blocker was difficult to both see the screen & use the touch screen capability; so the kids took those off.  But I’m very happy with the sturdiness hand strap and stand. Great purchase!
4,Nice iPad case. I like it.
5,I liked iPad cover very much but when you peel the protective plastic off screen it leaves a grainy look to screen.  We have tried cleaning screens but still get grainy look on screen.  Is there anything that can be done about this?
5,I used this case for my iPad. It is very durable and nice looking case. Previous ones I used the plastic chipped off. This one is easy to use and will and should last a long time.
3,Case is sturdy & offers good protection. Handle is a nice touch & prevents hand cramping from extended use. The case does make it a bit awkward to press the power button properly & the protective screen was not useful as it does not transfer touch to the screen properly but on the whole the case does what is needed.
5,I'm a docent at my local museum and I wanted to be able to show student visitors relevant images on my iPad without having to hold the device in my hands. The SEYMAC comes with a shoulder strap in addition to all its other protective features. I can tell that even if I happen to drop my iPad it won't suffer any damage because it's encased in durable plastic.
5,I liked the carrying straps and the protection that the soft frame provides.I didn’t like the fact that the plastic stand built into the back broke almost immediately and today approximately 2 months after receiving it the plastic stand has completely broken.As of 01 /09/2020 the seller has replaced the broken case very quickly. Thank you for such rapid response.As of 02/23/2020 new case has performed very well. Now am happy customer.
4,I received this case and was pleasantly surprised at serious protection it provides.  If there was one thing I would change it would be the protective blue screen  cover. Because it doesn’t adhere to my iPad screen you have to press more firmly on the screen for it to respond. I may replace it with a glass protective screen that sticks so it requires a lighter touch.
5,Easy to set up stand rotates to slow horizontal or vertical viewing
5,This product is great for my iPad. I feel that my iPad is safe from damage because of this case.
5,I have been using this case for about two months. I have no complaints. It feels very sturdy and stands up nicely in both portrait and landscape orientation. It is easy to hold and seems quite durable.
5,I am happy with my case. Its so sturdy and a great value for the price.
5,Very sturdy but a little difficult to get on.
5,The perfect case for my needs. Easy to hold with one hand while using the touchscreen with the other.
5,Everything is as described great price
5,It was a gift. The recipient is happy with it
5,This case is very durable and is doing a great job protecting out iPad. The only thing I would change (and I probably could) would be to remove the plastic screen cover and install a glass one that adhesives to the screen. There is a little space between the plastic cover and the screen making us press a little harder than necessary to select certain buttons. Its a great value though and perfect for working in the field or for kids.
5,Totally love this iPad case! So easy to hold and protects against bumps as well as a fabulous screen protector! Color is vibrant as well.  Would definitely recommend to purchase!
4,I liked everything but the fact that I can't turn the volume down with the button. However I can still do it on the screen.  Other than that I like the case .
5,Loving this item. Very easy to assemble. So far seems really sturdy. Strap for had Velcro adjusts to different hand sizes and the stand holds well.
5,I got this case because the glass in my ipad has separated from the insides a bit. I can’t get down to the repair place at the moment. So I thought why not give this a try as it seems to encase the iPad completely. And it does. I’m really pleased to have found a way to keep using this little stalwart info keeper and dispenser of mine.
5,The case although very nice did not fit my IPAD however it did fit my granddaughters so it was not a total loss. I did find a case that fit at Walmart and it was cheaper and fit perfectly.
5,I love this case better than any I have ever had. It is very sturdy and easy to hold. I feel better about my grandchildren playing on my iPad with this case.  The color is great too!
5,Case was just what I was looking for for my autistic brother. He loves his iPad but we are often concerned that it will fall and break. This case makes it easier for him to hold it while also adding protection.
5,I like that it holds the ipad pretty snug and has multiple features to prevent dropping it like the hand holder on the back with a strap and you can spin the ipad to be comfortable to use and hold at the same time and the strap around the neck that has clips to take off if not necessary.
5,Fit very well thanks I recommend it to anyone who needs a good case heavy duty. I gonna but another one color pink for my sister and the black one for my brother. These are good presents for them but we will see how they gonna take care . I bought another one but pink!!
5,It stands out and works great. Better than them big company ones.
5,Best thing for my wild on the go messy eater 8 year old! And I put it on after she broke the screen and it has still kept it from cracking any more been months that it has survived and still going
5,My daughter loves using her case. She is 5 and it’s very easy for her to hold and use. I feel confident that if she were to drop it the case would make the iPad safe. Highly recommend as I will be buying this case for my son once he grows out of his rubber case.
5,Love this case! Very durable perfect for my 7 year old. Love the stand and versatility of it.
5,This case took me a little while to install but you honestly just have to read the Instructions thoroughly. The case is great. My son loves it and the swivel stand on the back is ideal for various views. Great buy and great price! Very satisfied!!
5,My 8 year old LOVES this case. It’s been dropped a few time- case is super protective. He also loves the strap in the back for his hand and the stand.
4,I like it except the top layer does not lay completely flat. It’s loose and makes it awkward when your trying to design something.I though that maybe I just got one that was not made correctly however I purchased 2 and second one also has same issue. Other then that I like it.
3,I guess it’s a decent case but it’s just feels so cheap to me. The plastic underplays and then the super flimsy rubber. Time will tell if it holds up while my kids use it but I anticipated being around the same price as unicorn beetle cases and others like it that it would’ve been a sturdier build which it’s not.
5,It just didn’t seem to fit mt iPad quite right
5,Great product. Recommend buying.
3,Not very easy to hold the instructions weren’t very clear I struggled for over 45 min try to put it together and the weird plastic  film is bad so I don’t use it on mine I couldn’t figure out the strap event though I bought it for that and the stand is in a weird position where i have to unfastened the hand thing and then pull out the stand
5,Sturdy case at a decent price.
5,Love this holder. I like that I can set my ipad upright or sideways with the stand to read and also with handle strap on the back. The only negative is it is so much thicker it does not fit in my lunch bag as well.
5,Fué  un regalo para mi nieto de 7 años
2,Durable product but the smell of the rubber shell is awful! I had to wash it in the sink and spray it with a cleaner and I still can smell the odor. Just having it near me makes me nauseous.
5,Really good product.! It adapts to you hands size and the look is amazing. My kids already drop the IPad a couple of times so test passed !
5,We got this cover to help childproof our family ipad- so far it's been great!! I love the option to have a plastic over the screen or not. Easy to install lots of proping or holding options (handle and strap) included. Happy we made this purchase.
3,Great color and perfect fit for our iPad 5th generation but the kickstand is VERY stiff and hard to pop out. This case is for my 6 year old for remote school learning purposes and he needs to be able to prop up his iPad for Zoom meetings with his class.  I am constantly helping him get the kick stand open. Sometimes it is so stiff I need to pry it open with a screwdriver.
5,I have purchased 3 of these - Sturdy easy to carry love having the neck strap - I’d highly recommend this product!
1,This is total rubbish! The rubber cover is held on by tabs that don’t stay in place. The rubber corners and sides fit in place but the area in between the corners and the side don’t have anything to hold them in place. Wouldn’t recommend only glad I didn’t pay for the expedited shipping.
5,We ordered two of these for my kids iPads and have been very happy with them. They look great and they can withstand just about anything a kid can throw at them. Also really like the stand for watching shows. Great purchase!
5,i bought this for my sons ipad. i love and so does he. we originally had an otter box case but it was time for a new one. this to me is close to an otter box. i love it.
5,This case is nice only had it for 2 weeks now.Fits iPad 6th gen great.The only thing is it does come with a plastic screen cover attached to the top of the frame  but it does not fit properly has buckels in it other then that it works great. I will be purchasing a glass screen protector to cover it.
3,Unfortunately the case broke on the first day. The screen protector broke on the first drop. It comes with 2 front pieces. One that has a screen protector and one that doesn't. The one with the screen protector broke on the first day. First drop. The the other one just doesn't stay on. This could be an amazing product if only there top had as much integrity as the bottom and rubber piece.
5,It is sturdy and easy to hold. I love that I can stand it up as well.
5,It fit perfect easy to install as well feels great to hold during a presentation. Only thing is the back straps get in the way of use the back stand so iPad just sits on table. Other then that great product. Thank you.. very pleased
5,We just received these cases for my son and daughter. They have a kick stand for the iPads can stay upright velcro strap so they can carry with one hand and the come with an over the shoulder strap. Overall the cases are really good quality and are perfect for our kids. Definitely recommend
5,I had the otter box defender case on my iPad and it broke. I ordered this one as a replacement and im glad that I did. I love the handle on it in the back and all the accessories it comes with. Worth the buy!!!! I use my tablet for work and college so basically all the time.
5,Bought the case about two weeks ago it was very easy to put on.  It works well with fingerprint I love the color and the durability. Very happy with my purchase.
5,Extremely easy to hold shock absorbing when it comes to falls. Durable and sturdy. Sometimes the stand gives but you have to have pulled out the way out.
5,Great product great price
5,We are very happy with this product it’s for my 11 yr old it’s strong and durable it also have a nice built in stand!  Thank you.
2,This thing started to break after a month. If this is for your kiddos tablet I don’t recommend it.
5,This is. An easy to use case and it has protected my I-pad and it has either fallen or I have dropped it several times  since I have the case. Would definitely buy again.
4,The clear cover is not good it does not seat well on the iPad there is a gap near home button the causes repeated typing to make contact.  I like the basic design but the clear protective cover is extremely irritating and I will tell others to find a product that this has been resolved.
5,It's easy to put together and the material seems very resistant.  It's been used by my 8 year old and so far no problems. The iPad 6th Gen fits perfectly.
5,It’s colorful bright easy to install very durable well worth the cost
4,So far the case seems great! It has withstood the handlings of a 3 and 1 year old. The only problem I have is the fact that the volume buttons are partially blocked by the case making it difficult to control the Volume.
5,Great Quality
5,The fit is perfect and seems to be sturdy enough to properly protect my teenagers ipad.Have only had for a few weeks now but no complaints as of yet.Arrived on time had option for armor glass  so it can be used with a screen protector or without.
4,Buttons don’t work through the rubber
4,Awesome product
5,Purchased for grandson when his iPad of 6 years crashed and died
4,Very protective but a little heavier than I would prefer.
5,Perfect fit and it has the screen protector with it
5,I bought this case for my teenage son - who is VERY hard on his electronics. This case has been put to the test and it passed with flying colors. It’s durable easy to put on and easy to use. I highly recommend it.
5,Great protection for price
5,Buy it! My toddler always took the old case off plus she’s the only one with the iPad so it’s very easy for her to hold. This case has held up after multiple drops and no damage to the iPad.
5,This case is everything when you want the best protection for your iPad best purchase ever!!!! Easy to hold and and the best  durability and sturdiness I love it
5,My husband works in roofing and has to got on the roof to take pictures with his iPad. This case makes it easier and more safe for him to do so.
3,It fell apart. The plastic cover came off and the case just was just basic.
5,Love the case! So sturdy and I’m a dropper. With hardwood floors I was waiting for the day it cracked until I bought this case. Now I have no worries. I love how my iPad it protected inside by the rubber and not just a rubber padding on the outside.
5,Little guy loves it. Broke last IPad and bought this after purchase of a few others. Felt I should shop around even tho I had to buy a few. This is where I stopped. Great product. Been a few months now and IPad is safe and sound. Handle is perfect for little guy. Velcro makes it easy to size. And is secure..
5,Great color
5,case is great live the strap to carry over the shoulder... worked well for my son with dropping... recommend...
5,Very sturdy case easy to hold or put the stand down to prop it up. Very solid case are a great price. I would recommend this case.
4,Id give 5 stars but the case is very uncomfortably heavy. I got it for my autistic son's ipad and its held up very well but just too heavy for me as I have bad wrists but he does not seem to mind it.
4,I wish it had listed the silicone parts. It seems like great protection for the iPad but not so much for kids who can pull of them silicone and then then case falls apart.
5,This was for my 4 year old and great purchase very sturdy and fully protected ! I had bought him another kid friendly one but didn’t protect and broke screen right away but this one had very good protection
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,I liked everything about this product
5,Got it for my lil brother cause his previous case was already in bad shape and he needed a new one. He likes it a lot he even chose the color. He already dropped the iPad like three times and nothing happen to the iPad happy with the purchase.
2,It does offer good protection. I would not recommend though just because the case makes it hard to press the power button in my iPad.
5,Very easy to carry and so sturdy!!
5,The case came in and was easy to install. My son has dropped the tablet within the case several times now and nothing has budged. Overall a fantastic find.
4,So far I am happy with this case. It was easy to put on and feels sturdy. I wanted something to keep my new iPad safe from drops when the grandkids are using it and it makes it nicer to watch with the built in stand. I had no problem using it with the plastic screen cover.
5,Great product. I love the straps helps me hold it better and easy to carry when my hands are full.
5,We have 3 iPads in our house and have bought several cases for them over the years. This one by far has impressed me the most! The case is high quality and very sturdy. It was quick and easy to put on and we will definitely be purchasing 2 more for our other iPads when it's time for their cases to be replaced.
5,A great product! Feels very durable! Fits the tablet perfectly!👌I am confident that this will protect it !
5,Great case! It provides a lot of protection. I ordered it before a trip and it arrived quickly and helped me protect my IPad for my trip.
4,My 10 year old likes it so far
5,Fits iPad Pro 9.7” like a glove. Took some figuring out just like other reviewers said but once on looks good and fits well. I like that it has the handle strap as it’s my 8 yr old that uses the iPad. Nice color we got green and black.
5,Besides protecting my iPad it has a place to put the pen and a strap for my hand so I can hold it with one hand and have the other hand free to use the pen or type
5,Durable convenient versatile son loves. Had another brand previous to this and my sons iPad broke twice. But with this one no problems so far. Strongly recommend!
5,For the price this is not a bad case. My son has dropped this many times and it has protected the iPad well. Now it won’t keep an elephant from breaking it. But it survives a drop from the couch every now an then. It also comes with a choice of protective screen frame or an open frame. With the open frame you use your own screen protector.
5,Works great. No defects and it seems very sturdy. I got this because holding the iPad without a case was hurting my hand. This solved that problem with the Velcro strap and the soft rubber edges.
5,I love this case! Perfect price and I got it so that my son can use the tablet without me being around! First thing he did was throw it haha!! But it’s perfectly new! The price was more than reasonable so highly satisfied with this product! Thank you guys!
5,This all around a good case. I bought one because I have small children that watch the iPad for a reward. Sometimes they are rough and drop the device so it’s important to have a durable case.
5,I am really happy with this case! I feel more comfortable and secure when I am holding or using it. It is as good as promised!
3,This case does not fit quite right. For some reason the case interferes with the use of the microphone making the microphone inoperable. When i take the ipad out of the case there is no problem. I Will need to buy a different case.
5,Very easy to hold and  very durable excellent product.
4,Great product however needs improvement on the rubber siding.
4,It has  made handling much easier
5,I am in love with this cover and so is my child. He loves all the options it has.I recommend this product 100%.
5,Very easy to hold and so far it’s been very sturdy.
5,Love this case it protects the iPad in every way thanks so much
5,The iPad case is perfect for me.  I have several grandchildren that use my iPad.  It has been dropped and the iPad stayed safe.
5,I ready like this case. It was very easy to put on the iPad. My grandchildren will play with my iPad and I feel it is well protected from any drops that might occur.
5,This case is a really good value. We use our iPad as a tool in the field for sales and photos. This case keeps it safe from debris and offers decent drop protection. We will be ordering more.
4,It will better if you can adjust the stand position to a more vertical stance.
5,The Case was not hard to install anf what i really like was that it had a own screen protector or you have a choose to use it with out the screen protector very sturdy case. And the straps hang on the tablet like a strap.
4,I like is easy to hold handle.
2,Worked well for about 4 months. The black piece that holds it broke off.
4,Very nice case minus the screen protector.  Case is actually extremely nice and useful. The protective  screen is an afterthought and is very cheap to the point of unusable.  Buy a super shieldz tempered glass screen protector and rip up the one that came with the case. The combination works perfectly
5,Very nice sturdy case. Adds a little weight but good protection. Buttons are easy to press.
5,I play dungeons and dragons so the strap on it makes it very easy to hold it and talk at the same time. The case is pretty sturdy and the kickstand makes watching videos much easier
5,Too Rugged and Comfortable for my Kid
5,I wanted a case that provided drop protection as well as functioned as a stand.  This case dose that and more.  The rubberized corners are great.  It comes with two "cover" plates one with a built in screen protector and one that allows you to use a different glass protector while still benefitting from the protective design.  I suggest your own glass protector as the fingerprint scanner works a bit better but either is very good.
5,I want to say thank you who makes these cases comfortable stylish very durable my 4-year-old son has already tested this is the best purchase this yearI bought blue and green
2,I gave this to my son (11yr) for Xmas. The stand has broken the end of March. Thumbs down from us.
5,Nice looking and very durable product.
5,Great color easy to hold. I’m a high school teacher and my husband bought me an iPad so I could teach lessons via AirPlay. With this case it’s so easy to walk around the room and potentially be hands free.
2,This was too big and clunky for my taste. Also did not fit or seal well around my ipad.  Plastic for screen felt cheap and flimsy.
5,Restaurant handheld point of sale & table orders application
5,Case is perfect! Easy to hold super durable the strap is great for nature walks and taking pictures like my son loves to do.
5,Great case and very sturdy.  I needed a case that was durable for my 6 year old granddaughter.  It’s really durable and easy to hold. I would definitely recommend this case.  It’s a thumbs up 👍
5,My step daughter is in love with her new case!!! Also I love that it comes with a blue filter! Makes me feel better when she plays her games
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,This case is exactly what I’ve been looking for. It’s super durable and fits like A glove. It was easy to install and came with two different top shields one with glass and one without for those who already have screen protectors. I highly recommend this product!
4,I dislike that the screen protector was just a piece of plastic the hangs and its not really like the real screen protectors that stick to the iPad . It would be better if it was a real screen protector.
3,While the over all case is sturdy the plastic covering the screen is very flimsy. It is also hard to detect touch for my iPad. We have to press extremely hard to get the touch to be recognized. The stand portion is extremely hard to open. We have a to find something to pry it open with 99% of the time.
1,The silicon piece was too small to fit over the hard shell. I even tried taping it and cutting small pieces to try to make it fit better (which it didn’t). Hard shell will not stay shut either. Used the case for two days and then threw it in the trash. Not worth the money.
4,the plastic shelling gets a little wonky and some of the buttons are hard to find..The plastic screen protector could be better..it bubbles up in parts..I liked that you sent one without too
4,I like that is it to hold and you can you send anywhere you go
5,What caught my eye was the rotating strap with a stand attached. Now I can use it in portrait or landscape on my table. The case and the hand strap are very sturdy. This has added weight but  I'm very comfortable with it. Priced Right too.
5,Easy to use
5,This was purchased to replace an old case that was cheap and fell apart pretty quickly.  The case came superfast is very sturdy and fits like a glove.  Will definitely buy from this seller again!
5,It took me longer than I'd like to admit to put the case on (thought i could figure it out without the directions. Haha!). Once i read the directions it was a breeze! I feel so much safer letting my 8 year old use my ipad now without fear of him destroying it. Great product!
5,It works as described. Reminds me of an outter box but half the price. Now its time to see if it holds up well.
5,Great case.  I use it for work often and it holds up against travel and in-field use.
5,Product came fast and as expected.  Love the handle with easy velcro to adjust.  The stand snaps and has easy push button to release stand.  Case is not bulky. Easy for my little son to handle. Screen protector nice and clear doesn't effect the screen viewing quality. Overall very happy with this purchase!
5,Sturdy for my 4 year old granddaughter to use and she loves the handle to hold it with its a little heavy but very strong and sturdy keeping it on for my personal use too
3,I do not like the rubber piece does not stay on the case and it's not compatible for my son iPad. Definitely not satisfied. And there were no instructions. A tiny pamphlet that didn't have instructions on how to assemble.
5,Great buy and fit my sons Ipad perfect. The built in stand is great. Very happy with the case value for the money for sure
5,I am rough on my electronics.  I have trouble holding things and need something that can survive the multiple times I will drop it and is comfortable to use.This product met both of those criteria.
4,I don’t love how bulky it is for my 5 year old but it’s very protective so I get why it’s thick. However it does make the case hard for his tiny hands to hold
5,I purchased this to protect my iPad quite impressed how adorable easy to operate fits nicelyNo problem with operating the touchscreen
5,I love this product. Price very good and durable
5,Amazing for the price. I love the straps it came with because it makes easier for travel and he can adjust it to put it on the car seat to watch shows during rides. So happy with this purchase.
5,Bought these for my kids iPads  they love the straps and the hand strap.  The choices to have a plastic cover over the glass or not is also an added bonus.
5,The case is nicely put together I don't see my son's IPad breaking with this case on it. I love the strap that comes with it so far the stand works really well. In the past we have had other case's that have cracked or the stands did not last long.
5,This product is very Saturday for a you g boy that occasionally drops the iPad! Very happy with purchase.
5,Solid value for the money. The strap and handle combo work great for my needs using it around a construction site. Compared to the Otterbox defender that I have used in the past I think it offers pretty much the same level of protection but brought so much more for options to hold and tote. Lock this purchase in today
5,I had two requirements in searching for a new case: it must allow you to hold with one hand and rotate; and it had to have a kickstand. The protection features for me were a bonus. The case was easy to assemble on my IPAD even without the instructions. I haven't tried disassembling it yet but I'm sure it won't be difficult.  Assembled it was a little heavier than I expected but certainly no game changer.
5,designed and thought out well.  everything works as well or better than intended for.  different color options are a nice touch  already got asked several times how I got one in blue
5,Product was as expected. Quick delivery. No problems.
5,Very sturdy looks cool and is versatile great all over protection for your device!
5,I like this case; but the velcro on the hand strap is NO GOOD! The case is very sturdy. My ratings from 1 to 5 is a 3 for the hand strap. I had to replace the velcro on the hand strap.
5,Great case. The long strap works perfectly for either carrying the ipad around or putting it on the headrest inside a car.
5,Bought this for my kids iPad. Very sturdy durable & comfortable in hand. It’s been “tested” a few times & held up well. Highly recommend.
4,I bought this for my grandson. For the price it is a nice case and he loved it however the clear plastic face cover doesn’t allow good “ touch”. My daughter cut it out and added a glass protector.  Problem solved.
4,well built seems sturdy enough for what I need.
5,Love this case. Just like and otter box but a lot cheap and I think easier to hold because of the handle. I also really like the built in stand.
5,Everything so far... I tend drop stuff.. and have dropped this iPad... the case saved me! You might want to look at making it easier to remove the film from screen tho... no place to grab ahold of it..
5,I bought this because my son was using my personal iPad for school during the covid-19 craziness. It has been so awesome. Doesn't limit function at all and keeps my tablet nice and safe while my 7 year old uses it like... Well like a 7yr old.
5,This case seems very good.  No major drops to prove that yet but seems sturdy and very protective.  Also comes with a plastic overlay on the screen.  So many sellers say they do and don’t.
5,Very durable and solid case. Love it!!
4,this is a nice case for my ipad.
4,The case was very Easy to hold but one of the lashes broke off and the stand broke off to which I did not find the case useful after that.
5,The product is nice it looks and operates as advertised. Its easy to install. It fit my Ipad Air 2 which I use for home inspections.Con the film that goes over the screen I thought could be clearer but it isnt bad.
5,The product works nicely! I really like the adjustable strap that easily fits over the rear seat head cushion and allows my baby to watch cartoons in the car.
4,Nice and good fit for the money
5,This case is awesome I bought it because when I go out I hold my iPad like a book so with this case I carry like a purse over my shoulder in the front and back. If you have kids and you let them play with it you don’t have to worry because the case is like an outer box it is very secure.
5,Great communication from seller directions were easy to follow to put the case on my iPad. I really like the strap on the back to help hold the iPad and the stand is easy to use. Good price and quick shipping .
5,It’s actually the best iPad case my son has. In the past we’ve went thru at least 4. They start tearing or cracking and this one is wayyy thicker! I can’t cant see it messing up unless someone runs it over
5,Love this case! I use my iPad in the field and this case is great
5,Just what you need to protect your iPad from serious damage
5,I received exactly what was advertised in a timely manner. Easy to set up and appears to be very durable. The rotating stand is very convenient. Worth the money.
5,Seems like an amazing product. Time will tell but very high quality and seems like it will last a lifetime.
5,8 struggled to put it together but my husband hand no problem. I like the little  handles.
5,It provides better protection. The only suggestion would be to make the middle side sections a bit more sturdy maybe plastic so they stay on and don’t codf off so easily.  Otherwise it’s fine.
4,I run Inventory daily. And with the shoulder strap and hand placement holder it makes very easy. I have not dropped my Ipad once since putting this on it.
3,I bought this for my son in July 2019 and it was great.  We are now in April of 2020 - less than a year the Velcro is completely done - no stick whatsoever and the little clip that allows the iPad to stand is broken.  My son is a fourth grader and uses his iPad daily for school.  IMO - it should have lasted longer than this :-(
5,The case is really sturdy feels shock resistant. I needed something hefty since I just replaced the cracked screen. So far really impressed!
5,I absolutely love this case it protects my tablet. It can handle a beating.
4,This case is great for use with kids or clumsy adults like myself!!
5,Sturdy. It looks like it will last a long time!
3,I liked the case itself with the exception of the “screen protector” portion.It’s a seemingly flimsy plastic verses tempered glass. It does not sit flush to the screen and has some waviness to it. Because of the design of the screen plastic it is difficult to operate iPad in the corners. The center area responds well to touch but as you move out from center it requires a harder pressing. It also does not seem like it would protect the screen of the iPad from scratches as there is some space for particles to become trapped inside between the screen of the iPad and the case.
5,Better than expected. This is a great cover and the price is right. iPad is well protected the stand and hand grip rotates making it easy to view at any angel. Highly recommend!
5,Excellent case at a reasonable price. Comes with a strap to slide your hand into and a rotating stand for hands free. The quality is superb with protection comparable to much more expensive cases.
5,It is cool enough for my 11 year old to use and not be embarrassed yet sturdy and does the job to keep it protected.
5,Awesome Sauce
3,Overall I like this case. It is cumbersome and is quite heavy but I feel my iPad is well protected. What I don’t like is that the plastic screen protector doesn’t lay flat against the screen. It reminds me of those old keyboard protective covers where there’s a lot of give when you press on the screen. If you view it from the side you can see how warped it is. For the price I think they could have done better.
5,I am an ESL teacher in PA. This year I am working with grades K-3. As an independent contractor I look for equipment that my kindergartners to 1 can handle. The case was easy to put on.  My students can use it without being afraid to scratch it or let it fall. I highly recommend this case if you're working with any child. Great case 🤗.
5,This case provides advanced protection two front pieces for option with screen protector or not multiple ways to carry/hold. Would buy again and again for all devices!
4,Only had the case a few days functions ok. The edge of the silicone part doesn't fit well after taking apart and putting back together.  Sturdiness and durability remain to be seen.  Like the hand strap and carrying strap aspects. Rotation if tablet works well.
5,This product really holds the iPad together and it is well protected
5,Got it for my husband's first iPad. He was thrilled with it.
3,I loved this case for the most part. It even withstood a few drops the month I got it. But the kickstand gradually started feeling flimsy and sure enough a piece just suddenly broke off this week and now it’s useless for standing on its own. All the effort went into the case itself but the kickstand is puny and am so upset that I have to buy another case just a few months after buying this one.
5,I bought this for my six year old cause I wanted to make sure it was durable. It is an excellent product and very durable. My son loves it the iPad is protected not much else you can ask for! Customer serve from them is excellent as well.
5,I take my iPad out on the job site so it's nice to know it is better protected. The strap is very convenient as well! One less thing to carry around in my hands.
4,The only problem I have is not enough variety of colors.  I really wanted plum or darker purple. The lavender is pretty but would have loved a darker color purple.  That said I love the pen holder. And the material.Easy to get on and off my ipad.
5,Kid loved it
5,Very nice sturdy easy assembly and easy to hold in hand or set up and watch hands free.
4,I really have not had and used this enough to review it.
5,The perfect case for the iPad. The hand strap and shoulder strap just about guarantee you won’t drop it but the case is so durable your iPad will survive!
5,Product actually lives up to it's claims!  Sturdy easy to hold/carry.  I use it on camping and fishing trips with no issues.  Well made and a good value for the price.  I definitely recommend it!
4,This case is used for my childrens' iPad.  So far it's held up pretty well.  It's like a less-expensive version of the Otterbox.
5,This is a great sturdy case! Seems to protect it very well. The screen protector doesn't work very well it's more of a plastic attached to the top part of the case so you might want to buy a screen protector for the ipad.
5,I bought the purple case. This is one of the best cases I’ve purchased. It’s very well made. Great quality. This will be the brand of case I purchase for my next iPad.
4,Nice design and fits the ipad just fine. Only complaint is that the built in "screen protector" is loose around the screen.
5,I have had to replace the screen on my iPad twice from falls. So I bought this as a solution to that expensive problem. So far I like it a lot. Heavy duty shock proof plastic... It is rather tricky to install though... Buy with confidence from this vendor.  ;-)
5,Fit my daughters iPad perfectly. I feel it's better protected with this case versus the one I had on it.Only thing I'm not wild about is the strap that came with it is really long wish there was a way to make it shorter. I tied a knot into it so it's short enough so easy fix for now.
5,The kids love it. The only things I didn't like is that the velcro on the hand strap didn't last that long after a month or so stopped working properly
5,This ipad case was exactly what we were looking for for our 6 year old daughter. With being virtually homeschool right now we needed something durable for her school ipad! And this was perfect!
4,This items feels durable and it fits my ipad like a glove.
5,my 9 year old son has it and he loves it because my 2 year old likes to take it n it being secured and safe. my son loves it
4,Plastic cover is thin and the screen cover feels strange. So I put the other cover it comes with and a screen protector bought separate. Fast delivery and better then I expected for the price.
5,We love this case! Keeps iPad protected and easy to carry comfortable to hold
3,Very cheaply made... the “screen protector “ scratched just while I was cleaning it... you have to be really careful when touching the screen because it gets scratched really easily. The case doesn’t seal closed there is a big gap along the side of the case I’m not sure if its supposed to be that way but it will not stay closed.
5,Great quality i love the strap on the back makes it easy to hold. I take It to showings with me and it’s nice have my iPad along with me instead of printed paper.
5,It has a nice screen protector and I love the strap this product gives me security that my IPad won’t get damaged
3,The case is nice but a headphone jack will not plug all the way in due to the thickness of the case.  The hole needs to be made larger so the plug fully seats in the opening.  The  home button cover is extremely thin and I fear it is not going to last very long I’ve had this for a week now and it already seems iffy.  I wish there were more detents for the kickstand on the back to raise or lower my iPad to be able to reduce overhead light glare.
5,Ordered this to put on my 4 year old grandson iPad and it has been a lifesaver.  Very sturdy and great quality
5,I am pleased with this case.  It fits my iPad securely and the kickstand works nicely.  It does what it is supposed to do.
5,The case works as advertised keeping my ipad safe. The stand seems to function properly.
5,I love this case so much. Having the shoulder strap is the greatest thing ever with as much as I am on the go and now I can wear it like my purse with full hands and I know it will be safe. I needed to have the kick stand so I can watch shows easier. This case actually replaced an otter box. I feel it’s actually better quality.
5,This is an excellent quality case. Very sturdy. If someone is concerned about dropping their iPad this is the case for you. A hand strap hand carry strap and shoulder strap. You can literally wear your iPad cross body while using the camera. The sellers are very professional and responsive. They are friendly and easy to work with. They helped me to modify the case a little bit for my specific needs.
5,Case fits well very versatile and loaded with features. A much needed upgrade for my iPad.
4,its a very nice case. protects
5,Great product. Does a lot good for my kids for long car rides and everyday use!
5,I love that this had a screen protector and was clearly labeled the size of iPad it was for. I had trouble with another brand being the wrong size before this one.
5,Love this case for iPad. My tween likes the handle the stand the color and the sturdiness. He knows he's not as careful with electronics as I'd like and this eases the anxiety in both sides of that issue. It has held up great. Bought a second one for another device.
5,So far this is great. We’ve been using it for about a week. It was easy to install and very cushiony. Will update as it ages.
3,I returned the item as I needed to read musi scores on Ipad vertically rather than horizontally.  It would not accomodate that position without slipping out of place.  There was no way to lock in that position.
5,I found it to be very sturdy and easy to hold. My grandaughter is using it for remote schooling & likes the stand that is attached to the back.
5,My dad loves it!! You get either a screen protector orj the open one. Basically you don’t use all the peices! Took me like ten mins to figure that out. It’s a great product
5,I bought this for my daughters new iPad Pro 2 it fits good and looks like it will protect it from cracking when it falls.
3,I don't know if I messed up when I put my iPad in but I cannot get the botton of the case(by the charger port) to close!!It feels like everything else is good except for that one section!I love the look and feel of the case. I love the spinning handhold. And if it wasn't for that one section not snapping shut then this would definitely be a 5 star review.
5,Bought 2 for my kids IPads and they seem very durable and easy to hold.
5,This case was great! Sturdy and durable! I got it for my mom for her iPad and got her the phone case too and she loves them both! Thank you!
5,Very sturdy!  Easy to use and it was easy to put on my iPad.  Love the shoulder strap and the built in stand too.  All in all a very good purchase.
5,I bought this case for my son’s iPad. It looks and feels sturdy and I think it should protect it from damage. I already had a tempered glass screen protector on his iPad so I used the cover without the attached screen protector. Happy with the purchase.
5,Great case.  Great price.  I was not expecting the quality for the price but I am very happy with this case.
5,Amazing case!! Comes with multiple hanging straps. The kickstand and hand strap are very useful. If you want a durable and functional case - buy this one. You won’t be disappointed. I searched forever and this is the best. I would recommend purchasing a screen protector though.
5,My son really like this item
5,Nice case for the kids iPad
5,This case ended up being better than what I expected. Very sturdy and the silicone bumper fits snugly to the hard shell case. The handle is definitely very useful as is the kickstand. My only knock is that the screen protector isn't tempered and so the screen doesn't properly respond to touch.
5,This is a very sturdy easy to put on case. My son loves the strap on back making it somuch easier for him to hold and carry around without dropping it.
3,Loved the product for our young son.  However the rotating stand broke and we have only had it for 3 months.  That is not longevity.  The stand needs to be easier to open and close and the housing should have a single pin that goes across the entire length of the prop piece.
4,Perfect fit for my iPadA little difficult to hold case to heavyBut all in all a great product
5,i like it
5,This is best IPad case I have ever owned.  I would recommend this case.
5,Great quality and I can find my tablet all the time with the vibrant colors!
5,Love this case with the shoulder and hand strap. Fits perfectly and very durable!
5,This is a very well made and durable iPad case. My daughter has autism and this is to protect her iPad being used as a communication device. It protects it very well and I don’t have to worry about the case falling apart. Highly recommended!!
5,Got this for my husband and he is very satisficed with it. He uses it for Zoom meeting since now that is the thing to do.
5,Great product. Love all the accessories that came with case like hand strap shoulder strap kickstand etc
5,Sturdy easy to install.
5,excellent quality strong light attractive
3,This is no reflection on the seller. The product seemed great until last night when the stand that holds the iPad up broke. We haven’t had this product for even a year and that part already snapped? So basically the product is useless because now we have to prop the iPad up with books to keep it upright when using it.
5,Just as described very sturdy and well made. The ultimate protection and versatile. User friendly for almost any situation.
5,Easy to hold and very sturdy. Logan’s be the variety of colors.
5,I love the case but I got mislead by that it would come with a pencil so it made me a little upset
5,Kickstand hard to use with handle but is perfect for a child to carry and is durable..even comes with extra parts for breakage
5,Nice case easy to hold my daughter loves it!
5,This product is great easy to hold and very durable will buy this for my new iPad
5,Shockingly durable for such a cheap case. I dropped my iPad from the top of a telephone pole while hooking up coax cable. Took nearly a 20-foot fall into the dirt and much to my surprise didn't even have a mark on it and worked just fine
5,It’s handy secure and works very well for my needs!
5,Protects which is what I wanted it for!
5,It’s a great case with lots of cool features. Not sure how long it’ll last for a 2 year old  if we really like it and like hat it came with two faces one plain and the other with a built-in screen protector
5,Bought the case for my daughter. It is sturdy and snug around the iPad. Which for a 10 year old is perfect. The straps are really nice for long car rides she hooks it to the seat. She takes her IPad everywhere now and I’m not worried about it breaking!!!
5,Got this for our 6 year old grandson. He’s never had an iPad before so I was worried that he would be rough on it. This case takes the worry away!
3,I like the cost but the stand that it comes with is not durable for everyday use.  I've bought 3 already and on 2 of them the stand didn't last but maybe a month before it quit locking to stand.  Won't purchase again.
4,Have had this iPad case for about 2 weeks and so far so good. Seems very sturdy and protects the iPad well. And the kick stand works well when using FaceTime. Really pleased with this case so far!
1,My 3 year old had his iPad in this cheap foam case for like 2 years totally fine but then I seen this case and it looked more secure and able to take a beating from a 3 year old better than the foam one but now I regret that lol he dropped it and a small Crack formed then it spread like crazy and is un usable now so would not recommend sorry
5,Love this case! It is perfect! The multiple options of the stand and the loop to hold my Apple Pencil are great additions!
5,Got the teal case for my daughter iPad. Strong sturdy and most of all protective. All around a solid case. Came with tools to help with installation and if ever needed to uninstall. Also came with strap which adds endless possibility’s.
5,Great product easy to install and seems to take a beating
5,Right off the bat you can tell this product is made for longevity I got this for my kids IPad and it’s built for durability. Dropped it a few times to see what happens and it works.
5,This case seems to be a good fit for the application so far. In process of using and testing them out for company units in work field scenarios. Hoping this will be just what we need.
5,Got this for a gift to my grandmother and she absolutely loved it!
4,The only issue with the case is that the cover over the power plug has already ripped off.  Since I am not concerned with being water tight it should not be an issue.
4,The screen protector does not fit snug. At times touching screen has to be firm
5,Sturdy and durable is what I was looking for and found it in this product.  Carrying a tablet around a warehouse all day takes it toll on a product but this has proven itself beyond expectations.
5,Easy to hold would like front cover to be a little more sturdy but do like the stand and strap for easy carrying.
5,Ive droped my ipad twice now and its been protected :)
5,This case fit my gen 5 IPad like a glove!! I’m vary happy with the case
5,Before I placed my Ipad in the hands of an energetic 6yr old I bought the same case her classroom teacher swore by. It is fantastic and sturdy. I highly recommend it to parents.
5,Great product! Perfect for high impact protection in iPad 5th gen.
5,Perfect case for my niece! Very durable and love the color!
5,My boys are rough on this but it is holding up great.  They’ve dropped iPad at least 6 times now and it is fine.  Very sturdy  protective case.  It is heavy though  but I love how it can be propped up with stand.
4,The screen cover is loose and looks warped because it is so loose. Other than that it is great
5,We really like this case for our kids. It's sturdy and very durable!
5,We LOVE this product.  We purchased them for use in our property management office to make our ipads available to our resident's to use.  Of course we wanted our ipads protected and these cases are perfect for that.  Everyone loves the handle in the back for easy use. I highly recommend these cases !
5,We bought this for our daughter with disabilities.  This type of case let’s her take advantage of learning apps without damaging the device. Very durable and easy to carry.
5,Easy to snap together good thing as you would need to go online for directions 🙂Love itBuy itYou won’t be disappointed
4,Used it for daughters ipad
5,Haven’t dropped my iPad yet ( hope I don’t! ) but it seems sturdy & will hold up if dropped. Gives me a little more ease as before  was always worried I would drop it or someone else would.It feels comfortable holding it & little more confident.
5,A gift for the wife a handy device holder with versatility i was looking for. The variety of color choices was enough. Her favorite was purple and she truly like it.  This is a perfect gift. Thanks.
5,Durable easy to put on and to hold! My son loves it and so do I!! Will buy again
2,This looked like a great covered and my husband was very excited about ordering it.  It arrived with very unclear instructions and lots more parts to assemble than anticipated.  I must have gotten something very wrong because he struggles with it every day.  I would NOT recommend it unless they fix the instructions.
3,I thought this case was awesome but then the slider bar on the back broke. The pins came loose and then it didn’t function as a stand at all. It lasted a few months so I am buying a better brand.
5,Nice product for value
4,Keeps my iPad safe. Several means for holding or propping iPad. Pain to take off and put on.
5,Everyday my son reminds me that this is the best iPad case he's ever had.  That says a lot for a 12 year old boy!
5,Fantastic quality!  Love the ‘holding’ and ‘stand’ options!!!  Best bang for the buck!!!
5,I liked the case very much. Easy to install works great durable enough for the great grand kids to drop and not damage my iPad
5,My two year old granddaughter loved it especially the colors
4,Upset that the return window was so short. I bought 2 and can not use them as I bought the wrong size...
5,For my kids who can be rough with things. This is a super sturdy easy to use case
4,My only complaint is the weight - it’s more than I like when traveling.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 So this is perfect it even can with a second fram just in case you already have a screen protectorVery nice and easy to set up
5,I am very happy with this case. I love the adjustable hand strap in the back 😍
5,For the price this case is more solid than I expected.  The spare top cover without the film was a nice extra touch.  Totally happy with this purchase.
5,heavy duty cover for my often dropped i pad. great stand for reading.
5,I love how shock proof this looks and great feel. It came earlier than expected.  I love that it cam with a strap and tools. Plus an extra faceplate one with screwed protection and one without..awesome buy.
5,Very nice. Really like that it has the handle in the back.
5,I bought it for my daughter iPad so far she is happy with it. She can carry it to wherever she wants and with not worry of a slip. The materials look durable and are reliable.
5,Love how easy it is to hold. The great protection it offers.
5,Great product and quality! Exactly what I needed for my 4yrs iPad! It has two front faces one with built in screen and other without!
5,I totally recommend this case. It's very durable and easy to put on. I love the swivel handle and the strap. I bought it prevent my daughter from dropping and tearing up my iPad. It has not been dropped yet.
3,I bought this product because I wanted a protective case that could also stand vertically not just horizontally.  I have a similar case (without the kickstand) for my phone and love it (Unicorn Beetle).  Unfortunately as other reviewers noted the protective plastic screen doesn’t rest on the iPad directly so screen interaction is annoying.  I also thought I could ignore the strap on the back but it is more aggravating than useful.  I have ordered a replacement folder style case.
5,Came broken
5,My son LOVES this case.  It's tough good looking and is a perfect fit for his iPad. It's well designed so Dad likes it too.
5,So easy to put on iPad.  Watched video and presto did it.
5,I’ve only had this product a week but so far my 9yr old loves it. She says “look mom now I can carry other stuff without worrying about dropping my iPad!”
5,I love this case! Extremely happy with the quality. Just what I wanted a bulky case. Also  received an extra screen protector which I didn’t expect. 😁 would definitely purchase another to give as a gift.
5,Really Really Liked this case for my sons iPad! Highly recommend
5,Love my new iPad case! Sturdy and easy to hold. I like that you can stand it vertical or horizontal and I love the pencil holder!
5,Comfy grip and easy to put on. Works well.
5,We bought an iPad for our 18 mo. old granddaughter to use as a learning tool (and entertainment).At 18 months she is not the most careful child but this case has saved the iPad from certain death on more than one occasion.Thank you!!
5,Bought this for my grandson he loves it
4,Durable for a toddlers hand comfort to a mother’s mind
3,We just bought this two weeks ago and the stand broke unfortunately. My other daughter has a similar cover and it still works. I’m disappointed that it broke as we like how sturdy it is.
5,Great product but I used my own screen protector. It gives user the option of using a cover that comes with it or their own.
5,The color options are great! Excellent product very durable and easy to assemble. What a great bonus that it includes a non protected cover in the event you already are using a shatter proof screen. I would highly recommend and will buy more in the future!
2,Bad design it doesn’t fit the headphone adapter
5,I like this case - it is very sturdy and child friendly.  It seems very durable and will prevent any damage to the ipad.  thanks!
5,Liked all features
5,La verdad es excelente para cualquier caso para niños o para salir con todos los accesorios que trae la verdad es muy recomendable
5,Love it rugged and protection all around. I wish it had a Apple Pencil holder on it but was not willing to pay an extra $20.00 with a different brand just to hold my pencil.
2,I am currently airing it out and hoping that the smell goes away.
5,Bought for my son's ipad and it has been awesome. Protective functional & looks nice.
5,Overall very sturdy and works well. I got it since I have a toddler and he constantly drops things. He has dropped my iPad a few times with this case and no damage was done. So great job!
5,It's nice but wasn't the right fit for my ipad.
5,It was easy to put on and seems very sturdy!
5,So far it has protected the iPad from drops.
4,I like it. The straps allow for my hands to be free from holding it. It’s suggested that a real glass screen protector be applied to the iPad as the plastic screen cover will not do the job.
5,I’m loving my new case and the color is beautiful in blue and black. 10/6/20 (edith) the back that hold the case broke and the plastic cover too. very disappointed 😕
5,Grandson loved great product still in great shape
5,My daughter loves her new case and so far it’s held up.  She likes the strap on the back for holding while making videos .
5,Best case ever. My son is kind of destructive and this tablet case really does the trick! We call it the indo structo case. He's dropped the tablet off a third story balcony and it still didn't break!
5,I bought this for my destructive child 😂 Seems to fit together and hold the iPad snugly and securely. No complaints so far.
5,This case is amazing!!! My kids love all different options for holding it and I love how it’s fully enclosed and there are multiple ways for it to set up.  I highly recommend this especially for kids!!
5,Bought this for my 9yr old who has had 3 replaced screens and had to have a full replacement iPad within a year & it’s holding up great! I’m going to order more for all of the kids iPads.
5,My eight-year-old saved up his  Birthday and Christmas money to buy an iPad  so we bought him this case. The only thing my son did not like was the optional screen protector. Other than that he thinks everything is awesome.
5,Good product recommend
5,This case is great! I love how easy it is to hold and it seems durable.
4,I like all of it. Very easy for kids to use and bring with them!
5,Me and my kids have gone through a dozen different cases over the years. This one is by far the sturdiest with the most features. Takes a minute to put together but worth it.
5,Awesome
4,It is good but the black rubber part is always coming off.
5,I like it but it’s a little bulky. You can take the handle off
5,It was very sturdy  and worked well for my busy grandson
3,I love the color and how easy it is to hold  i do not like that the ipad sits low in side off the screen makes it look like a rainbow  when you touch the screen
4,Hard to assemble
5,This is WAY better than I expected. A little tough to get together but holding up to a 4 year old who can’t keep his hands off the iPad. Great product.
5,My son loves it better than the school one 👍
5,This is a very secure case. I have small children and both have dropped this multiple times and my IPad has been safe! I would recommend
5,I use my iPad in an rugged outdoor dirty environment and this protect does a great job in providing overall protection. Also provides multiple options for holding and carrying. Very happy all around.
5,Good product
5,Products was delivered fast and is a fantastic case
5,Good made product
5,Bought this for my 10 year old son’s iPad and he loves it. It’s very sturdy and has a high tec industrial look that he thinks makes it look “cool” the handle on the back makes it easy to hold and carry. I would definitely buy again.
5,Love the stand and the hand holder. The variety of colors is great too. Great job!
5,This is a good durable case for my son's iPad. The only problem we had was one of the clips for the shoulder strap broke right after we got it. I had great communication with the manufacturer who replaced the bad piece within a couple days.
5,Love this cases it comes with two screens qnd my daughter loves it it can hang on the back of the car seat ti wach movies !
5,Great case! I am very happy with it :)
3,I like the sturdiness but I bought this because of the hand holding device....which broke almost immediately. Luckily I’m good with a needle and thread although it’s bound to break again. Flimsy
5,I really like this case! It’s very sturdy and the best features are the handle and stand on the back.
3,Great case except the flip out stand. Two issues it’s not tall enough to stand up straight and it broke off. Beside this issue it’s great.
5,Strong item Easy to hold perfect for my tablet
5,Best case I’ve ever had
4,It doesn't seem to stay snapped together but overall a 3 1/2 - 4 ⭐'s
2,The basic design of this is very well thought out and it does protect the iPad a problem I have with it the kickstand for holding up your tablet has already broken  it will no longer lock in place and I’m not the type of person to tears up my stuff so that was disappointing that was one of the features that attracted me to this product.
5,I love that this case comes with an adjustable strap that way my kids can wear it without dropping it when going out.
5,This was the perfect case for my daughter.  She is always walking around carrying her IPAd with her ( she's a preteen ) so the hand strap is great.  Can even use the handle to hook onto the headrest of the car.thanksab
5,For the price of this case it features a lot of options. My daughter whi usually cracks the screen quickly has been able to take care of her ipad with this case.
5,Very nice design. Durable and holds iPad securely
5,Product is durable and has nice features including the hand strap and stand. Good product and value.
5,I love how my kid keeps dropping the ipad and throwing it and ipad is still safe and secured
5,Very durable and easy to hold
5,Great
5,I bought this for my 9 year old grand daughter. She loves green and was very pleased with the color. Then case has a handle on the back so you can slide your hand through to hold it and a strap if you want to carry it like a purse. Overall a very nice case
4,Had for a month or so.. seems adequate in comparison to more expensive models . Recommend as of yet. Will update as I abuse this cover!
5,This case is totally awesome.  I use it on my 3 year old's iPad and couldn't ask for better durability. Plus I love the attachable lanyard. Better than the competitors.. includes a handle and a stand. Wow!!!
5,This case does not collapse like other cases do.
5,Great product! I have a 8yr old son with autism. He has a tendency to throw things. This case definitely passed his test!
5,The shoulder strap and hand strap are very nice & make this cover different than most. Great for swpecial needs individuals.
5,This case is actually perfect! It has triple layers of protection that have kept my 9 year old son’s iPad in perfect condition no matter how many times it’s been dropped. It comes with a hand strap a stand and a longer carrying strap. I’m very very pleased with this case and highly recommend it.
5,So far so good! Very happy with purchase
5,I really like this case I have bought 5 cases for my iPad and so far I like this one because it is very sturdy And I have little cousin’s that like to play with my iPad
5,Was an excellent product and purchased. No issues or complaints. Would purchase again.
5,Super easy to hold love the strap across the back
5,I’ve been through lots of cases. This is by far the very best!  Strong sturdy & easy to handle.
5,I use this for my 9.7 iPadworks great
5,Very good product extremely durable.
5,I was very satisfied with the product. It was sturdier than I thought it would be. Had two straps to carry my iPad as well.
5,Works good for my two year old granddaughter
4,A little heavier than I thought it would be but if dropped I think my iPad will survive .
5,My iPad is very safe in this product.
5,I bought this for my 14 year old son and he loves it. It's very versatile and allows him to carry it around safely but has enough protection that even if he dropped it it would be OK. He didn't watch the video on installation and put it on with no trouble.
5,Easy  to holdAnd use right out of packagingDidn't have to almsitvbreak to out onMultiple good players
5,I love the handle on the back. It makes it much easier for my son to hold.
4,Got this case for my daughters iPad and she loves it. The handle makes it easy to hold and the case gives her the protection to be free with it.
3,The overall functionality is good but taking screen shots is tricky due to the difficulty of simultaneously pressing the power and home buttons.
5,Awesome quality very sturdy easy to follow  instrucrions great value for the money and perfect fitment.
5,Bought this for my son's iPad. He loved the orange color. Very durable and easy to set up.  Appreciated the fact it came with an extra front case.
5,Super fast shipping! Durable and sturdy. Love the color!  Like the rotating stand and hand strap!
5,It’s a very sturdy case and is great
5,It's very handy and it fits the ipad like a glove. Very secure and we like the handle and the scrap in the back.
3,Like that it is easy to install and fits well. Not too happy with the screen cover that is very lose fitting and does not sit flush with the screen. Have to push in on screen protector more than what is intuitive for a person used to a touchscreen. May take some getting used to.
5,Received fast and was exactly as described.
5,It’s extremely sturdy and very easy to hold.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Different variations of standing or holding case! Great Buy! Highly recommend like otter box with style double thumbs up from me !!
5,Muy buen producto
5,Very nice durable case. I would recommend this case to others.
5,This is the best iPad case if you hold your iPad to play games. I love the back handle. I didn't install all of the pieces to make it waterproof so I can't comment on that but I really like this.
5,My son loves this case and the stand is perfect. Had a little difficulty adding the strap with the directions but I figured it out. The product is top notch. Very pleased with the purchase.
5,This case is easy to attach and adds a great deal of protection.  Very happy with this purchase.
5,The best case I've found for my apple tablet!
3,We had two of these for our kids. ipad is protected but both of the stands break pretty easily. One broke about 3-4 months after purchase. Otherwise the case is very durable and prtoects against drops.
5,Durable Case
5,Second time to purchase! My son loves this case.
5,Fits well.  I use my iPad for email data and entertainment.
5,Easy to assemble to iPad great case
5,Appeard to be very durable.
5,Finally got it together properly. Working good
5,My son is loving his new case! Can use it for everything!
5,Only thing that is a little pain is where you plug in the charger you have to pull cover up and out to get charger cable in but this is fine because it keeps port clean
5,This is truly an amazing case and hard to beat for the price. It is very sturdy and durable decent color selections and has many extra features that you wouldn't normally expect to find on a device case. Would definitely buy again but it feels sturdy enough that I don't think I'll have the need.
5,It is easy to hold and I love how it doesn’t make it heavy at all.
5,Well made
5,Perfect for my 9 year old granddaughter
5,My iPad. Fits great. Easy to manage. Good value
5,This case has thick sturdy clips several carrying strap options and the rotating stand on the back makes it easy to hold. Recommend putting straps on before the iPad is put in the case.
5,Good price and great protection.
2,I really liked this case and having spent more than I usually do I hoped it would lasts longer. Yes it's pretty durable but it seems to have more catches than I realized. I didn't complain when the screen protector wasn't flush to my iPad or when the rubber part didn't exactly match up when putting my iPad in it. I also didn't complain when the handle started fraying but I am going to complain when the stand to hold up the iPad breaks! So now I have this durable heavy case that can't hold its own weight.
5,This case was easy to install and seems very sturdy.  It is for the iPad that my grandchildren use and I feel much better knowing that the iPad is now well protected.
1,The silicone cover doesn’t fit at all; very cheap; there’s literally no point in it if it doesn’t fit.
5,Perfecto
5,Protective easy to hold!😁👍
5,Very sturdy and handheld comfortable to hold in hand and has a screen protector keeps dust out because it’s a sealed case .
5,Great sturdy case !! Only downside is screen protector doesn’t work well with apple pen but it’s still not bad.
5,Perfect for iPads. Durable and sturdy. Great price too!
5,Love the color!
5,I bought this case for my daughters iPad and it is wonderful. It’s very durable and sturdy. Great product.
3,My son bought this but was unable to play the video games he likes because of the screen. So I removed the screen but he still doesn't like having it on his iPad. Could just be his personal preference. It will be used for when we travel in case he drops his device but day to day is on the shelf.
5,Very satisfied with this product
5,It is advertised as a 6th generation but it does have the holes in the correct position.  My iPad is a 6th generation 2018 model.  This case does not fit so I will have to return it.
5,It’s durable easy to attach and remove as needed..the strap is so handy makes holding it so easy.
2,I pulled this out of the package and tried to assemble it on my sons iPad. The rubber edging needs to be removed before the hard plastic is unlocked. The hard plastic does not fit together very securely. Before I was finished getting the rubber back on around the edges it was ripped where the charging port will go and none of the rubber wanted to fit quite right. Without the rubber holding it together I wouldn’t trust the hard case at all!  I’ve put many a case on iPads but this one is probably the jankyest one ever. Im disappointed because I was really looking forward to the strap on the back and the carrying strap! Maybe I got a defective one?
4,Like the product and it's flexibility of use.
5,Bought for my 6 year grandson to ensure his IPad was protected. This is a must have puts your mind at ease.
5,I was skeptical since it’s not a main brand but it’s very durable. A little heavy. But I’d still say it was over all worth the price.
5,I learned the hard way with our first iPad and children.  Three screen repairs later time for a case.  This case is virtually indestructible.  It may never come off but the iPad is safe.
5,I love it because it’s so handy when my child want to share with my kids and yeah
5,I can go on trips and not have to worry about my iPad getting damaged in my backpack also the hand strap is very useful
5,I found it a little challenging to put together and the directions were written in a small font. I studied the pictures of it on Amazon and finally figured it out. Very well put together. Thank You.
5,This is great and very durable.
2,When it was in the case the screen was shattered
5,Fixed. Ez to use. But the intruction “how to install” is inside the case.
5,I love how well made this product is.  It applied easily and has already protected it when it slid off the bed onto the floor. And I love the color!
4,I like if
5,I had got this for my daughter for her birthday for her new iPad and she loves it. She loves the fact she can wear it around to be hands free. I am going to be getting one for my son as well.
5,Good sturdy case.  The only complaint I have is that I wish you were able to use the kickstand for both vertical and horizontal viewing.
5,Very sturdy excellent quality
4,I love the sturdiness stand and handle! I would have given 5 stars if the plastic over screen fit more snug to iPad.
5,This is a great case for my iPad! I love the shoulder strap!
5,Very easy to hold!
5,Love love love it! The color the design and how it came with a pencil holder
5,Nice case very durable easy to hold onto when I’m talking with customers the only complaint that I have is the plastic screen cover is not tight against the screen is bubbled across the screen but other then that pretty awesome case I use the strap a lot when I’m carrying products it’s light weight.
5,This thing is totally worth the money! It has held up to multiple drops and it's got a cool carrying leash thing.
5,I love this case so much! It’s like a “Otterbox” but better!!
5,It’s perfect for the ipad
4,The case is good but the part for the finger print home button is not good. It does not recognize my fingerprint
5,Awesome case it did everything I need it to do and it's tough as nails. The kickstand in the back I very convenient and I love the hand strap. Best case you can ask for and at a good price so 10/10
5,Fits like my old iPad case at half the price.  So here’s hoping it is as sturdy and durable as my last one
5,A little difficult to install if you lose directions. I bought this care for my toddler sons iPad and I must say it’s ergonomically well made. Definitely makes me feel comfortable with leaving the iPad in my 2 year old hands
5,I bought this case for my 10 year old son's ipad. He loved it!
5,Loved everything about it. great to use for outside jobs
5,Very good case I didn’t realize that they send you two types frontal pr  one with blue filter and one without protector. I bought anotjer one for other ipad and doesn’t have that option.
3,A very good case for boys ! It’s not a a thick bulky plastic screen protector but it’s super nice
5,This product is very sturdy and protects your iPad from any accidents.
5,Easy to hold
5,I like it and it’s great! My only dislike so far is the plastic screen cover I tore it off . I wouldn’t even waste time or money to make that . I think it would be just fine with out it . (There’s always those glass protectors if you want that protection)
5,Love this iPad protector. I have a 6 year old boy and needed something that is durable and can handle drops. I love that it comes with the handle and the car headrest strap. No interruptions with the iPad screen. But you can also use without the screen protection.
3,The screen protector doesn’t sit correctly on iPad causing it to not work. The plastic life pushes into side buttons causing it to glitch***Seller reached out to help with issue.
5,Purchased for my 9 year olds I pad. She is rough on electronics!! She got it for Christmas and it is holding up beautifully. And she loves the kickstand and multiple handles.
2,Pro: It came with tools to separate the case and a cleaning cloth to clean the glass of your device before putting it in the case.Con: I did not like the way the outer silicone wrap fit on the case. It felt lose and would separate from the case when handled. I found myself continually adjusting this part while using the case.
5,I love it it feels like an Otterbox for the iPad
2,I really liked this since it had multiple handles and a stand that could be rotated. It made it easy to hold and use the ipad but sadly only a month or two in the stand broke on me. It makes it a lot less useful unfortunately.
5,Love it
5,Was a gift!! They LOVED it. Nice hand strap!!!
5,My grandson loves it
5,I like the complete protection of the body and optional plastic protector as some may already have the tempered glass shield and using the both together is overkill — which must be why I chose this option!
5,Very durable!
5,I love this case. It protects my IPad from when the grandkids like to play on it. Very durable.
5,Great product! My 8 year old loves it!
5,Awesome product. Love that you can look at a video to help put it together.
5,Good all around.
5,My grand daughter loves the case and I love the durability.
5,My first order was disappointingbecause it came damaged and missing partsthe replacement came with all parts was not damagedI was very very very SATISFIED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
5,very good
1,What I liked: The carrying strap was long enough for a shoulder to hold.  The color was fun my last one was black.  My husband had it together in no time.What I didn't like: The places where the product covered the volume ^ V buttons it covers too well.  You can not operate the volume with the itty bitty rubberized "shoes" that you are supposed to use.  We tried and tried to get the volume to decrease finally slipped it back out of the case and could lower the volume  However when we put it back on the volume shot to OFF and we can not get it to move up at all.  All our messing with the case while it was on the iPad caused us to break the button connections.  Can't use the Netflix app or other vocal apps.  Makes me really mad.
5,I love the strap on this case!
5,Love love love this case for my son IPAD. Literally everything you need for a case. It has so many choices to stand the iPad hold the iPad and even hang the iPad. if it ever breaks I will buy another one
3,I have to almost remove the case just to turn my granddaughter iPad off..
5,The product is awesome except the plastic stand in the back doesn’t open easily. It is easy to charge the devise and we love that there is a long and short strap option.
5,I really like this case!  It is stylish!  Think of it as the “tank” of cases ..... nothing can hurt my iPad now. Definitely a good purchase....
5,Great product protects my ipad and has a handle and a stand!
5,I love this case! It’s very durable. It came with a handle on top and an extra long strap which are two nice carrying options! Based on other reviews I did purchase a different screen protector and the combination of the two makes the case perfect. Definitely recommend buying!
5,I bought this case for my 6 year olds iPad. It’s very durable and is just what we were looking for to protect her iPad.  It is a great case for a great price!
5,Very strong sturdy frame and easy to use. Plus the color helps me find it.
5,So far so good. Very nice product.
3,Sturdy!!!!! If you want to make sure your iPad doesn’t break than this is the case! Ours did not come with the stylus though so that sucked.
2,Broke after 6 months. The strap to clip on was so short that is really served no purpose at all. The only positive of this has been the stand feature and even that is now very flimsy. Do not recommend.
5,My husband needed for work tablet. He seems to be enjoying it. No complaints about it.
5,Rotating stand is awesome durable material I can watch Prime in bed up close and personal so convenient. I love it! The straps are fantastic!  Thank you
5,The product is great and will protect the iPad from our toddler destroying it. Love the strap for car rides or walking around taking videos
5,This is an awesome case definitely worth the price compared to otter box I love it
5,I love the color and it protects the iPad so well definitely glad I got this one :)
5,Very sturdy be aware of you want to use osmo or other accessories it needs to be removed first and it can be tricky. But otherwise it's great!
5,Awesome case holds up to my 6 year old son which many items do not hold up to him.
5,This case is absolutely perfect my grandson has dropped his iPad several times and nothing has happened to it and the protective screen is a blue tint which is good for his eyes
2,Does not fit well would not recommend.
5,Really nice product
5,Nice and durable
5,Relatively easy to assemble. Sturdy.
5,The case is very versatile in that you can carry it on your shoulder for easy transport or hold it in your hand without worrying about dropping.  It's durable and easy to use.
5,Sturdiness is good. Kids aren’t able to take off
3,I'm a little upset that the volume down button is covered up by the case besides that the product is good.
5,Great value !  Has a shoulder strap too !  Built in screen protector does not interfere with the operation of pad or pad security (fingerprint).
5,The product was exactly what we were looking for and the price. The shipping took awhile but it was worth it.
5,Very Nice and STURDY! It's very easy to hold and carry. Love the protection it provides for my iPad.
5,Great case r
5,I purchased this item to protect my iPad from my grandson who usually drops it; works great
5,Works great for my 4 year old grandson.  He picked out the color and could not wait for it to be delivered.
5,Nice protection for your iPad.  Screen protection included.
5,Great case easy to put on my iPad love the easel feature for reading FaceTime movies & more. I would recommend it.
5,Safe from kids
3,I’ve had the rubber surrounding the hard case come loose all the time. Frustrating!
5,UPDATE: Seller reached out to me and made everything better. They sent out a new iPad case and everything work as it should. 👍🏼👍🏼Nice case but this kickstand lock is already broken so it keeps collapsing.
5,Great case. Just what my son needed to not shatter his 3rd iPad. Dropped multiple times already...still good to go ;)
5,All was good!!
5,Nice
5,Perfecto
5,Easy to hold very durable and most importantly it protects the tablet.
5,The case is as described.  I like it but is rather heavy/bulky.  But any case meant to keep your device from shattering is going to be heavy.
5,I love it for my daughter it’s so durable and perfect for children...
5,No negatives for me.  Case is well designed.  Like the side strap to carry/hold.  Strongly recommend
5,This case is ideal for durability and flexibility.
5,Strong
5,Like it sits easily on table or hold in your hand. Installs easily. Love the colors available.
1,Item is described to be shock-resistant and drop resistant. My six-year-old daughter had this for ONE DAY and the strap came loose on the back and it fell to the floor. It wasn't even a high drop...but as you can see it immediately cracked the IPAD and it is clear there was NO protection from impact as the description describes. I am super disappointed as I had high hopes for this case and my daughter really loved the color etc. Her former case held up much better and protected the IPAD against any bumps or drops. I recommend you stay away and don't get your hopes up. This is an expensive lesson for me. I now have to either buy a new iPad or pay 119 to replace the iPad glass. Should have stayed in the old case.
5,I bought three protective cases for my iPad in a two day period. This by far was the best quality and had the best protection. Time will tell if it holds up to a toddler.
5,Easy to hold. Easy to put on. Seems durable and sturdy.
5,It’s a nice case and well worth the price
5,Waited to do thos review. This is a very good case for kids.  Carry strap super handy
5,Great product sturdy and the handle and kick stand are made very well. So far great !!!
4,Protective cover needs to be closer to tablet. You have to tap the tablet a couple times trying to get it to work
1,Love that it has a handle and a strap to hang it by. Hate that it broke the first time it was dropped only days after the return window closed… 30 days for returns on items meant to be durable is not great. Will not be buying this brand again. Our Beetle case lasted us 3.5yrs before it broke. Guess I’m back to buying that.
1,Literally broke on me after a few months
5,My daughter luvs this case for her new iPad. Great quality n very durable
5,Good product works great for our son and easy to hold. Good quality.
5,Very well built. Would highly recommend
5,Better than expected !
5,All good.  only complaint is the screen protection is wavy. I'm not very happy with that since I use the ipad for my art sketches.  Drawing on it is a bit funky.  Typing and reading is fine.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Definitely worth the money my iPad passed the drop test and looks pretty good too
5,Easy to hold.
5,Great drop protection for iPad and fits into a tripod universal mount.
5,I love it but I can’t get it on  perfect almost but not perfect
5,Easy to install
5,Purchased two of these for my 3 year olds twin boys. Very good quality.
5,Picture shows pen but no pen
5,👍🏾👍🏾
5,Very affordable and reliable case would recommend
5,This was more than I was expecting glad to have it
5,The case is durable and able to withstand the use by a seven year old.
5,Comoda
3,Too heavy for me but seems very stable and sturdy. Not for me though
5,I love it!! The cover is heavy duty fit my iPad able to hold and has a shoulder strap. I really was surprised how well Procter my iPad is now thanks to this case protector. I recommend to everyone!
5,It’s awesome
5,We got this for my daughter to use with her new iPad for Christmas. So far it great seems durable and has a lot of good features for holding and carrying.
5,Waaayyy good !! Get it.
5,Excellent
2,It doesn't fit well.  Pen holder is a joke.
5,Great case! Easy to use and kids can carry and use stand easily.
5,Great product for my dad to use in construction. This helps him tremendously at work so that he can use his iPad and not worry about breaking it.
5,Awesome case - especially for a toddler!
5,Gave as gift and recipient loved it!
5,Very durable and I love the kick stand feature
5,Product is great quality for the price!
5,Great quality! Great Seller. Would recommend this product . It’s completely toddler proof lol...
5,Easy for my son to carry his tablet
5,very convenient the charger piece came off the first day though!
1,Doesnt fit properly
5,This case has been a game changer. Awesome!
5,Everything I needed for a protective work case.
5,Perfect
5,Very good and solid really liked the iPad case my son loves it thank you!
5,Kinda heavy  but if you have a toddler will be perfect.
5,This was a gift.
5,Nice case for a decent price!
5,thought it came with the pen thingythe string it comes with is super long....other then that my son still likes it
1,I bought this after paying for two screen replacements during the previous school year. I figured this could be a good investment. However a classmate knocked my daughter's iPad off her desk during group work and I am now paying $100 for a new screen.  :(  Waste of money-- I was hoping it would work to protect the crappy screens they replace the iPad with- no luck.
5,Love color nice quality for the price
5,Great product and a great price. I love the fact that my iPad is secure and has a handle and a holder for my ipencil. The handle will make it easier for m to use at work!! Thank you
1,The stand breaks too easily. I repurchased thinking it was an us issue only to find when we got the 2nd one the stand broke again in the same spot. Don’t bother.
5,Case was as advertised attractive design several excellent features super-quick shipping. Recommended!
5,I’m pleased with this! Very durable and cute!
5,One of the best protective cases I have ever bought. Truly surprised at the durability. I have terrazzo tile floors and no case before this one has last more than a week. I will definitely buy more products like this.
2,These are good in concept but first off mine was already damaged as they decided to slip some collateral into the case but in doing so they ruin the cover.  Then the stand part works well but easily breaks. These are not necessarily the best ones for kids but probably ok for adults unless you are accident prone with your iPad.
5,I like everything about this item great buy
5,The product was exactly as advertised.
5,Very good product. I purchased this because my grandchildren are always using my iPad. It fits perfectly and is good for little hands to hold.
5,My kid really loves it very good I can relax knowing the screen is protected
5,Very good love it
4,Durable
5,It is sturdy and thought was used in designing.
3,The instructions suck. The rubber does not fit right the plastic  “window fits wired and is very noisy  not tight against onto I pad. Not worth the money will be sending back and finding a better replacement.
5,This case by far is the best and most durable. It’s worth every penny. It’s nice to have so many options on how carry it as well (hand strap vs arm strap vs stand ). I would recommend this case to anyone.
5,I bought this for my daughters iPad it’s very sturdy and she loves it
5,Great
5,The hand hold on the back makes it so the iPad doesn’t lay straight on my lap but other than that I love it!
5,It works rather well very heavy duty.
5,Great product for protecting your IPAD. Easy to handle and made with top quality materials.
5,Love the case except for the screen protector. It doesn’t fix tight on the screen so it makes noises when pressing down on it.
5,Great protective case
5,Love this case easy to hold and protects your tablet.
5,Terrific item very protective of i-pad
5,Works great
5,It is not scratch proof
5,Liked everything about iy
5,This was absolute great purchase! I have a four year old son who is very active (as most children this age is) and this has been a great support case for him. Definitely a needed purchase
5,It is vey easy to use.
5,This works great on my new iPad especially like the ability to rotate the carrying handle and support leg to meet my needs. Tactile is a bit loose on the screen but does not affect touch performance.
5,My son loves it and it has been amazing for my son who drops his ipad often.
5,Fits our IPad well and so far seems to be what we wanted. Looking forward to the straps to use in vehicle.
5,My son loves his new case the multiple straps are his favorite part especially since he can strap it to the head rest in my car & watch his iPad hands free.
5,Really liked this case. Would definitely recommend.
5,This is a great case screen protected shoulder hand straps and snap out stand. Looks great
3,Strap for hand and shoulder have already broke.
5,Love it! Going to buy another for my other son!
2,Despite high ratings and mid-range price this case's kickstand broke within 4 months of purchase. The kickstand is held in position by a very frail plastic tab. I would not recommend it.
5,This is as good as an outer box but cheaper. I love the straps and screen protector that came with it. Nice for the price.
4,great case!
5,Now I'm in the product is awesome a words every penny
5,This was for my dad for x-mas and i bought for his iPad Air 2 and it fits perfect!! And he loves it
4,Color and durability are great. The grip is adjustable.
5,a very sturdy case that fits the iPad perfectly. my grandson loved the bright cololr
5,I love this cover. Very durable!!
2,The prop in the back which would allow handsfree usage consistently slips out of position causing the ipad to fall over.  It initially held fine but after a month and passed the return date it stopped holding the ipad upright all the time.  It's an awkward set up at best.
5,My son years dead for his ipad. It is the best protection you can get. I recommend it to anyone who values not to break their iPad!
5,If you are accident prone or have kids who could potentially be hard on your iPad this cover is your best bet.  I've had other covers but this one is the best I've had so far hands down.
5,This case is for an iPad used by a toddler. It’s perfect!
5,Use this for work. Easy to carry especially  on construction sites
5,The added weight I knew it would add it's just a fact
5,Very very good price the plastic screen cover is pretty much aggravating but they give you an extra replacement frame without the plastic so it works for me !
5,Sturdy
5,Pleasantly surprised at the sturdiness and thoughtfulness of the package. For those who have a screen saver on your iPad an extra top is included without the plastic screensaver. Fits great.
5,This item is great for kids especially with home schooling.
5,The color stands out so you don’t mislay your iPad.  The construction is solid like you might find on cases priced at twice this price. Great cushions to protect against drops. A number of other nice features too.
5,Bought this 6 months ago for my 8 year old. It’s very durable easy to hold and has a kick stand to stand on its own.
5,I love the product fit just right on my iPad 6th generation!! And shipping was fast.
5,I purchased this case to protect an iPad being used by a toddler.  So far it’s doing what it should ... the iPad has been dropped tossed and sticky fingered.No damage
5,Y’all I have dropped this thing at least 3 times onto the hard floor and it’s survived because of the durability of it!
5,Good product
5,It looks cheap before going on and it's a pain in the butt to put on but afterwards it works great.
5,This is great I have a 3 year old so this case really protects his iPad 👍🏽
5,I’m very impressed with this case. It feels very sturdy & my daughter likes the stand. I would definitely buy again.
5,Great case!  Extremely durable! We love all the ways that our iPad can be held to prevent dropping. Thanks for a great product!
5,Ordered this product for My daughter’s iPad for that added protection. The color is fantastic and love that you can hook it up to a head rest it has a stand and a rotating hand strap. Multiple options ❤️
2,The item is sturdy but is too heavy and cumbersome for me.
5,I have only had this product for about a week but so far I am very pleased.
5,Good quality!
5,Likes
5,So far so good.  I love these tablet holders.  My kids are able to carry them and they love the stand.
5,Great product works well
5,It’s very easy to install and easy to hold. Very strong case won’t even break if drop from 3 feet.
3,I like this product in general however there are 2 flaws thay i noticed. 1. u cannot press the down volume bottom its coveres by the back plastic part of the casing 2.the plastic screen protector is thin and low quality. If not for these flaws I would have rated this product 5 stars.
1,Inner package was open. Not sure all parts were sent. Will assemble shortly and update this review.Definitely previously opened package.Did not include cleaning cloth or user manual.The case does fit my iPad very well.The one star review reflects the used versus new product I ordered.
5,love the color love the feel i love the attachments and how tough it is
5,Excellent quality
5,This case is well designed made and heavy duty. The stand works great and is versatile with the ability to rotate 360 degrees.
5,This is a great case I bought one for myself a year ago and just bought another one for my husband. Super sturdy.
1,I like that it has a handle and a strap for carrying but I’m constantly having to try to push the side back into position. Thumbs down
4,Nothing
5,I got this to use my iPad at work and what I do it been through the test great item
5,good product very durable a little heavy
5,Sturdy very functional features and excellent customer service.
5,Very easy to assemble and i like the moving stand. My grandson is 3 yrs old and has a tendency to drop things that being said so far the case is very durable. Very satisfied with my cover.
5,I really like this case. It’s solid and sturdy.  So far my son has not been able to destroy his iPad. I am very pleased with this purchase!
5,Easy to snap everything together. Great instructions. Works great!
5,Great product kids enjoy itThanks
5,muy bien
5,Love it. Feels like I could throw it out the window if I wanted
5,Easy to put on.... sturdy for grandson’s iPads!
5,So much better than my previous case.Love the wrist strap on the backLove the colorSturdier than my other case
5,Very sturdy and protects my grandsons iPad when he drops it!!  He likes the Velcro hand hold in the back and have ability to stand it up on a table.
3,Great case except for the screen protector portion. It’s really bad!!!  Super wavy and annoying.  Beyond that it’s probably the most versatile case I’ve ever had for an iPad.  Too bad they fell short with the screen protector.
5,It just right and it got here fast and I love it
5,Excellent  product.  I recommend
5,Bought this for my daughter who is rough on everything. It's holding up to the test and she actually love it too
3,Great idea however the stand is pretty flimsy and the cover over the screen has some lag under so when you type your fingers touch the screen cover then it hits the letter(s).
5,The item is as promised.
2,I bought this in January 2021 to give as a gift to my wife. She got it in May 2021. By June 2021 the kickstand had broken. Cheap little tab on the inside that snapped off for no reason at all and now it's useless.
5,Great fit for my iPad.
5,We love ours!
5,Sturdy  product. Allows smooth handling of the iPad
5,Excelente. Me gustaría que fuera más compacto. En lo que se cae la tapa frontal sale pero n resumen el producto es bueno por el precio
5,Great case. Color was as shown and my oldest daughter got one as well and loves hers. It’s definitely sturdy.
5,Kids are not careful with electronics but this seems to do the trick.  Amazing
5,It's sturdy easy to put on if you read the directions they email. Kid like it and I'm happy IPad is protected.
4,It’s a very tough product for the price
5,This is a great cover for our techs to use on their iPads. They are very sturdy.
5,This is a replacement for an older Case.
5,Bought this for my son's ipad he loves it! It's pretty sturdy. I'm satisfied.
5,I got this for my child's ipad.  It was simple to put the ipad in the case.  My kid loves the stand and hand strap.  Seems like it will be a great product.
5,Bought for the kids to protect our iPad. Was just what i needed.
5,Great hold and steady
5,Fits perfectly on my son's iPad. Very sturdy and durable. Nice.I👌
5,Bought these for the kids new iPads old ones were in Otterboxes.  The kids LOVE these.  The kickstand and hand grip are all wonderful and they are very sturdy to protect their iPads.
5,Great case!
3,I’m happy with the case overall. I read a comment stating that the screen protector wasn’t very good so I did go ahead and order a glass screen protector. Im glad I did I just removed the one on the case and used a normal screen protector with the case.
5,Buen producto
5,Excellent case for my 9 yr old. It’s sturdy but doesn’t make the iPad too bulky. She loves it!
5,Great case easy install
5,Even better than expected
5,It is great! I can wear it prop it up on the kickstand or hold it. Great buy!
5,got it for my 2 year only iPad and it holds up pretty good
2,Too heavy. Weighed more than the iPad itself.
5,It has a hard cover
5,Fits perfectly. I feel safe using my iPad with this case. I am no longer afraid to drop it.
2,Great looking case with nice features but the stand failed after very little use. Unfortunately I didn't use it enough before the Amazon return period expired and it broke/failed a couple weeks later. I have had other cases last for years with similar stand mechanisms.  With a failure in just under two months of ownership and occasional use I would not recommend this product to anyone.
5,I love the versatility of this product it is an outstanding iPad holder
5,I love this so much ❤️❤️
2,Looks great impressive construction but that doesn’t matter if the on-off button won’t depress through the rubber bumper!
5,Seems like a good protective case for the money. My son enjoys the hand strap.
5,Excelent and very complete for the device. Everthing is ok..
5,Bought it for my daughters IPad and she’s really picky but she loves this case. So that makes me extremely happy.
5,Very durable case. Worth the cost! Not cheaply made.
4,Waaoooo
5,Great value for price.
5,This was easy to install and seems very sturdy without being too heavy or adding too much bulk.  I like the option of a strap as well as a built in kickstand.
5,I like the stand and hard case
2,The tiny plastic tab that holds the kickstand open is quite fragile
5,Bought this for my son he loves it and so do I.  It is very durable and looks great!
5,It overpassed my expectations! Good quality!
4,Great product
5,Wife likes purple
5,Solid safe and protective. All for a good price.
5,Great
5,Suvey industry.
5,I bought this for my grandson’s iPad.  It is very sturdy and a great product.  The shipment was fast and accurate.  I would definitely purchase this again.
5,More then I was looking for.
5,Grandchildren
5,Very sturdy and easy to hold.
5,Holds up well to a 7 year old's abuse.  Color is beautiful highly recommend.
5,So we were sent another case to replace the first one. The replacement case works perfect. I ordered this case because the strap attachments. Customer service was great to work with
5,We used the case to protect 15 new ipads that our construction guys use on their job sites.  Yup they work for us!
1,This is really a piece of JUNK
5,We love this product. Works great for adults and children who are hard on electronics. :-)
5,My son is hard on everything but this case has stood up to the test. Love the bright color and the handle in the back helps him carry it securely.
5,Very easy to assemble around the I pad. The extra straps make it very convenient to attach to the back of the front seat for kids to watch movies and carry.
5,It's very heavy duty and easy to put together.
5,I am totally happy with this case
2,This is the second I have ordered where the mechanism that stands the tablet up for reading etc has broken. I am not rough with this...it is just really cheap components. Learned my lesson wont buy a third for sure.
5,This is a very sturdy case which is needed for my son.  I am very pleased.
5,Great product arrived when promised
5,Excellent transaction with fast shipping
5,It was just what I was looking for my iPad it fit great it seems to be well made.
5,This is our third one to buy. Far better prices than Otters or others and extremely durable. We bought 3 not due to issues but separate iPads.
5,Product just as described.
5,This is great! Exactly what I needed. The plastic clear protective part is a little annoying but worth it to me for the price and the stand in the back.
5,Son loves it
5,EASY TO ASSEMBLE  EVERY THING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS.
5,Works great..my son loves it!!
5,iPad.

5,Super quick delivery and great quality product
5,Great product can say anything else..Holds great... durable...  and sturdy...
2,Loved this case until the latch for the stand broke. Now we can’t prop it up. It seemed the stand was poorly made to begin with.
5,Love this. The hand strap on the back is so convenient. Don’t use the shoulder strap but would work well for some.Nice material. Very durable and shock proof.
5,I like the stand nice when I what to watch a movie nothing to dislike
5,Great case I really like the sturdiness and solidity of the case. Great must-have for one’s IPad. I recommend it to anyone with children.
5,Just as expected
5,For the money a great value.  The case looks good is comfortable with the carrying strap and the case is very sturdy.
5,The quality of the plastic is good just a little hard to place the pad inside. Otherwise it’s s a good product.
5,Perfect Fit for my Apple IPAD.
5,Case and strap keep iPad safe and clean and as I move through worksites.
5,Great price and great product.
5,This was a great idea. I love this. Holds my daughters pen strong durable. Two different styles in package. Totally worth it.
5,Impressed with this case!  Just received but appears to be the right one durable for our son.
3,The horizontal position is to backward and cannot be adjusted to better position.  And.will be.better with a.cover for traveling.
5,Very happy with them
5,Great product. Neither my husband nor my toddler stand a chance with this case.
5,Yes I love this one.It’s beautiful 👍
5,Easy to hold.
3,The case is loose no good will not stay sturdyThe other case I bought for the large iPad Pro was EXCELLENT
5,Perfect fits great and looks great . Keeps my iPad protected.
5,My son loves the color and quality of this new case for his iPad. I will definitely be getting another one.
5,Works great for drop protection. I removedThe plastic cover and put on a protective glass instead. I like the strap also feels sturdy so far.
5,This is a great case very sturdy very thick I feel like my case is going to be very  safe for this iPad I won!!!
5,Great case !
5,For kids iPad. Great deal
5,Great case for the cost.  Easy to put together.  Get sturdy.
5,It has help up very well

5,So far so good I just received it today and I love it!! I will use it for a while and write another review.
5,Great look and durability!
5,easy to install  very good protection
5,Love it except it is hard to turn iPad off and on because the button doesn’t extend enough with the case on.
5,Fits great and looks nice. Great protection for the device.
5,I like it a lot. It’s very durable. It’s slightly bulky but does the job.
4,Good
5,Very sturdy and easy to use
5,Good protective case good rubber edges and it does have a clear screen cover. Lots of coding potions with this case.
5,My son loved this case!!
5,i liked that it comes with screen protection and whole case is well built.  For me is worth every dollar i paid for it.
5,I bought this case for my daughter’s IPad and the case is exactly what I was looking for. The case is very protective and the color is wonderful.
5,Durability
5,I love my new case! It’s easy to handle and the colors are great! I definitely will continue buying from them!
5,Changed out the screen protector because the one it comes with is very flimsyGives good sturdy protectionA little difficult to get snapped together
3,it is sturdy. Also saying very heavy.
5,This is the perfect case for our little boy's ipad! The item shipped fast and arrived earlier than we thought.
5,Perfect fit for my iPad.  Customer service it’s just wonderful.  Recommend 100%.
5,Love the product they even took a picture of where it was at when delivered beautiful. Love the customer service!
5,My hubby loves this protective case. BUT don’t even try to put on the screen cover-it’s of no use!  Buy a glass cover.
5,This is a really good product we are very pleased with it.
1,Concept is great. I’ve ordered two and both failed within the first month. Horrible cheap quarter inch plastic hinge which breaks within a month GUARANTEED. Stay far far away.  UPDATE. they were kind enough to send a free replacement and I will try to move the standless frequently to extend the life of the clasp.
5,Wanted a durable case that can withstand a kid tornado and it's holding up strong no complaints
5,Very durable!
5,Its been a great case for my grand-daughter.
5,Fits perfectly !!
5,Bought this as a gift for my mom. A few drops and the iAd is still in perfect shape. She loves the handle grip.
5,Really great product easy to use functionality is perfect for on the go life style
5,Love the ease of this to atach to my ipad seems sturdy
5,Works exactly as I hoped at a good price.
3,I don’t recommend  this cover
5,I would definitely purchase this item again. Very durable and reliable
5,Takes a sec to get in on right but when you do it’s very sturdy. Does the job.
1,This does not fit the Apple ipad 6th edition very well.  Not much I can do now since Christmas is next week.  My Grandson will have to use it until I can get another one ordered.  Also no way to turn and use the vertical stand.  The horizontal stand is difficult to use with the velcro hand strap in the way.
5,It's working out well for my son.
5,Thank you fir fine product. It is very safe for my kids.
5,Great product
3,The stand up feature broke after a few months
2,This case stated out good but the plastic cover for the screen has since come off one side completely. Not sure if it’s the best most durable case for kids since my son managed to get liquid between the screen and case covering many times. Now it doesn’t protect it much at all because the cover is hanging off that this point.
5,not as well made as it should be
5,My son loves his new case and seems very durable for my 5yr old
5,Great product really heavy!!
1,iPad physically fits into the carlee however the headphone Jax hole is not in the same place
3,It’s very sturdy but I do like the screen protector portion. It’s a piece of plastic that does not fit snug with screen & I have to press 2 or 3 times.
1,It stinks smells just like charcoal
5,Very pleased with both the case and customer service. I would definitely recommend
5,11 year old son absolutely loves the case and the strap. Highly recommended
1,This says it’s for my product model which I double checked . However the port is not for a lightning cable so it won’t work. Difficult return process. Would not buy from them.
5,I bought this for my son and he loves it this is a great product
5,Solid
5,I really like this.
2,I liked the color but the iPad was hard to turn on/off basically I had to take the cover off when I needed to access the buttons.  the rubber around the colored piece was flimsy and didn't stay in place very well too many little flaps.  I replaced this cover and would definitely not buy again.
5,Awesome case. It handles my 2 and 4 year old playing with it
5,Great product
5,Great for field audits. Feels sturdy not sure on durability yet but appears that it would age well
5,Bought this for my daughters iPad. The iPad is well protected. Highly Recommend.
5,Muy buena calidad
1,I returned this case and if I could give it zero stars I would!!  The kickstand it comes with will never last.  It is cheap and difficult to open.  It won’t be long and the plastic is going to snap in two.  The black  rubber case that goes over the purple plastic cover is the gummy/sticky kind of soft rubber.  Everything sticks to it and you can’t wipe it off!!  I wouldn’t recommend this case to anyone.  And it is too bad because some of the features would have made it excellent if it had been made with better quality materials!!
1,It's a great case in general but the stand broke within a month of use. There is a very small plastic tab that locks the stand into place and it broke on both mine and my sons. His first then mine a week later. I wouldn't recommend at all really because if there is something that is defective in the production of the product and it's on every one then I would assume that every single case made this part will break. So I would look elsewhere for a better quality case.
5,Sturdy Ipad Cases great product thank you!
5,Fits nice doesn’t feel cheaply made and easy to install.
5,Works perfectly for my 8 year old. Well made and appears to be quite durable without compromising the appearance of this good looking product. Absolutely recommended!
5,
5,Excelente Lo recomiendo muchas gracias
5,Finally figured out that the hard case goes on top of the rubber! Once you install it correctly it’s does what’s it’s supposed to.
5,I love it
2,Unfortunately the rubber frame doesn’t fit right on the shell & had to remove. I was very disappointed but it still serves a purpose despite not working well. I guess I got what I paid for.
1,Within one month plus one week after my order the kickstand no longer works. It was always a little difficult to set so it can stand properly or to “un-set” it so the device could lay flat. Now it won’t stay out in the standing position..... when trying to stand the device the kickstand just collapses. Now in less than 2 months I have a faulty product with no options provided on Amazon to return the product (I am assuming the window for returns has closed).Update: I have since contacted the vendor via the email provided on vendor’s page on the amazon website and without hesitation they timely gave a full refund. For this reason I give the vendor a high rating but the product it self remains at a one star.
2,I find the top piece of plastic always comes loose away from the tablet like it does not want to lock into place it just feels like a really cheap product the only good thing about it is the strap on the back for your hand in the pencil holder
5,Perfect cover for my grandson’s iPad.
5,Great iPad case. My 10 year likes it and especially loves the carrying strap that comes with it. Very easy to install.
5,Good item
5,Very good product!
5,Perfect for my 7 year old!
5,Liked
5,The best product for a wild 8 year old!!
5,My son needed better iPad protection and this seems like it’s a great fit
5,Great shock proof case.  Fits great.  The strap on the back makes it easy to hold.
5,Very sturdy for my toddler who constantly drop his tablet
5,I love everything about this case works great.
5,I use it everyday at work easy to hold
5,This fits my 9.7 in iPad Pro perfectly. All buttons are easy to use no pressing super hard or anything.
5,I got this case for my daughter and it works really well. Very happy with this purchase.
1,The cover doesn’t fit properly. The rubber ring around it just keeps popping off. You can’t get to the volume button. Total trash!
5,Hermoso y muy buen material!
5,Well made perfect for being in the school system!
2,The only reason I gave 2 stars for overall is because the gap between the screen protector and the actual screen makes it difficult to "tap" on your apps or  type something in.  You have to push pretty hard.  Not great for the littles trying to navigate.
5,Absolutely love this case have one for all of our iPads
5,Excellent for the money ... very nice case sturdy and  covers everything.
5,It has a lot going on. It will save your iPad.
5,Perfect & protective for my sons iPad.
5,Very protective
2,My daughter broke her tablet screen while using this product. No happy with it. So now I have to pay again to get it fixed. Isn't a good product for a special needs kid.
5,Fast delivery  my grandson loves it
5,Loved the case... it protects the entire ipad.... love the many ways it can be used and would definetely recommend it to anyone...
1,Gave this as a Christmas gift.  By the end of February the stand portion has broken and that was one of the main reasons for this purchase.  The stand is plastic and the part that keeps the stand upright has broken off.The button that turns the iPad on and off also doesn’t line up well with the on/off button on the iPad.I cannot get product service for this item but will keep searching Amazon to see if it can be returned for a refund.
5,We've got a 6 year old. This works!
2,The screen protector is made of poor quality. It does not align well with the case. The protector has a ripple effect in some places. As I type on it the protector interferes with the keyboard on the screen which makes keystrokes hard to achieve and you have to repeat strokes. However the case seems durable but the screen protector needs work. I would not recommend for an Ipad if you want to protect the screen. The case has broken after 10 months.
5,I dropped my iPad recently and cracked the screen. After having it fixed I bought this case and I love it.
5,Works great.  The Screen protector causes no issue what so ever.  Great Product.
5,Has protected the iPad very well. Keeps it sturdy while on its side.
5,I got this for my 7 year old and it protects his iPad perfect!
2,Too much to put together!! Decided to keep it because after spending time trying to put it on my iPad and having 3 different people try we decided it wants worth it!
5,Muy bueno
5,Great gift for my 6 year old grandson.
5,Grandson loves this case! He likes how you can hold it with hand while playing.
5,Durable
5,Awesome
5,wish it had a folding cover for screen.
2,Would be a great case if the black rubber part would actually stay in place. Not happy with it. I'm forever trying to get it to stay together.
5,Great product for my 7 year old. Exactly what he needed.
2,The kickstand on my case broke this morning I was just pulling it out and it snapped in half. Pretty bummed based on the reviews I expected more durability.
5,Was everything promised. So far it handles all the bumps and jolts on the job site.
5,had an issue with stand. Customer service went above and beyond and fixed our issue right away :)
5,Very durable and the color is great
2,The case looked good. But when I ordered it and tried putting it over my iPad the case was loose like it wouldn’t fully click shut. When I try to open the case it opens easily so that tells me it will fall apart with one drop. Would not recommend.
2,Black silicone bumper don’t stay secured on the sides I m always having to move them back into place.  Also the 360 handle in the back is hard to turn.
5,Great product will buy again.
2,It’s a nice case but description say for 5th or 6th generation iPad. It is not. Most of the ports do not line up on a 5th generation iPad. Bad description. Pain in the neck.
5,I liked almost everything except the Hand band blocks the kick stand from opening
5,Very well made. I would recommend this item for your IPad.
5,Good sturdy product won’t have to worry about my iPad breaking
5,Love for my business
5,This was a gift for my husband. He loves it!
5,Really like the handle that turns. So durable. May get one in black next.
5,It’s easy to work with and to carry
5,Bought this for my father and he loved it. Perfect fit very sturdy.
5,It’s great and very sturdy and durable! My 3 year old has an iPad and hasn’t failed us yet!
5,Fits perfectly. Get the glass screen option.
5,Ipad
5,It completely protects the iPad all around!!! Perfect for anyone. The colors are great!!
5,Love the color choices. Very easy to install around the iPad
5,Awesome Product. My kid loves it.
5,Sent it back not what we wanted
2,So easy to hold with the strapon the back. Durability is ok. the stand broke within a week but the sturdiness of the case/cover is amazing!
5,Really like this the boys 3 and 4 years old can use them and protect their ipads
3,Bulky  I did find it hard to hold it is heavy.
5,Bought one for one for one grandchild and had to buy three more when the others saw it.
1,This is the second one we bought and this is the second one that the kickstand broke.  Would not recommend.
5,This case was very easy to install and so far appears to protect the ipad quite well.
5,Outstanding product. iPad will not damage by drop alone.
5,Fits well very strong and durable.
5,I liked the sturdiness of the case as well as the straps that come with it would recommend.
1,Installation instructions written in pidgeon English.  Code scan to help installation brings you to their Facebook page then to a you tube video for instructions on a completely different case.  After an hour of wrestling with this case it finally is installed but the stand is so fragile it will likely break off after 2 or three uses.  The combination of cheap construction opaque installation instructions and you tube link which leads nowhere makes this a one star product and that is being generous.  Cannot recommend.  Amazon are you listening?
5,Great case. Good quality and durable.
5,Great for my 4 year old
5,IPad Pro love it
2,The case has a crack on the top and the button for touch id had to be removed because it was nothing more than sheet plastic wrap and it stopped working soon after I got the case. I was offered nothing more than a discount on ordering another one. Should have ordered a otter box like I started to at least they stand behind their products.
5,Excellent as advertised great for kidsI removed screen protector and installed another one on the iPad it self.
5,Good quality very satisfied
5,Works great fits great love it
2,I’m enjoying the protection that this cover offers but ....the stand feature cracked and broken with in 2 weeks ! And that was a feature I was really enjoying !
5,The kick stand is perfect for watching movies!
5,Arrived in a timely manner . My son was very happy with it
5,Sturdy and durable
1,Purchased this for my tween haven’t had it two weeks she dropped it and the iPad shattered into a million pieces. The drop from her bed to the floor is about two feet max. It’s cute but not actually durable. Literal pieces of glass everywhere.
2,Screen cover will not sit in case tightly. This makes it wavy as I have shown in the attached images and we cannot press the buttons on the screen properly because waviness prevents screen from responding accurately.This is a poor design. You would think that when a company creates a product they would ensure that the product works properly before going to manufacture sadly this did not happen with this product.
2,(Update: the kick stand stopped working after two months. It's completely broken.) The front plate is a little loose at the bottom. Not a big deal. Otherwise it is as advertised. I love the apple pencil holder especially since I have the old pencil without magnetism. But that's about the only thing this case is good for. Save your money and get something better.
5,Fit very well. 2nd time purchase for my workplace. Industrial grade quality.
2,The stand unlocks very easily. You have to put it down extra soft or it will collapse up on itself. Not a good design
2,Very strong and sturdy for kids to useI like the stand parts as well until small part just got loose at the back of the case and stand is no longer workingAnd it’s been less than two month of using it
2,You can only use kickstand sideways and sometimes the touch screen doesn’t register your touch so you have to repeat until it finally registers it.
5,Very good case.. I’ve dropped several times already no problems!!
5,Loved the product. Used it for my Gen 6 I-pad
5,Perfect color perfect size perfect durability perfect weight!
2,What I don’t like about it the volume button se do not match up with the case vs the iPad. This makes it extremely hard to set the volume and some times the pressure of the case will force the volume down.
5,Works perfectly; exactly as described. Rugged & durable. Great product.
5,Love the color and the hand holder on the back along with the back prop
2,Don’t waste your money!!! I bought two for my twins. Within two months the stands broke on both of these. Highly disappointed!!!
5,Love the look and durability of this.
5,Hold tablet safe and allows me to hold it with ease.
5,Very nice
5,This case is so amazing and great
5,Awesome
5,Love this product! I don’t think I can ever not have one now!
5,My son loves it. Sturdy enough. Tolerances and QC could be a little better.
2,If you use this without the optional screen cover it works fine. If you use the screen cover the cover is loose over the top of the screen which makes for a very unusual and annoying touch screen experience. They probably shouldn't even ship the optional screen cover. Then I would rate the product higher.
5,SEEMS TO BE A VERY GOOD PROTECTOR FOR A GOOD PRICE
5,Tal lo que esperaba.
1,First issue was the product is the incorrect color which is fine. Black is classic anyway and the sky blue was really just and indulgence.The problem for me was that the case was too big for my iPad. I checked the product information again to make sure I ordered the right size and I did.The sticker on the back of the packaging said it was the correct item but it was stuck over another sticker. Removed it and saw that the original sticker is for the 10.2 inch model. Not the 9.7 inch which is what I ordered.Why?
5,My daughter and I loved this case!
5,Durable and protects the iPad well.
1,Does not stay in place. Very disappointed.
5,Great product very sturdy
1,Hate I bought it
3,very nice case but the black rubber border doesn't snap in tightly after you have the ipad in it
5,Great product!
2,This is far too heavy and if you have an updated charger cord ( sturdy so it doesn’t fray and break) it won’t fit so you have to remove it charge.
5,I love everything about it perfect fit strong works great.
2,Well it’s hard to get on for the first thing and then when you get it on it slips off he won’t stay in and then after that I had to cut off the handle because all it does is get in your
1,Did not protect the iPad from damage my son dropped it when he slipped and fell dropping the iPad with this case on it. Still got damage to a corner and cracked it clear to the other side.
1,Couldn’t get it apart to put tablet into it.
5,Bought this for my son. He really likes it. Looks like a good case
5,The case was very easy to install and is totally functional.
5,I love it it protects the IPad all away around
2,Plastic screen is wavy and does not lay flat on the surface of the ipad. I asked the seller if I could return and the return process was fast. I got my second case the following day. But it had the same problem! Don’t know what else to do.
5,This case is very solid fit perfect and the stand is very good
5,Great case for someone working outside that needs to protect their IPAD.
1,Does NOT work! I bought this for my boyfriend's 5th gen iPad it fit perfectly everything seemed totally fine (except the instructions were very vague and took a while to understand and the blue film was ridiculously difficult to peel off). And then the NEXT DAY he dropped it and the whole screen shattered. Not the screen protector the actual iPad screen. I'll be looking into a refund and iPad screen repair now I can't believe I wasted my money on this.
4,Is a bit difficurl to use the ipad with it.Considering that this type of protective cases tend to increase the size of the unit you need big hands to use it.Otherwise it looks good enough. Only the time will tell.One thing to consider due to the size increase if you intent to keep/store your ipad in one of those bag that claims to feed an 9.7 ipad in it it does not incluse a protective case size like this one. So don't spect to put your 9.7 ipad in a bag with this case.
5,Very well made
5,It’s a good case & easy to hold.
2,The stand broke. I used it on my tablet and have no had it that long. I don’t us my tablet much so it should have lasted longer
1,Pull out stand snapped after a few weeks of use.  It was made of thin cheap plastic with zero reinforcement in the design.  Velcro on hand strap stopped sticking a week later. I only adjusted velcro couple of times in the beginning and never had to adjust again.  Now it suddenly stopped sticking and is just hanging.  Good case design but cheaply made stand and velcro.
5,Easy to put on and easy to hold your Ipad pro!!
5,Everything is good
5,nice item!! very practical!!
5,Great iPad case for the price and l really like the handle.
1,This smells very toxic from 3feet away. I can’t stand it.  Seems build good. But doesn’t smell right.
5,Just what I was looking for. Great case at a great price! Thank you!
2,I want to like this product but the rubber exterior piece keeps falling off of the hard plastic. I will be returning it.
5,was exactly what i needed
5,I use it for my teacher iPad that I carry everywhere!
5,One hand is all you need with this unit.
5,The carrying strap
5,Very durable case!
5,great cover!  sturdy
5,Used in dealership shop.
5,Bought this for my sons Ipad seems very protective and sturdy
5,Donation to school
5,Great product. We have two.
1,I’d give this less than one star if I could. I have low vision. I bought this hoping that I could use it with an “outside” app that would give me more freedom in mobility.  It’s much heavier than I anticipated. The instructions are *inside* the case. Even with a magnifier too complicated to put back together. The strap hangs down to low for me to use with the app I needed this for. Will be returning.
2,Mine broke after two months the little tab in back broke that hold the stand up. Now it’s useless.
1,I was ordering an iPad case for my child and came across this one. I dislike this because it had too many parts and it didn't even fit the iPad. I am returning this item and getting a better case for my child. The only thing that was good about this was the color.
5,My new ipad is very well protected with this case. Very thick
2,I bought this for my 6 year olds new iPad he got for Christmas and this case will not stay together! The black rubber piece falls off doesn’t stay connected and we have to keep snapping the case together. I wouldn’t recommend buying it unless you want to keep putting it together.
5,Fit great and very tough
3,Straps broke first fay of use little strings pulled out of the sewing
5,Easy to use and durable
5,Very well made sturdy materials. The swivel handle is extremely nice.
5,Very sturdy and lots of cool gadgets on the case.
5,Perfect!
5,Love this product so much!
5,Great value!!!
3,The screen protector is wavy. Problematic when using a touch device
5,Bought for my four-year-old and he really really loves him
5,Awesome Product!
5,fit pad good as said. looks good too !
5,It’s exactly what I need for the iPad protection
5,All good
5,I like it
5,Nice item
5,An amazing case all around super durable well worth every penny.
1,I purchased these for my iPads that I bought for my 4th grade classroom. The rubber edges would not hug the frame as they should and they would have been removed by my students in no time. Poor quality.
5,I love it
5,Best case ever
5,My son loves it
5,Excelente producto se ajusto muy bien a mi Ipad.
5,I love it.  I could not be any happier.
3,Strong plastic....  but difficult to remove.
5,Good
5,My son really love the case
5,Great for job site
5,I was very impressed with the quality of this case.
1,Sorry Amazon but this is another example of mega positive reviews but a crappy product. We had this a few months and jr seemed great. Then our screen cracked we fixed and it cracked again. This case is nothing more than any other crappy case as far as protection goes. In addition it’s very hard to take on and off if your kids play games and it broke after less than a year. Do not recommend.
5,Fits like a glove and works perfectly
2,I thought I would try this and save some money rather than going with Otterbox. But when this arrived I realized right away that this would not hold up for my 8 year old. It may work for an adult who is careful definitely not for kids.
1,As soon as I put it on my iPad it dropped & shattered the screen into a million pieces. Absolutely disappointed.
5,I love it!
5,Works well with my 11 year old
5,Easy to apply and LOVE the stand on the back
5,Great case for the price! I love it!
5,Works great for kids
5,Good quality
5,Impressed with quality.
5,Seems like it will last a long time
5,Love it
5,Lo que estaba buscando
1,I like the case except it slips off my iPad size 9.7 . It’s too bad because  I spent a long time looking for the right case.  It’s cute. I am so disappointed.
5,Great case a little bulky. Fantastic for kids.
5,Very good item
5,It fits my iPad perfect.
3,Installation was longer and fit of case lose.
5,Very pleased.
5,My kids liked it
5,Great
5,I took the screen off.. Was to bulky
5,Good value
1,The case is not sturdy it’s loose it’s not a tight fit
5,Great product
1,When my product arrived the screen protector was already scratched.
5,Good buy
3,Did not fit as specified. Nice  but need to return
2,Hand strap doesn’t allow for easy storage it won’t lay flat or lay propped up without moving and wobbling. Strap gets in the way of kickstand. Clear Plastic screen cover is cheap and sometimes interferes with touchscreen buttons so you may have to hit buttons multiple times
5,Excellent quality
1,My ipad was one of the models listed for compatibility but when I installed the ipad into the case I found that the top half did not firmly attach to the bottom half.  Result was the ipad could move around a little bit just enough that most times the top button on the case would not connect with the top button on the ipad.  So I returned both of the ones I ordered.
5,Excellent product
5,I wa very impressed live ut!!
1,Sadly when arrived the stand at the back was very stiff but we went with it but now it doesn’t click in at all so we are back to standing it up against a heavy object.  Also the rubber covers for the plug soon fall off (I already bought this once) .The rest of it is fine.
5,Good quality
5,Worked as expected easy to use
1,Installation very difficult! Took me a solid hour and the black silicone cover doesn’t seem to be fully covering the sides. The hard class doesn’t snap on like the instructions say; consequently I couldn’t use the screen protector that was included. I bought a separate tempered glass screen protector. Would not buy again unless a better model comes out. The idea is great. The product is cheap.
5,Love the color and it’s very sturdy!
5,Love the product very good for kids
5,Fast shipping. Good quality.
1,Since day one I have not been able to get it together correctly. It clicks together but falls apart . The rubber part don't stay on and I cant use the buttons.
5,Excellent!
1,The last iPad holder my kids had lasted for a few years. When they were ready to get new ones I ordered a blue and green one. Within a few months both of them had broken.  The black plastic piece  that stands the iPad up had broken in half.  It was past the return timeframe so was unable to ask for a replacement.  Very disappointed when this product is geared towards kids - you think they’d be more sturdy.
5,Looks and works great.
5,Wonderful product I bought for my teenager.
5,Grat value
5,Strong and nice
2,The clear screen protector is not laying flush with the screen and is bubbling. Extremely frustrating. It also makes it that much harder to scroll since you finger isnt touching the screen in the areas that are bubbled.
1,I want a refund we have had the covers for a year and the rubber around it has worn out and no longer wraps around the table or case. WASTE OF MONEY!
5,Great product.
5,It’s heavy
2,The Square lightening jack does not fit with this case. Also you can use the Square speaker jack adapter BUT you have to turn it sideways and yank the silicone cover of the case almost off.Such a bummer because I wanted this for my retail.
3,Great fit and I love that color.
5,Love the green color
5,It’s amazing
5,👍🏻
1,I bought this for my child something sturdy that would protect the iPad and had a stand. Well we’ve had it 4 months and the clip has broken and it no longer stands.... it should last longer than 4 months. It’s useless to my kid without the stand. Unhappy will not buy again.
5,Very good
2,It fell apart after a week of use
2,Outer case and strap were great. The stand was not. Metal pin that goes on one side of stand fell out. Should have lasted more then 2 months.
5,Good product
5,Great product sturdy
1,I’ve had this case for less than 2 weeks and the handle broke.  When it broke I dropped my iPad & the case fell apart with the front falling off.  I had a screen protector on which did get a crack in it.  Luckily- it was not the actual screen. I don’t recommend this case.
2,No drop protection. Dropped my iPad today around 2 feet or less and the screen shattered. Also had a problem from the start with the finger print ID on the home button. Would not read finger print to open or set new finger print.
5,Great
2,This item is so un-sturdy it fell apart putting together.  I wanted a durable solid item.  Returned.
5,Has a lot of useful functions
3,Did not hold up well
1,I was all excited to open up my iPad and clean it to put it back in it‘s case and then I see my screen totally shattered.What did I buy this case for when it did not protect my iPad after all?
2,The rubber casing is a separate piece and does not stay on.  Its too loose.
5,Fit my ipad 6.
5,Love the color
1,Everything about this case was as described BUT the case borders infringe on the screen so much that you can’t swipe left or right without difficulty and it’s nearly impossible to swipe down from the top. I like to use the brightness and sound volume menus that can only be accessed by swiping down from the top of my iPad’s screen and it’s almost impossible with this case. It doesn’t seem like anyone tested this feature. Sending it back because I just can’t live with it.
3,Flimsy screen protector
1,Lasted less than 6 weeks. The kick stand is very flimsy and was always difficult to open. Product may have been defective from start but kick stand broke rather quickly. As for protection not bad but I bought it more for its rotatable kick stand. Will find better product and buyer beware cheap product or defective
1,I was very excited for the new cover and got very disappointed to have open the package and find a cover that’s been previously opened the screen is not even attached and I got two plastic pieces of front frame. It looks to me like I received somebody else’s return
1,The silicone part of the case does not what so ever fit snug and is always sliding off! I expected a better fitting case or else I could’ve went with a cheaper one.
5,looks like it's a safe case
5,I like this .
5,Easy install quick shipping
2,Had this item for my sons IPad for 2 months and the piece broke that stands the iPad up. Very upset that it didn’t last longer.
5,Awesome product!! Bought another thank you
5,Easy to use and durable.
1,Do not bother buying this case. It does not protect your iPad. The corner of my iPad is now broken (and no i did not drop it). I am very upset. The stand does not work very well most of the time it does not click in to latch. The hand strap is cumbersome. And it is hard to remove if you need to clean it.
2,The rubber piece doesn’t fit properly on the sides of the iPad. It just keeps sliding off. Yes I’m using it for the right generation of iPad. I wouldn’t recommend this product because of the poor built.
5,Muy buena
5,Haven't had any issuez
2,The black outermost piece doesn’t stay on very well. I don’t like it at all to bulky.
5,good product
5,Perfect! No issues so far!
1,The kick stand is very stiff  and everytime you try to use it it take an entire truck load of power to pull out. Also the fabric handle is too stiff too
5,Recomendado 100%
1,Don’t buy this case if you want to protect your iPad. Had this case for less than two weeks and iPad screen was cracked while in the case. The case and iPad were face down and accidentally sat on and cracked immediately. You get what you pay for I regret this purchase.
2,Nice case but there was a sticker on the inside of the screen protector that left so much residue that it makes it worthless. Guess I’ll just order a glass protector.
5,Love the durability!!
5,Good
5,Amazing
1,I feel like i wasted my money. It was very difficult to put on way too many pieces  and i barely got a good use out of it. The rubber piece kept coming off of the iPad making it difficult for my son to hold. The kick stand was a pain to open kept getting stuck. The screen protector didn’t do much protecting  i wish i could get my money back.
2,This product does not stay together and is constantly needing to be re adjusted. It makes the iPad very bulky and seems much heavier. Does not seem kid friendly. Will be donating and purchasing another kind.
5,Love everything about it
5,Great price and useful
1,This case S U C K S!!!!!The outer rubber part doesn’t fit the case. It stays warped. Spend your money else where.
1,The back holder doesn't hold. Disappointed.  The company sent me a new case within two days and the problem was fixed. Great service. Will by again in the future
5,Durable and fit perfectly.
1,This case isn’t made well at all doesn’t really protect because the front of the case doesn’t really stay on well...also the way the hand holder is there isn’t any protection for the back of the iPad so it doesn’t ruin the back of it by making rub marks and messing up the finish since I paid so much for my iPad 6th Generation
2,Love the concept. Rubber part is nice and the hand strap is great. The plastic shell is flimsy and will not stay secured together. Would not buy this product again.
5,Awesome
5,Just as advertised.
5,Perfect
1,The black rubber piece doesn’t stay on at all. Most uncomfortable case I ever seen.
1,We loved it it just didn’t fit
1,When I put the case on my son’s iPad the case did not align with the volume buttons. Anytime he tried to watch anything on it his volume is always down do to case pressing against the down button. Wouldn’t purchase or recommend.
5,Great case great price!!!
1,I thought this would be the perfect case for my son. We are in and out of the hospital constantly and he takes his ipad to entertain himself during treatments and transfusions. The back stand snapped right away and quickly after the velcro strap followed by just not fastening anymore. Of course I didn't contact the company in time to return it so now I'm looking for something that will actually last. Don't waste your money.
1,The cover was hard to put on my iPad and then it wouldn’t stay on; I did not like it at all! I ended up throwing it away. I didn’t even bother trying to return it.
5,Great product
1,I purchased as a replacement case for my son's I PAD. He has autism and the device is how he speaks as he is non verbal. I purchased it in July and by August  the strap was broken. The strap is important because it allows his hand to be free.
2,Although I gave this cover some high ratings which are deserved I ended up sending this back because it was so bulky and cumbersome. Just more than what I needed and too bulky.
1,After having this for less than 8 months with normal: first the use port covers broke off then the handle broke. Does it still protect my iPad I hope so but I have dropped it more lately because of the broken handle
1,I listen and watch my iPad but it cannot stand so I was disappointed
1,The rubber part outside perpetually is falling off. Poor design so if you move or use the iPad at all then the case starts coming apart. Advertised as a good on the go case with a strap and all but functionally not very good. Would need to glue it all together for it to work correctly.
5,I like how it has a sling and the hand mount!
5,Very nice
1,Doesn’t work at all. Cheaply made. Don’t waste your money
2,As stated
2,3 months and the kick stand broke.
1,It is hard to see in the pictures but this case doesn’t fit.  The screen saver is too big and you have to hit numerous times in order to make contact with the iPad.  The rubber does not fit around the green case and you have to constantly readjust it.  I would not recommend this and I have ordered a replacement case already after using it for three days.
5,Great case!
1,This case seems like a fabulous idea. But it is not made to fit the iPad very well. And the protective covering doesn’t stay on very well.  It actually slowly falls off during use.  Not worth buying .
2,The plastic out of come ring doesn't fit properly in a moves too much.  Also the outside a rubber doesn't stay on
5,Great!!!!!
1,Couldn’t put my iPad in it. It came apart and wouldn’t fit back together again. Do not recommend this product.
1,This product is the worst Protector I have ever purchased from Amazon. I do not recommend it to anyone. At this point I’m just gonna throw it away and request a refund.
1,The case seems to be doing ok so far protection wise. However one of the main reasons I purchased this specific case was because it also had a built in stand. That stand has already detached with normal use. I’ve had cheap cases with stands last longer than the few weeks I’ve had this. I’m disappointed that I spent $25 on something that broke this quickly.
5,Love it
5,iPod
1,I like the fact that you can carry it over your shoulders and it comes with its own stand.  I strongly dislike not having access to the power button or volume controls without having to take off the case.  Might have to return this item.
2,Kick stand broke in two weeks it is easy to carry love that pieces rotate and such but wish it was a little sturdier in some aspects.
1,Not happy case was supposed to fit the iPad and does but case when on pushes the volume buttons so volume won’t stay on trying to figure out how not to have to send it back as I need it for the 4yrs iPad and that would mean he wouldn’t be able to use it not good
1,Only a week having item the plastic screen cover had so much space between it and the actual screen made it hard to push buttons. So I switched to the open faced one and now the rubber parts don’t stay lined up and are always falling off. The piece to open for power cord didn’t last long either. Very disappointed in this item.
5,Perfect!
1,We tried to put it on the iPad but all the opening to the buttons were on the wrong side. Very difficult to put on.
1,The screen doesn’t allow you to flip pages and the case presses on the volume button the whole time.  Not worth it
1,First of all very poor design! I struggle to press volume control and off/on tabs because of the misplaced or think rubber casing! Secondly the blue tinted protected only option was horrible! Changed color and made watching movies/Netflix unpleasant. Third the damn kickstand tab broke less than two months from purchase! I demand a refund!!!
1,It will not fit right it in snaps when u tuch  it rubbed pad not stay in place
1,This order is in the same box at the screen protectors because I never open the box with both the screen protectors and the case for the iPad 6 because I turned the iPad back to sprint so I did need the orders at all since the only thing I need is case for the Samsung galaxy tablet A 8.0
2,Purchased case with stand on June 26th  2019 and it will not stay upright. The stand is what made it worth getting and now it’s completely unless
1,The outer black rubber case does not fit around the green case. It constantly falls off because the holes don’t line up for it to stay on correctly. My son couldn’t use the protective plastic cover because it didn’t fit snug to the iPad so when he tried to play a game the iPad couldn’t pick up his touch.
1,The screen protector is a cheap blue film! It makes screen under it look yellowish blue and light very dim. so disappointing! Will return!
1,The rubber outer part does not stay on also not sure what the stick was for never used it.
1,Already broke. What a bummer. My son bought this for his iPad with his own money and the kickstand already broke! We’ve had it just over a month
1,This fell apart after in less than a year. I wasted my money. I’m so sad 😞 I had to buy a new I pad cover.
1,It was listed for a 5th or 6th generation iPad. It was for something around a 9 or 10. Just way to large for my iPad.
2,Needs to fit better
1,It doesn’t stay together!
1,iPad fell from kitchen counter onto tile floor and the entire screen shattered.
1,How do I exchange my ipad case? I just purchased it on January 11 2021. A piece broke off now the kickstand does not work!! This is quite disappointing!!
1,The space it leaves for the volume buttons is so small that the case presses down on it and keeps the tablet on mute. I can’t believe no one ever mentioned anything about that. They need to fix it. I’ll be returning it today!
1,Only had this for almost 2 months and the lock that holds the tablet to stand broke. Unfortunately it is out of the return window.
1,This case does not allow me to easily turn the ipad on and off.  The rubber is too thick which makes it difficult to turn it on and off.  Same for the volume...
1,This was cheap and i kept having to remove the black rubber to use the sound buttons because the rubber buttons wouldn’t work. I used it a couple of weeks and now have to buy another case. I hated it!
1,I bought this for my son. It seems to be a pretty solid case but I would not recommend. The plastic case doesn’t seem to be cut correctly the plastic covers the volume buttons making it worthless. Don’t waste your money
1,Purchase this iPad case on September 5th.  It was delivered on September 7th.  The clip that holds the kickstand in place broke on October 14th seven days after the window to return expired!  I bought this because it appeared to be rugged and durable not so!
1,Complete garbage. Poorly fitted rubber edging. What a waste of money. The edges are sloppy and will not stay securely in place. Totally disappointed. Will be returning.
1,Will not stay together keeps popping off would not recommend
1,We’ve had issues with this case since day 1. It was for my 10 year old niece so I wasn’t able to act quickly enough with returning it. It’s never fit properly & moisture gets inside the case. I do not recommend this case!
1,THe kickstand broke after only a month of use.  I only use my ipad in the house so it didnt take any harsh treatment etc.  I reached out to the seller and they never responded.  Dont waste your time or money
1,This case is terrible!  Parts did not fit together properly didn’t hold the iPad firmly.  Lasted about one day before my son took it off because it was not fitting properly.  Waste of money!
1,Too bulky and heavy for me. I would worry about my iPad overheating in this case too. It may be fine but just not for me. I'm disabled and need something lighter to hold.
1,The case looks great but my ipad had at least 1/2 inch of play all the way around. Yes i bought the correct case based on the description. Returning because it doesnt properly fit
1,Trash screen is not protected at all! ! Broke my screen the first time my sin dropped it !
1,We just use it for one month and the holder behind did not work at all. And the case is heavy for little girl to hold.
1,Plastic screen protector was wavy which made it difficult to scroll on the screen.  The piece that covers the charging port broke the very first time it was opened.  Great idea but very poor execution with extremely poor materials.  Sending it back.
2,The screen that comes on it makes the iPad unresponsive part of the time and the power button isn’t lined up in the case
1,Disappointed in stand.  The piece of black plastic that holds the stand broke off in 4 months.
1,My son drop his tablet by Accident in side the house and it broke the screen protector doesn’t work at all!😡 too bad I throw out the box otherwise I would had return it back!
1,Ordered for 6th gen iPad. Case is to big and iPad moves around in case. Didn’t want to deal with the hassle so I didn’t return  kinda wish I would have.
1,Bought for my sons iPad he’s very clumsy. The first time he dropped it the iPad screen cracked. Wasn’t a cheap case either. Also noticed that the screen protector wasn’t great either. Lots of gaps. Very disappointed in this.
1,horrible product!!! didnt work at all
1,This doesn't fit right the rubber folds off the iPad. I wouldn't buy it definitely not for $25
1,Bought this item specifically because it’s shock proof. Well it slipped out of my hand and fell now more than 2-2.5 ft (I’m short) and the screen on my iPad shattered. And the case snapped open in a couple spots.
1,Said it fit my iPad 5th generation but not even close. Sent it back and ordered another brand. Fit perfectly!
1,This case didn't protect my daughter's iPad - when she dropped it the screen shattered. $140 later she has a new screen and a different case. I would not mess around and buy yourself a quality Lifeproof case.
2,I am super upset. It was delivered and did not have the shoulder strap which is why I ordered this. ☹
1,I was loving this case until moisture got trapped between the iPad and the earphone cover/case rendering my son's iPad shorted out and damaged. I just bought this iPad for $400 and now I'll have to pay to get it repaired.. If it can be.
1,the case is good just I received the wrong color. The size says 6th generation but this fits in a 7th generation. its too big for the 6th generation. I can't contact the seller?
1,Bought for my nephew. He hated it. It was sturdy but it was bulky and the putter rubber part kept was coming apart from the tablet. Ended up buying a different case. Gave that one to goodwill.
2,Not the best quality the back broke and now I can’t return it!
1,Returned the same day I received it. Flimsy piece of junk nothing else to say.
1,Got it for Christmas and it’s falling apart already then it dropped n crack the screen on my iPad
1,The case looks great but it didn’t come with any instructions for how to put it on the iPad. I think I broke it by trying to take off the black part.
1,The outer softer part Doesn’t really fit the hard plastic part.
1,This product is not durable this is my second one since December. My son 8 year old son has ASD and he’s able to Manipulate it within 24 hours. The screen protector is already broken
1,It’s already fallen apart. It lasted about a month. The cover for the plug came off as well as some other rubber parts. There is also particulars under the screen protector. Don’t get it. There are others.
1,Looks like crap. Quite heavy. Avoid.
1,Terrible design cheap. The silicone seal is too thick and doesn’t allow clean ease of access to the power button. That’s just damn silly.  Poor design. Sent it back in 15 minutes. Don’t waste your time or money.
1,It did not last two months before it started falling apart. The screen protector separated from the case. Even when it was new the protector would bubble up and make using the ipad screen difficult.
1,Smells like paint very strong smell. Itsemlls bad we have asthma. if them smell doesn not go away then we will return it.
1,This product advertises that it is for 5th generation iPad but doesn’t fit
1,Ruined my iPad screen. Do not buy
2,The kick stand no longer locks in place.
1,The stand for this broke within 2 months of purchase. Disappointed in the quality
1,Not well made at all. Very flimsy
2,Handle broke the second day
1,The black part of the case constantly needs to be put back on.
1,My daughter dropped her iPad from the couch to the floor in the case and the entire screen cracked. Not worth my money considering I had to pay to get her iPad fixed.
1,This case is terrible. Case does not stay together and can easily be taken apart by a 3 year old. Rubber tore on day one. Don’t waste your money!
1,This case is horrible. The pieces don’t come together properly 2 days with it and I’m constantly fixing outer casing because it doesn’t stay on properly. It seems as if it doesn’t fit.
1,The screen protection is so far from the screen it often takes several taps. I tried to contact them no luck. Don’t waste your money
1,It did not fit firmly around the ipad
2,Adds more additional weight than I expected.
1,The cover broke weeks later. The iPad does not stay up any longer.  very poor quality.
1,It looks good and sturdy but it isn't useful if it doesn't fit.
1,Didn't last long. The front screen part that snaps into the back broke in half after just a couple months. No abnormal use or extra wear and tear it just wasn't built very sturdy.
2,does the trick but flimzy and not durable
1,The rubber around the case won’t stay on the actual case it’s frustrating an poorly made
1,The case is entirely way to large and bulky. Feels squishy and not sturdy at all. Doesn’t fit well at all. Poorly designed. Plan on returning
1,iPad case started falling apart. Stand broke strap broke & glass on iPad cracked
1,It’s a great case if it actually worked and protected iPad. My iPad broke in less than a week in this case.
1,Worse iPad case it took me 30 minutes to put it and still doesn’t work do not waste your money in this!
1,The rubber casing ripped on day two. Prior to that it never fit snugly and was always slipping off revealing VERY sharp edges underneath. AVOID. Especially if you’re buying this with small children in mind.
1,Product does not actually fit the iPad & was unable to return it.
1,Horrible as soon as I got it it wouldn’t snap onto iPad please don’t buy this crap.
1,Seems to be well built except for the built in screen protector. Could be thicker and fit flat on the screen. Can't use Touch ID because cover doesn't allow sensor to read full fingerprint.
1,Piece of junk I wish I would’ve bought it
1,It doesn't fit my iPad even though it say it did...smh Such a waste of money!!
1,I found it to be too heavy for me.  I had difficulty getting it on my device and had to have help removing it.  I can't rate it for that reason.
1,Please don't waste your time or money on this one guys.
1,Cool colors but flimsy. Sides easily pull off.
1,It is flimsy cheap and not even worth $2 It doesn't even fit it has huge gaps and between the buttons as you could clearly see in the pictures about the post
1,Screen broke in case
1,Didn't fit right
1,Very poor quality. From start to finish
1,Durable and sturdy!!
1,If u have a I pad air this will not work. The plastic case covers the volume down bitten which makes it mute it self.

1,Horrible!!! Don’t buy it!!
1,Cheaply constructed junk
1,It does not fit properly
2,Could not get this to work with my IPad.  Think it would have been great if I could have made it work. All stars given are estimated.
5,This case is great for the price and very functional. Being able to work with it strapped on one hand with the band is a major plus. This is a must buy
5,After leaving the review below the seller contacted me and advised on how to put the case together in steps. I know it sounds silly with a simple iPad case but the instructions were not well understood. I did exactly as they said and it fits perfectly! My son LOVES his new case. I definitely don’t worry about scratching and I don’t cringe when he drops it occasionally. Put iPad into hard case the black silicone goes on next around the outside than the screen protector.This would have made a great product but the rubber black pieces along the outside do not fit and stay in place. We’ve tried to position it every way imaginable and it just doesn’t stay. It would have been 5 stars for sure had that piece actually fit.
5,I just love it. It’s just like the picture and it was very easy to assemble. Thank you for a well made product. The colors are striking 2
5,My daughter loves this thing. I have 5 kids and bought this for my oldest (12 yr old). It has held up to being dropped a few times so far and the iPad still works and is not damaged. Seems well made and my daughter likes that it holds her apple pencil.
5,Liked the strap screen protector and positioning
5,Product is as described. Fits and looks great and my iPad is well protected.
5,Great product very durable and lots of great colors!  Easy to hold and carry with the strap - very easy to assemble.
5,This case is really sturdy and easy to hold am very pleased with my purchase
5,Like the color and sturdiness. Use it on my work ipad
1,Had this case on it when the remote fell and it broke my iPad screen
5,Light tough and at a great price! it has survived my kids and some of my troops. This will be a standard order from here on out for my devices!
4,easy to set up my daughter loves it her only issue was that the case with the clear cover glitches so she uses the other one it came with. Over all i am happy with this case
4,So far this case has been great.  Love the handheld grip on back that easily rotates the ipad.  Love the color and the stand.  The screen protector was not flush and had air bubbles so we didn't use it.  Everything else is great though.
4,Great case but I recommend not using the screen protector. The case itself is difficult to take off but overall great case.
5,Great productprice and seller
4,Easy to put together comfortable in hand . Nice prop stand good viewing angle.
5,I received this for a gift for Christmas.Very easy to install really enjoy the hand strap with the pen holder lanyard is very comfortable and I like the option of using my own protection glass or use theirs.My only complaint is the plug in covers are not very strong because I see some tearing at the earphone jack cover.The best protective case I’ve had to use at work.
3,Purchased Jun 18 2020. By February 2021 the plastic is so badly broken the case no longer stays on. A 2 year old can really do a number on these things.
5,Second time I purchased this item. Love it!
5,I like the color. Easy to install. Its a little heavy the kick stand leans to far back for me other then that its a good purchase...
5,All features!
5,This case is a good addition to your  iPad.  It makes iPad easy to hold and the case folds nicely to make a stand.
5,Love this- especially the Velcro handgrip on the back. Easily wipes clean and is lightweight to carry.
5,Very satisfied with product. It was purchased for a teenage and her iPad and it's very durable.
5,Get protector !!!!!
5,Perfecto tamaño ideal buena oresentacion
5,I gave this as a gift to a friend.He installed it and is very happy with it.He's only had it for a few days but likes the handle on the back very useful.
5,Good quality.
1,This is the second time the kickstand has broken. I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. BUT he needs his Ipad for school and needs it to stand up. Why can't they figure out a way to fix this problem? This will be the second one. I am not buying another one of these.... ALTHOUGH.... he loves the color and the durability of the rest of it. He is never without it. But come on people send me a new one that the kickstand will last longer than ONE month!! I'm only going to give it One star as this is an important part of the cover....other than that it's GREAT!!
1,I bought 10 of these for my classroom. The kick stand on the back on over half of them are now broken. Cheap plastic and housing!! Do not recommend.
1,Thing broke the moment my kid dropped it on the floor. Cracked the screen again. This is garbage don’t buy this product! The iPad didn’t even fall that far I’m so pissed
2,Pros: Secure protection for iPad nice color Cons:  Very  Bulky and Difficult to hold. Buttons for sound etc not easy to use. It doesn’t rotate like advertised!Would not recommend or purchase again.
1,Awful! Awful! Awful! My daughters iPad has broke. Twice now in this case! With a protector on it! Absolutely horrific case! Would never ever consider this case again.
1,Broke after 2 month. No return or customer service. Waste of money
2,Handle broke first day of use.  Otherwise everything works.
2,The product doesn’t fit properly!
1,had on my sons ipad for a month ... slipped off the couch onto the floor (a matter of 1 foot) it shattered the case and my sons ipad screen .. so yea not so “drop protection” proof i hate to see what happens if it falls  from further
1,Bought it and having to replace screen on iPad for second time after dropping ipad . So much for shockproof
1,This Product worked for exactly one month after Christmas. The back stand will no longer click into place. This is very disappointing especially for the eight-year-old. Very frustrating I thought Amazon had better product control.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is a sturdy case with a good rubber trim. However the screen protector is not solid like a Supercase it is film and lose film at that. To try and fill the gap I installed a tempered glass screen protector to the tablet but there is still a large gap between the film screen protector and the tablet that makes typing nearly impossible. There is also glue bleeding into the viewable area. Without the tempered glass installed underneath this film protector will in no way protect the screen in case of a drop by a child onto an object. The film is scratched after one day of use. I also see no way to contact the seller to address this issue. Hopefully mine is a defect in how lose it is. If the seller reads this please reach out to me.
5,This case is very sturdy! I wasn’t sure what I was going to get when I ordered this but I was really surprised! The kids kept dropping the tablets and I would find little cracks in the screen here and there. Rather than buying a case like this or an otter box my husband bought this flimsy book type cover. Nonsense and worthless. I put this on and my daughter of course- dropped it again and no new nicks or cracks! It’s firm and sturdy. It has a stand a hand sleeve to hold it AND it comes with a strap also. Bonus we can hang the tablet around the front seat chair in the car so the kids can watch a movie. With distance learning and these days of long tablet use which unfortunately is currently unavoidable- this case is a savior!
4,The case is easy to put together I like that it seems very rugged and durable it come apart without much effort using the tool provided (useful for cleaning the device from time to time especially if you have kids)The stand works well and the straps can be used to hang from headrest of care for hands free viewing on road trips.Only reason not given a 5 star rating is the buttons while functional do not allow for easy use and they are not easy to locate without looking at them.One other thing frustrating to me but may not be to all is this case will not accommodate the Use of right angle (90 degree) chargers. I have a similar case from a different manufacturer for my 7th generation iPad which allows for the right angle connectors and that is a nice advantage for me.
5,My old iPad case fell apart after a few years and I wanted to have a multi functional new case. This one was very protective and had carry options hand held options and self standing options. There is a choice of screen covered front or open front (both included). The case has a very grippy rubber edge that also cushion drops. The hard plastic case protects well and fit together perfectly.
5,Love this case. Used otter box and other cases in the past and this one has so far been the best durable kid friendly case I have come across. I have bought two now for our kids iPads and the school also used this product for all the cases for virtual learning iPads. For the price and durability it’s a must have. Make sure you keep the tool for opening the stand as it’s very hard initially to open it without it.
5,This is a great investment. The tablet is well protected and there are 2 cover options. One with a screen and one without. The straps make it easier to carry around especially for the little ones.
5,Definitely would recommend. I bought this for my childs ipad and its amazing. I feel secure that no matter how you hold it if it falls it will not damage the ipad. The long strap is great my son loves it since we are on the go all the time and he carries everything with him there for it gives him extra hands. Haven’t had it for too long so i don’t know how long it will last hopefully a long time. I would definitely buy again.
5,Works very well on our IPads.  Worried a little that the rubber parts will break down a bit but that is not a given.  Just use the plug in a lot so that will be moving and worried it might break but that's just me thinking down the road.  Very good product.
5,I had to replace one and this fit my iPad perfect…plus the price couldn’t be beat…it even seems I can see the iPad better too my last one had a film on the glass so be sure to remove that film and you’ll be amazed as how much better it is…lol.
5,Only thing I have issues with was the cover with the plastic shield. I couldn’t get the “touch” to coordinate. Lucky they sent an extra with out the shield. Overall it’s a good buy
5,The case was easy to put on. Just as described and pictured. Easy to use with case on. Durable strong and perfect for our needs. Great product. Seller even reached out to confirm satisfaction. Great service!
5,I like how it protects my ipad both the screen and the body. I like being able to carry it with the strap. The only negative is the stand which seems to be the only weak point
5,I just wanted a case to protect the iPad since my 9-year old uses it frequently. This case was perfect as the installation was easy and the device is well protected.
5,Love it. My 2 year old uses it daily still no breaks or issues it’s alittle on the heavy side even for me. but it’s super durable it comes with 2 front screen parts the one with the film isn’t all that great so I would suggest buying a glass screen protector just in case
5,I really like how it came with alot of stuff the strap was included and an extra screen if the one gets messed up. Its really durable and my kid is going to be able to use this one easier while doing school work.
5,An amazing product. Best used without the screen protector piece it comes with. (Use an actual screen protector) The kickstand has a double locking feature that can be rotated 360°. Once on iPad gets heavy but extremely durable. I'll be keeping my eye out for more products from Seymac.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy to hold sturdy and durable case. My IPad is well protected.
5,Easy to hold nice coverage my iPad is secure in the case. A little difficult to put on but I figured if out quickly
5,Just trying to save the I pad my husband is hard on it . This is working great for us .
5,This case was a little confusing to put together but after all that it’s an awesome case. Very durable. Well made. I really like it.
5,I got this for my son's iPad which occasionally ends up on the floor. It's great I love the protection is provides and the way it stands for viewing.
5,When I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised by the weight and quality. Make sure you follow the directions when putting together. Definitely worth the price
5,Very sturdy and easy to use but had to return it because the holes didn’t line up with my iPad.
5,Awesome case. Has lasted a long time already!
1,We got this as a gift for our daughter for Christmas. Here we are not even 1 1/2 months of use in and the stand piece just snapped right off.
1,I love everything about this case but it wasn't measured correctly at all! On the side where tHe volume bottling are the slot isn't long enough so the sound continues to be lowered because the case is pushing up against it. Super diassapointed!
5,This case is amazing strong and beautiful. It protects the I pad really well. Totally recommend.
5,This case really helps keep my iPad safe. I have a little one and this case is needed. There is many attachments on the back that are helpful for multiple uses such as in the car or to set on the table. Well made product
5,I love the color and overall look of the case! I love the kickstand on back it allows me to browse and play games without something to prop up on. I haven’t needed the carry strap yet but this case is well worth the money. I love it!
5,I think the case is really good! I was looking for something that allows me to carry my iPad around without holding it. The color is more vibrant than expected but I like it. I like the fact that you can choose Which screen protector to use the one with or without the film. Looks like is well done should last.
5,We love this case and our daughter really love the colors
5,This cover was exactly what I was looking for with a handle for easy holding and a stand to prop it up.
5,My son loves it.
5,I purchase this for my older sister. She loves it very good quality I am going to buy one for my iPad.
5,Easy to hold my my young boys hands. The kick stand is a little hard for them to open and sometimes myself also. I like the feature of the hand strap as well as the option for the lanyard. Screen protector does get dirty easily so be sure to keep it wipes off. Really good product.
5,Great has protected my iPad while my daughter has banged it around
4,A little overboard but better than it breaking
3,It’s a cheap product but it will work for now
5,It perfect but a little heavy for my grandson.
5,Great Ipad protection and very sturdy.
5,I liked the durability that the case provides in the past I had flimsy one's that didn't provide great protection in case I dropped it. The SEYMAC case provides that extra protection I've been looking for.
5,The ipad case is very durable and very easy to install. It has provided great protection against the elements that I work in everyday.
5,Very durable. Easy to install.
5,Great Product Fast Shipping
2,Flimsy and doesn’t stay in place
5,Good
5,Bought for my daughter and she loves that it comes with a strap and she can put it anywhere to use.
5,Easy to install made of quality materials and keeps iPad very secure! The handle & stand are very helpful. I got it within 2 days.
5,Perfect for my son and soft to the touch.
5,Really like
5,This is a very nice big child proof case. Our little one loves it!
5,All good
1,THE BUTTON TO TURN ON IPAD IS BLOCKED. I HAVE TO OPEN THE CASE TO DO THIS EVERYTIME. SO I HAVE LEFT OFF ONE CORNER SO I AM ABLE TO TURN THE IPAD ON. MAY I RETURN OR EXCHANGE FOR A DIFFERNT IPAD COVER?
2,Overall the case was I expected however the stand is very difficult to close. My guess is that it would eventually break in my attempts to close it.  I have returned it.
2,This looked like a great case. However it doesn't fit and lock securely at the top of our ipad 5th gen so I'll probably be returning.
5,I really like the swivel hand strap. I use this for work and it it comes in handy. It also cam with two screen covers
5,Bulky but just what I needed to protect the ipad from my little one
5,I really like this product very easy to install iPad love the strap on the back easy to hold as a read a lot of books on my iPad
5,Seems to protect iPad great for my 10 year old.
5,love it
5,Using as a teacher and I love the durability and additional practicalities it provides for that setting.
5,Perfect. It is very protective and has a plastic protection film on the front.
5,Works great for little ones. Easy to hold and durable
5,This is great for my 3 year old i don't regret buying it a lot of protection from all the throws from his tantrums
5,The only thing I don't like is that you can't lie down completely because of the strap you have to hold it with your wrist
5,It's a very good quality cover  and very sturdy!
5,Easy to install and very durable. The hand rest in the back is very clutch. And the string is helpful
2,It seems to be a good product but the safety rubber does not stay on 👎🏾👎🏾 That means my iPad can fall out if I’m wear the shoulder strap🙁☹️😢
5,This enclosure is tuff just what I needed after a screen replacement note should have had this enclosure in the first place.
5,Pretty awesome case for the money
5,We have had our cases for several weeks now.  They are holding up very well.  We have dropped a couple of times and have had no damage.
5,Strong
5,I really love this  it’s easy to hold I love the sturdiest about it and love the colors
1,Plastic cover does lay flat so touch screen is awkward returning.
5,Perfect
5,Handle is in the way
1,See sbove
5,It’s kid proof. Just what I needed
5,Fits snug and doesn’t cover speakers or buttons
5,Sturdy for kids
5,My daughter like it!!!
5,Sturdy and secure
5,Only complaint the stand is dificult for t little hands
5,Just like the pictures
5,Is durable
5,This case has been good so far. Relatively easy to put on. Love that is has the built in screen protector.
5,I bought this for my 11 year olds older iPad because she has a tendency to drop it. We just had the screen repaired and she wasn't allowed to touch it until it had a case on it. 😁 I looked at the cases and showed her the options. She chose this case based on the color (sky blue) I agreed based on the features. Shockproof case very durable and sturdy; Screen protector not a thin sheet of plastic but an actual frame with a sturdy clear protector in it. The whole case fit her iPad perfectly and she loves the crossbody strap easel have strap and pen holder on the back. Overall very nice design and gives me confidence in it's ability to protect her iPad. Thank you.
5,Great protection for the iPad
5,This case fit my 5th gen IPad perfectly. The quality of it was much better than I anticipated. I am super pleased with the case and highly recommend it.
5,Perfect case for my child's I pad. Durable secure. Easy to use. Good product.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Very nice case  just wish the kick stand was a little longer. I like it.
5,I love this case for my 2 year old. The strap works well around the carseat for him to see his ipad.
5,I love it!
5,Fast shipping and just as described.
5,I like this case it’s easy to put on and take off and it has many options of holding it. I really like the screen cover that comes built in with the case. This is a Great Buy!
5,It’s the perfect fit for my fifth generation iPad!
5,The rotating handhold/stand is super convenient. I haven’t dropped my iPad - yet :) - but I have high hopes that the silicone edges will protect it. Well made and a nice selection of extra optional straps.
5,Great
5,Very durable and solid case. Very pleased with my purchase. A+ seller with excellent communication
3,Not sure if this is really made for a 6th generation Ipad. It just doesn't fit right. I can't get the case to fully close so the protective screen keeps coming off. I love the small handle that comes with it. This would be a great case if it fit right. Would love to update this if this ever gets resolved.
1,Literally garbage! Broke in exactly a month losing its window of return!!!!
4,Overall it is easy hold although quite bulky. Seems to be durable. However one month later kick stand broke
5,Product is very good quality! Easy to put on and multi functional! Highly recommend
5,I loved everything about it
5,There was absolutely no disappointment. It’s durable easy to put on and what I was looking for.Feel safer when I’m traveling now if I drop it or if the grandkids get a hold of it we’re good to go.
5,Very nice product. Fits well and looks good. The handle on the back is convenient.
5,Bought this for my toddlers iPad for Christmas and so far it’s done well. Nice design and it seems sturdy. I like that it came with the option of a front cover with the built in screen protector! And my kids like that it has a strap for your hand or a your neck.
5,Holding up well to a 2 and 6 yr old. The strap was a nice plus I hadn’t considered. Can hang it on anything.
5,I got this case for my toddler son. The case holds up very well. I like that there are two pieces of the front part of the case (one is with a screen protector; other is without it). We’ve also used the HAND strap to wrap around the bottom of the front seat headrest. It also has long straps. Great case. No complaints!
5,Ordered for my 7 year old grand son. Great value and he loved it.
5,Love this case!!! Nice and sturdy better than I expected and super quick delivery.  Will definitely buy from this seller again.
5,Love it
5,Love it.  The strap is great on the treadmill now more balancing it on the little ledge
5,It’s the best compare to other products because it’s the same price as others but it come with a handle help and screen protector. Great job to them.
5,Item arrived as expected would purchase from this seller again.
5,This iPad cover is the best for the money.  The colors available makes it hard to decide.  But the quality and sturdiness is exceptional.
5,I don't usually write reviews unless they're bad but this one us amazing! It stands up on its own is really durable and I love how safe it is. I am very satisfied with this order and know others will be too.
5,Well made
5,Great product and way to install
5,This iPad case cover arrived on time. It was easy to install over the iPad. We haven't had it for more than a couple of weeks so hard to really rate its durability but feels solid. We haven't had any issues so far. My son loves using the holder in the back and it stands up really well for watching movies. The color is great and love the built in screen protector. Definitely recommend.
5,I've been hesitating on buying a case for my ipad for years.  A few weeks ago my Ipad fell on the floor and chipped my flooring.  Finally this was the push I needed.  I decided to take the plunge and buy one that had good reviews and was a good price.  So far so good.  I'm loving it!
5,Top plastic little thin but works
5,Easy to use nice handle on back and quick to put together
5,I bought this becasue I was going on vacation with my young kids and wanted them to be able to use it in the car without worrying about my ipad being scratched or broken.  This case is great! It is very durable and I love the handle on the back. I also love that is has a place to store my apple pencil since I've already lost one. The case came with 2 front covers one with plastic covering the screen and one without.  The instructions say the one with the plastic won't work if you have a tempered glass protector on the screen but it works okay with mine it's just not as sensitive.  Overall I think this case is great and I would recommend it for sure!
5,This case is amazing. Came with everything and what surprised me it came with two front covers. One with a built in screen protector and another one without. Two different options if you have a screen protector or not. I like the lanyard and fit the iPad 5 generation perfectly. A good long term case. I like the handle on the back and it's adjustable.
5,This case was a good buy. It’s sturdy and I love that it has a strap to hang! Highly recommend it!
5,just what I needed.  easy to put on ipad. seems durable.
5,Nice case… holds up very well around my kids… lots of options on the back of the case that include a stand a handle and a strap that holds onto a headrest If you choose to use it in a car.
1,The stand broke very easily
5,Bought this case for our mobile Hookah service. Last thing we need is a shattered screen while assisting clients. Has our logo colors easy to hold and the strap to carry around is very helpful.
5,Couldn’t be happier with this purchase. It came two options one with a protective screen and one without. Would not hesitate to buy again.
5,I love everything about it color durability easy to handle and a good price.
5,Instructions are very easy to understand and the plastic tool that comes with it makes changing the edge protector very easy. The only problem I had was peeling the blue film off of screen protector.
5,The kids love the handles and straps!
5,This is a well built case. Sturdy and the back handle is great. Only problem is that it makes plugging in difficult.
5,I actually love this case! It’s not too much or too little. I don’t like the cases you need tools to take off so this is perfect. Still can handle a 2 year old getting their little hands on it.
5,Strong esthetic and durable
5,Great for kids ! Has many ways it can be held which is great for kids. Its extremely durable . Also I like the 2 options for the screen . It made it possible for me to buy a glass screen protector for it.
5,Great choice of colors perfect fit for my iPad Air 2.Great seller fast shipping
5,Very pleased with this case. Perfect fit and it keeps the iPad well protected. Worth the money.
5,Bought 2 of these one for a 7yr old and one for an adult. They 7yr old was really hard on his iPad 6th generation and we kept replacing the cases. Now he doesn’t drop his tablet as much and we haven’t replace this one yet. He slips his hand ringer into the strap or sets it up on the stand We have flown all over the country in and out of different airports checkpoints and such and it still looks as good as néw.
5,Purchased this for my sons ipad and he loves it works well and is durable
5,I love it. The color is cool and it’s very sturdy….
5,Love this product. I was very excited and satisfied with how well it did for my oldest sons ipad. That i bought a second one for my middle child. Easy to assemble. Durable. And overall toddler proof.
5,Love the protection this case provides while we travel.  Great price
5,This product exceeded my expectation. I bought it for my disabled child's use and it stand up to his wear and tear on his iPad. It also came with so many useful accessories like the strap and the top cover with or without a clear protective cover for the screen. If I could give 6 starts to this seller I would. I am very satisfied with this iPad cover.
5,seems durable and protective
5,I’m hard on my iPad. After breaking the screen for the second time decided durability over cute!  The fit for my fifth version is ok. Not exceptional but certainly NOT BAD!  Installed the screen protector in addition to the body wrapper and have found no issue with functionality ( touch etc). I’d recommend it. Pbly good for kids tablets too.  Update…. 3 months in - kickstand set button broke!  Now I’m not so sure 😵‍💫
5,I have read through some of these reviews and it’s sad that most poor reviews are due to those that are not installing the case correctly. The company has included very clear installation instructions AND the case is quite solid in my opinion. I purchased for my son and I love the the different ways to use this case. It comes with 2 case frames… 1 with a screen protector built in and 1 without. I give this 5 stars!!! I’ll update if the iPad case doesn’t last as long as I assume it should.
5,My son has a tendency to drop everything.  We love this case.  It is very durable and "son" resistant.
5,My sons iPad is very protected inside this case. He loves the color and thinks it looks so cool!
5,Have been looking for a new and durable case for a while that also holds my Apple Pencil and I think I just found it. Just received product and I am extremely happy. So far  Great product at a great price.
5,This was a gift for my 10 year old and it works great.  Very durable and she loves it!
5,The button to unlock the stand is really hard to unlock to close the stand and it’s hard to get the stand to lock back into closed so we can put our hand though the grip
4,It is exactly what was expected. Easy to carry
4,In reading the reviews I noticed someone else made the same mistake I made in installing this iPad case; if done properly it is sturdy and looks great…and works well.You MUST put the hard plastic cover either with or without the screen protector on LAST. It snaps over the rubber sides! I know that seems like a stupid mistake but I made that mistake…so learn from my error! I thought this was a piece of garbage until I saw in another review how someone had properly installed it and a light bulb went on over my head. Now I love it. Before the sides were “wavy” and loose!I figured it must be something I wasn’t doing right. I will say the enclosed instructions are confusing or at least I found them to be.This is a very good iPad caseand reasonably priced. Just put it on correctly. 🤓
5,Great tough product to help with protecting my child's Ipad.  It is super easy to install and works like a champ!  I recommend this cover for those who have children with IPad's.  It is on our 5th generation IPad.
5,Really like this product. So grateful that it scones in different sizes.  Just be mindful of the generation iPad you have when ordering.
5,So far this case has been great! Easy to use and super durable! My daughter likes the kickstand so she can stand it up while watching or designing. The spot for the pencil is really helpful!
4,Came with a cracked screen but great other than that.
5,I fell it is a good deal for the price. Materials seem quality and was easy to install my iPad. It has everything you need to keep you iPad from being destroyed if it is dropped.
5,Bought for my wife as a replacement iPad holder/cover. It is an older iPad. Pencil holder is a little hard to find - it's at the end of hand strap. Good protection when iPad is dropped.
5,I bought this to cover an iPad that had cracking in the corner and that was primarily used my my young children.  My 5-year-old’s favorite feature is the hand strap that allows him to carry manipulate and position the iPad with just one hand.  He also loves the stand mechanism.I love that it covers the cracked portion of the screen feels sturdy and has held up to daily use.  I would highly recommend this product.
5,I love this case. It is exactly  what I needed. It is very stylish and it protects my iPad really well. I have already dropped it at least two times since purchased and my iPad has been totally protected from the fall. Wish I had this before as another case that I had previously purchased did not protect my screen and therefore I already have a small crack. I like the fact that it has a small section for me to store my pen and I also like the fact that the kickstand stays in place.  Another issue I was having with another case. It also comes with an enclosed strap so I can wear it like a purse but I did not connect that one because I feel I don’t need that part. The small handle in the back is good enough for me and my small hands to carry it around. Overall I highly recommend this product.
4,Was hard for this old geezer to figure out how to put together  but it does appear to be very sturdy when put together correctly
5,Was looking for a durable case for my new iPad and this one checked all the boxes.  I am very pleased with the case and feel confident that my iPad is secure in it.  Easy to put on too!
4,This ipad case is very strong and offers several holding options to support the weight.  And the weight is what's holding this one back.  With the ipad installed the assembly is very heavy.  If you don't mind the weight this is a very nice case.
5,This is one great deal and I love it. I bought the turquoise one and after I completed the “install” of my iPad my granddaughter wanted one for her IPad. There are numerous colors to choose from.  We just finished a short trip where my granddaughter was able to hang her iPad on the back of the seat to watch a show.  It was perfect. I only wish I realized that it came with 2 screen shields…one with a built in screen protector and one without. The one without would be if you already had a glass protector or your iPad which I had. I suggest the seller list that feature in the listing details. It is a great selling point. Again . I love how durable this case is. Thanks"
5,Muy fuerte y muy bien protegida
5,Case fits my iPad perfectly. Seems to offer good protection although I am not going to drop it to see if it works. I would recommend it to anyone. I enjoy the versatility of the stand.
5,Great product! Came quickly.
5,I really like this case but the case is so strong and durable it makes the Ipad heavy but it has a stand to use.  Keeping it.
5,This is a great case!  I’m always dropping things and my husband is even happy with it and feels confident it will withstand my accidents!  The only one little thing is that it had a slight plastic smell but that went away after a couple days.  Very Satisfied with this case!
4,Non-slick rubberized case so you can get a good grip. I haven’t dropped it yet so I don’t know how well it protects your iPad but I assume it should do a good job. I thought it would be a good idea to get a more protective case but I forgot about the additional weight.It took a few minutes to figure out how to open the case. Then I was a little worried about putting it back together over the tablet but it went together easily.If you use your tablet for work outside or you tend to be clumsy this case will give good protection. It comes with a screen protector (plus a spare) but for outdoor use it would be better to also have a fold-over cover.I gave it four stars because of the weight. If I used my tablet outside like at a construction site I’d give it four and a half because I’d like a cover over the screen
4,Am using it for old iPad 9.7. Came with two top covers one with screen protector and other without. The screen protector looks like it is tinted then someone dropped acid on it - HORRIBLE!. I already have plastic covering my screen so I opted to use other one. This case is definitely a copy of the Otterbox Defender I always use for my phones. However the plastic is definitely thinner and the fit is nowhere near as tight as the OB Defender. The flimsy plastic may be cause of looser fitting. The rubber that protect the corners seem nice and think. Overall for this price point for a very old iPad I am happy with purchase.  I would not buy similar for let's say the new Pro 11 or 12 however.
5,The rubber tabs on the back easily pop out of the case back until the case is fully assembled. The screen protector top piece secures rubber part on  the sides. The rubber corners then fold over the top piece corners to bundle it all together. Once assembled the case is really good but the instructions were not that transparent. I would buy it again if needed.
3,Great case for the most part! It feels heavy-duty and it's easy to hold especially with the strap on the back! I recommend getting a glass screen protector instead of using the front case with the cheap plastic. It just feels better looks better and the touch screen works better. As for cons the strap on the back with the pull out kickstand under it is a little awkward. I wish it had a different design. Also the stand will pop and lock into place but when you set it on the table it doesn't hold very well. The tiniest bit of pressure causes my ipad to fall over so make sure you don't touch it until you're done using it.I don't know if everyone has issues with the stand but this is my experience. I wish it was better. This is mostly my reason for a 3 star review. Fix this and it's 5 stars!
5,This is the protector of your toy. Built like tank. Had to go on YouTube to make sure I was doing it right.
5,Owned otter boxes to life proof just as high quality and love the rotating handle with stand perfect for what I need
5,Great durability and easy to handle
5,I needed a protective case for my tablet as I would be using it while flying my drone.  I needed it to handle the elements and be durable this case does that and more.  Take your time and search the products out there trust me you will come back to this product and end up being glad you did.
5,Love these very happy with them
5,IT  IS A PERFECT FIT FOR ME
5,I love this case. It is very durable. I got it for my son and he’s clumsy and it’s durable. I love it.
5,Bought this for a road trip and I was able to hang it from the seat in front of me while I used my Xbox controller to play games on the iPad. Very fun experience. I also love that I can prop up the iPad in any way I want. Landscape or vertically. My iPad feels very protected and it looks so pretty. I think the green yellow combo is best. It looks like a switch lite
5,Started up a small business bought this for my husband’s iPad and we both love it it’s a great fit to the hand and it’s really comfortable I have dropped it once or twice and it’s done me well
5,Good cover
3,I purchased it to hold as I sing during a concert but it is bulky and the rubber edges keeps coming off.  I believe I will have to send it back but I’m f you have other covers I could look at maybe I could purchase one of them.Sorry just not happy with this one.Thank youJames
5,Easy to use
5,Keepps it safe and easy to hold
5,Love love love this cover! Amazing - sturdy - and great to use for your business 💜 Highly recommend if you've been for a while like I was.

5,It’s nice that it has a hand strap headrest strap and a stand.
5,Have a son with Autism and this case is doing its job as he can be rough with his iPad from time to time.
5,I bought this for my grand babies iPad. The case is standing up to the ruff and tumble life with a 5 year old and almost 2 year old. It’s a great case!
2,My kid did not like it so we didn’t use it. Very bulky.
5,My child loves it it's easy to carry she wears it across her body.
5,I was satisfied with what I got for the price. Thank God it can with a faceplate without the screen protector too because the one WITH the screen protector is bad quality. More specifically the screen protector itself. Horrible. But the case with out it is great.
5,I love this case is exactly what they described easy to install very sturdy and not heavy and my boys loves the rotating kickstand. Specially with my son’s puppy that likes to chew on everything! God! This is great it really does last.
5,Product has a good field to it and is durable I  recommend
5,Very sturdy easy to assemble
5,Bello
5,Works great and as advertised
5,shipped out fast and was just like from manufacturer. great price..
5,Got this for my g daughter.  She's a bit clumsy so I bought this for her iPad. Great very pleased with this item.
5,I bought it for my son's tablet. My son loves it very good quality !
5,I previously owned this exact case but when I took my iPad in to be worked on THEY broke it taking it off. Errrr! I swear by these cases. They’re so well made and the grip on the back just adds the icing to the cake.
5,This is the only case that really works for my kids
5,My daughter wanted a new case for her iPad and she loves this one! She did drop it once and nothing happen to it! So far so good!
5,
4,Looks good but it is a little loose.
5,I bought this for my 8 year old who is rough on her iPad cases and this one is the best I have gotten thus far!  I love that it comes with the screen protector and the rubber casing is great! We also love the kickstand so she can stand it up and watch.  Happy overall.  Totally worth it and it’s priced nicely!
5,I bought this iPad case after buying a Samsung compatible model for my sister. Once I saw hers I had to have one for my iPad. Used the case to do a neighborhood canvass and being able to carry my iPad with a shoulder strap freed up my hands and the back strap made it easy to complete participant surveys on my iPad. Never lost my stylus either because that too was attached to my case. I initially hesitated to use the front panel with the screen protector attached (included also is a front panel w/o screen protector) because I thought it would interfere with typing on the internal keyboard. To my surprise it felt more natural than the surface touch and no fingerprints or stylus marks are left on the screen protector. Rotating cover is a plus and the case color was what I expected. Shipping was as anticipated and case was packaged well. I just recommended this case to a friend who saw mine and she just ordered hers today; she’s real picky too. I haven’t dropped the case yet but the case material and rubber edges appears capable of protecting my iPad in that event. Hope I don’t have to find out though. Highly recommend purchase.
5,I have an iPad for work which looks old plus the case that I had originally broke and was very cheap. Ever since I bought this one it made a huge difference on the way the iPad looks now looks brand new and I feel fully secured
5,We wanted these for use on construction sites.  They work well no lost iPads yet.
5,Perfect fit
5,Great durable case for a 13 year old.
5,This is exactly what was needed for our iPad. Built in stand carrying strap for over the shoulder and small strap for carrying in the hand. The case is super durable.
5,Good.
5,This iPad case looks great and certainly feels sturdy I have only had it for a week so I can’t comment on its durability as yet. It is as advertised.
5,Everything!Buy itfit iPad 6th gen. Perfectly! Good valuecomparable to Otter Box
5,just what i ordered
5,Overall it’s a very good product.
5,Great fit and design.
5,The case is durable sturdy and easy to hold
1,Bad quality the silicon part never stay on place i do not recommend to get this waste of money
5,Amazing product..
5,Exactly what I wanted. Works great and durable. Would definitely buy again if needed.
5,I bought this for an aged friend who drops things so wanted to protect her iPad. I liked the neck strap  for added security. I actually took the Velcro hand strap off. The stand was a bit unstable for my friend to use but good for me when setting the machine up.  All in all a good product.
5,Excellent case. It feels strong and durable without feeling too bulky. I really like all the different holding options. It's a quality case at a fair price. I popped the screen protector off but I do that for all of my electronic cases since I use glass screen protectors.
5,This product is very sturdy and good for such a great price. Fits Great a little hard to take off in order to put the case on the ipad. but everything is good.
5,This case was definitely worth getting at first I wasn’t so sure about the backstabs being behind Velcro hand slot but surprisingly it works well. I do wish there was a little more instructions on how to close the stand but after figuring out that you push own on the little tab that’s still visible it will I click itself and will easily close back down. Aside from that I love it!
5,Great..I carry around my ipad for work and this thing is perfect! Id wear it like a purse if I didnt look silly! Lol
5,It’s sturdy!
5,Love love love
5,It was a little difficult to assemble. I’m honestly not sure whether I did it correctly. Otherwise it is a good purchase and it has been keeping my iPad safe from my 6 year old and his Wreck-it Ralph tendencies.
4,I like this product it’s easy to hold & I love the color . The only thing I don’t like is the black cover tends to come off a lot & it’s not so sturdy . Other than that this product is fine . It definitely protects !
5,I absolutely love the case. It is sturdy and hard enough to resist any regular drop from 9 year old girl and 3 year old brother. Comes with the screen protector that does a nice job keeping food away from the screen the back handle along with the strap provide an easy way of moving around with the iPad and my godchild loved having a place to hold her pencil while not using it. Worth every cent.
5,Perfect
5,Love the product
5,I really like the product. I use my iPad for job walks. The neck strap and pen holder make it easy to take pictures and make sketches of the site. The rotating grip makes for an easy hand hold. Really glad I purchased it.
5,Love how versatile & sturdy this case is!Great for preteens/teens or really anyone looking to have a well made sturdy case able to withstand basically anything.Also really love how easy it is to charge.Best case we’ve found
5,This works very well!  It protects the IPAD and makes it easier to care for!
5,I found the instructional video to be so helpful and easy to follow. I could not be happier with my purchase. The multi-color case is exactly what my child wanted. We are very pleased!
5,i love this case i can't tell you how much i do i even dropped it a few times and it held up though i didn't use the screen protector it came with it was kinda cheap but other then that i love it
5,Good
5,The case was easy to assemble and even provided two front covers one with plastic protection and one without. In addition the product even arrived or day earlier than expected. Good product.
5,Great choice of covers  our 8 year old grandson uses the iPad and it works and protects very well.
5,I love this case. It protects my iPad and it’s  still very easy to use. Highly recommend.
1,Dislike came in cracked and do not stay together didn’t feel like going through hassle sending back so trashed it
5,I love this case it’s so durable for son and how he’s always on the go with his iPad! ❤️💙❤️
2,The cover is made well except that there is a strong burning rubber smell to the soft silicone parts. It's so over powering. I tried everything to get rid of it. It's been a week and even soaking it in soap doesn't work..the smell gets on your hands as well and seems toxic to my kids to use. I bought a non-silicone cover even though I really like the handle and spinning stand....
5,Me gusta mucho se ve resistente y tiene muchas maneras de sostenerse
5,I bought this case for my 4 yr old son. He is a very hands on rough kind of kid so I was looking for a strong sturdy case and we absolutely love this one! Every feature is great the only that was kind of a bummer is that it’s pretty tough to pop out the stand in the back and I think that’s a pretty essential feature so it really bummed us out how difficult it is to pull out. Either way we are very satisfied with this case!
5,I actually bought this for my husband since he takes his iPad to various automotive plants for work. It was crucial to find something durable since he would be around heavy machinery and we can all be clumsy. He absolutely LOVES it and it looks professional for work. If you have any doubts like I did get it and you won’t regret it!
5,This case is perfect for my seven year old.  It’s durable and lighter than a lot of other cases.  My son really loves it.
5,No more dropping the IPad with this case. The grip on the back is great. Very durable and secure. The seller was very quick.
5,It got to  my door in like 3 days super fast shipping! Fits perfectly and comes with options for a built in screen protector or a facing so if you already have a screen protector on it
5,I like that it protects my iPad and was easy to assemble.  Perfect size and affordable
5,Perfect
5,Does the job! I just wish the stand could make a full 360 so you can flip it the other way around without unlocking the iPad screen if it’s locked for a specific reason. Other than that no complaints
5,Very durable
5,Exactly what we needed for the office use!
5,Ordered for my iPad. Love it! Very durable
5,installation instructions should be clearer but I figured it out. There are two frames one with screen protector and one without that's nice very durable and versatile.
5,The color is great very sturdy easy to put on
5,Bought my grandaughter an ipad and this case. She loves the case especially the carry strap!
5,Mi nino esta encantado con su protector  facil de cargar el lrotector esta muy bien reforzado.
5,Loving this. Kid proof and versatile
3,Produit acheté en juin dernier avec le blocage du pied de support déjà cassé. Donc l'étui protecteur protège bien mais on ne peut plus faire tenir le support dans quelque position que ce soit. Très très décevant....Si ce n'était de cette pièce qui rend le support inutilisable je lui aurait accordé 4 ou 5 étoiles facilement. Je vais tenter de contacter le vendeur pour voir si le service est au rendez-vous.
5,There are two face covers which is great. One face cover comes with a built in screen protector the touch is horrible for games.Lots of frustrated complaints from the kiddo probably a preferred cover for people who don’t game as it does not impact the screen visibility.The 2nd face cover is open so swapped it out and all problems solved.  The corners are well protected.Thumbs up!  (👍)
5,It’s great does what it needs to do. The straps are great for carrying and for hanging the iPad to watch In vehicles!
5,Exactly what I ordered. My 4 year old loves the colour and he hasn’t destroyed my iPad yet.
5,Item was as described it arrived early and fit perfectly. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,Ma petite fille échappe toujours mon I Pad alors maintenant je ne suis plus inquiète. Vraiment robuste
4,good case very strong. the kickstand works well  horizontally not so much vertically snaps closed too easy
5,Products good
5,Big and sturdy work’s fine for me!
