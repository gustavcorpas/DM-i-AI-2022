5,I've been very content with cable matters overall this cable is no different. After having issues with my HDMI dongles and 4k monitors and refresh rates I decided to just try the USB-C route and I was pleasantly surprised. I can confirm that a MacBook Pro and a Lenovo Ideapad 5 both can send 4k at 60 Hz with this cable no dongles no nonsense. Works great with BenQ USB-C monitor.
5,Bought to quickly connect my various laptops with usb c video to my tv through a switch. Works great and seems sturdy.
4,Headline sums it up the cable works and does what it needs to it's just thick and heavy and not flexible enough to be ideal for peripherals you'll be moving around frequently.
4,Needed a usb c to c cable that includes video display support so I can hook up a portable monitor to my work laptop. Like the company says cable matters as I tried multiple other cables that didn't include video so not all cables are created equal.Solid performance and fair price. Plug n play worked on first try.
5,I bought this cable so I could actually use the brand new Elgato FaceCam I bought. I don’t really think there’s a ton that can be said about a cable from an average consumer’s point of view so I will say: it works as described. I did notice some reviews saying the cable failed prematurely and I hope that won’t be the case but if it is at least it’s not a colossal loss.
5,I bought an Amazon Basic USB-C to USB-C cable that had specs similar to this cable - however with my DELL laptop it would not power my USB-C display.Upgrading to this cable allowed the laptop to see/use the display and also power the USB webcam plugged into one of the monitors USB ports.
5,I bought three of these to hook up a MacBook Pro to three Samsung USB-C monitors. Clean easy. Highly recommend!
4,I'm using this to replace the cable that came with the LG 5K 27" display.  The cable does *sort of* work in passing through 5K video the monitor's USB ports and power - but not all the time.  If the MacBook is using a lot of power (say by simply having Zoom running) the battery starts to drain even while connected.  If I quit Zoom the battery begins to VERY SLOWLY charge again.  (To get from 72% back to 100% it is estimating roughly 9 hours of charging time.)  If this is truly passing 100W I can't imagine how much the MacBook wants.  It worked fine using the original cable that came with the LG 5K but my cat decided that cable was just too delicious.
5,Was Pulling my hair out trying to find a cable that would display my LG ultra wide properly with my Mac.  I tried 3 other cables that worked just fine for audio and power but no video.  Was using a USBC to HDMI adapter but the display would never show properly.  This cable just works I was also able to remove the power adapter from the mix.  Amazing accomplishment. Only downside and not of the cable but Likely the computer if the computer is completely dead I had to charge with the power brick before it would work with the monitor... Didn't think to try to cable in the power brick it likely would have worked... so not a downfall of the cable but the connection method on a completely dead laptop.
2,Pretty decent price for the value but after a month it did not work as well anymore. My screen would black out and go in and out of my monitor back to my laptop.
3,Good sturdy cable but it seems like sometimes when the monitor would go to energy saver after the computer went to sleep the computer wouldn’t get charge and bump back on. That didn’t happen with the cord that came with the monitor.
5,I purchased this to supply power and data connectivity (USB and Ethernet) for a MacBook Pro 16" through a dock and it's been working perfectly for 6 months now.  Yes it's a fairly thick and heavy cable but it needs to be in order to accommodate both the 100W of charging current and 5gb/s data.  Though I've had no problems with it I just bought another to keep on hand as a spare just in case.
5,Purchased this cable to extend the 3 meter Cable Matters 4k USB C to USB C cable I previously purchased and used a female to female USB C coupler.  This whole setup is connected to my Oculus Quest for using the Oculus Link Beta with my PC and it works really well.  I am surprised how smooth Oculus PC games perform with this cable setup.  I had my expectations pretty low video quality wise. I was pleasantly surprised to have it perform as well as my Samsung Odyssey+. I can also use Steam VR with this setup.
5,Works great for connecting monitor directly to the terrible design of only USB-C ports on a 2019 MB Pro. Resolution is as advertised I have another brand that I use for another monitor that was slightly cheaper than this one but the length on this one is better and the resolution was on point with description where the cheaper one was not. Still wayyyyyy cheaper than buying than buying from bestbuy or other brick and mortar stores near me.
5,I bought this because I wanted to utilize the USB-C port on the new GPU and monitor I bought. It works perfectly for 3440x1440 video passthrough which is exactly what I wanted. Feels well made (as all Cable Matters cables have I have a number of them) and stands up to constant plugging/unplugging (I swap between a cable from my desktop and one from my work laptop pretty much every day)
5,Used to power my air via my monitor and to connect my 4k monitor to my air.No concerns currently
5,It’s a great cable. Thicker than most so won’t roll up as tightly but charges my 2021 iPad Pro 12.9” quickly.
5,Very sturdy
3,This cable works great for transferring files to and from my phone charges it using my Samsung Super Fast Charger. Overall I'd say it's a good product. However you need to be careful with it because the rubber coating is very thin. My Roomba went over it once and I had to repair the cable with electrical tape because the inside of the cable started showing. Coming from Anker products I was used to them withstanding that kind of hard use. The cable is also very stiff so tight loops are not possible.
3,Could not get to work reliably.
5,Hopefully this helps someone else this cable works for me with the Lenovo usb-c gen 2 dock.
5,The extra pieces are nice.
5,Using this with LG 27" inch 4k monitor I get display and power from the cable.  I can even connect other devices (like an iPad) to USB plugs in the back of the monitor and see devices on my MacBook through this USB-C cable. Works great!
5,Works great for a portable display. Powers the secondary monitor just fine and extends the laptop  workspace. Length is great better than the cable that came with the portable monitor.
5,Great cables. I will not use any other brand. I have tried so many others. Cable Matters cables are true to specs and exactly as described in listings. I use them both hallway home and at work. I have replaced many more expensive brands from ones from cable matters because of the quality and price. Done waste your money on big name brands just buy from cable matters.
5,Works great
1,Literally failed after 15 seconds of use as data transfer cable for an RC Radio tested other cables and radio still works with them.
5,Needed a longer USB C to USB C to connect my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 to a display with Samsung Dex.Needed to be able to transfer hd video to work  this does.
5,Used this for a USB-C KVM and it worked perfectly. It was a little on the pricey side but it got the job done.
1,My laptop charges fine with another cable. But with this one it won't charge!
5,We needed a long cord to work with our docking station at work that would provide charging and push out to two 4k displays. This one was the only one that worked!
5,Works for my MacBook Pro and Dell display. Charges and displays.
5,Delivers a quality 4K signal and enough power to keep a 15” MPB fully charged. I’m very satisfied with this purchase.
1,I bought a LG monitor to use with my laptop for school when I started last semester and came to find out my Macbook's USB-C cord was not capable of video transmission only power. So I bought this cord to connect my laptop and my monitor. The cord itself is thick and not flexible which was fine I assumed this meant it was durable. Apparently it isn't. I'm sitting here 6 months later with a cord that worked flawlessly until it stopped working last week. Just another cheap Chinese cable I guess. AVOID THIS ONE
5,Purchased this cable to test out the USB C connection from my RTX 2080 to my LG monitor.  The cable works flawlessly definitely recommended.
1,I have had this cord for less than two months and my monitor is already starting to cut in and out frequently. Do not recommend
1,I bought this cable to use with my MBP and Dell USB-C monitor. I had been using the cable that came with the monitor but after a year of use it died. I really liked having one cable going from my laptop to my monitor to drive both power and display.This cable provided the same functionality to me. It was able to deliver both power and display. However after only 3 weeks it stopped working.I have used many cables from this brand previously and don't recall ever having a problem with them so I'm very surprised.
5,Hardware indispensable
5,Needed a longer monitor cord. Works perfect.
5,great cable for my external monitor. picture is clear and great!
5,Strong and sturdy cables. A definite must have.
5,Work great!
1,I purchased this cable in December because the specs were really great. It's a sturdy cable for sure. A little on the pricier side.  I started having connectivity issues with it a month ago (4 months in) and now we're into month 5 and the cable will not stay charged at all. I can't order another because of what's going on and since my computer will not charge without a cable my entire workflow is disrupted.
2,Cable worked fine for 8 months or so now it doesn't work at all.
1,Please note this cable doesn’t support 4k@60hz doesn’t work with my Mac Pro + lg 4K only support 720p. The description is misleading it is incorrect description please correct it. FYI: to support 4k@60hz 18Gbps is the minimum requirement! This one is 5Gbps.
1,Lasted 14 days before it got to where it needs to be held at a specific angle to work properly. 2 shorter USB-c cables from 2 different manufactures do not have the same issues so it's not the ports on the laptop or the monitor.
1,Not working out of the packaging. Intermittently charges and displace my MacBook screen for 2 seconds and then goes inactive
1,As soon as I connected this I couldn't maintain my connectivity. Just didnt work.
5,Nothing to complain about. The cable looks good.
5,Seems a high quality cable. The cable is flexible and easy to manage. Seems support Display Port 1.2 and 1.4 fine. Works well with 4k 60Hz.
5,Have tons of Cable Matters products from 120V extenders to 3.5mm AUX to Display Port none with issue. Now back to the cable.For the layman first understand some electrical/computer engineering. Signal and power degrades over distance; that's just high school physics. It's very difficult to get both from A to B without sacrifices e.g. incredibly thick cable short length.Second not every sending or receiving device will be capable of ??? spec. Easy to blame the cheapest part first the cable or socket or whatever but if the device[s] can't handle it you have a bigger problem.Finally back to the cable I recently acquired several devices needing/benefitting from a USB C to C connection namely an Android phone and tablet. On top of that my EV has a bunch of chargers all USB C so I tell my passengers; they want to ride and charge they'll need this or USB C to whatever.Last word: Good cable for cheap that I leave in the car for my passengers.
5,Quick delivery questions answered promptly cables work as expected
5,i am buying all cables from Cable Matters and i am happy
5,Used this cable to extend my WAVLINK 5K adapter.  I can now tidy up all the cables on my desk.  Cable works great!
5,Great cable. Sturdy and flexible but not too thin. Connectors stay secure and they are and not too thick. Works great with my Minisforum TL50 with Thunderbolt 4 out to the USB-C port of a Dell UltraSharp U2720Q. 4k60 at 4:4:4 Chroma without at issues. No sound issues either.
5,This appears to be a well made cable. It works well connecting my Mac Air to the monitor and charging at the same time. Not all cables are two way so be aware.
5,They work
2,I have had multiple cables die after a month of use. I used it for my Lenovo dock for our classrooms to transfer data and video to the smartboards. Some of them stop transferring video signal some stop all together some do not transfer internet. Quality control can be better.Update:Continue to find that more of these cables are causing issues with displaying our laptops to the projector via a docking station. Our most recent situation is when the projector kept cutting out. I had already replaced one of these cables with a brand new one. I replaced the cable with the standard cable that came with the dock we did not use it because it was shorter than what we needed and our teachers have not had an issue with the projector since.They still work for data transfer power etc.
3,I bought this cable to use for an alternative to the very expensive Oculus Link cable but it does not work for that purpose. It registers fine to use as a data cable for my Oculus Quest (and has good data transfer speeds when used for that purpose) but does not register on my Quest as a link cable so no desktop VR on my Quest with this. I would recommend for device charging and data sync/transfer for mobile devices but skip it if you were looking at this for VR.
3,The cable has poor durability.I purchased the cable to reduce clutter between an auxiliary USB-C portable display and my computer. When I first received the cable I had no issues. The cable is thick and appears durable the thick built terminals are rigid and do not display any flex along the cable.I had used the cable for a few weeks frequently as COVID necessitated work from home. I stopped using the cable regularly in early August as I returned to work and it was no longer a necessity. In Late September I brought the monitor and cable to work; the cable had stayed in my monitor’s carrying bag and now it does not transmit video data; my monitor receives a charge and it’s internal battery will charge but I receive no display output. I used the shorter cable that came with my display and have had no issues.Now I am beyond the warrantee period and have no recourse. I am left with an overpriced USB-C cable that does not transmit display information.
5,I bought this cable to replace the 50cm long cable I received with my 4 bay harddrive enclosure. The cable is great it handles my Mac's Time Machine backups streaming and anything else I try to do. I would definitely buy it again.
3,The price is good and it works. The reasons for the low ratings are: 1. the cable is somewhat stiff; 2. most importantly the connection is loose. The USB C connection is not tight and it easily pulls out of the charger but mostly from my Lenovo laptop USB C socket. I would not buy another cable from this company.
5,Product came quick and was as advertised. No complaints
1,Longévité pas très bonne
1,Was tested with my WD external ssd. It couldn't keep a stable connection with the  desktop using the USB C 3.1 port (the drive kept being ejected/reconnected). Refunded by Amazon
5,I have a myriad of different cables from this manufacturer/supplier. So much so that this is my first port of call. The quality of the cables are verily magnificent and to-date I have never experienced any problems at all.  As for value for money? Believe me this is literally the best I’ve seen. 10/10 all day long.
5,Optimo Cavo
5,Tried a few USC-C / Thunderbolt 3 cables to connect my 2021 13" MacBook Pro to my Dell U2720Q monitor. This one works and is it a decent length. Charges my MacBook really fast and can transfer a lot of data including video at 4k.
5,I uses this as a replacement cable for kensington sd4700p docking station as original one got snapped off. This goes straight from Dell  Latitude 5280 to USB C over display port to docking docking station. I then have two monitors HDMI to HDMI and DisplayPort (DP) to HDMI Cable - everything works like a charm. Good price for or DisplayPort Alternate Mode.
5,長めのUSB-Cディスプレイケーブルが必要になり購入しました。ディスプレイケーブルとして使えるケーブルとしては長さの割にかなり安価な製品かと思いますが、今のところ全く問題なく使用できています。安価で安定した長いケーブルをお探しの方にはおすすめできると思います。商品説明には柔軟とあるものの、こちらのケーブルはかなり硬さがあるものです（USB-Cディスプレイケーブルはどれもそうなのでしょう）。スマートフォン等の充電目的でケーブルをお探しの方は、充電専用の柔軟性のあるケーブルが存在していますのでそちらがおすすめです。
5,This cable is very good and works perfectly with my Benq SW270C monitor.
5,Works great connecting my Lenovo work laptop with one of my Dell U4919DW ultrawide 49" monitors at home. No issues with charging (PD) image or using the monitor's usb-hub. Will definitely continue purchasing Cablematters cables! Highly recommended!!
5,Resistente y funcional para video
5,Like all the other cables I have bought from Amazon and there have been many it works well for about a week and that's not working. Imagine my disappointment
5,Only used one so far and inly had it for two days but they seem to be a good quality cable that charges displays video and works well with my USB-C dock
