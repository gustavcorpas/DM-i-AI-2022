5,This thing is fantastic.  I recently purchased an MSI Rainbow6 Raider series laptop and noticed that after a little while of gaming the internal fans would spin up LOUD.  The MSI Center Hardware Monitor would clock the fan speeds ~6000rpm with CPU/GPU temps both around 80*C.This stand dropped my GPU temps by ~20*C.  No noticeable change in the CPU while gaming but the laptop doesn't feel warm to the touch anymore.PROS:* QUIET - i can only hear it when I'm really listening for it.* Ergonomic - can be used on desktop or on lap and really helps elevate the monitor height to comfortable levels.  Also not a pain to use on lap both sitting 'normally' or cross-legged.  I like that the height settings are done with a single bar underneath and multiple notches in the base to hold it instead of two flimsy legs.* Lights - you can turn them off!!!  You can also change them to different colours and patterns which I don't care about.  I'm just happy I can turn off the lights.* COOL operator - even when gaming the air shooting out of the vents on the sides and rear of my laptop is body temp at warmest.  When not gaming it's not icy but it does make my lap a bit chilly.  Wild.CONS:* It's plastic.  ABS plastic but still plastic.  my least-fave material but something i was willing to live with for the sake of the other features.  The stand bar is metal but everything else is ABS.  That does keep the weight down though.* No on/off toggle switch.  If it's plugged into your laptop it's running.  You can turn down the fan speed (dunno why it's quiet on full spin) but you can't turn if off without unplugging things.* No passthru USB ports.  For the price of this unit that surprised me.  Not a deal-breaker for me but may be bad for others.* Size - can fit up to a 17.3" monitor which is great.  Will NOT fit inside a bag intended for a 15.6" laptop though.
5,My laptop dropped 30 degrees in a matter of minutes! Color scheme is fancy though I have no use for it. Only drawback - It takes 2 USB connections to run the fan and the lights. Very pleased with it.
5,Great for gaming and has many options highly recommend if ur reading comments!
5,Using this on my DELL XPS 15. I've been hearing that some people dont find this effective in cooling their laptop and I want to clear up some things. I live in Seattle and recently we hit 120 degrees and this thing worked great. Just a reminder that plugging this in your laptop will actually heat it up so try to plug it to an outlet or as you can see in my picture I have it plugged into my Anker 26800. If you want to cool your laptop just try not to have so much USB plugged into it - well thats one tip.There aren't a lot of cooling pads with a fan this huge ( 200mm) and I'd rather have that than several small ones.The RGB surround is very unique as well which initially was my reason in picking it.It comes with 2 usb plugs to power it because the manufacturer said older laptops cant power it with just 1 but if your laptop is fairly new it should be fine. But like I said try to power this from an outlet or a portable charger. If you dont like the three headed cable they gave you you can buy a normal two headed 12v dc to usb cable for about $7.I'm about to buy a 2nd one of this for my new XPS 17 and I don't regret it. However if you dont like this one two other models I would have considered are the KLIM Halo (125mm fans) and KLIM Nova.If you work from home and stare at your screen all day the extra lift from Nova and Ultimate have the highest lift. Some of these cooling pads have short 2 inch legs that don't really do anything - and they're flimsy. Look at the legs of KLIM Halo for example.All in all this is a good cooling pad. It's slim enough for travel once its folded (unlike some thicc cooling pads like KLIM Airflow) the RGB surround is an awesome and unique feature. The fan is huge at 200mm. And its good for working too since the legs stand up a good 8 inches so you're not always straining your neck looking down. But you don't have to put it this high. At the lowest laid flat its 2 inches. 3 inches on the lowest lift - which is my default setting.If there's anything I want improved on this I say 1) a normal dc to usb cable 2) a bigger AND faster fan. But really folks I haven't seen a cooling pad with a bigger fan so goodluck.And for those wishing this had extra USB ports - it's good that it doesn't. Because when you plug anything to that port the power of the fan can decrease and in addition heat up the main power source. Both bad conditions if you're thinking of plugging this directly to your laptop.Anyway I don't review products much but I protect the things that enable me to work and make a living. This thing saved my life in 120 degree temperature for several unexpected days. It really stepped up to the challenge and I hope this review helps you out.
4,This is the second Klim laptop pad I have owned. I had my first one for four years. That one had a noisy fan since it came out of the box that could be almost muted depending on the angle I set my laptop at. This pad however is utterly silent. And I don't have to turn the dial up all the way to get adequate airflow. Like one of the other reviewers I also play Final Fantasy 14 on my laptop an HP Envy x360 which is not designated for gaming but runs it just fine. This new pad has a better design overall and keeps my laptop nice and cool while I'm running any combination of FFXIV Chrome Discord and iTunes. The only thing I don't like is that the included USB cord is too long and gets tangled up with my charging cord or stuck under the stand if I lift and move it. But I'll keep buying Klim cooling pads as long as I game on a laptop.
5,nice one
5,I bought this because my laptop gets super hot when running ESO at the graphics settings I prefer. It works fantastic and it's comfortable to use on my lap as well. Love it!
4,The cables for it are very short and easy to break. I can do without the fan it helps my laptop breath by putting my laptop in an elevated position.
5,So there's two reasons why you're buying this: it's pretty and it's functional.And my god is it pretty.  You know how they often doctor up photos to make them brighter than they actually are?  This doesn't it's beautiful.  Whether daytime or night the colors are bold vibrant and make any laptop far more amazing.  I have an HP Omen 15 Studio and this has a lot of space to spare.  What's nice about a 15" laptop is that the entire computer is flushed with the ventilation system but you could easily get a 17" on here and both items will perfectly align in size guaranteed nothing will hang off.I like the stand system.  If I'm playing a video game I don't want a computer overheating and the amount of space below the laptop is extremely useful.  I have a rear vent on my laptop and the hot air just rises straight up and out.  I would be playing both Final Fantasy 14 and 15 on 4k settings and being so hot that it burned my fingers now it doesn't.Which brings me to substance.  My computer went from burning your skin hot to warm and that's a massive difference when it comes to electronics.  I would take a stroll around the open world and my computer's temperature started getting very concerning.  Now I'll occasionally feel the laptop and it won't be anywhere near that.I do concur that it's a little annoying that all the buttons are in the back.  Realistically you're not going to turn the entire machine around you're going to reach your fingers back until it feels like it could be a button or dial.  Fortunately only one dial for fan speed so you know which one you're touching.  There's also a click in the dial when the fan is off so you know which way you're turning it.Also it really is whisper quiet.  I can't tell when the fan is on unless I double-check and click the switch.I did worry about it being one single fan albeit a large one but I'm impressed how cool my laptop has become and I can't argue with the results.  If it was a pretty RGB light with no real strenght this review would be all 1s.Hopes for 2021 Model:  put the buttons on the side maybe try for USB-C because I don't use the 2nd USB port as auxilary power (1 USB 3.0 is perfectly fine to power the entire deal so I do my best to tuck away that ugly 2nd cord hanging there) and throw on two USB-C ports (in and out) right on the machine as a hub.  USB-C really is the future and now that you've got a solid old-school USB there's no reason why you can't sell a USB-C version.
5,It's a good laptop fan for around 2 years. Afterwards it doesn't keep my laptop cool and it disconnects randomly. I recommend if you don't use it for gaming. Anything intense like gaming editing and streaming will make it basically useless. It doesn't reach to the important parts of the laptop either.Get this if you're not using it for anything crazy. It will last you at least two years. Unfortunately it just isn't for my lifestyle. I'm looking to buy a new one now.
4,The KLIM Ultimate provided moderate cooling improvements to my MSI gaming laptop.I think your results will depend heavily on the chassis design of your laptop specifically how much of the bottom of the laptop has venting.For instance my laptop not only has vent cut-outs for each fan but also over most of the heat pipes. So the system benefits more from the KLIM Ultimate because the air it pushes flows directly on the heat pipes further helping to remove heat from the system.In my testing I saw at most a 3-4C improvement while playing my games.Also the fan operates nearly silently and cannot be heard at all at max speed once the laptop is placed on top of it. My internal laptop fans are louder than the KLIM Ultimate.I also wanted to quickly comment on the buttons and rgb lighting. There are 2 buttons on the back of the device that control color of the lighting and one that controls the light pattern (rainbow solid flashing off). And everything works just fine!My only gripe with the lighting is I wish they had a button or dial to adjust the brightness. These things are BRIGHT in a dark room so a lot of the time I opt to turn them off at night to prevent eye strain. Certainly not a deal breaker by any means though!Ultimately I think the price of this device is high for what you get. But the device so far has worked flawlessly and it seems like other customers like myself are happy with it too. I opted to spend money on this better-reviewed device over cheaper alternatives and that is a choice you will have to weigh too.
4,This fan stand does what I need it to do and in style! You can barely hear the fan running (I’m using it with a GU501 so it’s exponentially more quiet than my obnoxiously loud laptop internal fans) and the RGB features is the icing on the cake!An unnecessary and overly opinionated suggestion: the only thing this fan needs is an on/off switch. Yes I could just plug it into my laptop I know. But if you’re like me and already have a cluster of cables on your desk with no free USB ports (just use a usb hub dude I know but no my desk is already a cable nightmare…I can’t be the only one…) you have to draw its power elsewhere to help control the chaos of cables. Aside from my personal life choices with arguably too many peripherals connected and Asus’s decision to not include an ethernet port (sigh…) forcing me to use a usb-to-ethernet adapter if I want a hardwired connection….this fan is still worth buying.
4,A few drawbacks but overall I'm happy with it. I have two complaints which are height adjustments and missing RGB colors.The lowest height is too much of an incline for typing comfortably. When putting the pad in a flat position it's rather uncomfortable to type compared to having simply my laptop on the desk. I wish for more adjustment flexibility rather than simply having the 4 preset levels.In regards to the RGB modes violet yellow and aqua are missing in the solid or fixed option. It's in the other modes like fading and flashing. Why not include it along with the other colors?I lied there's another issue and that the bounce effect this has when typing on it. The screen on a '21 G15 Zephyrus will move around like you're sitting in a 4.5 magnitude earthquake.
5,I don’t often write reviews only when a product is special and is deserving of the time. This is one of those times. This fan made me feel a thousand times better about using my new gaming laptop. The built in fans were not cutting it and the bottom of the laptop was extremely hot to the touch. The PC cost over $3000 with the ram and SSD upgrades I purchased for it and the idea of at best possibly ruining my battery eventually to at worst frying my mother board or CPU was terrifying. So I was on the hunt for a laptop cooling fan. I researched a few different options but after looking carefully and reading several reviews I decided to give this a shot. The grate is a nice feeling metal and the cooling pad itself is light but extremely sturdy. It doesn’t feel cheap despite the plastic build for the rest of the parts. The RGB is beautiful and it is big enough for my big 17” QHD laptop. I tested my computer using all ultra settings (with my fancy RTX3070) and the computers bottom was COOL to the touch. It was so hot before it hurt my hand on the hottest parts of the lap top. The fan is much more silent than I imagined even on the highest setting. The adjustable height bottom is perfect for getting the right ergonomics as I sit on the floor when I’m gaming due to the low table in the living room so my hands don’t hurt at all while playing. This machine was worth every dollar and not only that but the creators of the cooling pad even left a hilarious note about how it’s packaged before it arrives to you. No spoilers you will have to by one yourself but let’s just say it gave me a good laugh and made the product feel premium like it is. 100% satisfied. I heard their customer service is amazing too but I wouldn’t know because it worked perfectly directly out the box.
5,I was having the start of heat issues with my laptop. I researched several laptop fans and this one was near the top of the list for the price I was willing to pay. The fan is super quiet (and I have even checked to make sure it's working). I don't care for the crazy lights and luckily there is a mode of no lights..Not sure about traveling with it but will see when the time arrives.
5,I have my MSI GP66 Leopard 11UH on this cooler and it definitely brings down the temperature!After contacting KLIM Customer Support I found out that the 2 USBs on this cooler are for the purpose of incase just one USB port not providing enough power to the cooler so the 2nd one could be plugged in to provide enough power! I've only needed to use one USB though.Easy to clean with a hand vacuum or can of compressed air.The colors are pretty neat too!
3,Ok well. I bought my first gaming laptop and I read things that discussed GPU temperatures. I found this laptop cooling stand on Amazon and decided to purchase it. Well first the stand is very nice. It’s adjustable and also very sturdy. Your laptop is safe on this stand and it does make things easier. Also the RGB lighting looks nice and it’s fun to watch while gaming. So in that respect I would give this stand 5 stars. However unless I’m doing something wrong it has ZERO effect on the cooling of the GPU or CPU. I have a Legion 7 laptop and the temps are the same with or without the stand. The fan on this stand is more of a gimmick I guess not sure. I’m also new to gaming so if I’m doing something wrong I’ll change my review. I’m running at about 68 degrees centigrade WITH OR WITHOUT this stand. I didn’t return it because I actually like the stand. Also it appears that 68 degrees centigrade isn’t bad from what I’ve read so no worries I guess. I gave this stand 3 stars which might be a bit too generous since the cooling feature doesn’t do anything. Anyway that’s it. Great item for a stand. Poor for cooling.
4,This is massive. Far too big for a 15.6” laptop. Only get this if you are a non mobile user with a full size laptop. It cools very well. It takes two USB ports and the rgb is alright. Not great not terrible… 3.6 on that. The klim pro is a better alternative if you need a smaller more efficient cpu cooler.
4,I did a lot of research on laptop cooling stands and finally settled on the KLIM Ultimate. My ultimate reason for this decision was having a single large fan and the ability to adjust the angle. I suspected that some of the competing stands with multiple fans had to be louder. Since I use my MacBook Pro as part of my Zoom conferencing set up with highly sensitive condenser microphones it was very important that the cooler stand was quiet. As any recording musician can tell you microphones hear EVERY sound in the house! The KLIM Ultimate is very quiet: barely noticeable during Zoom meetings. The fan does keep the surface of the laptop chilly. However I also cleaned out the dust inside my Mac and replaced the thermal paste so it's difficult to know how much the improved performance (complete lack of thermal throttling MUCH faster processing times for CPU intensive things like iMovie video exports etc.) is due to the KLIM Ultimate and how much is due to fixing my Mac. I don't use the lights at all but it's fun to know they're there. The size is perfect for a 15-inch MacBook Pro and I REALLY like the adjustable tilt not only for desk use but also for the lap or watching movies in bed. Only complaint: I'm not sure what the hell I'm supposed to do with the dual USB power cable; where is that extra male USB supposed to plug in? I would understand if it was a female USB so you could plug another device into it. This just gets in the way. But it is nice that the power cable is detachable from the cooler stand unlike some stands that have it dangling on it all the time. I also like that the stand has rubber feet so it sits securely on a desk. So far happy with the KLIM Ultimate.
4,Pretty quiet I dont hear it over my OMEN fan and the lights are a nice touch.
4,i don't care about the lighting so unplugged it internally.  i'm getting a 'fan malfunction' error on laptop starting though it only occasionally runs hot on its own. so when my laptop is running hot i get this cooler out and plug it in.  so far no special issues noted on pulling down the computer battery as i plug this cooler into a computer usb port.  the fan so far is entirely dependable and definitely makes a difference and it is quiet.  issue:  I REALLY wish there was a non-clunky way to clip the cooler to the laptop to hold it in place; i use the laptop usually not sitting on a hard level surface.  that isn't a particular fault of this product but all such cooler pads i have looked at.  I wish there was an industrial-grade or milspec cooler pad.oh well i like this product ok and it does the job.ps  the supplied power cord with this unit has a small coaxial plug into the unit-- WHY not use a small standard usb  plug like so much else?  at the other end of the cord are two usb A plugs not one.  found in a review somewhere that this is so one can power the cooler from two usb sockets simultaneously if one usb cannot deliver the needed power. (each usb would  have to be separately rated for current capacity)  I measured the current draw at 0.24-0.26 amps (recall I unhooked the lights)  so this shouldn't be a problem.
4,I've a 17-inch laptop not "ruggedized" but with some heft certainly more than a smaller one or tablet. I'm no gamer and am told that I touch-type like Vladimir Horowitz. Indeed set at the lowest angle on a firm wooden desk surface this cooling pad bounces. To be fair some may prefer that condition but my first such product was an NZXT Cryo LX that I'd still use if its rubber components hadn't mystifyingly deteriorated.All else appears functional it's certainly quiet and the rim colors are pretty if not distracting. Time will tell of its durability and effectiveness. I have the accompanying USB cable plugged into a desktop outlet instead of the laptop proper. I'll also explore and report on the potential for using a suitable US5VDC-AC adapter and cord plug as I'd done with the Klim Cool + metal laptop cooler fan.
4,My one issue is that it doesn't have a fan speed adjustment. No biggie. Other than that it works great.
4,As a laptop cooling stand the Pad is quite effective. The built-in fan moves a fair amount of air and the large mesh screen inset provides your laptop with plenty of area to feed the intakes of its internal fans. The lighting is quite bright and provides a dramatic backdrop. The only real negative is the cord that comes with the unit. It is a USB to power-pin cord and has two inline USB connections. The user manual does not do anything to explain that the cord has two USB connections because early PCs had low-power USB ports and therefore need both USBs plugged in to provide enough power to run the lights and fan. Additionally the cord is very very short (about two feet) which means you are limited as to where the pad can be plugged in; if you already have a wired mouse gaming keypad and USB wired headset connected you probably don't have an available port to connect the pad and have to hope the cord will reach an auxiliary USB port on one of your peripherals. The one thing I would love to see changed is either including a (much) longer cord or changing the power port on the pad to use one of the USB plug form factors so we can buy our own cable to suit our needs. A nice alternate would be an actual wall-power adapter since the pad cannot be controlled over USB anyway.
4,Product was great . Only problem I have is  I wish they would be more detailed in there product. I’m running a omen i7 17.3 screen and coming in at a hefty weight of 11.3 pounds ..... that being said you can get the stand up to two notches and that’s it. Any higher and that bad boy will fall off . Not really a deal breaker but should be mentioned in the description . I’m very satisfied with this product as it doubles as a fan and a stand!  Really does help cool my hefty gaming machine . So if you have a big lap top like me just know it will support the weight but will not rise all the way up due to the weight and the stand not being able to hold the lap top. Other then that it’s an amazing product and highly recommended! Doesn’t feel cheap and the lights are nice to!  But it would be nice in the future to have a big boy version so we could tilt our laptops  more to!!! We wanna look cool to and we’ll it would help with posture etc.  please make it happen!
3,Thought the big fan would of really pushed some air out.  Wish I had read reviews first.  Its nice but definately could use a different fan.  I bought for gaming and noise I really don't care how loud it gets if it cooling it down.  Just seems like the fan is underpowered or something or blade design on it isn't very good.  If u want cooling I'd suggest one with more fans.
5,This cooling pad works very well. My MacBook Pro was getting hot and that is a problem. After placing my laptop on the cooling pad and using my laptop for over an hour the bottom of the laptop was almost but not quite room temperature.  This is a tremendous improvement that will prolong the life of my (expensive) laptop.  The fan is quiet and moves as much or more air than more expensive devices. The ability to change the angle is convenient. The little tab that keeps the laptop from sliding off of it is nice. Personally I don't have any use for the LED variable color lights around the edges but they are there and that is okay. I was going to get another cheap cooling pad but wow I am glad I bought this one. You can spend a $200-$400+ for cooling pads but why? This one works and it works well.
3,Overpriced and underpowered for what it is. At max speed air flow is too low.
5,I'll admit I was skeptical about buying this cooler. At first I thought it was just pretty lights and overpriced and that the multi fan ones that go faster and move more air would do a better job at cooling my new rig. I was bored on a Sunday browsing amazon and I had a birthday gift card burning a hole in my pocket so I figured what the heck; I'll give it a try. I bought two other coolers as well to compare. The vacuum one and one of the multi-fan ones that moves 15 more btu's or whatever than this one claimed to. This one beat them all and it looks stunning. The LED is so bright it even outshines my GE66 Raider which is if you've seen it up close: super bright and flashy. I posted temps from both my cpu and gpu and I'm honestly amazed it got that cool. The other models I would put my hand up to just to see if they were on and blowing air and it was hard to tell. With this one I was holding it for a minute and had to put it down because my hand was getting numb from how cold it was. Definitely would recommend esp  if you've got a gaming rig you're trying to keep alive a little longer
5,I have had this for about a month now and have been thoroughly enjoying it as an everyday kind of tray that I keep my laptop on and take with me around the house. Half the time I don't even have to turn on the fan because being raised from my lap and the blankets does enough to keep the temperature low enough.I got an inexpensive adapter to use it directly plugged into my 2018 15" Macbook Pro (USB C).At first I thought it would only do the solid color in the RBGW choices but then I discovered a secret setting to keep it on the solid color of whichever you like the most. First you have to put it on the second color changing setting - the slow color change mode - (using the middle button closest to the fan dial). Second once you reach the color you like you press the first button (furthest from the fan dial) and boom - you can keep it on the solid color of your own choice - my favs are the golden yellow color and teal.The other bonus I've been enjoying a lot is that it protects my cables sticking out the side of the laptop when I carry it around my house. No more worrying about bending and breaking the connectors if I am to pick it up or accidentally lean with it against the cable!
5,This Laptop Cooler Actually Cools Down My Laptop and Looks Good While doing it. It isn't loud at all. I sometimes have to put my hand over the sides to feel the air coming out to make sure it is on it is so quiet. The RGB lights give a Nice Glow and has many different functions. I just keep it on the Scrolling Rainbow 🌈 it matches My RGB Keyboard Perfectly. My Laptop is an HP Omen 015 and it fits like it was made for this cooler. Check it Out! I added some pictures.
5,I recently bought a gaming laptop and was absolutely floored by how hot it kept getting even when running older games. The built-in cooler boost fan did a great job of cooling down but it's also insanely loud. Fortunately all it took was a google search and a purchase to find the perfect solution: the KLIM Ultimate cooling pad.If your setup is anything like mine it already glows with the light of 1000 RGBs(seriously it's difficult to find anything that doesn't pulse with color now) so any new accessory is basically required to light up. While not a feature I was actively searching for I'm glad I went with a RGB cooling pad because this one is bright and pretty and now it's hard to picture my laptop without the cooling pad's calming glow beneath.Not only does it look great but my laptop's average temp has gone down drastically and it never reaches the insane peaks it did before. In addition to a great fan this pad also has multiple elevation settings so you can maximize airflow(say goodbye to using a precarious stack of books).  Of course the fan does make some noise but it doesn't really matter since my laptop fan drowns it out once I start gaming(plus you can turn it off whenever you don't need the additional cooling).Overall I'm quite impressed by this thing. It went from being an accessory that I hated needing to one that I enjoy having. If you have a hot laptop look no further; the KLIM Ultimate is the last word on cooling pads.
5,I was very impressed by the packaging and quality of the KLIM Ultimate. I noticed that my laptop would get pretty hot at times the cooling stand not only addresses this issue through its giant fan but also through the stand itself as it raises the laptop off the table surface allowing for substantial airflow underneath the laptop. Moreover the stand is made out of a lightweight metal so quite sturdy and resistant to high temperatures. I have a 17 inch laptop and it fits perfectly plus the stand has various height settings so you can adjust to the correct level for your eye line and is also extremely portable (it fits into my laptop bag). Obviously the RGB lighting is another bonus mostly aesthetic but can be useful in darker rooms best part being you can turn it off at the touch of a button. Finally the part I was most worried about was how loud the fan was going to be. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it makes virtually no sound at all to the point that I sometimes have to double check that it's even on! There is also a dial to control the fan which can be completely turned off if desired which is nice because I don't need it 24/7. Great product highly recommended excellent customer service.
3,I didn't see the purpose of spending 70$ on a fan that cannot move a Kleenex tissueSo I returned it I was expecting so much more from this device based on the reviewsIf I want a piece of plastic that lights up I'll just pick up one of the pads for 20$.This thing couldn't handle a gaming laptop I feel bad for people that believe this will prevent extreme heat.I played with the buttons tweaked the wheel to max and just a gentle breeze.Update found something much better 4500 rpm it actually cools for heavy gaming. AFMAT StoreGaming Laptop Cooling Pad 4500RPM Strongest Laptop Cooler 17.3 inch Laptop Cooling Stand with Faster Heat Dissipation Colorful Lights Adjustable Mount Stand Temperature Drops by 20-30 DegreesThe perfect power house "blower" anything else is just protecting your legs and not your laptop from heat.This one is much better for 60$You NEED 4500 rpm for gaming anything less is just protecting your knees my rtx 2060 laptop was getting too hot playing PSO2 NG BDO and Warframe.It was causing my avatar to always lag about when your laptop is more focused on cooling than running the game you can easily see it in the frames.I attached this cooler to a power strip with usb plug-ins cranked it up to 4500 and the laptop could focus on playing the game and not cooling and throttling to reduce heat.This cooler did worry me at first by it being USB powered but the 4500 rpm speed was no lie I would get a power strip with usb plug-ins though don't put unnecessary strain on a gaming laptop.
5,I was skeptical of the 1 large fan versus the other styles with multiple fans.. but even on a top gaming lap top it seems to do the job very well. Playing numerous games it kept my Alienware 15'' laptop cool and preforming at peak performance for the entire duration of game play. Very impressed. The color scheme and fan speed options are also top notch.  I definitely recommend this product.
5,The cooler does the job for the most part. My system still gets a bit warm but the games run. I could care less about a little fan noise the way I use my system. The lights and their different modes are solid. Had a problem several months in and the KLIM team fixed it asap. It’s really nice when companies stand behind their stuff.
5,I'm a regular laptop user; it is very cooling on the lowest setting.  the best thing I like about it is that it is very quiet! The lighting is nice nut I seldom use it.
4,The LEDs are nice and Bright materials feel like quality its quiet but blows cold over all I am happy with my purchase
5,While the fan inside isn't very powerful and the RGB modes/colors could be a lot better/more varied it's not bad for $80 (price on Amazon when I bought it as of this post it's $67). I do notice a 1-5℉ difference between using it and not using the fan at full blast with my Strix SCAR 17 (2021 model) so that's nice. Colors are BRIGHT but again I'd like more variation to the colors in the other modes and maybe more modes. (You can change some of them with messing with the buttons the instructions tell you how). Pretty awesome device though being able to stage the laptop off the table with the stand increases airflow drastically at least but might not feel so ergonomic. Also the cable it comes with to connect it to your laptop for power doesn't need both connectors plugged in as long as you're plugged into a 3.0 or higher port it seems (I haven't ever had to plug both in).
4,Compared to my old Zalman laptop cooler this one is lighter and more strong fan. adjusting levels of height is a boon to your spine !
5,Amazing product!Pretty quiet great LED system.Absolutely comfortable and great for the gaming I can run 4 games in my laptop high quality and when the computer gets HOT!  its getting cooler immediately.
4,All in all it's working well comfortably and flexibility wise. One thing tho the RGB lighting is defective from time to time. I don't really mind but could be better.
4,This cooler did exactly what it was supposed to do. So it gets 4 stars....but i tested out a $25 a $40 and this one and it does the same as the others do. But i will say it looks cooler lol. Rgb looks cool but doesnt cool any better than the cheap ones
5,Product is excellent works as advertised. Wish there was a power switch instead of cycling through light options to turn it off.
4,It definitely does cool my laptop but I was expecting the fan to be much quieter.  It seems to be a defect in the motor bearings though so this might be unique to my purchase.  I feel like I could be getting a lot more air movement for the level of noise it makes.  Also while the ability to adjust the fan speed is nice I can't see anyone using it at anything but full speed.The ability to turn off the lights well-appreciated because the lights are pretty obnoxiously bright.  I'm not really an RBG person though.For some reason the power cord has two USB inputs.  It only needs one plugged in to work so I'm really quite perplexed as to what the other input is for.It is pretty thick and the fixed angles you can adjust it to are fairly dramatic.  I've just been using it flat.I've used it for probably about 100 hours now and it seems to be performing fine.
4,Updated my review after playing with this cooler more.... the "whisper quiet" comments and the manufacturer's own statement that it's only 23db I can only assume apply when the fan is at its absolute lowest setting. When it's on full blast it's definitely noticeably loud and more like 60db.However after buying and returning 4 other cheaper coolers... well.. this is probably as good as it gets so I have to give it a reasonable rating since the others are all so bad and so much louder.Biggest downside is the lack of extra USB ports and that it'll even use 2x USB for max cooling but since it's for office desk usage that's fine by me and I'll say right away it's noticeably stronger if you plug in both USB cables.All in all this is the one I think I'll keep.
3,Love how effective and quiet it is. The RGB lights turn off so that’s nice.My main complaint is it uses two USB ports but does add any ports on the unit.
4,I was going to buy a lower priced product but the reviews for some of the cheaper products did not sit right with me.  Most of them indicated that the other products seemed flimsy/cheap and didn't always cool very effectively. When I found this product and company online I was encouraged by the reviews and also by the evidence that KLIM cares about it's customers.  There we're several responses to customer questions/issues that suggested this.  I have a 15.x inch MSI gaming laptop and often game while sitting in a recliner with the laptop on a large book on my lap.  The heat generated by the laptop was intense.  The book would get very warm and actually seep through the book to my legs.  While using this product that no longer happens and the air blowing from the laptop fans is noticebly cooler to the touch.  I did not take temp readings before or after but I don't feel the need to as this product appears to have satisfied what I was attempting to accomplish (a happier/cooler laptop and lap!)
5,Product is nice and quiet has has a stop for the laptop to prevent it from sliding off the Surface of the fan and  has an adjustable tilt feature if you use it on a tabletop.  I'd recommend.
4,Serves its purpose very well keep my laptop cooler and elevated. Lights function well.Only cons. Lights are extremely bright. My brightest lights by far. Distractingly so i’d rather maintain max fan speed and adjust brightness.When gaming on main screen I have to shut the stands lights off because they are so bright and distracting.Also I can’t figure out how to keep the lights on fuchsia /purple every other color but that.
5,I work from home and create corporate training videos. My work laptop’s fans usually kick on while working with my audio and video editing software and they are pretty distracting. If I need to record audio I usually shut down my laptop to let it cool for a while before a recording session which interferes with my productivity and turn around times. While it’s only my first day with my cooling pad I can say that my laptop’s fans have not kicked on once with the pad at the highest speed so I’ve been editing nonstop all day. It’s also QUIET very impressed. I could probably get away with leaving it on while recording and the background noise would be very minimal. I’m also not a huge fan of RGB lighting but having the option there is nice and it does look pretty sweet when lit. Overall I recommend it. Hoping the quality is there for longevity of use as it was double the price of others on here.
5,Overall this is great stuff. fan is quiet and you could turn the light off. One suggestion is the height adjustability. The pad is quite inclined with an angle of 30 degrees from the horizontal.
5,I have had this laptop cooler for two days and so far it is EXCELLENT.  Before receiving this my 17" MSI laptop was chronically running hot.  The internal fan was almost always wheezing away trying to keep things cool not very successfully.Now my laptop is cool.  The area above the CPU is just slightly warm to the touch but otherwise the laptop feels consistently cool.  Huge difference.  The laptop now never needs to engage its noisy rickety internal fan.I enjoy sitting in bed working on occasion and this cooling platform props up comfortably and maintains ventilation.  I dont care much for the lighting feature but I leave the lights OFF so no problemo.This product I suspect works well because it uses ONE fan.  A few years back I bought the following multi-fan cooling pad and it was a piece of TRASH:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FQ7OGQU
5,My original unit had a power cord issue after two years of use. I contacted KLIM and had the best customer service experience to date!  I had spoken with several individuals and was treated with courtesy and respect throughout the troubleshooting and replacement process.  Great company great people!
4,So I like to keep my reviews honest and here is the deal this looks amazing I mean it’s by far the best looking laptop cooler you can get if you love RGB then buy it.The issue is it’s sold as a laptop cooler and it has no airflow.I did the true test I put the fan on full speed and placed a dollar bill over the fan and it never moved at all.In order for this item to cool laptops you must have some kind of airflow or it’s just a thing that looks pretty.I tested this on my MSI gaming laptop and it had zero impact I tested 1 that is $20 more on here and it not only blew the dollar bill on the floor but significantly cooled my laptop during gaming.If you want a cool looking laptop cooler then get this if you want one that actually cools then I would not honestly recommend it.
4,Product did help a little probably better than most cooling pads out there keeps the laptop cooler for a lot longer than without it
5,The cable went out after some time but customer service sent me a new pad and it works great once again!  Thanks
5,Originally There was no power cord included with my cooling system I contacted the KLIM and informed them about the situation. They worked very hard to get a power cord to me as fast as possible. Unfortunately the postal system had other plans. They ended up just sending me a whole new unit and it it awesome!! I love it and it works great!
5,Honestly didn't except that much from this laptop cooler pad but I love how you can turn off the lights and change colors. I also like how the fan is really quiet. You can change the fan intensity by using a wheel. I still thought the fan wasn't as strong but once you have your laptop in the pad it's a different story. The fan got significantly cooler because my 15.6 inch laptop covers the whole top of the fan and it the cool air stays in the cooling fan longer while the metal part covering the fan is always cold and helps the laptop cool better. Overall I'm happy for this price and people don't talk much about the usb but there is 2 usb in case your laptop is not strong enough to use just one. They also added the note how they made sure to sanitizer the laptop and had expert people recoding if it is working properly.
5,This thing is cool and all and reliable but it barely cools anything down the fan placement is terrible for 7 out of 10 laptops I tested it with. Not Mac friendly in the slightest will not cool back plate. For ACER computers you’ll have better luck somewhere else. Best match would be asus computers as they work well with this fan actually seeing cooling!
5,Purchased this for my Alienware M15 R4 which runs pretty hot.  I've found this laptop cooling pad to be effective and stylish.  I would say that it fits perfect and I wouldn't want to put anything larger on it or it would both hang over the sides and therefore cover up the RGB which I really like. The incline adjustment is pretty solid for plastic and is a very nice feature.  I recently purchased the thermaltake Massive 20RGB for my wife's M17R3 and while that fits better for her larger laptop I really like Klim's version (I think it's the same exact fan and controls) much better due to the adjustable incline.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The noise level is very mild it is ergonomic and cools perfect. There are buttons on the back to adjust fan speed and lights.Please note that if your laptop has USB C ports you will need an USB C adapter which will have to be purchased separately.I would definitely recommend this laptop cooling fan
4,The product overall is really well made.... However there could have been more height adjustments on this I'd love to have it set lower but the default lowest adjustment sits really high. The other two adjustments provided have an insane height added to them to the point it's almost impractical if you want to use your laptop with it. You pay a decent price for these but you don't get the laptop cooling that you actually need the fan's rpms are very low hence the quietness of this device. This is more for cosmetics and devices with MAX-Q GPUs (which are GPUs with nearly 50% performance reduction) . If you have an actual gaming laptop I'm not sure I can recommend this as there are better options out there to make sure your gaming laptop has a bit more cooling for those intense internal components.
2,Had this out of the box for less than ten minutes before I knew it wouldn't serve my needs.First off it's very wobbly. When you're running a nice gaming rig you don't want instability below it.It's made entirely of plastic.It takes up two USB ports on your laptop so if you run a headset and mouse you'll need to have four ports or buy a USB hub.For the price I couldn't justify keeping it around. Returned it and ordered a different brand.
5,Keeps a high temp machine in the 70 to 90 c range.  Happy camper here
4,Received one that was dead on arrival had Amazon ship me a replacement which works perfectly.  It really is beautiful but more than that the large fan is virtually silent even at full speed and it pushes just enough air toward my laptop's fans to keep it just a little bit cooler.  My only slight complaints are (1) even at the lowest incline it's still tilted farther up than it needs to be to make room for airflow it would be nice if it would decline one more notch and (2) the included usb cable for some reason has two USBs at the end so no matter what I do there's a useless USB plug dangling next to my mouse.  Minor complaints for a beautiful & functional product though.
4,The airman creates not enough r wind to reduc the heat should have a bigger power
4,After using a less expensive pad I went to this one figuring that for the price it would be able to keep my laptop from overheating.  It is much better than cheaper pads but still does not always keep the temperature down.  The color feature is nice but distracting.  Cut the color and add to the fan power.
5,I have been using this cooling pad for a couple of months. So far so good! It definitely keeps my Alienware gaming laptop cool. It hasn't overheat since starting to use it. Love the colors and the different patterns I can change it to. It is very quiet for being a bigger cooling pad. The different angles I can change it to is a big plus for me as well the comfort level it has sitting on my lap. It doesn't have that those uncomfortable little tabs that you have to flip up or down. I had one that had those on the bottom and they were super uncomfortable and often dug into my legs while sitting on my lap. So glad I found this little gem! Definitely worth the money. The only thing I would change about it would be being able to shut the lights off or be able to adjust the brightness for when I am sleeping.
4,- This laptop cooler works and looks great.- It has dual USB on one end so you will need to have 2 side by side USB ports (most do).- I have used it a few times while it was 90's outdoors while working on PLC programming and the laptop stayed much cooler. Let someone else try it as well and it made a large difference.- Easy to blow out (clean) with a can of air and vacuum.-1 StarIn solid color mode there is no purple. Purple does work in the other modes but not in the solid mode. How did this ever get by QA/QC/Design? Obviously someone did not test it.
5,I got this item for my 15-inch laptop and now am using it for my 17-inch laptop. The colors are very bright. The noise level is so low that you cannot even tell that it is on.I've had other cooling pads but this is by far the best one I've had the pleasure to own. Would buy it again and would recommend it to anyone who wants one.
3,I am a voice actor and was using this in my recording studio to prevent my laptop’s fan from running so much. Unfortunately this cooling pad wasn’t up to the task. Even at the highest fan setting my laptop’s fan would still come on at high speed often. The Noise of the pad was less annoying and easier to edit out than the laptop noise but when this cooling pad didn’t prevent the laptop fan from running it is of no use to me so I’m returning it.
5,This cooling pad does exactly what it's meant to do. And in style! I needed a cooling pad for my Alienware gaming laptop.. it has a 2060 gpu and is paper thin so as you can imagine it gets quite warm after a while. This cooling pad keeps it cool. Not only that you can prop your laptop up at several different angles (with a small lip that holds the laptop in when it's propped at an angle) depending on your preference. It also looks great with the RGB light (everyone knows good RBG's improve your gaming lol)! Finally the cooling fan is all but silent.. I record a lot of audio with an external mic right at the computer.. and the built-in cooling fan doesn't pick up at all.. and the mic is super sensitive. All-in-all great purchase! Highly recommended for cooling during laptop gaming great ergonomics and good looks!
2,February 2021 edit: These cooling pads are more trouble than they are worth. My fan is super loud now. Not a huge deal because I'm wearing my headset all the time with music running. It might be an issue for other people though. One of the cords on one of the other cooling pads has shorted so the lights and fan keep flickering off and on with just the slightest move. And replacing the cord isn't as simple as just using another double sided usb. The only thing about this cooling pad that I still like is the tilting.I wanted a cooling pad that had the rainbow colors and this is the one that popped up. I'm not extremely impressed with the usb cord. I thought it was going to be double sided usb but it's not. So it's going to be just that much more difficult to replace the cord should I ever need to. Not even any usb ports on it to replace the usb port it's using on my laptop. My fault for not paying attention though. I wound up buying 3 of them. One for my mom her best friend and me. My mom got hers to replace a havit she bought that only glows blue. It's still in great condition but it doesn't tilt and it didn't have the rainbow colors and that what she wanted. She saw mine and immediately wanted the same one. Her friend did too. The tilting feature was what we all love about this. Working from home is a pain when you're looking down at your screen all the time. This way my screen is level with my face. Cord aside it's very sturdy and does its job of keeping my laptop cool. All in all I'm very happy with my purchase.
4,idk how effective the actual cooling is... running certain MMOs with this fan on i can still feel certain keys getting rather warm. Having said that it's better than nothing and it certainly looks cool.
5,It works well. Had it for a good long while and it’s still going. One thing bother me is the short little plug
5,Great pad. Super light. Many color options.Had an issue with a lost power cord customer service sent me two free replacements no questions asked.10/10
5,I ordered this laptop cooling fan and loved it. About a month after owning it I was careless and dropped it and broke the power supply. I contacted customer service asking if I could purchase just the power supply. They said they do not sell them as a standalone purchase but instead offered me a full replacement. Keep in mind that it broke due to my negligence. They could have done nothing but they went way above and beyond. Thank you!!!!
5,Gaming on old laptop
5,This cooling pad is perfect for the Lenovo Gaming Laptop. Keeps the air flowing and the RGB is a nice plus! Definitely recommend this
2,If you’re looking for a nice looking cpu cooling pad with the nice colored lights then this might be right up there on your listbut for cooling this is not so  great  the fan turned all the way up and the air putting out is so weak .I’m looking for a new cooling pad this won’t do..
4,This laptop cooling fan is so quiet I don’t hear it at all. I was told by people not to expect it to reduce the fan noise on my laptop but so far it HAS reduced the laptop fan noise.  It’s only been a few days but I’m loving it. My only issue is that the power switch is on the back. Horrible design choice (hence the 4 star rating). But other than I highly recommend trying this out. Lots of fun colors to choose from if that interests you.
2,Sadly not as good as advertised.Lights are awesome.Very quiet. It's quiet bc it moves so little air that I thought I set it to low nope it's just that weak.  My laptop cpu and gpu run at 96c constantly and I run live temp data on my lower monitor. It doesn't make a bit of difference. Does nothing.  Don't buy it if you need a fan.
5,It is amazing! It doesn't feel like it actually puts out more air than the one that I was using before but it works soooo much better. It has made my laptop an average of 10-20 degrees cooler even when running graphic intensive applications. Not to mention it's just gorgeous.It is also very sturdy and the cords buttons and stand are well built and feel like they are going to last a long time even though I move it from room to room. I'm very pleased with my purchase.Their customer service is on point also. I had inquired about a different cooling unit they offer and was told that while it wouldn't work with my laptop model this one and a couple others would and even offered me a discount.
5,I had to wait a ridiculous long time for this product to arrive in Venezuela due to the pandemic only to find that the fan collides with the top when I place my Asus Vivobook S14 ultrabook which weighs only 3.2 lbs. I couldn't use the cooler even once I am very frustrated and disappointed. [UPDATE 9/6/2020] Klim customer service was super awesome I sent proof of the failure they were very comprehensive and agreed to send another unit to me. Such a complete support and warranty makes me feel safe to buy from this brand again it really makes a difference. [UPDATE 25/7/2020] My new Klim Ultimate arrived to Venezuela like a week ago and it works perfect the fan is super quiet it looks awesome too. My ultrabook is not overheating anymore. Thank you very much.
4,My only hope for it would be that the base was a bit wider.  Its legs are pretty narrow.  When sitting your legs well my legs have to be near together and straight.  For lounging in bed its great.
5,I've been using it for the past three days and I absolutely love it. I love the design and the attention to detail (like the logo that pops up in the front for the laptop to rest against) The fan is quiet with ample air to cool down my 15.5" laptop when I run MMOs for hours on end. I like I can control the fan speed colors and light display. The adjustable heights and the design of the legs of the tray make it comfortable to put on your lap. I highly recommend it!If I have one critique it would be I wish they shipped the box inside another box for protection. It wasnt damaged but the box had some dents in it because well usps
5,I bought this for my laptop after an older one I had died out. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived! Incredibly easy to set up and use and the lights are fun to mess with as well! The noise level is practically non-existent. The ability to recline it is doing wonders for my lower back and they have the courtesy to give back the USB port being used!Like I said in the headline my daughter "stole" mine after only one day so I just purchased my second one which arrived yesterday.The true test will be lifespan so if there are any concerns I'll come back and edit but so far this was perfect!
5,Bought this for my Asus gaming laptop and it gets the laptop really cool on your lap. Worth to buy cool rgb barely notice the fan noises at max. Only thing I just wish it had a better cable to connect to laptop but it is really minor since I don't even notice the cable once I put it on my lap or desktop.
3,I gotta start off by saying that this cooler has the best rgb lights hands down. During the day they look sad but at night they’re perfect and have a large assortment of color options not just your basic 5. The cooler itself is also amazing. One large fan is definitely more quiet than several medium fans and the temps were always significantly lower as opposed to no fan.The biggest drawback is the quality. Plastic feels cheap and the hinges are a joke. I fixed it once and just came undone again after 2 months. For the high price i would say your money is better spent elsewhere.Unless your video calling and you need the low noise or your a nerd like me and needed the rgb lights I would say save your money. Most coolers are half the price.
5,This “big ‘ole fan” works a treat on my 17” gaming laptop.It offers a stable base at any angle.The light display is cool and easy to control.It’s quiet enough that I have periodically checked to see if it was on.A fine cooling option for hotheaded laptops.
2,Bought this for my WFH setup at the beginning of the Pandemic (April 2020). Now the lights flicker when they're supposed to be on constantly and sections of the lights barely work. The fan slowly spins down and stops all on its own if it spins up at all when I start it up.It's quiet and pretty but isn't built to last.
5,I bought this pad because I was having constant issues with my laptop getting too hot and overheating. It keeps my laptop cold and it's so quiet you can't even tell if it's on. This was a very worthy investment!
5,Excelente tamaño y eficiencia
5,Been through a few coolers for my gaming laptops over the years and this one is up towards the top. Cooling is top notch (brings my temps down 8-10C on average). The stand itself is very sturdy unlike most coolers on the market (no cheap flimsy plastic). I have a pretty heavy 17" and it fits perfect and the stand handles it well. The lighting is a bonus and really nice  but the cooling is what i was looking for and this did the trick. I highly recommend this for gaming laptops.
2,I read reviews for many laptop cooling pads before deciding on this one and I chose it based on the high number of positive comments. After receiving this product I am rather disappointed with it.This cooling pad needs 2x USB ports to power it and I have it connected to a j5 Create USB hub which itself is powered by a power adaptor. The air generated by the fan (on the highest speed) is almost non-existent and doesn't do anything to cool my Alienware X17. The plastic tab that keeps laptops from sliding down seems thin and cheap and I predict it will break will prolonged usage (I could be wrong however). I'm really amazed that there are so many glowing 5-star reviews.This cooling pad has a nice design and nice lighting as well though I would prefer a cooling pad that actually cools laptops even if it doesn't have fancy lighting. I tested this cooling pad with my Wi-Fi router and as it does actually cool the router I decided to keep it for the router and i'm back to looking for a cooling pad for my laptop.
5,Pros:-Adjustable positioning for laptop placement-Adjustable fan speed-Various RGB lights and modes-Fan noise is acceptable (even on high)-Great cooling performance (cpu and GPU temps dropped by around 15 degrees while under load)Cons:-Power Cord is way too short. Make sure you’re no more than a couple feet away from an outlet-PriceyOverall:I recommend this laptop cooling solution. I mean it should be good especially for such a high asking price. Overall 4 stars (that cord is wayyyy too short)
3,The overall presentation is pretty nice it's a flashy little unit so if you're looking for something "unique" you won't be disappointed. The fan is super quiet though not very strong so if you're looking for a super high powered fan I would probably not get this one.The reason why I decided to rate this product three stars goes into my biggest complaint; The design. If you search for a company called "irocks" you will see that they have the EXACT build design just without the "KILN" name and a few dollars cheaper. Everything up to the fan power settings the rim colors and literally everything else is exactly the same just without the name brand. It seems as if KILN uses other build designs and slaps their name on it. I noticed a few other customers complained about that as well with their other cooling pads designs.I personally do not like that so I won't be buying another product from them again. Otherwise I would have been a reoccurring KILN customer.
4,I like it.  My laptop doesn't have enough USB ports to power it from the laptop so it keeps running when I power down.  No biggie I just flip the power switch.  They thought of everything.  I just can't remember to turn it off and on half the time.  But that's me.  I do have some USB-C ports I but I could make something work that way?
5,If you have a gaming laptop this is cooler for you.  The fan on my ASUS ROG TUF506IV-AS76 Gaming Laptop would max out and get hot.  Now with this is cooler it does not have to work as hard and stays much cooler.  The LED lighting is a nice addition along with adjustable fan speed.  Overall extend the life of your gaming laptop by cooling it down.  I really like this unit it costs a few more dollars but worth it!
5,Klim goes above and beyond. I had this cooling pad for almost a year when it suddenly stopped working. I'm not sure what happened but it was VERY well used over the year I had it and I adored it. I love the colors it's lightweight and it makes a definite difference in the temperature of my gaming laptop. After my cooling pad went out I contacted Klim and they definitely stand behind their product and the warranty. They are sending a replacement out this week. Would definitely purchase from this company again. 10/10.
5,The build quality surpassed my expectations. It is great quality. The lights are crisp and have a ton of great settings with different patterns and colors. The fan is very quiet at low speeds and at its highest speed it is not very loud. It is about the same noise level as a laptop when their fans max out. I'd say overall it's a great bang for your buck.
5,Tried to find the biggest fan I could found. And this is it. Although according to many reviewers that having a laptop cooler doesn't really help with the temp inside the laptop that much.I really liked the LED on this thing it's so bright and smooth.
5,I recently got an alienware area 51m 15" 32g ram\i9 10thgen\Rtx 2080 Super Max Q laptop that was hitting about 75-80° degrees within 5-10minutes of running anything wich is why i needed a cooler so I got this one....ITS PERFECT😊with the cooling power in this cooling pad I've used my laptop for upwards of 2-3hrs and never hit over 45° and it still wasn't anywhere near where is use to get after...It is a little big compared to the cooler I had with 3 mini fans but the difference in cooling power is very noticeable...the fan in this thing is Awesome and unmatched...so for my up and coming deck and gamers this will not disappoint you
5,It's very quiet and keeps my computer cold! It's sturdy and I think it'll possibly outlast my computer.  I also like that you CAN TURN THE LIGHT OFF on this fan...  which a lot of fans sold online cannot do.  I leave the lights off but if I liked bright lights I would like that I could choose the color or have rainbow colors.  I did not want to have to keep buying cheap ones so I bought this one and I'm glad I did.
5,Am a Mobile DJ. In this "new world" many of my gigs have moved outdoors.Summer heat is not good for a laptop. Bought this cooling pad because it had good reviews & I can hook it up to AC power. I didn't want to run it off a USB port.  Bought this adapter UGREEN AC to DC Adapter 5V 2A to go with it.It came well packaged. It is plastic which makes it lightweight but not sure about it being durable.Easy to set up. I used it for a total of 5 hours on a 80 degree evening. My Dell laptop was barely warm. VERY impressive. So far I highly recommend.
5,We have had this for a while now and it does exactly what we needed it to do
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great colorful addition to my gaming setup. The laptop i have has a loud fan that kicks on during certain games that require more processing power and the cooling pad has seriously cut down on the noise level. I love the color features and tilt. Very durable design. If i do run into any issues i will update. I also want to say the company that made this product seems pretty cool. The message that came with the instruction manual was very funny. I have full confidence that if there is an issue they will help take care of it
3,Noise level is ruined by the fact you can hear the fan. Will randomly skip and cause a 'tsk tsk tsk' sound too. It does give cooler machine temps for gaming but marginal at best compared to any other fan on the market. I tried the rest looking for the best but I feel this one isn't all it is meant to be.Minimal use have a ROG Zephyrus G14 sitting on it so not overweight LED RBG light display is neat and a plus though.This cooler is not really worth the price point it is currently at so be sure this is the one you want not just to match your other KLIM cooling products like me.
4,The cooling pad does indeed assist in cooling my M17 R3.  I really like the design of the pad but I do wish the fan spun a little faster and pushed a little more air into the laptop for maximum cooling.  For the price this does exactly what you need it to do elevates the laptop circulates air into the chassis looks cool AF doing it!
5,Long story short all of the Surface's major components and heat come from the monitor and I still needed the keyboard so I just stood the cooling pad to it's steepest angle while widening the surface to rest the monitor against the pad. It worked way better than I expected. I was always so afraid when my computer would start getting so hot from games but now it literally doesn't get hot. It's almost perfect.The ONLY gripe I have is there is not a solid/static color option for hot pink/purple.Also I still don't know what the second USB slot is for.Otherwise 9.69/10 might even buy 2 honestly.
3,I bought this product twice. The first time I had it replaced because the RGB bar in the front was stuck on only blue and would not turn off even if the rest of the RGB bar on the entire cooling pad was off. I returned the replacement that I received because the right side of the RGB bar was stuck on only green also not turning off even when the entire RGB bar was off. I was really disappointed especially because I loved the board. The fan did great wasn’t too loud and definitely kept my laptop cool. The colors on the RGB bar were vibrant and looked great in all lighting. If the bars didn’t come to me defective both times I would have definitely kept the product. If you’re willing to gamble it is a great product.
4,The only complaint I have is the lights.  Some of us hate flashy blinking lights.  They may be fine for the kids but are very distracting for other people.  I removed the plug the first day of use.  I suggest another 25 cent switch to allow the lights to be shut completely off without having to open up the unit.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I really like the design of this cooling pad really..but the noise it makes could wake up my neighbors.!!!! I will process a return most likely....Edit**** I got a replacement...!!!Looks like the first cooling pad was defective. This one passed the noise test. 4 stars because of the defective cooling pad...!!!
4,I have to admit it is nice. It's not bad it's not great it's nice. You do feel are coming off of it I have noticed my fans on my laptop not going as high as they normally would. The only negative thing I would have to say would be it's very bright. I like the subtle RGB. This is extremely bright. Other than that I've had it for almost a month and had no problems.
4,love it but requiring 2 USB A input for such product is a bit too much.
1,I had purchased a Tecknet previously for ~$20 and got a loud and rattling fan so thought I would try a more expensive unit.  I was excited about this KLIM from the positive reviews and it was a nice and quite unit when first brought out of the package (though it didn't seem to move a lot of air).  The fan doesn't turn off automatically when the laptop is put to sleep (unlike the Tecknet) so I had to reach around the back to switch off the unit.  Turning it back on the next morning it immediately produced a loud rattling sound and I see the fan is now wobbling and rattling just like the Tecknet.The unit seems cheaply made and I feel a little deceived as I had done some research so as to not buy another cheap "made in china" product.  The KLIM web site responds to the FAQ question of "is this made in China" with "really hard to answer as our parts are sourced from all over the world some made right here in the US".  Well it's clearly stamped on the back with "Made in P.R.C.".For my third attempt I'm going to try a good conductive metal stand to dissipate the heat and a small desktop fan to blow a little air over it which is as much as these overpriced cooling stands are doing in the first place.  The concept of cooling my laptop through an overpriced computer fan wired to a cheap piece of 3D printed plastic just isn't working out for me.
4,The product does what it’s supposed to and look great. Fan is not loud even in max setting. However the stand is not stable so when you type the laptop and frame wobble which gets annoying. I’m gonna buy a separate keyboard as work around.
5,This product is wonderful! It works so well and hardly makes a sound. It’s lightweight so you can take it anywhere at any time and customer service for this product is unbelievable. I would recommend this product to absolutely anyone! Also I was worried about the lights being bothersome so I thought I would have them off most of the time. As it turns out the changing colors are soothing and not aggressive so it actually makes for a really calming experience while I work and I have them on constantly!
5,had it for a month it works great.
5,Happy customer.... Wish it had a few usb ports
2,It doesn't cool as good as I thought it was going to
5,This is a simple lightweight fan. It's relatively quiet and has a lot of color options if that's your thing. What impressed me most was the outstanding customer service I received. My first fan was slightly wobbly. Nothing crazy but enough to bother my OCD brain. I contacted customer support and they were very communicative and sent me a brand new one. I always love to see a company that stands behind their product!
5,I brought it for my son and seems to love it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great looking love it its nice and quiet you can change the colors to what you want. I had gotten the pro version but then I saw the ultimate  version so I had to return the other one to get the new one glad I did
5,Very nice i recommend it to all
5,The system is quiet and does a great job cooling the laptop under stress testing - about 20 degrees under heavy load.More to the point however there was a problem with the unit so that the can stopped working after about a month.When I talked to technical support they were extremely supportive and helpful - I had a replacement unit within the week.Very pleased with both the performance of the pad and customer support.
5,My last cooling pad from another manufacturer lasted less than a year.  It never truly kept my laptop cool  even after just a few hours of use.  I have had this cooling pad for several days and despite running it for 36 hours straight  at one time I have not yet had any degree of warmth (much less actual heat) emanating from my laptop.  I Since I do not use separate keyboard I would like to see a slightly more tilted pad to accommodate my wrists.  However despite this I am very happy that I invested in this product and would recommend to others.
5,Wanted to put my "non-gamer non-techie... just a regular office worker" review out there.  I have this tilted up at the highest angle so it actually saves space on my cluttered desk!  Keeps my laptop ice cold.  My colleagues love the colors.  This machine produces NO noise over the background drone of air-conditioners water coolers and regular office chatter.  I like the double USB cable so you don't lose a port after plugging this thing in.  Love this!
2,The LEDs are slick although mine arrived with a burnt-out diode in the front. It's also very quiet. This will keep your laptop chassis cool to the touch but it will not reduce your thermals at all. Far too expensive. There's other models for half the price which will reduce your thermals a bit.
5,This cooling pad is very good the fan work great. It looks is more beautiful in person. I recommended for everyone that one to cool the laptop also is going to give your desk a nice look. I can stop looking at it is gorgeous. the price is very good for what you get.I love it is so beautiful gorgeous and amazing and work perfect for my 15.5 laptop and keep it nice and cool!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Noise level is super low I cant even tell that it's on. As for cooling my laptop use to heat up so much while playing games. And now it basically never does the laptop fans dont go top speed trying to cool it down anymore. I'm super happy with this definitely worth the money.
5,I ordered this to keep my work laptop and personal MacBook cool while working and gaming. I’m used to my work laptop running warm as it’s used for 8 hrs at a time but once I paired it with this it was cool in no time! I keep the fan on the highest setting as I’m from the south and the heat and humidity are atrocious. The only way I know the fan is on is if I put my hand next to the laptop and feel the breeze.
4,Very quiet however doesn't spin very fast so it's not like you are dealing with a windtunnel.  Colorful fits 17.3inch laptops adjustable height as well.  Very bright but the RGB can be turned off completely or use a solid color breathing/pulsing or a alternating rainbow pattern.  All in all cools my gaming laptop noticeably which is nice.
3,Very quiet and sturdy. Needs to have a place for a mouse.
5,I waited to rate this product and it is a very good computer fan.  I don't utilize the flashing colors but they are there for the people who like that display.  I would buy this product again.
5,Very quiet! Was playing "it takes two". Laptop has a 2070 and CAN run it and full specs but was hitting 82. Turned this on and it dropped to 70. And its quieter than the laptop fan
5,I turned off the lights they were distracting. It seemed flimsy when I opened the box but after using it it’s tougher than I thought. I use it on a stand not on my lap.
4,Quiet and efficient. Keeps your rig coon. Great for Alienware.
4,Good
5,Great end of story. Knocks 6 to 9 c off my gpu and cpu gaming laptop. I have a sager laptop with a 175 watts 3080 and a 10900k running all cores locked at 4.9 this does the job and looks great doing it. Quiet as can be too. Oh and sturdy for ny heavy laptop.
5,Wasn't expecting much as a lot of other stands / fans are much more expensive.I was surprised this fan is not loud even on its highest setting it keeps my Razer gaming laptop much cooler during gaming and the RGB's look great. For the price this is a MUST buy for laptop gamers.The ONLY con would be it is not super thin or light or anything but even still its definitely not bad.Thanks this was a GREAT purchase!!
5,This laptop fan is absolutely aesthetic! The RGB lighting is a must have to complement your gaming / work set up! I have the Klim mouse bungee hub and this laptop fan and I love the lighting! The fan is very powerful and my laptop does not heat up no more like it used to while I am gaming for hours straight!  This fan does support my 17 inch laptop with ease! Do not pass on this because it is worth it do not allow your gaming laptop to lose preformance because of the number one enemy HEAT!
5,Esto es esencial para el uso de tu laptop  lo mejor del mercado
5,This beauty is bulky but it cools my super hot razer laptop enough to let me put my hands on the keyboard. Theres only 1 fan but it kicks ass. And it's portable enough to sit it on your lap but too big for taking it around in the community.
4,very light weight. fits nicely in my computer bag for travel. Very quiet hardly notice it is on and really keeps the laptop cool; was having a lot of trouble with my laptop over-heating.
3,IF YOU DONT LIKE HEARING YOUR FAN DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!
5,This is an effective laptop cooler and also works well as a laptop stand. I like the larger single fan design and the overall quality is better than other models I have tried in the past with multiple smaller fans. It lowers core temps and makes it more comfortable to use while gaming. I usually leave the LED light mode off but it's nice that it's there if you want it. Overall good product and quality.
5,It is built well and works as it should. I did not really need the light functions but my grandkids seem to think grandpa's new disco lights are the bomb. The fan is strong and I am sure this will extend the life of my pc. Satisfied customer so far.
5,Im not an everyday laptop user but for the times ive kinda pushed my laptop for gaming this has kept mine cool.
5,Purchased this fan for my 8 year old who’s totally into gaming. It was the perfect fan for his gaming setup. The fan is very quiet you could barely tell that it is on. It comes with the awesome lights that my son loves very much. The fan is very sturdy yet light weight.
4,i have a gamer laptop and i see people saying is cools it down and helps it run better. For me it does not cool it down my old cooling fan did a better job on cooling it down but it still gets hot. other than that its really cool!
5,I absolutely love this product!!!It’s extremely light weight and the noise level is so low.If I had to write one complaint about it it would be that I wish it was chargeable so I can take it with me outta my room and still be able to turn the lights on.
5,I have purchased 3 of these for different family members. Works great with no problems. Elevates your laptop at several different angles. The RGB lighting is bright and has many different settings including off.  The cooling works great with my laptop and allows it to not run hot.  I would certainly purchase again without hesitation
5,Very quiet cooling pad that fits my 15’ gaming laptop perfectly. The five different adjustable heights gives plenty of options. The RGB colors are a nice touch and they look great on the breathing setting. The pad comes with a USB cord as well. It’s an affordable product that does exactly what it says it does. If you’re looking for a cooling pad for a gaming laptop I would definitely recommend this one
5,Best cooling pad out there my old cooling pad had 3 smaller fan temps were 60c-70c on hard gaming (Alienware R17 16rami7GTX1070) and 51 on neutral with KLIM Ultimate Cooling pad they dropped to 53c-61c on hard gaming and 39-43 on neutral. very noticeable performance! Its a MUST BUY.
1,Everything worked well it seemed to do its job just fine for about a month. Then earlier this week I set my laptop on it and hear a snap. The plastic folding arm snapped with what seemed to be like very little pressure. I know I didn't drop or mishandle the cooling pad because I always store it in a cabinet alone with nothing else in it.
5,I use this on my mining laptop 24/7/365 and it is silent and keeps the laptop cool with nearly zero noise.
5,This fan helped my laptop immensely. It really cools down your laptop in the heated summer. it really changed how my laptop performs. The lighting is quite beautiful especially in the dark. I like how I can change the color of it to whatever the color I want it too. Furthermore this fan is more silent than my old fan. I recommended this product if you have a gaming laptop that easily heats up.
5,This thing is good and quiet but if your laptop is overheating this won't help at all if what you are looking is something to not burn your legs this is excellent... Pretty much I tested it with and without the the heat level was the same not a single change but I can place my laptop on my bed and maintain the laptop apertures free of obstruction
5,This is the best cooling laptop o have been come across. I got it for my sons birthday. He is an avid gamer and his laptop kept overheating. This product has put an end to that. He kept trying to get it to overheat and it never got higher than 38 degrees. It is so quiet that we thought it wasn’t working. 10/10 would buy anything this company was selling.
5,What's there to say cools the laptop well and has great RGB.
5,Perfect
3,I expected more and was disappointed It's more of an overprice laptop stand with LED lights.  Not great for a gaming laptop as it does not cool an RTX3070.
3,Let’s get this straight I bought this item as a laptop stand first and a laptop cooler second. My new desk came with a full desk mouse pad and I couldn’t just keep my laptop sitting on that. I loved the rgb lights and went with this one immediately. The build quality is good but as the title says the fan does practically nothing. It works it’s not broken it’s just so weak there’s almost no air pushed out. So if you want something to actually cool your laptop this probably isn’t the product for you.
5,I got this fan because my gaming laptop was averaging 90C when playing games. The first thing I noticed is how sturdy the pad feels. It's fairly large but nice and sturdy. The colors around it look really cool and really stand out and there are different settings for the lights. It only has 1 fan but it's practically completely silent and generates good cooling. Upon using it while gaming temperatures dropped to around 75-80C!
5,Using on 17in. Fits this size perfect overall design is awesome. Very quiet not a super powerful fan but its good. Build quality and packaging is up there with anything on the lower price range of Corsair and those guys. Uses dual USBs for power which isn't ideal. Only other thing I don't like is that the LED strip isn't perfectly uniform theres dark spots around it. Still gave 5 stars though because its low price point makes this a win all day
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Looks amazing under my PS5! Haven’t used it long enough to know if it’ll help keep it cool. Not too worried about that I got it for the aesthetics.
5,It arrived on time and was basically a plug in to get it to work.  Very quiet can not even tell that it is running.  The lightning effects are awesome.  With though that it did come with better instructions on how to change colored lights but in then end it was not too hard to figure it out.  Well worth the money.
5,Works well
5,Just ordered this to replace my old one that was going out and it works really well 😩🙏❤ not disappointed granted if your house is without ac it can only do so much
5,Wow it drop allot. I have regular Targus but it still go up the heat but today I test it . It drop allot. I’m impressed this product thank you . Hope it last ! This fans is top notch. Thank you
5,Final addition to finish off my setup :) Very quiet and the fan level adjustment is great. I used to keep a desk fan on my laptop when I gamed and it was really noisy so the change is nice! Highly recommend for those with gaming laptops that get really hot!!
3,I wouldn’t mind paying a little more if it came with a longer and better quality USB cable. The rest of it is fine
5,This devise is very quiet keeps the lap top cool. Does not heat your lap up. The led lighting looks fantastic. I get a lot of great comments on how good it looks. The price was perfect. Fast delivery too.
3,GREAT LOOKING NOT MOVING HOT AIR INSIDE THE COMPUTER ALIEN R15 COMPUTER STAY HOT ... MAYBE FOR MY PLAYSTATION IS FINE
3,Really 80$ for this? My computer still over heats with this fan. U can barely feel the fan when you put your hands on it and yes I know how to turn the power level.
3,Pros:--Very quiet fan at least so far--Cools fairly well--Small enough to use as lap desk--Fits my 13" laptop with room left over--The lights are coolCons:--Very strong plastic off-gassing smell for the first day out of the box--I have a Zenbook and the vents are in the hinge so have to pull the laptop all the way to the front edge to get good airflow from fan--takes 2 USB slots to run lights and fan and no USB port on cooling pad so mostly I'm using it without the lights
5,Wonderful.  Very quiet and keeps my  Asus rog duo gx551qs-xs98 really cool.  It amazed me how cool the bottom was after a couple hours of use
3,The RGB is awesome....... The Fan is TERRIBLE!I run a MSI GS75 9th Gen I9 and I can tell you this fan does nothing to assist with keeping temps down during gaming. It basically has the same effect as just proping the back up the laptop up and nothing more. This unit is best purchased for the RGB only and not cooling. If you are looking for cooling qualities over RGB then look elsewhere.
2,ok look gorgeous the rgb is beautiful  display on my desktop i did a lot youtube  and reviews on amazon for gaming laptops   at first look great  but gaming and video editing  my  laptop  fans work full speed the cpu reach sometimes 92 degrees  never happens whit my old cooling pad the iets gt300 double fans   i change because is horrendous  loud as jet fighters but never cross 80 degreesif you priority is performance this pad  is not for you barely blow airif you don't care about  performance  but looks and rgb show get iti not recommend as cooling pad anyone care about cooling efficient any laptop  and  youtubers give not honest  reviews  about real performance
5,I love this cooler it drops my temps by almost 20 degrees! The rgb is crazy bright and looks awesome on my desk. The only thing I did not like is that it uses 2 usb ports. Great purchase for my 17" gaming laptop.
5,I'm not sure if 5 stars means quiet or loud.. but for me it means it's quiet. It feels cheap but my laptop is very heavy and it holds it just fine. Colors are beautiful and it works wonderfully.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Ordered Sunday got it MondayCan’t hear the fan (too quiet)Average airflow (subpar for the price)RGB is mostly reason why you’re buying thisIt’s 5* for me since I read enough reviews for my decision.
1,My item was either defective or its a complete rip off. I'm hoping for the defective part based on the other reviews. First impressions of the cooler was very good. It looks cool was comfortable to use on my lap and fit my 16" Asus Zephyrus very well. However the one thing it did not do is the cool the laptop. I plugged it into the USB port and slid the wheel over to max and the fan barely spun and had no significant or distinguishable airflow coming from it. I even placed a half sheet paper towel to see what it would it do and barley showed any movement what so ever. I've had cheap $20 coolers with smaller fans produce significantly more airflow than this overpriced color changing mat. Again I'm hoping it was just a defective unit but for an $80 cooling pad I would have hoped for better Quality Control and premium materials. especially since the majority of their competitors are selling for more than half of what they charge. I'm returning the item and will be looking elsewhere for a cooling pad that actually cools
5,Playing intensive games usually running 80-90 degrees Celsius. With this bad boy/girl am at 60-65. I also bought a foam filter to put in between this unit and my laptop to catch dust from getting in the laptop and still runs that cool! Excellent product and a awesome email from Klim that made me laugh lol.
5,i bought a top-notch gaming laptop so i figured i needed a fancy cooling pad to ensure its longevity. this thing does NOT disappoint. it is quiet as a mouse!!
5,Got it express delivered and received it in a few days. I'm quite happy with the product; my laptop is generally noisier than the product so I'm glad it didn't add to it. My friends think the laptop stand looks really good too!The only thing I didn't like as much is that the controls/buttons are at the back. The double USB is a bit jank but otherwise still a great product!
5,For the money its worth it. I run a Asus ROG Strix II GL703 17.3" screen and it made a noticeable difference in temperature. I was running hot between 80-86 degrees depending on the game. With the cooler it hovers between 72-76 degrees and keeps my legs cool! :) If it takes a dump i will re-review it.
5,After a few days of using this fan on an Alienware m15 laptop it's definitely safe to say that this is one of the best gaming laptop coolers out there. Not only is this fan incredibly aesthetically appealing and quiet but it also serves as an amazing laptop stand. My favorite aspect by far however would its amazing efficiency and lack of noise when it comes to cooling my laptop.
4,Me gustaría que la inclinación sea más baja de la de inicio. Es decir menos ángulo  porque su primer escalón sube demasiado.
5,This is very pretty in person the colored lights are bright and really quite beautiful. It gives off a nice amount of air flow and is very quiet. Bought this for my teenage son to use with his gaming laptop. He was blown away for the price. Would buy it again. If you want a nice rgb laptop fan this is a good choice.
5,So far so good. keeps my mbp cool.  Fits on my Lap.  Love it.
4,I would love to give this 5 stars HOWEVER having to use 2 USB ports for both the fan and the lights is pretty inconvenient. Otherwise it’s great.
5,like the quiet fans but could do without all the distracting lighting features. Took me a half hour to get the lights to stay still in a single low key color. Do not want to pay for all the lighting nonsense.
5,I love this! It is so colorful!My cat chewed through the cable! Their costomer service is AWESOME! They are very friendly and responded to my request very quickly!
5,This exceeded expectations. Not just a fan but a great stand for a laptop as well
5,This keeps my laptop cool and I like the color leds around the edge.
1,I liked it at first but like the headline says After less than a year it broke. For almost 70$ id expect this thing to last longer. I take good care of my things. This wasn't user error. Disappointed
5,This thing has been running smooth and maintaining temperature for gaming for nearly a year. It matches the keyboard I bought him and he absolutely loves it. We’d highly recommend it!
3,Had device for just over a year. Now the fan stopped working.
5,Came suuuper fast. The email they attached was over the top but it was wonderfully written and gave me a much needed laugh.My laptop was bigger so that is my fault for getting stary eyed at it. Its super quiet unlike my last one.I can see myself buying more from this company for sure!
3,Product works good so far but the box was opened and a bit damaged when I got it so I'm not sure if I got an used product or not definitely not what I was expecting from this company.
5,I have a Dell G7 gaming laptop that tends to get a little hot when I’m pushing big boy numbers on large games. I see at least a 5 degree difference in my CPU and GPU temps while using this product. The adjustable base is nice and sturdy. The lights are adequate but cannot sync with other external RGB accessories.
5,When they said this thing is whisper quiet they were not kidding at first I thought it wasn't even on it was so quiet! Keeps my lap top super cool the lighting effects are awesome one of my best purchases.
1,Propping up the backside of your laptop without this will cool it surprisingly well and using this product adds zero cooling over simply propping it up. Waste of money
5,Before: idle 40-50c load 75-95cAfter idle 28-40c load 55-80cFor real no joke.Edit: just received my second one to finish off my setup. Thank again Klim!
5,I can be a little cumbersome because it cants your laptop up at an (adjustable) angle but with a flip-up stop to keep your machine from sliding off. It runs quiet it keeps my laptop cool it looks pretty and all for a reasonable price. Highly recommend.
5,This is my third cooling pad and is by far the best one! It keeps my laptop cooler than two other ones I have recently used.
5,After going through 4 cooling  pads none compared to this one keeps my laptop cool while working at Max capacity. Would recommend this above all else.
5,Product is much better than expected
5,What a great cooler so far it has been amazing. I bought it used in good condition and I'm happy that I saved $25.
3,Really quiet and sturdy holds my 17 inch laptop no problem  however I it doesn’t do much to reduce the heat in my gaming laptop. It does however work very well on my work laptop which doesn’t generate much heat.
5,Works good. Fits my Dell G7 17” laptop with no problem. I do wish light controls were on the front or side and not the back.
5,I have no bad comments so far. Doing what it was made for. Thank you!!
4,Works well and easy to customize.  I haven't had long to test durability.  However  I haven't had any problems so far.
1,After a year of owning this unit it now wobbles has screws coming loose inside of the fan area and has always been very loud.
5,I have Macbook Pro 13 2015. Lately I had been shut down issue due to heat I have tried 3 different cooler and this is the one who completely solves the problem. Yes looks price but it works very well.
5,I got this cooler since my last one died. The huge fan is great since it moves a lot of air without making a lot of noise. There is a lot of space under the cooler that is adjustable. RGB is really great.
5,Very impressed with this product Worth the buy and have already recommended it to a few friends
5,This is the best cooler. Larger fan is quiet and the performance is excellent. Worth the extra money.
3,Didn't need the lights didn't notices a huge difference in cooling
5,The fan is quiet and the light around the edge of the cooling pad adds a certain amount of creative colors to a computer area that is lacking in bright cheery lights. I really like this pad
5,Looks great!  The Led colors are very bright and much better in person then the pic. Easy to use holds my 17in MSI laptop snug. Fan runs quite and does assist in cooling. I would recommend very happy with my purchase!
5,I really didn’t expect for it to look better than it did in the photos. Nice packaging and came in a day sooner than estimated. Great size very quiet fan buttons and stand are solid. Light looks nice and bright just like the photos!
3,First the good RGB and stand look great.The bad the cooler system isn't good poor air flow the fan speed is too slow.If you want a really good cooler system this isnt your best option. If you want that your laptop look great this is a best option.
5,Bonus: Choose the first option where the colors slowly change and when it gets to a custom color you want you can press the second button and it will stay on that color. Sweet option I figured out while messing with it.Very awesome laptop cooling pad/raise stand.
5,Nothing bad about the lights and fan. It's so good!
5,Works great with my Lenovo Yoga laptop. I had been having issues with it getting very hot but since I got this it is staying cool. I dont notice the fan noise. The colors are cool as well.
5,Expensive but gets job done and looks good doing it.
5,i like it
1,THING DOESN’T EVEN BLOW AIR!!! I have been looking around at cooling pads for awhile now and firstly went with a dual fan targus cooling pad that did nothing here 2 months later I saw this KLIM cooling pad is one of the higher priced cooling pads on the market for a $80 freaking cooling pad you get a to be honestly decently good quality body and the RBG lights increase my ram by 1GB :) as for what we are buying this cooling pad for. The Fan I thought I bought a high quality cooling pad? This fan literally has no air flow almost put my hand over it cannot even hardly feel the air and this is at FULL fan speed!!! I dropped a WHOPPING ZERO yes A WHOPPING BIG FAT 0 Degrees celcius with this stupidly overpriced real title should be  ““just for looks” RBG pad”
5,Great product
5,I purchased this item a couple of months ago and for whatever reason it stopped working.  This item has a 5 yr warranty.  I sent it back and within days received a brand new one!  Great company great service!
3,Works fine but its just extremely cheap breakable plastic. I imagine if i accidentally dropped it a few feet then something would break on it. Lights on it are pretty cool though. I personally would recommend a more durable one.
5,I bought a G7 dell laptop 17 inches.  Fits perfect and actually works.
5,I got this for my boyfriend as a gift and he loves it and the product is really good. Really worth the purchase
5,Was in need of a cooler for my Asus Tuf 505DU Gaming Laptop and this product had great reviews and I was NOT disappointed!
5,Product is great if not better than expected. The fan is so quiet I had to actually make sure it was on xD. The colors are brilliant and goes great with my overall setup! Great product!
5,Quiet as it can gets but powerful fan!It keeps my laptop cool enough!Great anesthetics awesome RGB lighting too.
4,Don’t really know got it for my daughter.
4,Nice product.  Bigger than I expected. Enjoys the led display.
5,It’s beautiful though and cools better than most  other fans I have.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             It fits my 17.3” laptop perfectly. The lights add such a nice touch. It definitely keeps my gaming laptop cool for hours on end. I seriously love it!
5,The color changing belt around the edge is a little distracting but it can be turned off.  I use it for a lap top computer that is used for productivity and leisure time
5,Being greedy I wish the fan was a bit faster but it is super quiet and gets the job done. Also looks great if you have a full RGB light setup!
5,I ordered it thinking it would be just another normal cooler and I was wrong. It keeps my laptop much cooler than without one and does so quietly and effectively.
5,Literally the best thing that I’ve purchased all year! Highly recommend.
1,I really needed a fan to cool off my MacBook while playing my switch on it. My MacBook is a 2015 dinosaur and it heats up like crazy each time I use it as a monitor for my switch. I saw this and well the lights drew me in…I’m upset I spent this much on a cooler fan that doesn’t seem to blow any air at all as well as not even cool my MacBook down. I did get a replacement to see if it would be any better but unfortunately it seems to have just worked the same. Even if you plug in both USBs (I don’t know why this was a thing) the fan still blew….nothing at all. Yes it’s spinning. No it’s not dusty. It’s just…a really bad fan with a dope set of lights to hold up your laptop.
5,It’s been fantastic at keeping my razer laptop cool. I just wish it was more open so the plastic didn’t absorb the heat but it’s also good so it doesn’t damage the fan.
5,Bought this for my gaming computer and works great. My computer fan is louder than the cooling pad and has kept it from getting too hot.
5,My son loves it keeps the PC cool and freed up space on his desk.  Great investment.
5,Awesome laptop cooler it’s perfect for keeping my laptop call when on skype calls and playing CS:GO. Would highly recommend for anyone with a toasty laptop.
2,The Cooler is beautiful. The RGB lights are super fun and compliment my M15 R4 Laptop well. However I have seen ZERO improvements on my computer's temperature. I know this because I constantly have my temperatures up. Unfortunate because it is a really pretty cooler just grateful I got it on sale...
1,I have been using this product for my dell latitude for quite some time it is really cool but only bc it has tht color bar going around all the edges if this device. but it just stops there.. the main features are really disappointing.. ^^” for one.. the main thing its supposed to do is cool down your laptop.. i am using a dell latitude 2n1 with open vents to the cooling for a fan pad like this. but it doesn’t really work because to much air is escaping from the bottom of the fan.. instead of going to the top... ^^” while its a cool toy bc it glows and flashes lights.. its not very practical.. bc the main only thing ppl buy this for to cool down there open bottom pcs.. it doesn’t well enough... i had been using this for maybe an hour.. and i went to feel the back of my pc.. onky to find out.. it still felt close to boiling hot... ^^” i rly wanted to like this more.. i only wish it worked btr.... ^^”
5,works great i have no complaints except that i wish there was a power button on the thing
5,This is one of the nicest looking laptop coolers i’ve ever owned. Totally worth it. I usually connect my TV as a second display and my laptop overheats because of it. This definitely helps with that and it looks amazing.
5,I have a Alienware M15 laptop and it over heats but  cooling fan does it job to keep it cool all the time  A MUST HAVE
1,This is the$78 fan just look inside is just nothing and a small fan and very small electric unit that controls the fan that’s it. I think the cost for this can not even over 5$ and it sells at $70+  Only got a fancy lighting.
5,Been a great item so far... The problem is that these things need to be used a good while before you can really review them.
5,This is an awesome cooler quiet fan many RGB color adjustments.Connected to a USB hub to save laptop USB ports which was purchased on Amazon.
5,Highly recommend this for your laptop! And its perfect for keeping my gaming laptop nice and cool! Buy this you will not regret it!!
5,Best Fan pad I ever had low noice level while still pushing a good amount of air. Perfect for 17 inch laptops.
5,Better than my cheaper one from that I had a few years ago. (make sure to get a cookie dry rack to make air flow better for cooling pad)
5,Perfecto ideal y necesario!
5,Pros: 99% of deviceCons: Size its huge but it’s worth it
5,Well made solid. LEDs are bright and smooth transitioning. Fan is silent. Makes absolutely zero noise. I dislike the dual USB plugs tho bit of a hassle.
5,Quiet under no long term usage
5,love the fan action of keeping my laptop cool the lights work great  it is a very good working  laptop fan cooling system
5,Very good product in the next version try to put USB Port and working more in the rbg after that very perfect I like
5,It definitely helps me keep my laptop nice and cool!
5,Wonderful Product I actually bought 3 so far. I might need a few more down the line. Once everyone saw mines they wanted one...
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Exactly as description reads. Exactly what I wanted. Will update in future if anything unexpected happens but right now product is 10/10
5,I like this. It is quiet and keeps my laptop cool even if I am on it for hours. Lightweight but sturdy.
5,I was skeptical at first but this totally works..  The RGB is a cool visual.
5,Awesome! Keeps my laptop super cool and looks super cool!
5,Nice color consistent n smooth changing colours quiet hardly hear any sound.
5,Lost the fan in my MSI laptop it's old. Kept shutting down while gaming This table fixed that forth with!
5,Excellent product for cooling the laptop and nices lightsmy daughter loves this.
5,Excellent for everything
5,And I love the colors all around it.
2,the controls on the back are hard to get to the are lose and cheaply made. I had rather paid more if that is what is needed to get a decent product. I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone unless you need a sinker to fish with that's all it's worth.
5,Love this fan. Super quiet colorful & fun and keeps my laptop nice and cool. Very important to keep the laptop from overheating - which happened with my previous one.
5,It is extremely light and quit. So far so good. The light show is amazing. Great purchase.
5,Great quality built. Super quiet and does the job. Plus the light modes are great. Highly recommended.
2,Fan speed to low even on high to cool laptop
5,Love it!
5,Es super lindo y eficiente prácticamente nada de ruino y es realmente potente.
5,Really like the outside rim color display.
5,Good cooling pad...does it job! Would buy again!
5,Good product for its price ~.~ thumbs up for this product
5,The light on this look very goodThe build doesn’t look cheapJust wish the fan speed was a bit better
5,Good cooling and reliable
1,The fan is weak and does not work well. I tested by putting a piece of tissue on it and the tissue barely moved
5,It gets the job done and keeps the laptop running cool!
5,Le gustó a mí hijo
5,High build quality and materials. My laptop was noticeably cooler with the fan.
5,Works great! Love it!
2,I have a lonovo legion laptop. Very powerful and strong overheats alot. I brought a different cooling mat them normal because I wanted to see if I could find better. I did not. It doesn't prevent it from overheating. It works with regular laptops but for gaming ones it barly makes a difference.
5,My kids love them
5,It’s great
5,It’s extremely quiet at its highest speed. Looks super good and is extremely light!!
5,This is the best cooling pad that i owned it’s really the best
5,This product I would highly recommend. It is exactly what the description says.
5,THE BEST. Love those stickers as well.
5,The fan isn't tooo strong but it looks super cool
1,The product is not a cooling pad. This a a RGB Laptop Stand.The fan in the product does not provide enough to adequately cool any laptop. Tested with a printed receipt paper and found that the paper did not move on the pad. Neither suction or pushed air was experienced on full power.I have an Alienware M17 R2 that run 65degrees normal load. Added the pad and did not see any difference with the cooling after 4 hrs of use. I did not even use the laptop just added the pad to see if the cooling was sufficient.If you need RGB lights then this is the pad for you. If you need cooling look elsewhere.
2,Nice looking decent construction. Unfortunately something about the way this is built causes my 17" Dell G7 to overheat enough to drop framerates from 120 to below 10.Initially I thought it was a specific game but within five seconds of lifting the laptop off the cooler my framerates jumped back up and never dropped again. Recreated this three times. Likely an issue with where the vents on the laptop are. YMMV.
5,Very quiet. Great qulity. RGB is lovely which makes a great combo with ROG Strix Scar 3 ;)
5,Does it job well i really like it
5,I Like it.. Thnx..
5,Good stuff works well but quite thick.
5,Very cool led light show!
5,Really smooth looking cooling pad.
5,Excellet
5,Keeps 17.3-inch laptop cool thereby extending it's life. Thumbs up!
2,This product looks great. However there is a major problem. The fan continually shuts off for no apparent reason. Unfortunately it is so quiet that you don't even know! Buyer beware!
1,This is a cheap knockoff product.  The fan was noisy with an annoying buffeting sound right out of the box.  You are getting completely ripped off with this product.  I am returning this immediately.
1,Nothing worked out of the box except the RGB. The fan wouldn't spin at all and yes I turned it on in the back. Only one of the RGB buttons did anything. And who the hell has two spare USB slots on a laptop? This thing needs TWO USB slots. Where is that noted in the product description? None of the (probably paid) YouTube reviewers mentioned it. This product is very overpriced with horrible quality control. Don't waste your time or money.
5,Good product
5,Love it
5,It works great
1,It sucks within 15 minutes of using it I realized I had been duped. This will not help keep your laptop cool you might as well buy a fan for 20 bucks and point it at your computer. That would be more effective.
5,Super nice
5,nice
5,Works perfect
1,Awful. Just awful. How does this cool down anyone's computers? Is mine defective? I turned it on the highest setting and the most it could do was generate a small breeze that at first felt cool to the touch but with continued use (a couple of days) became a warm gust of wind. I think I could generate more air with my breath than this fan could. So disappointed especially after reading all the reviews for this product. I suppose the only good thing about it is aesthetically how pretty it is. The lighting is very nice - all the lighting settings. But this product wasn't bought for the aesthetics.
2,Quiet but not strong enough to make a significant difference
5,Very nice
1,I boight it off amazon.. .cord tip wqs loose and eventually fell off making the pad useless....returned it only to find the price increased so high I couldnt get a replacement for the amount of refund. Would change to 5 stars if they assisted me.
1,It is a Rgb display but not a cpu cooler the fan run extremely slow
2,The cooling pad fan isn't strong enough it needs to be more the 750 rpm's I got it because I thought it push more air because of the larger fan blades but nopethe LEDs are nice tho :v
1,I used this with a 17" gaming laptop. I was constantly afraid the flimsy hunk of plastic they put on the thing to keep heavier laptops in place would break. The fan developed a buzzing noise within a few days of ordering the thing. The controls in the back were also really annoying and a pain to get to.All in all this definitely isn't worth the price they're charging.
2,This laptop cooler looks fantastic. However when running a game at full settings this cooler does not do a great job at reducing heat. I saw about a 3-4 degree difference which isn't much when the computer is running around 90-95C. If you do light gaming/tasks and want a cooler that looks nice get this one.
5,Works perfectlt thank you.
1,Very poor build quality. The lights were cool i guess and it does raise up the laptop a bit. However after using it just for a bit the cable broke. After buying a replacement cable the fan doesnt even work. Very dissapointed after paying a premium on poj product.
5,Looks great works great.
5,Absolutely love it!
5,It blows air
2,seems to be a good laptop cooler i like that you can turn lights off and it keeps laptop cool but fan doesn't last and usb port is loose
1,The product does not change the temperature of the laptop by even one degree. If you buy this for cooling you might want to look elsewhere. If you buy this for pretty lights and consuming 2 USB then you have come to the right place.Move along the cooling you are looking for is not here.
1,I bought this Sept 19th it stopped working December 17th. I tried to contact support and no help. I also bought protection on this piece of shit and i cant even get a replacement. Also its not for heavy duty laptops it just looks pretty thats it. My Acer Nitro5 was still HOT HOT even with this under it. The fan is very weak. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GO BUY SOMETHING ELSE.
1,Really poor quality. Worked for less than a minute. The issue is with the ac connector to the cooler at the plug itself. If I push down on the connector fan and lights go on when I let go power goes off. Like I said just a very cheap product!
1,It’s trash...expensive trash! The description says USB powered like a normal gaming laptop fan. But this unit doesn’t actually have a USB port on it at all. My old gaming laptop cooling pad had 4 built in. This has none and they don’t give you the correct powerchord in the box. All trash!
2,It's basically a colorful laptop stand with better air ventilation. Fan is crap.
1,Although the fan itself is really quite and the rgb light on it is really cool when it comes down to it the pad doesn't really cool. The only time I felt that the pad cooled down my laptop was when I didn't have it on and the laptop wasn't doing anything. Its a cool purchase if you don't have a gaming laptop that heats up a fair amount.
2,Broke fast and the top too thin the weight of PC tended to make the fan press against it.
1,Needed this for gaming to cool down laptop and lights looks really nice but fan doesn't work. Just read a lot a reviews with people having the same problem with the fan. JUNK!!
1,Beautiful design Rgb lights. zero slilent. I loved this when it first came in. The fans were Perfect but after two days I realized it's barely moving. I put a lil piece of paper towel on top of the cooling pad and it barely moves. The wind from my mouth or even Nostrils could move a paper towel but not this. I don't know if it's an issue with the rotor in the cooling pad. I'm very sad.
1,The cord that comes with it is flimsy. Didn’t do that great of a job cooling my Mac. Beware
1,I really wanted this to be a good product. I have now tried 3 laptop cooler pads.The problem with this product is that it doesn't blow air. I turned it up to maximum and it barely made a breeze. Additionally it was slightly unbalanced so it made a constant noise.Cannot recommend
1,Definitely not worth $80 lol.Made of flimsy plastic and there’s a chance your laptop USB port won’t have enough power for this cooler.the lowest adjustable level angle adjustment is way too high and a clears to type on.The fan speed could be better . Fan sound is not great
1,First indication was that the box had been re-taped along all edges and completely battered. Upon opening the box and setting it up I noticed the DC plug in was NOT tight at all as if it were the wrong size completely. I used a flashlight and peered into the DC port to see that there was no central pin to connect to meaning that it had been broken off entirely.
1,My item arrived without a power cable so it probably wasn’t even new it was just repackaged and shipped to me without even thinking.
2,Fan is too noisy compared to the other company
1,After a couple months of normal use the top of the casing has started to sag and presses down on the fan blade creating noise.  Now the fan has ceased completely.  I would not recommend this product.  Maybe the company will issue a replacement.
1,This unit did not pass the paper test an did not  keep my gaming laptop from over heating
1,Whisper quiet.Disappointing cooling.1/4th the cooling of the much thinner MiN Notepal that I have been borrowing from my wife.I tried it with one USB and with both USBs.  No difference.The fan seems very small considering the size of the pad.Expected more from the reviews.
1,Upon arrival the fan did not work. Not sure why this product is 2-3X more expensive than every other laptop cooling pad. The materials aren't good.
1,See Title
1,I would not recommend this for 17” laptops. The weight of my Alienware M17 R2 and Lenovo Legion make the fan scrape on both units u bought. Defeats the purpose of the quiet fan...
1,I was very much looking forward to this product for I am in full time school and on laptop all the time. Really could have used it.
1,Noisy even at the lowest setting. Minimal impact on late Mac book pro 2019 model.
5,Super quite fan. Cool lights. Works as described. Would recommend.
4,I like the size of the fan.....it's larger than my previous one. and it's very quite. the lights are nice looking but I really don't see a need to have lights on the outside of this thing. I think it is over priced personally. it comes in a beautiful box which is neatly wrapped. I think I paid for all of that nice packaging. I think it might be worth 35 dollars..............it is well constructed and looks great just wish it was cheaper. not sure why it has two USBs on it cause you just need to plug one of them in and it works. the colors are ok just don't need them. they are very bright and you can shut them off or change them but you can't dim them. just received mine today and you can feel the air flowing if it is on your lap. on high power because the fan speed is adjustable you can hear the fan if you are in a quite room. when it is on low you can't hear it. I would get one with no lights. lights are not necessary.
1,Returned disappointed due to lack of air flow. I was really hoping this would work out
1,Neither the lights nor the fan power on anymore. Only used this cooling pad for about a week.
1,When this is on you can't even feel the air vs a 5 fan.
1,The fans are not powerful enough to cool my MacBook Pro.  Very Disappointed!
1,Product arrived damaged. The stand was ripped off and placed separately in the package.
1,The fan is very low power. For the price I’d expect a better fan.
5,Very nice looking and the fan is working really nice
4,I've purchased a few of these thermal cooling pads for notebooks over the years but they all ended up getting returned. Usually poor quality noisy and/or ineffective. The KLIM cooler isn't perfect or the cheapest but the real-world improvements make it an easy recommendation. If you'd like to hear why keep reading.First the design is fairly basic. Its a mostly plastic construction but it is sturdy. It's large enough for a 17" notebook but if we're talking about a gaming notebook such as an Alienware it would hang over the edge. The rubber feet on notebooks grip to the top surface very nicely. Although there is an optional stop you can use to make sure the notebook doesn't go anywhere.The RGB light strip along the edges is a bit much. The light bar is rather large and you can't adjust the brightness. If you toggle through the colors there is an OFF setting. You can use the other button to change between a few modes such as strobe fade etc. The dial is used to turn the fan off and adjust speed. There is audible fan bearing noise that you will hear in a quiet room. But the notebook fans are louder so it's not a big deal. Especially considering it's a single large fan that cools the entire bottom surface of the notebook.And last is the barrel power connector that you use to power via your PC or anything that can provide USB power. The cable is included.My test system is a Dell XPS 15 7590 with a 9th gen I7 and GTX 1650. Most thin and light notebooks with those specs tend to run toasty and this is no exception. So I ran a few comparisons with and without the fan running with Intel Extreme Tuning Utility and 3DMark Time Spy. Here are the results:Stock - No Fan:XTU2:  1223 -> CPU 3.11 GHz @ 73CTime Spy: 3211 -> CPU=79C GPU=74CStock + Fan:XTU2:  1273 -> CPU 3.12 GHz @ 72CTime Spy: 3379 -> CPU=79C GPU=74CIt doesn't solve thermal throttling on extended runs but it does reduce temps to allow running at full load longer before hitting thermal limits. The real improvements are when combined with a -120mv undervolt as this improves efficiency and performance (Google it).Undervolt - No Fan:XTU2:  1547 -> CPU 3.14 GHz @ 75CTime Spy: 3230 -> CPU=79C GPU=73CUndervolt + Fan:XTU2:  1549 -> CPU 3.14 GHz @ 75CTime Spy: 3597 -> CPU=77C GPU=72CEven with limited benchmark and synthetic tests you can see allowing more thermal headroom does translate to real-world performance as there is considerably less chance of hitting thermal or power limits of the CPU. In particular when there is a load on both the CPU & GPU during gaming sessions. Basically it works and is why I'm already planning on buying another one.
4,KLIM's RGB cooling pad packs a 200mm fan that can rev as high as 750 RPM's into a plastic frame that houses a 7-color RGB strip.While mostly built of plastic this cooling pad is very well constructed and is solid enough to hold up to my older 15.6" laptop that weighs 6 pounds. There's a lip at the front of the cooling pad that keeps a device in place. On the back is a mechanism that allows you to adjust viewing angles. Although they're predefined by Klim I found these angles well suited to good ergonomics even when I shifted from working at the coffee table then to the dining table and finally to a desk. No matter the angle my 6-pound laptop felt secure and stable while it rested on this cooling pad.What many will enjoy most about this cooling pad is the lighting. Klim did a better than average job here. I own a Razer laptop stand that has an aluminum build and embedded RGB's. While this cooling pad doesn't include a software interface to manipulate the lights as Razer's does the button on Klim's cooling pad is easier to navigate. Klim's RGB's are brighter than those on my Razer laptop stand but you'll have to decide whether that's a good or bad thing.What many won't enjoy about this cooling pad is the price. While the embedded fan is cool and quiet and the RBG's are aesthetically pleasing spending nearly 50 bucks for a plastic cooling pad is a bit pricey. There's also the issue of portability. I ended up leaving my cooling pad inside the box to protect it when I am on the go because there's no case or sleeve included inside the package for it. By their nature laptops are meant for travel and a carry accessory for this cooling pad should have been included in the package considering the premium being charged. I deducted a point from my overall rating because the value per dollar could have been better.Overall Klim offers a very nice cooling pad that efficiently cools devices while integrating a much appreciated RGB light show. My major concern with this offering is the price. Were it in that sub-30-dollar price range it would be a no-brainer purchase. However it almost 50-bucks you really have to explore all of your options to ensure you're getting the best bang for your buck. While this offering from Klim is very good I am not sure it has enough value to be the first cooling pad on my list were I in the market for one.
5,Thank you so Much Lolita!!! Everything is perfect with this product you helped me smoothly! Best to you in life kind soul :)
5,No se escucha
4,This is a good fan to have if you have an RGB gaming laptop. I have my asus gaming laptop and this thing looks great with it. It is powered by USB and unfortunately does take up a USB port. The cable is just a USB to a plug cable so try not to break the cable as I am unsure how to even replace it. That being said the LED lights are pretty nice but not too bright so you do not have to worry about the device blinding you. It does also have a power on and off switch on the back if you need to turn the fan or LED lights on or off. I have had a few devices when I put it to sleep where it will continue to run so it is nice to have this option. There is adequate air flow between the bottom of the cooler and the surface but not too much between the laptop and the cooler so I am concerned with hot air just getting blown back into the laptop. There is also stoppers in the front of the device to ensure that your laptop does not fall or slide off of the cooling bad. There is only one fan setting and the power is connected via usb. There are not additional USB ports so you essentially just lose a USB port when using this. I have seen other fans at least have away of connecting other USB device into it so you do not just take up one USB port to power the cooler. I would say this device does a decent job with keeping my laptop from getting super hot but it is still pretty warm when I am gaming. Overall this device is great. It does keep my laptop from overheating specifically when gaming which is nice. It keeps the noise can be set to high or low with a scrolling wheel in the back. The LED lights are also controlled on the back as well. Only issue I had with it is that it does not have too much airflow between the fan and the bottom of the laptop.
4,I ordered this 'Klim Ultimate + RGB Laptop Cooling Pad with LED Rim + Gaming Laptop Cooler + USB Powered Fan + Very Stable and Silent Laptop Stand + Compatible up to 17" + for PC Mac PS4 Xbox One + New 2020' for review.I ordered this Cooling Pad for my very heavy and large 17" Gaming laptop which I am mainly using for video and photo editing. I was concerned that this would be too small and not durable enough to handle the larger laptop however I was pleasantly surprised. Though this Klim Ultimate is made of plastic it handles the larger laptop just fine. As for cooling I can say that it does help to cool the Gaming laptop down a bit and it is definitely better than when not using anything at all. This cooling pad has a USB cable that plugs into your laptop for power. I was worried that it was not going to work as the cable splits into two USB plugs and my laptop only has one USB plug on either side of the laptop so the cable will not allow for both USB plugs to plug into the laptop. When one side is plugged in the other USB plug will not reach to the other side of the laptop. The cooling pad does however work if only one USB plug is plugged into the laptop for both the fan and RGB lights. I am not really sure yet if I were to use a USB dock and plug both cables into that if the speed of the fan would be faster but I doubt it. For my use it seems to work fine and although the Cooling pad has a speed control dial I only use it on the highest setting and the noise level really isn't that bad. Overall for the money I feel that this is actually a really great value and the RGB lighting is a fun bonus.
4,I've got an older laptop that is working with only one of the two fans. I often worry about overheating and knew I needed a remedy. I'd tried a laptop stand but still didn't get the cooling results I wanted. This cooling pad is fancier than I would normally consider but I really like light effects and thought I'd give it a try.As a cooling fan it's working just great. It takes up a bit of desk space but it's light and I can lift it or move it around easily. It's powered with a USB plug and I choose to use a USB on my laptop though it could be plugged into an outlet via USB converter plug. The fan has a variable speed wheel..I just let it run at the highest setting. It also has a high/tilt adjustment feature.The edge of the pad is a strip of frosted plastic that houses the colored lights. Solid on (white or colored) all colors in a sequence around the edge blinking flashing and fade between colors (my favorite). I don't leave the colors on all the time but it's fun to know I've got the option. Sometimes if I'm on my laptop later in the evening I'll select the red orange color to help my eyes.I hope this lasts a good long time. The case is durable enough for my purposes. I don't know how it would do being moved or packed. I'd recommend this product as a good value for the price.Thanks for reading my review. I hoped I've been helpful in your purchasing decision! Have a great day and happy shopping!
1,This is overpriced and over hyped I bought this because it was supposed to lower my temperature on my gaming laptop but instead it just cost me 60 dollars and elevated my laptop it doesn’t cool it by even one degree worst investment ever.
5,I run a laptop with a graphics card which I use for cryptocurrency mining. I noticed the temperatures were quite high so I bought this cooler. Yesterday without the cooler the GPU temperature (reported in Windows Task Manager) was 80 degrees C. After plugging the cooler back in the temperature dropped to 71 degrees C. Note that I do use it with the legs fully extended. I'm sure if you didn't use that feature the cooling would be less effective.Combined with the warranty and good support you can't go wrong with this purchase.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I have been using a three fan cooling pad with side vents non-stop for the better part of a year. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the angled position of my 15" MBP or if a single fan could adequately cool my laptop because my work is graphics intensive and tends to get pretty hot. So how did the  Klim Ultimate + RGB Laptop Cooling Pad fare?Pros:- It is VERY quiet!- The surface temperature of my 15" MBP is noticeably cooler and I was surprised that it seemed to cool even -  better than it 's predecessor. Even though it only has a single fan it produces adequate RPM speed when set at the max although I don't know exactly what the max adjustable RPM speed is it works well.- I learned that I like the angled position after all and it seems to deliver much better airflow and cooling despite only having a single fan.- If you enjoy a light show the 7 colors LED lights with multiple modes is sure to please.Cons:The Power cable. The port is not USB on both ends which wouldn't be an issue if you are powering this pad from your laptop's USB port of the nearby hub. However I am not and the dual USB connector is plugged into a power block on my floor and I find it very inconvenient.I would have given this a lower star rating than I did but it would never be published if I did. If you get my drift. That alone would factor into my opinion.This is a really nice laptop pad and other than the power connection I don't have any issues with the device itself.
5,I love to play a railroad simulator on my high performance Dell laptop. The Dell does well with the game but the intense graphics and heavy processing causes it to become quite warm. So warm in fact that the internal fan goes to maximum speed and at times the laptop’s CPU slows down to protect its itself from overheating. Certainly this isn’t a good thing.I’ve used laptop cooling fans previously but none have done a particularly good job and many have been noisy. The Klim Ultimate + RGB Laptop Cooling Pad with LED Rim has neither flaw. The fan is quiet and it is adjustable. It can also be turned off. The stand is plenty large for laptops up to 17 inches and accommodate my 13” Dell laptop very comfortably. There outer edges have an LED that shows a number of colors and patterns and these are also adjustable. They adjust with a good old fashioned push button and do not require yet another software application that runs in the background loading down the computer. Although the colors are pretty cool I am very glad that they can be turned off to save the eyes and the laptop’s battery power.The angle of the stand is adjustable. I found that it made a big difference in my ability to use the various keys during the simulator. I also liked the angle of the screen on the stand. On the downside the instructions were lacking. Although I suppose that I should know this it wasn’t clear to me why Klim included a two headed USB cable. Aside from that the Ultimate+ RGB Laptop Cooling Pad with LED Rim is a winner.
4,I enjoy this product. I am using it on my Acer nitro 5 with a GTX 1050 and Intel i5-8700h. This thing on Mac fan settings is not that loud I'd u have your laptop on most the time u cant even hear it when at idle but it works great I can out my hand under it and I can feel it sucking in the air and helping assist the removal of warm air out of the system. This thing at first confused me a little because it has 2 USB plugins but you only need one plugged in for everything to work fully. This is one of the best cooling pads I've seen because it's not to loud badly audible and if u do hear it isn't a noise that will drive you nuts. And this thing has one of the higher air flow rates on the market the ones that compare with flow rates of air are in the high price range where your spending double almost triple the cost of this some times.
1,Broken product. Very cheaply made. Look for something else.
3,It’s great but the port where I plug the cooler to the laptop just randomly broke.  I can’t use it anymore.
1,I only used this cooling pad a couple of times and now the fan doesn't work at all. At least I have something that lights up now and serves absolutely no other purpose. Don't waste your money on this cheap junk.
5,I am an instructor at a local self defense school. Due to the restrictions on public gatherings and businesses we have started holding sessions online. We did a test run of our gear and discovered that it was a challenge to keep the laptop cool (video streaming throws a ton of heat).That's where this cooling pad comes in. Because it's a laptop we have a limited number of USB ports and we need the ones we have for the gear. No problem. Plug the included USB DC cord into a charging block and everything powers up nicely.It's cool to look at. Different LED color schemes. Very smooth. Not super important for what we are doing but it's nice. There are two things I was looking for in a cooling pad and both are accomplished here: it cools the laptop and has a quiet fan. That's what we needed. That's what we got.There is a flip up stopper to keep the laptop from sliding off. Not a problem if you have it flat but it also has legs to stand the machine up on an angle. So there are options.This thing is great!
5,I honestly wasn’t expecting much for the price but I was honestly pleasantly surprised! It’s not too bulky and I just leave it at my desk so I don’t carry it around really. It’s no louder than the stock fan inside my laptop and moves a decent amount of air. Has tons of customizability for the RGB
5,This is the best cooling pad I've ever used.It has 1 big fan and with it turned all the way down it barely makes any noise.  Turned all the way up it makes a little more noise but not enough to be distracting.The lights really sell it.  I've found a lot of devices with RGB lighting these days have cheap looking effects but this one really looks good.  It adds a lot of flare to any setup.The power input has 2 USB plugs.  I used a USB 3 port and it fully powered up with lights and all after I plugged 1 in.  I suspect if you used USB 2 you'd need to plug in both connectors.It measures 17 inches from side to side but there's nothing on the sides preventing you from putting a larger laptop on it.  There's a small latch on the bottom that holds your laptop in place if you prefer using the laptop at an angle.It's mostly plastic but the grate above the fan is all metal.Overall a great cooler.Highly recommended.
5,This just came and I unpacked it immediately. I have a 15.6" laptop that also serves as a heater if you know what I mean. It has a Core i7 Nvidia dedicated graphics card and it gets hot when gaming and video rendering.This stand has lots of benefits. First and foremost it has a large fan over 10" in size. It is very quiet even on high speed. That keeps the base of my laptop nice and cool. The fan has stepless speed settings per a dial. The stand is also adjustable for your optimal viewing and working angle. It also has lighting effects all the way around the edges 360 degrees. The lights have seven different colors and 5 effects per two buttons on the top/rear.The stand is powered per the included USB cable. This stand can accommodate any laptop make and model up to 17". It is very well built durable and surprisingly good quality. It is well priced and is a good value for the money. I give it 5 stars.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This fan is worth every penny. It's extremely quiet even on maximum mode. On the lowest mode it's barely even perceptible. The fan noise is a gentle white noise low hum that easily falls away into the background; it doesn't have a high-pitched whine like some cheap fans. It has a clip to stop your laptop from sliding down. It has an adjustable angle of incline. The mesh surface that the laptop sits on is metal which helps with cooling. The LED lights around the edge look very cool and you can choose the color and setting you want (or just have them turned off). I do a lot of video editing which is very taxing on my laptop's processor and thus creates a lot of heat. This fan blows enough air to make a considerable difference. Keeping your laptop cool will increase its performance and lifespan so I'd say this fan is an excellent investment. It's well built and I'm hoping it lasts a long time. Definitely one of the best-designed and implemented laptop cooling fans out there.
5,This laptop pad has everything it's got a great big fan RGB multiple different angles of tilt and most importantly it's super quiet.  The laptop cooling fan is way louder than this thing and it doesn't provide nearly the amount of airflow that this does.  The RGB has a few buttons that you can adjust the various presets or turn it off completely.The one complaint I have is that the power plug is a weird 2 USB plug that only really seems to need 1 plugged in.  Maybe if you have an older laptop that doesn't output as much power then you'd need 2 but for me only one works just fine.  It would also be nice if it was at the very least micro usb or usb c the weird dc jack to usb is such a rare cable that if it breaks or if you lose it you're probably out of luck.
5,ok so you might be thinking that you need more than one fan to cool a laptop down while gaming yeah?Not the case coming from someone who actually thought that. Ive had a multiple amount of cooling pads and they were all pretty meh. But this one is fantastic. Why?Pro'sKeeps your laptop coolPlaying destiny 2 on my asus rog zephyruswith cooling pad kept my temps at an average of 82c or a few digits under and that would be on performance mode.The latch its sturdy and its meant to slant your laptop so that the fans can get maximum air.the design is well thought through the corners are easy to grab.The consThe single con of this would be the lighting wellas not to degrade the review any starshere are the modes1. Rainbow2. Slow Rotating colours3. Red pulse4. Red seizure5. Solid redDont get me wrong i do like red.... but theyve outweighed the other options..
5,This worked much better than I expected! I have a gaming laptop that normally sounds like a hair dryer when I play anything. This pad keeps the temperatures down significantly and stops the laptop from spinning up its own fans. Now it sounds like a pleasant hum.You can adjust the fan speed which will raise/lower the noise level. I have it on the highest speed and it's barely noticeable.The lighting can be adjusted to single colors and you can adjust the pulse rate. I haven't used the angled stands but there is plenty of space under this thing to hide any extra cables you have on your desk.One thing to note it takes two USB ports to operate the fan and the RGB lights. Grab a cheap USB hub and this won't be an issue.
5,The product definitely added a few fps while playing flight sim which has been nice but their customer service has been fantastic. I had the plastic leg break and Lolita was extremely helpful and checked in while they waited for a replacement to come available to send me.
5,For those who have had a problem with their laptop overheating this is something you will definitely benefit from.It's pretty quiet which means it won't be distracting. I have it at home but it honestly can travel with you on the road too. Great design and something that is functional giving you that cooler air to keep your laptop from getting too warm during use.You'll appreciate this for sure and easily see the difference it makes. Love mine.
5,Absolutely wonderful product I'm super surprised that this product is this nice. The images are true to the product you get a true rainbow effect on the stand it is absolutely beautiful and vibrant. I am a rainbow addict I love my gaming station to be colorful and this brought it to a whole new level of colorful!The fan is adjustable so when I'm in vr with my vive I can turn it all the way up and when I'm light gaming on league I can have the fan be a light breeze. It's pretty quiet even on high and it puts out alot of wind my laptop is running at full capacity with no problems now. It no longer gets hot I'm so happy.
3,I'll be honest: none of these cooling pads that I have tried have helped my laptop stay cool. I have an Alienware M15 that frequently hits TJ Max and I don't think any cooling pad is going to fix it. It seems to be a defective or poorly designed laptop. Assuming your cooling issues are more manageable this particular pad is well made and the single large fan is super quiet.It comes with a USB power cable that can connect to two power sources but I have found that I only need to use one USB charger to make it work. The RGB lights can be distracting as you're looking almost directly at them but you can turn them off.The reason I am giving three stars instead of four is that it seems to be designed so that the lowest possible incline (aside from flat) is about 30 degrees. So the lowest setting (aside from flat) is way too steep at least for me. You either have flat. or four different levels of way too steep. The pad when set to flat will raise your laptop about 1 1/2 inches higher off the desk.This is the fourth brand of these I've tried and so far this one is the best made but putting the laptop at an angle even the lowest angle is far too extreme to be useful.
5,I got this as an upgrade over the one I had in August 2013 that ended up breaking (plug connector broke but it has a second power option so it still running great). This fan works very well and the rbg colors are amazing.It keeps the laptop cool but I dont think it does as good a job compared to my old one.plus -200mm fan that good.rbga stand to hold the laptop in place and tilt functions if you want the laptop at a slant.badtiny bit of noise.there was a weird noise on mine (prob from heavy laptop and pressure).I think this works very well and I will be using it on one of my laptops or router.
5,KLIM Ultimate + RGB Laptop Cooling Pad with LED Rim + Gaming Laptop Cooler + USB Powered Fan + Very Stable and Silent Laptop Stand + Compatible up to 17" + for PC Mac PS4 Xbox One + New 2020This laptop cooling pad was exactly what I was looking for. It is really quiet and keeps my laptop cool. The RGB is really nice. It's not cheap RGB where you can see each diode. The color shifts are smooth and solid. No dim spots. Super happy with this cooler.
5,This stand looks cool but more importantly it keeps my laptop nice and cool. It's comfortable and holds the laptop securely.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I'm using this Klim Ultimate + RGB Laptop Cooling Pad for my gaming laptop. Like every gaming laptop there is always a struggle with proper cooling and bearable noise. This cooling pad can much more breading space. My laptop has an additional removable fan to ease the overheating but as I experienced this cooling pad is more efficient. I like how safely and nicely holds this 7.5pounds (34kg) weight beast. Thanks for the 200mm fan this cooling pad is very quiet even heavy load.
5,My laptop gets very hot while I play games. for $20 it’s worth so much more. My games run better since I started using this cooling pad my laptop gets significantly much less hot. Also the cooling pad looks stylish with the rainbow colors around the cooling pad. This laptop cooling pad is a game changer!
5,The colors can be a lot of fun but a little ridiculous in a coffee shop. You can turn them off with the push of a button in the back. Pushes a fair amount of air through and keeps my various gaming laptops significantly cooler. It also works as a wrist wrest for smaller laptops. No big downsides. Little big but it needs to be to get the air through.
5,The cooling is effective. Temps did not change by that much but the fact that it can be lifted with a level lets it get so much airflow in. My temps are just slightly cooler but more controlled. Then again my laptop runs hot. It also keeps higher clocks on the processor while gaming now. I would definitely recommend. Plus the leds are beautiful for those that love RGBs.
5,So quiet I thought it wasn't working. Lol
5,Es muy ligero practico y cómodo Lo recomiendo al 💯 gracias
2,I’ve had this for a couple of months now and I think I’ve only used it 10-20 times. Today suddenly the fan has stopped working by itself. I have to turn on the lights for the fan to spin.
5,I was really in need of a new cooling pad but was leery of what I was seeing online about many of the cooling pads that I was considering. This product is beautiful. It is not made with top-of-the-line parts but it is surprisingly sturdy. It's also lightweight. However the best part of all is that it works extremely well. And the pad is so quiet that I had to lean in close to make sure that the fan was actually working. It was and still is. It works like a charm. I love this item!
5,I have a 16.1 inch laptop and It would definitely get hot running AAA titles. With this cooler not only did my setup transform but my temperatures got significantly lower. Usually my laptop would run the fans at max speed now they don't even run that fast. This has been the best purchase ever. It keeps my laptop cool while looking good. Only complaint is the lighting modes. Don't get me wrong the default color mode is absolutely awesome but some people may want to get a specific color and this cooler dosnent do that. This cooler comes with a plug with 2 usb cables. I plugged only 1 usb in and it worked I tried it with both usb's plugged and it was the same. Overall for the money and quality its so worth it. Not to mention that you can change the level of height on this cooler and as seen in the picture I made my laptop the same height as my monitor. Such an awesome purchase. Would definitely recommend.
5,Great cooling pad definitely quality built with no rattling or loose parts.  Fan provides good airflow.  The RGB lighting is great and easy to change between settings.  It's quite a big pad with a high rise definitely not slim if you're looking for a minimalist look.  The rise is quite stable and can extend pretty high up for excellent leveling depending on how you sit.  For a big fan it's surprisingly quite.  A very good quality pad
5,Love the fact it's very quiet in comparison. It cooled down my laptop super fast. I needed it for work where I have multiple PowerPoint slide Zoom meetings sharing video's working in breakout rooms all simultaneously. The colors are a bonus and I have it on a standard blue light. Easy on the eyes. It's also very sturdy. There is NO on-off switch. Plug it in it starts. Unplug it's off. The controls are on the back. I got used to it super quick and can adjust easy enough. I really like the product.
5,Very quiet cooling fan set up for laptop.  Raises the viewing height and is adjustable.The lights are working as advertised (not sure how long that part of the unit will continue to function but the colors are vibrant and can be turned off completely so if the colors go haywire they can be shut off).Quite pleased.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I'm from the PH and the item arrived to us in perfect condition 👌🏻 Got it when it was only $64.97. RGB lights are awesome! Casing is steel so it added in cooling down the laptop.Overall: 💯
4,I purchased this for my gaming laptop with a 17" monitor (that i also purchased from Amazon) It is exceptionally quiet. My favorite feature is the ability to  to elevate is various levels to give your laptop better airflow to help keep it cooled while gaming! The lights are customizable and fun but bears no importance to it performance.
4,The RGB is a cool effect bought this for my sons laptop. Now depending on how his laptop is sitting on the pad it can cause slight pressure in the middle of the grate and it will barely touch the fan but it still is touching a fan. For such a large cooling pad I would figure the would attach something to help support the weight of laptops. It does help with the cooling by a few degrees but it is nothing drastic like a liquid cool system.
4,Looks awesome even better than the pictures can show. Great lighting effects and options. The fit is great for my 15" and 17" laptops. As for cooling.. it doesn't cool any better than a stand wo a fan. The big fan looks nice and is super quiet. Doesn't do much for actual cooling. I have two rog strix w different specstried it on both.
5,This works so well the stand is very sturdy and the fans are quieter than my actual computer. The lights are a really cool feature and it just makes the whole thing even better. The company made this really fun to unbox too.
5,This is my third cooler lapdesk type device that I’ve purchased for my MSI GS66 laptop. This by far is the best and works really well and is very quiet too.
5,Very pleased with this product its lightweight its silent and does exactly what I needed for my childs gaming laptop. The lights add extra to the gaming experience and you have a choice of colors or all of them in movement it's just great!! Its definitely worth the price!
5,I’ve had the cooler for a few months now & it’s been great! I didn’t use the RGB honestly till recently. it’s very colorful & vibrant. From unboxing till now it’s been on max fan speed so it’s been pretty quiet. No official temperature testing but my Eon17x laptop hasn’t throttled fans for normal work use unless gaming of course. Over all I recommend!
5,This is freaking amazing for the price it’s at I honestly think this company should charge more
3,I love the strong design but the fans are ineffective. My MacBook Pro still gets relatively hot while live-streaming video or gaming.
5,Perfect for my 14 inch laptop. It's very quiet and actually cools it down. The lighting is very bright and has multiple settings so you can customize it.
5,Like: Reasonably quick nice screen.Dislike: keyboard color and letter colors are too close - almost unreadable sometimes.
5,good product  fast delivery time
5,I love it. The lights are beautiful
5,Very nice!
5,it's an awsome product just wish it had a usb built-in
1,It doesn’t cool at all the fan doesn’t blow wind! But the fan is spinning. but it’s a cool design. So I ended up getting something I don’t want.
5,Been having it for a while and still going strong bright lighting is cool
5,Amazing product keeps my laptop cooling during gaming and great lights
5,This pad really works to cool down your laptop.Prior to using this pad when I played Fallout 4 or Skyrim the laptops internal fan would run and occasionally get so loud it was annoying causing me to increase the volume to compensate.For the record my laptop is a Dell G5 SE. It has pre installed Radeon software that monitors the systems useage as well as the processor temperature. Sadly I never checked the temperature prior to using this pad. My mistake for a real comparison.Long story short since using this pad (and it is quite) the internal fan on the laptop has never run full speed as previously. The fan volume is consistent and the processor temperature hovers around 59 Celsius.As I mentioned in the title. The lights are a bonus. I only have them enabled and set to color so I know if my laptop is on or off. I have the fan speed about in the middle of the dial and it works fine for keeping everything cool. Were I to play a more demanding game I would probably have to increase the fan speed just guessing but no doubt.I think ill do a comparison on temperature with and without the pad. So look forward to a update soon.
5,Work fantastic! Get this instead other product!
5,Ignore reviews stating it’s not a cooling pad a cooling pad is simply designed to elevate your laptop to allow for better airflow in the in take and the fan is there to allow better air circulation to prevent your laptop from sucking in hot air from the  exhaust and it works excellent for that allowing your laptop to run cooler when under load
5,I had an issue w my original unit and their customer service team was on it immediately. They took care of the problem and had incredible follow-thru. I can’t recommend this company and this device highly enough! Wish all my purchases were of this caliber.
2,There is no pink led option only certain colors like white green and blue. Seems cheaply made compared to the older cooling pad I had. Not worth the money
5,Have a hp omen gaming laptop I bought it for works as it should keeps my laptop cool
2,This is very pretty and totally silent but unfortunately aside from allowing a little more airflow it doesn’t do much. It doesn’t cool the laptop effectively.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Immediately cooled off loud PlayStation to a quiet hum.I started the video after it had cooled it to show fan noise of this product but there is none. The audible fan is of the PlayStation only.Will update if the cooling fan fails or breaks in anyway.
1,EDIT: This product was fantastic the first few months of usage. No major overheating no light problems nothing. Until one side of the stand broke. I have tried fixing it with hot glue and tape but to no avail. Now the other side of the stand has broken and made this usable. The fan still works but I can no longer adjust the height I would like my computer.I am very disappointed something that cost me $80 is so flimsy that it breaks a couple of months later.
5,The fan is super silent. I love how you can personalize the colors! And the adjustable base makes for ease of use in any position. Would gladly buy again!
5,very silent cools my face sometimes as well good angles lots of LED display options
5,Works great on my Predator Triton 500. Perfect size and the light features are awesome.
5,My son loves this for his laptop.
4,The fan is very weak as in don't do its main job as a cooler fan is very low speed
5,i got this for my husband for an anniversary gift and he loves it! it’s durable and light weight. much quieter than the laptop fan itself. he really likes that it matches his light set up for his MSI gaming laptop too!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Bought one similar for my bother a few months ago and he loved it. Since I got a new laptop due to my old one over heating. This is great I love the lights fan is minimal noise and is good for a 16” laptop. I’ve tried gaming yesterday and it’s great my laptop hasn’t overheated. Super comfortable to work with and easy to work it. Would recommend it!!I’ve had this a few months now and although I’m not a big gamer I am a secretary and sometimes I have to bring my work home. I’m usually on my laptop over five hours and the fan keeps my laptop cool. Still no noise from it and the lights work great. Speed of the fan is low to high and no noise. All the people that have seen my work space always ask me where I bought it and if it’s good for gaming. Honestly my brother was at my house for a few months and didn’t have his so he used mine and he loved it. Like I said before I had previously gotten him one and he still uses it every day. Its almost a year that I got that one my bother has and continues to work great. This one is working as it did the first day I took it out the box. And I do have it in a spot where I do nails everyday so dust does get on it but it’s a fighter and works with no problems.
4,This cooling pad is certainly one of the best looking ones you can get. It has these various different height levels that you can adjust to your liking which is great. However the cooling pad doesn't really cool my gaming laptop so if you have a powerful laptop that produces much heat then don't expect this cooling pad to cool your laptop when gaming or doing tasks that produce much heat. The cooling pad is alright though for when I am not gaming it drop my temps about 2 ° C  which isn't that great considering the price of this cooler. Although customer support helped me out and understood that It wasn't cooling my laptop and gave me a partial refund which was enough to buy another cooler for when I am gaming. However this cooling pad is great if you are looking for something that is slim quiet and good looking.
1,This is considered the "best cooling fan" on the market. Yeah right barely produces any air and my X17 R1 keeps the same temp with or without using this dysfunctional cooling fan. Stay away from thus product unless you want to give your money away. The only good thing about it is its ability to to adjust the level your laptop sits and its cool looking rgb lights and it isn't loud. The cooling aspect SUCKS.
5,This thing works great and is pretty. Works as intended and adds cool rgb lighting to your desk. Also makes the key board easier to use due to it being slanted and different angles that you can set to your comfort level. I would recommend
5,Great product very quiet kept my legion 5 pro laptop cool on heavy load & nice RGB lighting
5,I use this product for gaming and to keep my laptop cool and running.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Product works good the only proble was package was opened on arrival an the Amazon delivery man knocked ran from me. 👩🏼‍🔧
5,Love it’s excellent. Yes a bit noisier but it’s not an annoying noisy it’s just more subtle. Phone works excellent it makes a huge difference with your computer temperature I like that it seals the laptop below. The inclinations are awesome and very comfortable this is a high-quality product
5,Great product
5,Really cool I love this product. The fan is quiet you can adjusted from low to high speed.  The led light is awesome you will love it.  There are a few changes in colored light you choose what you like then there is. You can either turn off fan while use the light on or turn the light off and leave the the fan is on.The bottom of the stand has four levels it's cool.
1,Looks cool but the power of the fan won't move a single sheet of paper. It's disappointing considering the reviews
5,Good
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I like how it looks at night!!!
4,The product itself is great; low noise level serves it's purpose of cooling and I love the little lip on the edge to hold the laptop in place but the cable it comes with is ridiculously short. It's literally like 1 foot long. I don't know anyone who sits within a foot's distance of the outlet but I had to buy separate one in order to actually get any use out of the product.  Would recommend only if you buy another DC-USB cable for it.
5,Color adjustment fan speed adjustment height adjustment. Solid design and products used. However the only dislike is the lack of usb of any kind or type c thunderbolt SDor micro SD PORTS available for the extensive over 80 dollar price tag. The extras that came in the box for the product info and such were classy like a formal invite to something.
5,Work great
5,Love it!!
5,This KLIM Ultimate laptop cooler is very cool!  I love the good-mood inticing lights and my laptop is actually staying cool and I hear NOTHING from the fan; a wise investment....  (I also bought KLIM's chroma wireless keyboard and with those backlit sci-fi beautiful colors it's like I'm all set up now to blast off in space...excellent quality from KLIM!  (and honestly no I don't work for KLIM but I have a big mouth for reviews and I like to give reviews as honestly as I can bad or good)).CA MacKinnonMontreal Quebec Canada
5,I wasn’t sure if I would like this cooling pad the others I’ve tried haven’t done much and have been very loud. You can hardly hear the fan on this! The angle is great and my posture is much better while gaming. The lights are pretty too- but overall I’m happiest with the functionality. It’s also the only cooler I’ve had that has made such a big difference in the temperature of my laptop after a few hours of gaming. Highly recommend!
5,Mon PC chauffe ses derniers temps et le KLIM Ultimate  rempli parfaitement sa mission.Design sympa  très peu brillant et Klim est une marque de qualité je ne suis pas déçus.seul petit truc c'est qu'on reçoit un câble d'alimentation avec de connecteur USB mâle et nul par t j'ai eu l'explication.Est ce qu'il faut impérativement utiliser 2 port USB pour connecter le KLIM Ultimate si quelqu'un à la réponse merci.
4,Rafraichisseur efficace et silencieux. Je ne suis pas trop fan des LEDs mais c'est un + pour ceux qui aiment ça.Attention néanmoins à l'utilisation en mode incliné : c'est pratique et réglable mais sur la plupart des modèles de PCs l'écran vibrera lorsque vous tapez sur le clavier. Perso ça me gêne j'ai stabilisé mon écran avec un pied posé sur le bureau en complément.
4,It’s fits relatively small for my Alienware M17 R2... the fans is working but it’s not that strong to actually cool the laptop when your using the system extremely hard... it’s only useful if you have smaller laptop and the only cool thing about it it’s RGB... they should release a larger cooling pad that can accommodate bigger laptops such mine
5,As you can see from my pictures; Aesthetically it's absulutely amazing and mesmorising to watch and enjoy. In terms of build and design they haven't missed a thing. My laptop is oversized as it's a gaming / development laptop so alot larger than most and fits beautifully.The clip at the front that ensures your laptop doesn't fall off is brilliant. I wouldn't have even thought of that! Bravo.The service is second to none as it arrived in no time. The packaging is amazing as it's well packed looks professionally presented and the little note inside... Well I'll leave that for you to to read as it really did make me both smile and laugh.My only criticism and it's nothing serious at all is that personally I would have done a "PWM fade" between the LED changes in the multi colour mode so they face into each other rather than "move along" but like I said unimportant... I'm just uber picky.The temp on my laptop whic usually burns at 65+ degrees is down to 48! I KID YOU NOT... I went through buying and using liquid metal cleaning fans everything... This thing is a Godsend...That said.. I'm going onto their amazon now to see what else they have because quality like this is just engineering at its best.Just because you've earned your space in the hall of awesome I've added your stickers to this laptop my PC (MSI) and saving the others for my next....
5,Solid cooling fan/platform. The lighting function is a bit distracting so I don’t use it but it looks cool when on! My laptop is running considerably cooler. If this pad doesn’t fix your heat issues don’t blame the pad clean out your dusty ass laptop and re-paste your processors!Also silent on the highest fan speed if anybody was wondering.I would suggest using a separate keyboard when using this thing more ergonomic as it raises your laptop up a bit
5,Absolutely perfect! Fits my 17" Asus Strix without it overhanging and the fold up lip keeps it in place. The large fan draws a lot of air and is relatively quiet considering the size. I definitely recommend it it's a great bang for the buck!
1,Don't waste your money on this heap of plastic ****. It barely cools down anything the fan is not powerful enough to do anything. If you like RGB tacky lighting then you will love this but if you want something that will help your investment cool look elsewhere. This is a knockoff of a more expensive brand but it can't even imitate a proper cooling pad properly. Keep your money and but a different brand.
5,Excellent Cooler for any PC laptop as it keep my Monster quite cool my laptop is a 9th gen I7 an 64 Gigs of Memory Gamers i guess which i don't game but becomes a Furnace  until i got this one from KLIM  Love the light show but can rarely use as  when it is on my Dog Howls an whines and wants to chase it for some reason when  alone is Great light show the harder you work your machine the better it looks also VERY QUIET operation and keeps the furnace into a Freezer mode Couldn't ask for anything better you will not go Wrong buying it!
5,Great laptop cooler. Good and decent quality. The LED light is a fun feature I turn off its light most of the time as I see no use of it. This cooler is Very very quiet it is turned to highest speed and my studio condenser microphone does not pick up any of its noise from about 1.5 metre away. My ears is about 90cm away and I cannot hear it's noise. I ended up have put my hand under my laptop to feel the breezes to confirm it's actually running.Well done Klim
3,In terms of gaming or even just streaming it made no difference looking at that temperature stats. It's fine for a regular cooling pad though but definitely not good enough for gaming or streaming.
5,Almost fit my Dell Inspirion gaming laptop. Just have to align it further forward in line with the front horizontal edge without using the cooling pad stopper latch. Easy to switch between light modes. After a week of usage I just kept it in fixed mode instead of cycle. Although it has only one big fan it is sufficient to keep my laptop cool while gaming. You do not need to plug in both usb connectors if both lights and fan are working. Should have specify that in the description. Yeah I wasted money on usb hub because I thought both usb connectors need to be plugged in. And no those two connectors don't powerup lights and fan individually. Any one will work.
5,Muy buen producto. Excelente. Entraba el ventilador de mi lap y antes se tardaba una eternidad en enfriar el equipo y se alentaba  ahora dura poco el ventilador de la lap y si broncas lo único digamos medio malo fue que en amazon no había detalles del envío y en donde estaba pero llegó mucho antes del tiempo programado y en excelentes condiciones. Altamente recomendado valió la pena la espera.
5,Après un mois d'utilisation je suis toujours aussi satisfait.D'ailleurs j'ai moins mal au cou maintenant que l'écran est plus élevé.Par contre petit côté négatif à noter.  Si vous utilisez la caméra et que vous tappez en même temps ça fait bouger la caméra.  Donc si comme moi vous passez vos journée en conférence Zoom ça pourrait vous agacer mais sans plus.
5,Llego en muy buen tiempo haciendo el pago de envió urgente.. el producto venia en super bien empacado en su caja y instrucciones y algunos stickers en lo estético no hace nada de ruido y quedo perfecto el tamaño para mi laptop15.6" el rgb esta muy chulo con varios modos y colores... funcionalmente mientras juego si mantiene la temp del CPU unos 7 a 8 grados menos de lo que usualmente estaba de 99 - 98 grados C a 91 - 89 grados C
5,I bought this for my gaming laptop which turns into a furnace when I'm actively gaming. It's been able to keep my laptop cool and is very aesthetically pleasing. The brightness and colours are perfect. My partner was so impressed that I ended up having to buy a second one and we're both very happy with this product.
5,El ventilador de computadora o más bien enfriador portatil de laptop es una maravilla. si enfria no hace ruido las luces se ven muy chidas. No se arrepentirán porque parece mucho dinero por un ventilador pero estás comprando calidad la calidad cuesta.
5,This is my second laptop cooler. My first was a cheap finicky thing where one of the two fans broke the day I received it. This is so much better it’s bigger and easier to put together and take down the fan is huge and does so much work to cool the laptop and makes minimal sound which is great. The price was great for such a sturdy product that works really well. Also I love the flashing rainbow colours. Would recommend
5,The only issue I have is that it uses one (and maybe two) USB port on the laptop to power the KLIM.  Fortunately I have an old USB charger that I could use instead and that give enough power.
4,I use my laptop for virtualization with several machines working simultaneously so it tends to get hot. While using this fan meant a significant reduction of heat I was expecting this to be a little bit more powerful. The noise is easy to ignore the build quality is just right and the lights are really nice.
5,Works great!  I think this is the best one that I have purchased thus far.  The colorful LEDs are pretty spectacular as well.
5,Very impressive cooling pad. Customer service is very good due to the fact that I had an LED defect in the first shipment and I was able to get a immediate replacement for free.I recommend this .
4,For the amount of fan noise you would think it was super powerful airflow but not really. Well constructed.  Lights are super bright.
5,this fan is very quiet and lightweight! much better than those brandless knock offs! the light is customizable for static colors like white or disable it completely for low profile desk setups. highly recommended!!
5,It is 100 perfect for laptops that are hot a lot this cooling pad is like a table for your laptop you cant hear it but you can feel the cool air coming from it i wouldn't buy any other cooling pad
5,For those who are considering KLIM™ Airflow or other multi-fan cooling pad.KLIM™ Ultimate is actually silent at low speed. KLIM™ Airflow isn't. It was driving me nuts.
5,It's nice and I love the colours
1,the look and feel of the product is good but sadly my Laptop keeps heating up even with the fan on full speed.Yes I have checked and no its not my laptop. It is because of the stand :(
5,Nice quality
5,Super bien por el precio la recomiendo
4,Nous utilisons ce produit pour diminuer la chaleur d’un laptop de gamer et ça fonction très bien et en plus c’est cool avec les lumières intégrées
5,great for a gaming laptop
5,I bought because of the many positive reviews and thankfully those reviews are real. Lights look bright and fan is not noisy. Love it!
5,El material se ve de buena calidad feliz con la compra
5,I needed to cool my laptop down. It was heating to 61 degrees C. The cooling pad done it's job perfectly.
5,Good product as expected. Delivery also is very fast. Thank you.
5,It works well
5,Great stuff. Not noisy and working properly.
5,Works amazing for me was able to lower 10c for my cpu temperature
5,Quality and standards are awesome
5,Bought this for a second time. Amazing product.
5,Excelente
5,Very bright and does the job
5,Happy with my purchase
5,Nice product
5,great fan really helps cool down my gaming laptop. comfortable to use.
3,It’s basically just a fan. What could go wrong… for that reason I think a cheaper option would be better. The fan is pretty silent the rgb leaves some things to be desired but whatever I suppose. Conclusion… buy a cheaper option
5,Der Laptop Kühler erfüllt wirklich alle Erwartungen.Er kühlt hervorragend auch meinen iPad Pro der bei einem Zeichnen Programm sehr stark erhitzt.Er ist angenehm leise  leicht und trotzdem stabil.Schade ist nur daß er dafür konzipiert ist waagrecht verwendet zu werden also für ein Laptop.Die Stützen an der Unterseite erlauben nur ein waagrechtes hinstellen.Toll wäre wenn er auch Stützen an der Unterseite hätte mit denen man den Kühler senkrechtstellen könnte um mit einem iPad senkrecht arbeiten zu können.Trotzdem 5 Sterne und sehr empfehlenswert!Nett und witzig ist auch der kleine Brief an alle Käufer und Käuferinnen :).
1,UPDATE: I will leave my unedited review below.  But I wanted to come back and say the company contacted me. I returned this item and bought from a different company. KLIM apologised and offered me a discount code for a future purchase. This did a lot to restore good will. I won’t be afraid to try them again in the future.———ORIGINALNice lights….too bad the fan stopped working less than five minutes in. Not buy from this manufacturer again dang!
5,Cools the gaming laptop brilliantly.Looks amazing with its colour changing leds.
5,J'ai acheté ce produit car je trouvais que mon Mac Book était souvent en surchauffe ces dernières semaines. J'étais un peu perplexe mais au-delà du côté ludique des couleurs qui entourent le refroidisseur c'est très agréable de ne plus entendre mon ordinateur en surchauffe et c'est forcément très rassurant aussi ! Un très bel achat que je recommande.
4,The Klim Cyclone has a sturdy design with no loose parts. This makes it ideal for me to have some parts of the stand over the edge of my small home office desk.The controls are at the back and consists of a colour mode (switch between different colours) light mode (switch between different modes or off) and a fan speed control wheel. The power cable has 2 USB ports only 1 is required. There is unfortunately no additional USB port on the cooler to replace the USB port that it takes.My ambient noise level (with my laptop on) is about 24 dB while with the laptop cooler it reaches about 28-30 dB (measured using a free decibel app). It is definitely audible and due to it have a rotating part (the fan) there is a cyclic pattern to the noise. It is definitely quieter than my laptop fans (when they speed up during gaming etc.). I would recommend not to run the fan constantly at max perhaps at 80% as fans in general do not function well when operated constantly at maximum.The fan does a good job of keeping my laptop cool the height adjustments also assist with that by allowing better airflow. It is important to note that your laptop should have air intakes and preferably intake fans at the bottom of the laptop for laptop coolers to make a difference. Also take note where those intakes are located to purchase the correct layout. My intakes are located from the middle of the laptop and continue to the rear of the laptop.The sturdiness (relative) quietness and decent temperature control makes it ideal for my use case. It is difficult to compare different laptop coolers as most of the manufacturers do no state their noise level or air flow rate. Those metrics will be ideal to compare and make an informative decision.I can only refer you to the Klim website for more information regarding the dimensions or noise levels of their products. Alternatively one could contact the customer support as they are very friendly and supportive.I would definitely recommend trying this (or a similar Klim) product.
5,Love the product!! Although it has plastic build but the quality is good! No noise whatsoever from the fan and you can switch off the rgb lights!!! It’s keeping my ASU’s rog strix laptop quite cool when Iam not using my ac which is great!!! Highly recommended!! I bought it in a sale for around 3.8k so it’s a great buy for me.
5,Bin sehr zufrieden. Ist sehr leise Die Lichterleiste ist schön bunt ;)Kühlleistung ist ok. Lebt halt von der konstanten Leistung.Verstellbare Drehzahlmodi wären toll.Ist ok für das Geld. Obere Schmerzgrenze
5,Bene
5,Mi ha salvato da un estate calda luci perfette eliche giuste. Consigliato.
5,Macht was der kann
5,My laptop is 17 inch - it has AMD Ryzen 9 3900 12 Core CPU / NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070. It's used mostly for web development graphics (adobe CC) and a bit of warcraft but lately I've wanted to do some video editing on Premierepro and found it was getting too hot and shutting down.I tried cleaning it all out for dust but there wasn't much inside and still afterwards there was a lot of heat especially on the right hand side where I suspected the internal fan either wasn't working or not doing an awful lot.I had an N11 Tecknet cooling pad but it just didn't seem to be blowing out much cool air. So I bought this having watched Tech Tyrial's very helpful review on Youtube. From the comments it looks like he used the Mistral initially (I didn't fancy that because of the noise) but had some probs and moved on to the Klim Ultimate.It's a sturdy cooling pan and has a nice height adjustable feature. The lights are of course a nice bonus. It also arrives very nicely packaged. It plugs into the laptop via USB. It's nice and quiet even on the highest setting.I've had it just a day but I've noticed an immediate improvement. I've been able to run Premiere Pro and happily edit for hours with no shut down. I'm positioning the cooling pad a bit to one side so the big fan is blasting right under the warmest side.I'm using coretemp - temps seem cooler - I'd say about 10 degrees lower roughly - usually it climbs into the high nineties and then shuts out.So so far a great purchase I'm very happy. Obviously I can't comment on durability as I've only just started using it.
3,Ne convient pas esthétiquement au 173" (voir photo avec 173 pouces MSI) ni même aux 17" contrairement à ce qui est suggéré dans l'annonce du constructeur.Esthétiquement conçu pour des PC de 34cm de largeur réelle au max parce que ça correspond à la dimension de la grille.Le ventilateur est réglable en continu avec un dispositif de type potentiomètre mais avec une valeur de rotation minimale plutôt élevée ce que m'a caché le SAV KLIM.On peut éteindre les leds.Sinon ne consomme pas beaucoup 030A en ventilation max et 019 en mini mais sans les leds.Avec les leds et avec la ventilation au max on est à environ à 056A.Niveau bruit on est dans la norme des supports pas trop bruyants mais rien d'exceptionnel.Niveau ventilation c'est un peu light pour les PC qui chauffent beaucoup.Pas mieux fabriqué que les autres marques de supports qui en proposent plus sur les systèmes de commandes qui dans la cas d'espèce sont situées derrière.En conclusions: Bien trop cher pour ce qu'il offre mais serait preneur à ce prix s'il avait 8 cm  de plus (1 vrai support 173") en largeur avec du coup 2 ventilateurs ou un ventilateur de 200 comme le Thermaltake.
5,CONFORME A LA DESCRIPTION ET SILENCIEUX

4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Ich habe das Gerät vor drei Tagen bestellt und dauerhaft über 8 Stunden und länger im Betrieb gehabt. Es ist festzustellen dass eigentlich so gut wie kein Geräusch zu hören ist. Der große Ventilator oder Lüfter dreht sich ohne jegliche Abgabe von Schleifen Surren oder irgendeinem Rauschen.Was mir nicht so gut gefällt ist dass es zwei USB Anschlüsse sind die angebracht sind. Aber auch nur bei Verwendung von einem einzigen USB Anschluss funktioniert das Gerät einwandfrei. Auch das Licht funktioniert bei mir wenn man nur ein USB Stecker einsteckt.Friedlich entspannt arbeitet der Kühler im Hintergrund während die Hände ergonomisch auflegen können und man ganz normal sein Gerät nutzen kann. Auch die Temperatur ist auf eine angenehme Arbeitstemperatur herunter gekühlt. Selbst bei anstrengenden und komplexen Rechenleistungen wie zum Beispiel Spiele mit hohen Grafik Anforderungen Oder Multimedia Streaming Sind alle schmerzfreier für den Klapprechner auszuführen.Man hat jetzt einfach nicht mehr das Gefühl dass die Festplatte nur so dahin schmilzt. Die Lichter kann man sogar ganz ausmachen was sehr gut ist wenn man einfach nur schlafen gehen möchte.
5,Ich habe den Kühler nun seite einigen Wochen und bin sehr zufrieden.Ich arbeite mit einem 17zöller Gamingnotebook mit einer RTX3080Ti (die entsprechend Hitze produziert).+ Der Kühler passt genau.+ Dank einstellbarer Farben kann ich die Beleuchtung mit dem Notebook harmonisch abstimmen.+ Ich nehme häufiger Videos auf und kann leider nicht mit einem Kühler der neuen Generation ( KLIM Airflow) arbeiten da die dort verbauten "Miniturbinen" eine entsprechende Geräuschkulisse erzeugen. Der Ultimate verwendet einen großen Lüfter der viel Luft bewegt aber deutlich leiser arbeitet.+ Preis-Leistung ist sehr gut der Lüfter ist vernünftig zusammengebaut und sieht nicht aus wie in "China vom Laster gefallen" keine Plastikgrate oder wackelige Verarbeitung.+ Großartiger Support. Ich hatte den Support angeschrieben VOR dem Kauf um mich beraten zu lassen. Ich bekam nicht nur rasch eine Antwort die Antwort war sogar in einem richtig guten Deutsch verfasst sehr freundlich formuliert und ging ausführlich auf meine Fragen ein. Wahnsinn. Das ist man in der heutigen Servicewüste nicht mehr gewöhnt. Dafür noch einmal hier vielen Dank!- Wirkliche Minuspunkte habe ich nicht. Nur zwei Wünsche:> Es wäre sehr schön wenn das Kabel für die Stromversorgung nicht zwei USB-A Stecker auf der einen Seite hätte sondern falls technisch möglich 1x USB-A und 1x USB-C. Immer weniger Notebooks haben viele USB-A Ports und den Kühler an einen Steckerhub anschließen finde ich nicht so toll ich verwende ja einen Notebook um weniger Krempel mit mir herumzuschleppen :-)> Eine Kombination aus der Klim Airflow "Wanne" für die Passgenauigkeit zwischen Notebookboden und Kühler und dem großen Lüfter des Ultimate würde ich mir direkt kaufen. Leise und sehr gute Effizienz.Fazit: Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Klim Ultimate und bin dankbar für den tollen Support.
4,Brauchte den Kühler für ein Razer 15 Gaming Laptop da eine 3070 schon etwas warm werden kann!In der kurzen Zeit In dem ich den Kühler jetzt habe macht er seinen Job ganz gut wenn ich mir auch die einstellbare Drehzahl etwas höher wünschen würde.
4,Does what it says so far and silent.Yet to fully test it. Large form factor could have been made thinner.
4,erfüllt den Zweck kann das Problem jedoch nicht zur Gänze beheben
4,Une réelle différence une étoile en moins pour les boutons pas très pratiques et un petit peu bruyant
4,It is perfect cooling solution. Very quiet I had to check if it was running.  Sturdy and LEDs are a nice feature.  Having a large fan ensures that airflow enters the laptop intakes which sometimes don't line up with other cooling pads this one is not an issue
4,amazing effects with my Lenovo legion 5 proalmost There is no heat at the base of the device I’m happy with the resultI just wish if the fan speed is more than the current speedone question in my mind iswhy there’s two USBit work with only one
4,la company KLIM a remplace directement le produit KLIM ultimate Par contre conseille a la company KLIM en france de faire livrer les colis avec une autre societe de transport que SWISHIP completement incompetent. ne telephone pas au customer pour s'assurer de la livraison et jete les colis sur les balcons en cas d'absence...
5,Silenzioso leggero comodo e di grande effetto il led.
3,Un peu déçu car la languette de maintient en position inclinée et tout juste et aurait méritée d’être un peu plus longue pour maintenir le portable sans qu’il puisse glisser. Rien à dire pour le refroidissement et sur le diamètre du ventilateur qui réduit aussi le bruit. Vraiment gadget les leds. Je m’attendais à mieux vu le prix.
3,Product looks and feels sturdy the RGB is a bit of a gimmick.The cable for some reason comes with one usb that splits into another usb and the 5v power cable.Only the main usb needs to be plugged in.So why add this weird second usb coming out of the main one? No reason it seems (no both don't need to be plugged in! if you think that look at the cable again/feel free to tear it apart and look at the way the wires are set)On to the actual performance. On my bottom air fed 17 inch laptop the temperature drop whilst running heavy load (a tool to put stress on your pc by using every resource at 100%) compared to it sitting on the table was about 7 degrees at max load from 81 down to 74. This is a somewhat respectable result though I recommend going for their cyclone series with 5 fans and the 2 pass  through usb ports given that you can get that for 29 compared to the 40 quid this thing costs and the reduced performance on this model comparatively (on the cyclone depending on your device it's around a 10 degree drop)
5,Ive had a cheep laptop cooler before and my god this was an upgrade. The fan is silent and super effective you also have a choice of angles you can set it at
5,A must for a gaming laptop.
5,Hab schon einige Laptopkühler getestet und der hier ist ganz ok verarbeiten bring auch eine gute kühl Leistung mit dem großen Lüfter. Ganz gut für den Preis
5,J'ai pris ce refroidisseur pour mon petit Asus TUFF qui chauffe un peut bcp à mon gout lors des sessions de jeu.entre 80 et 85°C en utilisation avec le pc déjà incliné pour favoriser le passage de l'air par le dessous.J'ai fait un test simple et rapide ce matin lors de la réception de ce Klim Ultimate mon PC ne variant jamais sous l'utilisation du même jeu habituellement j'ai posé le pc sur le refroidisseur j'ai mis a fond le ventilo qui reste bien plus silencieux que les deux turbines du TUFF soit dit au passage et j'ai lancé le jeu pour un petit test rapide. au bout de 10 min je switch sous Windows pour regarder les valeurs et la : 70/75°C donc entre -10 et -15 de gain avec ce joli petit refroidisseur... CA reste dans la bonne moyenne et si vous possédez un petit pc offrant une entrée d'air par le dessous n'hésitez pas il fait son job en silence.Petit - pour l'usb reporté qui n'existe pas sur ce modèle à cause du RGB qui complique le report des usb.Le cable d'alimentation fourni possède deux usb afin de permettre aux anciens pc de l'aliment par le biais de deux ports couplés sinon sur un usb 3 un seul port suffit à faire tourner la bête.J'ai fait le choix du chargeur de portable 2A qui traînait dans un tiroir et cela fonctionne à merveille.Encore une fois Klim fait du bon beau et qualitatif.Le support est solide malgré sa légèreté et pour une fois le ventilo n'est pas RGB... Bah oui ça sert a rien le RGB une fois le pc dessus !!! Le le bandeau autour est simple joli j'en demande pas plus.Merci Klim !!!
4,Ero un po' scettico al riguardo. Ho avuto tante ventole nel corso degli anni ma nessuno mi aveva mai convinto. Le usavo giusto perché mi tenevano il PC alzato per cui l'alettatura sotto il laptop riusciva a dissipare in maniera più efficiente. Con questo prodotto ho dovuto ricredermi. Design accattivante (luci LED programmabili) e robusto non come le ventole economiche (ci mancherebbe). Per quanto riguarda la ventola la tengo sempre al massimo (mi pare abbia 5 livelli di velocità) e facendo un testbench a riposo la temperatura della CPU mi cala dai 7-9 °C. Sotto sforzo la situazione è un po' diversa. Chiaramente la ventola è veloce ma non velocissima quindi non riesce a smaltire tanto calore quando il PC lavora a pieno carico. Mediamente riesce comunque a tenermi a bada la temperatura calandola di 4-5 gradi rispetto a quando non uso le ventole. Last but not least è possibile variare l'inclinazione del supporto di ben 4 livelli. Io la tengo a livello 1 ma credo che se lo inclinassi ancor di più lo smaltimento di calore sarebbe ancora più efficiente visto che ci sarebbe un maggior flusso (ricambio) di aria sotto alle alette. Oltretutto ci sarebbero meno riflessioni di aria calda provenienti dal piano dov'è poggiato il laptop dato che buttando l'aria verso l'esterno  impatta sulla scrivania e parte di questa torna indietro rendendo meno efficace il raffreddamento. Quindi non sottovalutate il fattore inclinazione. In fin dei conti il prodotto è valido
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The stand comes supplied very well packaged with a USB power lead manual and stickers.It is very well made and you can see and feel the quality it actually looks pretty smart even before its lit up.  Its a mixture of plastic and metal which have been used in good combination to make it really strong.  The metal bracket underneath has 4 positional height slots to fit into the deep grooved plastic slots on the second bracket.But the main emphasis for me was the cooling ability and looking at the 20cm fan which is basically in your face when you look at the stand I had high hopes.The stand comfortably accommodated my laptop and I plugged in the USB cable into a spare port.  I would like to state that the cable is a bit long (80cm) considering the laptop is sitting above the stand.  The back of the stand has 2 buttons one for the 5 colours and the other for the colour effects there is also a fan speed control variable slider.With the laptop on and the light effects on the whole unit  looks awesome!  Anyway I loaded a game which gets my laptop GPU rising to 50 or so degrees.  Once temperature was reached I switched on the cooling stand and put the fan on full.  After 10 minutes the temperature had lowered by 8 degrees.  Having placed the game settings to max the stand kept the laptop going without ever topping 60 degrees normally the laptop would reach 75 degrees and has occasionally shut down.So happy gaming days ahead when I get the time!I forgot to mention there is a liftable flap at the front to stop your laptop sliding down.Overall 5 Stars and highly recommended for your over heating laptops.
4,Bei meinem Benchmark Test Lüfter auf 100% konnte die Kühlung  Leistung zwischen 5-10 Grad gemessen werden.Der Unterboden beim Asus ist zwar teils Kunststoff teils Gummi er ist aber deutlich Kühler an der Unterseite geworden nach einem Leistungstest.Schade das es umständlich ist hinten ans Lüfterrad zu kommen und sich an die Knöpfe ranzutasten.Eine Anzeige wie schnell die Lüfter grade laufen wäre hilfreich.Man selber wird auch leicht vom Wind abgeblasen… was aber keineswegs negativ ist.Ich werde es aufgrund der ausreichenden Kühlleistung behalten. RGB ist ausgeschaltet da mein Asus eine eigene besitzt.
3,It looks great and perfect size for 15.6" laptop. but BUT it's just slow. Doesn't cool the laptop enough!
4,Der Lüfter ist zwar kein Kühlschrank aber er lüftet. Natürlich darf man keine Wunder erwarten aber 4-5 Grad weniger bekommt er schon hin was bei hohen Belastungen den Unterschied machen kann.Er ist nicht lautlos aber deutlich leiser als der Lüfter meines Laptops.Außerdem sieht er cool aus :)Würde ich wieder kaufen.
4,So I bought this cooling pad for my GS66 stealth (i7 & 2060 config.) not because it did not stay cool (it did when turning 'cooler boost' on) but because it was relatively loud.  With cooler boost I can play Doom Eternal (ultra/nightmare settings) hitting about 75C (no cooling pad) average or about 71C (with cooling pad). It is worth mentioning that turning the cooling pad's fan on/off made almost no difference here so it was mostly the raising and allowance for better air flow that made the difference. However WITHOUT cooler boost I easily hit the 90-95C cap while with cooling pad it went down to an average of 85C (spikes to 90 happened occasionally butreally negliable). So with cooling pad I can comfortably play without thermal throtteling reasonable temperatures and reasonable sound (fan noise from Laptop not cooling pad the pad is almost silent). This trend was roughly observable throughout all games (Doom just being the reference of choice)RGB COLOURS:The pad has 6 different modes: Rainbows moving around the pad RGB cycling (strip in one colour and cycling through the spectrum) Slow blinking Fast blinking Steady Off.Slow and fast blinking have the colours: Teal  Blue White Purple Red Yellow Green.Steady has the colours: Blue White Green Red.Yes steady does not have teal purple and yellow (which is a bummer hence only 4 of 5 stars would've loved all choices for steady. Also I could nowhere find any information on which colour options/colours are available so I took the gamble when buying and feel like there should be a bit more transparency).
3,Wunderbar leise auch in der Maximalen Drehzahl TOP Lüfterlager. Leider etwas dick das ganze Teil wegen der aufwändigen und stabilen Mechanik um den Kühler anzuschrägen. Ka. wer das braucht wird sich freuen.Im Gegensatz zum Klim Wind aber etwa 30% geringere effiktever Luftdurchsatz. Reicht evtl. noch für Laptops mit gutem Kühldesign wie Razer oder Alienware bis zum 6-core+ 2070ti aber mehr schafft der wohl nicht.KLIM BITTE MEHR MAXIMALE DREHZAL FÜR DIESEN LÜFTER. NATÜRLICH WEITERHING VERNÜNFTIGE LAGER VERWENDEN NICHT SO SCHLECHTE WIE BEIM KLIM WIND.
4,Der Regenbogenfarbverlauf ist leider nicht so smooth wie bei anderer Hardware (zb von Razer) ist aber eigentlich schön anzusehen. Dieses "ruckeln" hat mich persönlich aber schon gestört daher habe ich auf den farbwechsel umgestellt und das gefällt mir ganz gut.Mein größerer Kritikpunkt wäre aber dass der Kühler keinen einzigen USB-Anschluss hat. Somit habe ich an meinem Laptop bzw angeschlossenen usb-hub nun einen Platz weniger. Das habe ich schon besser gelöst bei ähnlichen Produkten der Konkurrenz gesehen.Ich bin dennoch zufrieden mit dem Kauf - vielleicht sollte ich mir einfach einen usb-hub zulegen der mehr Steckplätze bietet.Trotz allem - gerade wegen des schönen Designs - von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung.
5,Den Kühler benutze ich für den Lap Top. Er ist sehr leise und es lässt sich gut damit arbeiten da man ihn stellen kann. Bin sehr zufrieden.
4,Esthétique pratique
4,Besitzen das Produkt nun seit mehrern Tagen und bin sehr zufrieden.Der Lüfter ist für meine Verhältnisse sehr angenehm leise selbst auf max. Allerdings macht der Lüfter teilweise komische Geräusche die mich nicht wirklich stören.Temperaturen haben sich bei meinem Laptop (HP Victus 16/ R5 5600H RX 5500m) leicht verbessert beziehungsweise wurde der Laptop nicht mehr so schnell laut. Allerdings sollte man nicht mehr wie 5°C weniger erwarten. Habe zwar auch mal 8°C weniger gesehen kam aber selten vor.Im großen und ganzen bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dem Produkt und kann es nur weiterempfehlen.
5,I really don't use to write reviews but this time I felt I needed to share how satisfied I am with the cooling pad!It looks really awesome and it's so quiet I can sleep with it on.RGB is sometimes a cool future Really lifts the whole desk.I have a thinkpad X1 extreme. It gets hot and its custom fans is very noise. With this cooling pad that never happens. And my laptop is always in cool temperature.I'm sure it will lenghten the life of my laptop significantly!
4,Esthétiquement c'est beau bien fini facile à mettre en oeuvre. 4 à 5 modes de lumière. un varaiteur pour le ventilo.Le miens n'a pas fonctionné un journée. la moitié des leds restaient sur une couleur fixe. puis il s'est mis à fonctionner depuis plus de soucis.l'effet refroidissement est efficace visible sur les bench en ce qui concerne mon Acer nitro an517 rtx 3070 + ryzen 5800h.le produit est silenceux dans le brassement mais il y a tout de meme un bruit parasite audible dans un environnement sans bruit comme le miens.la taille est parfaite pour mon 17".le prix est plus chère que les autres produits mais ca reste correcte.L equipe klim à repondu a tout mes messages avant et après achat. cela inspire confiance pour les 5ans de garantie.
5,Relaxant oui grace à ses lumières douces.... Rafraichissant aussi bien le pc portable (si le smartphone si vous le glissez dessous) et par cette chaleur estivale nous donne l'impressions de ventilation.
5,ok
3,Sent this back after two days.Reduced laptop temps by about 5 degrees C.Nice sturdy stand with nice RGB LED’s but not very good for cooling gaming laptops with high temperatures.
3,Before buying any cooling pad please pay attention to where your laptop's air intake is. I am more than sure that there are people whose laptops might take air from sides and might have their backs covered. In these cases cooling pads that provide air from below are basically worthless.My laptop's air intake grid is on its back: so it takes air from below and the cooler provides air from below. Should work perfectly you say? Not really. I tested the temperature of my CPU and GPU when they were under a lot of stress (gaming). I watched the temperature change with the fan of the pad turned on and turned off. To my surprise there was no change at all. Maybe 1°C but that is it. The fan itself is pointless.Then I decided to do the same test but with the laptop on my table and then on the pad with the fan turned off. The temperatures dropped around 2°C. I turned the fan on again at max speed - zero change.So in conclusion: the results you can expect are 2°C maybe a little more in your case or maybe even less. This will not cool your laptop it just looks good. The fan literally has 0 impact you can just turn it off. Good for LED lights and elevation (since the laptop now has more space for its fans to take air compared to just being on the table) but not for fan.P.S. I find it really hard to believe people who write things like "oh my god my laptop got 20°C cooler". The fan itself is weak creates barely noticeable air flow maybe elevation helped but still those are crazy numbers.
5,Excelente. Solo  me  gustarían  un par de puertos USB
3,La sto usando da qualche giorno con un PC 17 pollici acceso per circa 8 ore.Per il prezzo pagato pensavo fosse meglio di altre viste in giro non esce tutta questa aria che promette il PC rimane appena tiepido.L aspetto carino e' la luce che cambia colore ma che essenzialmente poi non serve a tenere "fresco" il PC...pagata oltre 50 euro ma secondo me ne vale la metá
4,Does a great job of providing cooling however it needs to be raised to at least the first notch in order to work properly flat it bearly draws any air.Surprisingly quiet only ever noticed it when the laptop was off (I power it via a USB plug)I find the edge lighting more annoying than useful so I leave it switched off.While it's a great pad mine was delivered without a power cable which I had to buy separately for around £3.95 (which is longer than the one that would have come with the pad)
5,Just to clarify the unit I purchased is the single 20cm fan item not the five fan unit.I admit I was very surprised when I unpacked this. For once it was actually large enough to hold my 17" laptop without it hanging over the sides. That alone gets my vote.  But more than that this thing is actually kinda cool.  The LEDs around the edge work extremely well and there's a whole bunch of settings so you can get the lighting you want at the speed you want. The fan is virtually silent and while it doesn't move volumes of air like some it does move enough to keep the laptop relatively cool.The next selling point is the step that holds the laptop on the pad for once a company that doesn't use those awful fragile fold up teeth/prong things. You know the ones the things that collapse while you're typing and snap off in a light breeze.  No this one is a nice solid thick piece of plastic that sits vertically in a nice comfortable slot on the front of the pad preventing the laptop from gradually sliding off. It's nice it's solid it works.Third great point. No spindly legs that snap off at the most inopportune  moment. This has a hinged base with a curved metal bar that sits in deep cut pockets which allows you to set the laptop at whatever angle you are comfortable with.Good solid construction decent quality plastic almost silent fan relatively subtle lighting from the edge and a decent amount of air being moved. Overall this is a damn good buy and value for the price. Just about the first laptop cooling stand I've bought that I am confident of saying that with.
4,Für das zum kühlen nodes Leptons
5,Used it for over a month now and its genuinely perfect. Thanks team
5,bought this as a replacement for my Klim Wind cooler which served me very well for 4 years. was very impressed by that one but it was starting to die and this was on sale (I'm a student so buying things full price is a taboo). wanted to leave a review to drive positive metrics!build quality is fantastic - feels sturdy and the stand is much better than the Wind's solution. aesthetically fantastic I'm not an rgb person so I have it set on solid white (actually quite useful for seeing stuff on my desk in the evening). I guess one possible complaint is that the lighting is uneven but I think thats pretty standard. cools very well the one big fan is better than the 4 on the Wind somehow and noticably quieter too. overall happy with my purchase would recommend investing a bit extra if you're torn between 2 and this is on sale.
4,Silencieux et puissant c’est tout ce qu’on lui demandaitLes matériaux sont propres pas cheap comme j’ai pu voir sur d’autres modèles chez KlimLe seul reproche c’est le câble d’alimentation…D’un côté on a un USB A qui se fait plus rare sur les appareils et de l’autre une petite fiche ronde (genre 6V)Bref tout est bien sauf le câble
4,Robusto fatto bene e veramente molto molto bello. Speriamo duri nel tempo. Silenzioso anche con la ventola al massimo anche se non e velocissima. Però raffredda e sopratutto sul mio pc che ha sotto delle forature proprio per essere raffreddato va veramente bene. Fprse su pc chiusi totalmente sotto nn penso abbia senso. Purtroppo qualche giorno fa ho dovuto fare il reso perche i led d altronde fatti molto vene si aono fulminati in parte. Però ne ho acquidtato un altro sempre stessa marca perché la qualità c'è ma forse sono stato sfortunato.
5,Excellent laptop stand best purchase I have bought for a while! It looks amazing with the rainbow effect lights and super cool  keeps my laptop from over heating whilst gaming  I would definitely recommend 😀
4,The colours are a great addition to any set-up. The fan seems to be doing it's job no complaints.
5,After buying a gaming laptop I was looking for a device to keep it cool whist either gaming or whilst using it in bed (the laptop's fan is on the underside).  I didn't really know what I was looking for stand wise but after doing the usual research I settled on KLIM Ultimate.FYI I have a 17" and it fits perfectly.  I'm not really here to talk about the device itself it is exactly what it says it is.What I'm here to say is that when I received my device it was faulty.  The fan was making a lot of noise which I was pretty sure wasn't supposed to be the case.I got in touch with customer support and they were very professional polite and helpful.  I was asked to make a video of the issue and upload it.  Without any fuss it was confirmed that the device did in fact have a fault and without any further questions a new device was shipped to me.  Due to COVID I didn't even have to send the faulty one back.The new one works a treat and as suspected the fan should be almost silent.So I couldn't ask for more than that.  Great device great customer service.  Thank you.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Exelente calidad super recomemdado.
4,Mein Laptop wurde zu warm und verlor an Leistung. Jetzt ist damit Schluss und es wird gekühlt.
5,Ottima base di Raffredamento  ovviamente per pc che hanno la presa d aria sotto altrimenti non serve a nulla in generale questo tipo di prodottobuona qualità costruttiva e lavora bene  in maniera silenziosa  rotellina per spegnere o regolare intesitàe doppio tasto per scelta colore rgb e animazione delle luci
3,Für das bisschen Plastik ein viel zu hoher Preis. Der Ventilator ist so lala.Ich würde mir ein günstiges Produkt kaufen. Das hier ist billiger Plastikmist
5,I have a Lenovo Legion 5 Ryzen 7 5800H with dedicated RTX 3070The airflow and raised profile allows more than average airflow but while playing at full max settings it gets loud and hits temps in the high 70s 77 being about the max..This not only raises it up higher allowing more air in the fan helps cool it to 45/50 when hitting the machine hard so much better.Only bug bare is when the laptop is off you have to unplug the usb connection to turn the fan and Led off
4,Its a nicely sized cooler platform capable of easily holding my Alienware M15 laptop. It gives out less noise than the inbuilt laptop fans so I don't notice any excessive noise.The platform raises my laptop about 4cm off the table so unless your using a usb keyboard and mouse you may find it uncomfortable. The LED lighting is changed by a button on the rear so nothing fancy available through software.The plastic isn't premium and the hinge to elevate quite basic. It also requires 2 x USB ports to power it so could cause issues if you dont have access to many free USB port. I have it running off a USB-C to multi USB-A port adapter and its working fine.The main thing is that during gaming my processor has dropped approx 15c of max temperature. This has been a great help as my CPU isnt throttling anymore to keep temps down.Unsure its worth the premium price as its not a top quality item. However very happy with its performance and it does its primary job of keeping my laptop cool.
3,Schaut schön aus aber leider schwach könnte stärker sein. Hören kann nicht  hübsch und praktisch einstellbar .
4,I got this mainly for the decent size and adjustable elevation. The lights are a nice touch though and I have the fan on the lowest setting so to be as quiet as possible. Very sturdy and better than the cheaper alternatives.
4,Niveau de bruit très léger même à fond léger  j ai un 17 pouces passe avec cet appareil.
5,Bought for my acer nitro laptop and it does help keeping it cool whilst I’m gaming. Looks pretty cool also with its rgb
4,Parto dal presupposto che mi aspettavo qualcosa di più come flusso d'aria ma vabbè sempre meglio di nulla.Avrei anche preferito un cavo di alimentazione più standard tipo un semplice usb-usb un eventuale sostituzione di quello fornito potrebbe non essere così semplice.Seppure il look è gradevole (almeno nella parte superiore) la qualità dei materiali lascia a desiderare.Una base di appoggio più larga sarebbe risultata più stabile.Il rumore alla massima velocità non è eccessivo ma direi udibile.
5,I love this product!works very well very quiet and allows my CPU to run for longer at safer temps while gaming. I was worried about my purchase due to some reviews I had read but I am very happy with the product.Price could have been better but ive gotta admit the quality is worth it.
5,The cooling pad is sturdy and easily adjustable. It puts my laptop screen at a great height especially as I have it next to an external monitor. I had an issue with the power connector over a year into owning it but the customer service was amazing they helped get it sorted incredibly quickly with no cost to me. I bought one of their keyboards afterwards because I know that if i ever do have an issue they'll sort it straight away.
4,Qualità dei materiali non dei migliori  ma fa il suo lavoro  i LED rgb fanno molta scena
3,Joue bien son rôle pour refroidir mon PC portable (ca souffle fort!) par contre ce que je reproche c’est que contrairement à d’autres marques de refroidisseur celui la monopolise 2 ports USB (un pour l’éclairage un pour la ventilation) ce qui fait que mon PC portable est amputé de 2 ports USB ce qui n’est pas anodin. Prévoir d’acheter en plus le dongle USB pour pallier à ce problème.De plus je trouve que la conception fait très « plastique » très peu de présence d’aluminium et pour ce prix je m’attendais à mieux. Niveau du bruit ça va.
4,I have an oldish gaming laptop (coming up on 4 years). I was noticing some overheating when running some demanding games without a cooling stand. This has definitely helped I've the temperature drop when using it even after a long gaming session.  It's very well built and feels sturdy I'd definitely recommend.It does only have a single fan I can't comment on how it stacks up against other stands that have multiple fans but I'm pleased with it.
5,Nachdem ich mehrere Laptop-Kühler durch habe die entweder aufgrund von zu hoher Geräuschkulisse oder mangelhafter Verarbeitung allesamt nicht lange durchhielten versucht hatte landete ich schließlich beim KLIM Ultimate. Das Design mit einem großen Lüfter ist deutlich besser da der Durchfluss im Verhältnis zur Lautstärke bei niedriger Drehzahl viel größer ist.Ich verwende den Kühler in erster Linie mit minimaler Drehzahl wo er gottlob wirklich fast[1] unhörbar ist um meinen Laptop ohne interne Lüfter zu kühlen - weil die auf der untersten Stufe viel viel lauter sind sodass ich effektiv über lange Zeit und ohne Volllast praktisch lautlos arbeiten kann. Die Temperatur der Chips reduziert sich von 54° auf ~42-43°. Dazu muss man allerdings auch sagen dass das Design für meinen Laptop (XMG Fusion 15) perfekt geeignet ist - die Lüftungseinlässe an der Unterseite des Chassis sind genau dort wo der KLIM Ultimate die meiste Luft bewegt.Ich habe nicht viel Erfahrung mit den höheren Drehzahlbereichen kann aber sagen dass sie schon *deutlich lauter* sind insbesondere natürlich auf Max. Dem steht aber auch eine wirklich erhebliche Kühlung gegenüber wenn der Laptop Lufteinlässe an der Unterseite hat was ja nicht überall der Fall ist. (Dann ist die meiste Kühlleistung natürlich verschenkt etwa wenn der Laptop Frischluft ausschließlich über die Tastatur zieht.)Fazit: Für meinen Anwendungsfall im niedrigen Drehzalbereich absolut perfekter Kühler den ich auf für das Büro noch anschaffen werde.[1] Ich sage fast weil man ein leises Surren bei absoluter Umgebungsstille feststellen kann. Nach einiger Zeit Benutzung stelle ich allerdings auch fest dass ich den Lüfter meistens nicht zusammen mit dem Notebook ausschalte weil ich einfach vergesse dass er läuft und mir erst nach einiger Zeit irgendwann klar wird dass da noch was summt - und ohne Grund muss sich ja der Lüfter nicht abnutzen.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Si vous cherchez à refroidir votre ordinateur portable gaming qui chauffe beaucoup trop pendant la canicule celui-ci est fait pour vous !Ce ventilateur couvre plus de 30cm de surface ce qui lui permet d'être utilisé pour des ordinateurs allant jusqu'à 17". Il est équipé d'une petite molette nous permettant de régler sa puissance de rotation qui n'est même à la vitesse maximale absolument pas dérangeant (on entend à peine le ventilo cf. vidéo).Une petite languette en plastique (vachement dure) est disposée en bas du ventilateur ce qui permet à l'ordinateur de tenir même si le ventilateur est incliné vers l'avant.Comme écrit dans le descriptif du produit le ventilateur est équipé d'une bande de lumière RGB avec plusieurs effets réglables via deux boutons à l'arrière du ventilateur (voir photo) un petit plus bling bling qui vous permettra de briller au sein de votre maison tel un phœnix dans la nuit (ou pas).L'un des seuls points négatif que je pourrai pointer du doigt concerne sa puissance.Si le ventilateur n'est pas très bruyant c'est bien parce qu'il ne tourne pas aussi vite d'un handspinner. La puissance maximale du ventilateur étant assez faible elle reste tout de même assez forte pour refroidir convenablement votre ordinateur.Je recommande fortement ce produit :)
4,Il prodotto è buono e fa egregiamente il suo lavoro. Unico neo: il fermo che impedisce al PC di scivolare è corto e non fa molta presa. Se si sceglie un'inclinazione più verticale (dalla terza alla quinta posizione possibile) il PC tende a muoversi e rischia di cadere con eccessiva facilità.
3,Well for the purpose I use it it doesn’t make a big difference on actually cooling my laptop for me it’s only a different of -2 degrees(with out using the cooler I get like 75 degrees and with the cooler just 73 degrees) and it’s not really a big thing
5,das teil funktioniert einwandfrei. es kühlt den laptop garantiert hab es getestet.man sollte sich aber kein wunder erwarten. der laptop wird trotzdem noch unerhört laut.aber meine fps sind schon mal um einiges stabiler getestet in total war warhammer 2.es braucht auch viel länger bis der laptop laut wird.ich werd es aufjedenfall behalten in der hoffnung das mein laptop somit länger lebt.es sieht auch schick aus.aber wie viel mehr es wirklich bringt kann ich als leihe nicht sagen.bin dennoch zufrieden. schöne leds. und laut guides soll es ja dem laptop helfen.falls einer von klim das liest wärs nett wenn ihr vlt ansonsten noch ne andere empfehlung für mich habt was den acer nitro5 leiser machen könnte.
5,Kühler lässt laptop wieder erkalten. Meine im Laptop verbaute 3070 graka wird gut runtergekühlt.Unter anderen gehen die intern verbauten Lüfter in meinem lenovo laptop nicht mehr auf volle Touren das man denkt neben einem startet ein Flugzeug. Der Lüfter ist kaum zu hören nur bei voll aufgedrehten Poti ist ein leichtes surren hörbar. Voll aufdrehen ist bei mir aber nicht nötig da er auf halber Stufe den Laptop gut genug kühlt.Von mir volle Kaufempfehlungen
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               mir ist beim 1. Lüfter ein Teil abgebrochen (meine Schuld) habe Lüfter verglichen und bin wieder bei diesem gelandet* kam schnell an* leise wenn der Laptop drauf steh* verringert bei World of Warcraft Overwatch Genshin Impact Life is Strange Ruckler*kühlt im Sommer auch den Benutzer:)* Drehgeschwindigkeit Farben (auch RGB) Farbmodus einstellbar
4,Considerando che ho già una base di raffreddamento della tecnet..ho voluto provare quella della Klim il primo acquisto era senza il fermo della base se io avessi voluto leggermente inclinare la base a 30 gradi avevo il pc che scivolava verso il tavolo ho restituito il prodotto che a parte con questa mancanza/difetto troppo piccolo per un 17 pollici ho voluto comunque provare la KLIM rgb come dimensioni va più che bene per un 17" esteticamente è molto più bella si controllano i  colori fa il suo lavoro... ma occupa due porte usb ma con quello che si paga potevano tranquillamente mettere una seconda porta usb in modo da recuperare quella occupata nel pc anche perché i portatili non vantano di avere tante porte usb... considerando che ho una workstation Dell Precision 7200 17 " della klim uso la base di raffredamento /che è arrivata oggi e la metto alla prova) e due KLIM Cool + Sistema di Raffreddamento Laptop in Metallo  perché le uscite d'aria in questo pc stanno dietro e sono due il pc in questo modo lavora notevolmente.
5,Alles bestens!
4,O produto em si é excelente. Cumpre tudo o que promete e arrefece muito bem. O problema foi mesmo a embalagem em que veio… ou falta dela. Veio simplesmente com uma etiqueta de envio colada na mesma. Muito mau
5,Bei meiner Suche nach einer Halterung für meinen Laptop mit eingebauter Kühlung war ich entsetzt wie billig die Produkte vieler Anbieter wirkten. Ich habe mich daher für dieses durchaus etwas teurere Produkt entschieden und bereue es nicht. Es macht einen hochwertigen Eindruck und wirkt trotz LEDs nicht wie die Beleuchtung eines Kindergeburtstages. Die Lautstärke ist wahrnehmbar aber absolut akzeptabel. Ob eine Verringerung der Temperatur meines Laptops stattfindet habe ich nicht überprüft.
5,Das ist schön produkt mit Farben und so aber was wichtiger ist ds ( kühlung) umsonst:/ .. najaDas Laptop is das gleiche mit Temperatur und Lüfter echt laut :/
5,Seit fast zwei Jahren nutze ich diesen Lüfter bei meinem neuen Gaminglaptop weil mein altes Gerät nach 8 Jahren durch die Hitzeentwicklung den Festplattentod gestorben ist und ich diesen Verschleiß so weit wie möglich hinauszögern will. Ich bin mit dem Produkt total zufrieden. Der Lüfter kühlt den Laptop super selbst bei stundenlangem Zocken von Spielen die viel Leistung einfordern spürt man kaum Wärmeentwicklung. Habe ihn an eine Freundin weiterempfohlen die ist ebenfalls total zufrieden. Die Optik gefällt mir auch sehr gut. Es ist außerdem toll dass sich die Farben so flexibel verstellen lassen. Der Lautstärkepegel ist ebenfalls in Ordnung und stört mich überhaupt nicht.
5,Klasse Teil sehr angenehm leise. Beleuchtung ist nettes Gimmick
2,Its super slow i expected it to be very fast but it wasnt i dont mind if it makes noise but it is extreamly slow and basically does not do what its advertised
5,Roulette de vitesse pour le ventilo reçue en 2jours ( ( sans amazone prime ) branchage USB directement à l’ordi ou prise ( chargeur téléphone )Ce matériel est vraiment silencieux. Je le recommande fortement pour un PC qui a tendance à réchauffer sur des jeux vidéo style ( league of légende. Warcraft. Battlefield…) ne vous attendez pas à une chute de 15 degré bien évidemment. Mes le matériel joue sont rôle puis le dispositif d’éclairage est vraiment sympat. ( Mon Pg lenovo Légion âmd ryzen série 5 GTX 3060 de 2021 )
5,I have a 17" Toshiba laptop and it fits fine on the stand in the flat position I cannot go to the highest tilt position as the laptop will not stay on the stand in that position however the next tilt setting and the laptop is kept firmly in position.This keeps my laptop cool the only thing that would improve this particular stand is the addition of a couple of USB ports I knew that the stand didn't have the ports at time of purchase. 5 Stars highly reccommended.
3,Dopo aver sperimentato qualche surriscaldamento con il mio HP Z Book  17" mi sono deciso ad acquistare una base di ventilazione.  Personalmente ho trovato KLIM Ultimate ragionevolmente efficace senza rimanere particolarmente impressionato dalle sue caratteristiche costruttive. Sulla workstation si percepisce un significativo abbassamento di  temperatura l'ingegnerizzazione del sistema e invece accettabile con qualche riserva: la base di appoggio sulla scrivania sarebbe più stabile se avesse  all'incirca la stessa dimensione del piano superiore non si capisce che vantaggio c'e' a farla più piccola (si risparmia qualche grammo di plastica ?) il sistema e' circondato da luci psichedeliche tipo luna-park che potranno far la gioia di qualche gamer in compenso non troviamo un semplice bottone frontale per l'accensione (e stiamo parlando di un ventilatore che a listino sfiora i 70 euro)  il fermo anti-scivolamento potrà essere sufficiente per un PC sottile ma non un PC da 17" con il bordo inferiore arrotondato la stessa rumorosità senza essere particolarmente fastidiosa e' ben udibile nell'ambiente di ufficio. In sintesi un sistema ragionevolmente efficace ma ben lontano dall'eccellenza
3,An sich nicht schlecht benötigt aber zwei USB Stecker. Die Beleuchtung ist meiner Meinung nach zu hell.Es eignet sich sicher für andere Laptops aber nicht für MacBook Pros mit 16 Zoll.Vorsicht nicht falsch verstehen: Ich weiß dass dass Macbook keine Kühlschlitze auf der Unterseite hat jedoch nutzt das Macbook das gesamte Gehäuse als Kühlung. Die Temperatur der Batterie wurde dadurch unter Last um ca. 2 Grad gesenkt ebenso bleibt das Macbook etwas länger kühl. Da ich viel Programmiere und 3D-Anwendungen nutze ist er oft an der Obergrenze der Temperatur.Ich habe gehofft die internen Lüfter etwas entlasten zu können leider konnte ich das aber nicht mit dem Kühler machen. Dieser ist einfach zu schwach dafür.Zum Vergleich habe ich einen PC-Lüfter genommen die wesentlich bessere Ergebnisse erzielen konnte.Deshalb schade ich suche weiter!
4,Der Kühler ist leise und kühlt doch ausreichend um die Betriebstemperatur des Laptops herunterzuregeln. Die Verarbeitung ist sehr solide und größtenteils aus Metall. Die verschiedenen Höheneinstellungen rasten sicher ein die Beleuchtung lässt sich auch ausschalten. Einzig der Preis ist etwas zu hoch. Ansonsten ein guter leiser Kühler den man auch im Büro verwenden kann.
3,je m'attendais à mieux j'ai été un peu déçu.
3,My laptop is 65 celcius
3,Il produit un bon rafraîchissement mais il a du mal à refroidir complètement les ordi épais
5,Also das Teil sieht wirklich sehr gut aus es kühlt auch gut aber der Ventilator macht bißchen unageneme Geräusche aber wirklich nur bißchen ansonsten finde ich das Teil sehr schön und unden die Füße könnten bißchen hochwertiger sein Erfüllen zwar ihren Zweck aber finde sehen zu den Rest sehr günstig aus
5,After test temp goes down around 15 celc. Silent and good made ! Buy it without a concern ! Worth every single penny !
3,Le Klim Ultimate est un très bon produit et de bonne conception mais... Les plus exigeant d'entre vous veront vite la limite car si vous faites des montages photo vidéo ou du gaming ( un peu comme moi ) eh ben oubliez les refroidisseurs plateau.Malheureusement pour moi ce Klim Ultimate ne m'a pas permis de faire chuter la température de mon PC portable MSI ( enfin si pour être honnête 1 voir 2° donc rien de transcendant )Je continue avec mon ventilo mis à plat qui brasse un plus grand flux d'air... donc malheureusement utilisation d'un casque audio obligé.Pas très esthétique tout ça mais cela protège mon matériel assez coûteux et m'évite un rachat prématuré.Ma conclusion :Beau produit bonne conception silencieux et très léger...on sent l'envie de Klim de vouloir satisfaire le client ( Bravo)Mais malheureusement le ventilo ne brasse pas suffisamment de flux d'air pour refroidir un PC gamer ou montage vidéo.Mais assez pour les PC qui utilisent moins de ressources.En espérant que mon avis puisse vous aider à faire le bon choix et aider KLIM pour de futurs mises à jour ( bonne continuation)Times
4,Got this for home-working as my dining table was getting quite hot. Height/angle adjust offers a good range of options so much more comfortable when doing long hours. Lights look great which brightens up my day too! Fine for my 15”work  laptop but my metal 17” gaming one feels quite unsecured due to the only support being a small plastic clip in the middle. Whilst the fan is reasonable enough to keep my work laptop cool enough with email/word/excel and some web pages running I wouldn’t recommend this for serious long term gaming. This was £30 off when I bought it if I had paid full-price and bought specifically for a gaming laptop I would have been rather disappointed. As is it does what I need it to do stops my knock hurting and looks nice and bright!
5,I needed this for my HP Omen gaming laptop. I wanted an easily-adjustable unit with a quiet fan & some nice gizmo lighting. This was the choice & a very good one too.The Omen gets hot quickly but the KLIM keeps it a lot cooler. It's silent enough to be unobtrusive & the laptop sits very well on it. I love the lighting: it adds a bit of class to the whole set-up & it's easily adjustable too with 4 settings for tilt. The fan has a speed controller but I keep mine on high as it's so quiet & keeps the Omen cool during gaming. I use power from an external USB 3 hub which is mains-powered although it could be plugged into a port on your laptop. The KLIM has a great build quality & a reassuring feel to it. The value is excellent: I paid under £30 for mine & I hope to use it for a very long time.
5,Very good! Only just received it but can already see that it does a good job. The cpu temps without it are a toasty 64C peaking at 71C while doing mundane stuff like watching YouTube with the noisy laptop fan running continuously.Putting it on the pad without the fan on reduces the temp to 52C while not doing anything but it still shoots up to 70C when watching a video and the laptop fan is noisy throughout.In both those examples the laptop’s casing is quite hot to the touch.Then switch on the big fan wait a few minutes for things to stabilise and...The case is cool to the touch. The temperature doesn’t go above 52C even when watching a YouTube video... the cpu fan is less noisy (partly compensated by the base fan but oh well).So in short my experience is this doesn’t reduce the noise all that much but it does cool the laptop down! Very happy with it since that’s what I wanted.
4,Klim ULTIMATE testé avec MSI GS60 2QE ghost pro: Bon support avec un niveau de bruit inférieur au PC réglé au maximum. Merci l'unique ventilateur (non RGB) qui souffle suffisamment et réglable avec une molette (éteignable). Gain de 15/20°C entre ventilo éteint et allumé à fond.Mon MSI faisant 390*266mm il n'y a que la bande LED qui dépasse sur le coté.Grille supérieure et barre d'inclinaison métallique châssis plastique.Différents mode RGB pratique (1 bouton mode et 1 bouton changement de couleur).1 seul sens de soufflante (sortie vers le haut) et prise d'air uniquement dessous (pas sur les côtés) obligeant d'incliner le support pour une bonne circulation.Le 1er cran d'inclinaison est un peu trop prononcé (moitié moins aurai été pratique).L’arrêt frontal du PC laisse passer un filet d'air agréable pour les mains.Très bien emballé et protégé pour le transport.Point négatif:A plat l'épaisseur est importante.Manque un hub USB alors qu'il y a largement la place pour.2 prise USB d'alimentation.
5,Produit parfait
3,It can do with improving leds they not many and distanstance between them 3 cm you can see the leds the dark spots. It should of had cob leds it would be much better and more PRIUMUIM look to them....second the fan is wining you can here it its not silent as advertised.... does it do job yes. it does it keeps my laptop in optimum temp and laptop fan don't switch on even in this heat wave we have....  if the fan was not wining I guess besides the leds I would give full 5 stars....  I hope next gen will address these problems
5,Ich nutze ein MSI 15M Stealth die bodenplatte hatte sich öfters stark erhitzt dadurch Leistungsabfall abhilfe mit Klim Ultimate perfekt. Hält dauerhaft kühl dadurch bessere CPU und GPU leistung. Der Klim Ultimate ist sehr leise auch auf Volllast. LED Beleuchtung an den seiten ist ein hingucker 😁. Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Klim Ultimate und empfehle es gerne weiter
5,Refroidiseur parfait je joue sur 7day to day en ultra.Et je joue aussi a new world (ship-trap) le pc se met en sécurité apres quelque heure de jeu a font maintenant avec se refroidisseur qui est parfaitement silencieux je peut jouer  15h d'affiler sans quil chauffe.Personnellement je n'entend pas le bruit du ventilateur.Service client irréprochable réponse extrêmement rapide
5,Super produit !En premier lieu j'en avais reçu un qui ne fonctionnait pas. J'ai eu le service client de Klim qui a été très réactive et professionnel et m'a de suite renvoyé un autre appareil fonctionnel.Du coup je met une note maximal car malgré le contre temps l'efficacité du SAV a été top et 3 4 jours après j'avais un nouvel appareil Klim.
5,Leichtes Gerät trotz der Größe sehr leise und sehr gute Kühlung - stufenlos einstellbar. Hübsches Farbenspiel und läuft sehr lange - auch an der Powerbank. Kann ich nur weiter empfehlen.Habe mehrmals gelächelt als ich die Mitteilung zum Gerät gelesen habe:-) aber das müsst ihr selber lesen...Danke KLIM
2,Ich hatte mir den Kühler mal für meinen neuen Laptop gekauft da beim zocken auf höchsten Einstellungen die RTX3070 doch mal gerne 91 Grad heiss wird. Nun ja die RGB sache ist ein nettes Feature aber war mir nicht wichtig. Viel wichtiger war es mir das der Laptop doch etwas kühler wird. Das Nitro Sense auf dem PC zeigt da immer die aktuelle Wärme an. Getestet wurde auf max. Einstellungen beim Spiel Assassins Creed Origin jeweils immer in 20 Minuten Abstand. Laptop auf dem Tisch stehend 90-91 Grad. Laptop auf dem Klim Ultimate mit Lüfter aus und auf vorletzter Höheneinstellung 87-88 Grad. Laptop mit Klim Lüfter an auf max und auf vorletzter Höheneinstellung 87-88 Grad. Das Fazit: bei mir hat die Veränderung in der Höhe eine sehr minimale Verbesserung der Temperatur gebracht. Der Lüfter der im Klim Ultimate eingebaut ist bringt bei mir leider gar nichts da sich die Gradzahl nicht verändert hat egal ob mit oder ohne dem Lüfter. Ich denke effektiv werden die nur 750 Umdrehungen die Minute leider nicht ausreichen was der Lüfter sich so dreht. Bei mir hatte der Lüfter zudem auch einige komische Geräusche gemacht. 3-4 Grad sind das was man generell von so einem Gerät erwarten kann. 10 Grad wie in manchen Rezessionen geschrieben sind bei meiner starken Hardware defenitiv nicht machbar.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Feels sturdy has a foldable dropper in the back if you want to increase the height/angle of the pad noticed a 5/10c temp drop which is all can I ask for from a cooling pad this was tested with bfv quite a high graphics demanding game most pads will usually only get you around 10c temp drop at max so I'm ok with this and the design including the rgb is really nice in my opinion there's about an inch gap from the surface giving it room to breathe and keeps the laptop of your bed or other surfaces that will overheat your pc.
3,Produits intéressant en dépannage mais reste plus un gadget que autre chose.
4,Perhaps it's because my 17" (screen size) IS to big. I thought it fit a 17" laptop. perhaps I read the gumph incorrectly because it is 17". Still if your actual laptop is over 17" it will extend over the edge. I do love this product tho and the kids enjoy the rainbow beauty as they stare in to it's cosmic wonder. The message from KLIM... well I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.This is a great product and having my laptop at 30o without fear of flimsy joints snapping is a wonderful revelation.+ Bonus brand stickers+ Wonderful personal message about my product- not so quiet anymore "brrrrr"
5,Utiliser sur Pc tuf gaming. bande rgb paramétrable ventilation tournant a fond je perds 10 degrés .Contact avec le vendeur très sympa et réactif donne de bons conseils... Continuez comme ça.
5,I don't often write reviews but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at how effective the cooling element of this product is. I am a video DJ and use it to elevate my laptop to the first stage angle which I feel is right for me (see photo it bit messy as I was just setting up for a party evening but thought I'd let you see it) When in full flow my machine does get hot with the resources I use including encoding videos while downloading songs I don't have following a song request while I'm simultaneously running 2 projector screens and it's noticeably cooler. Regarding the colour effects around the edge of the unit there are 7 colours in either static of moving effects if you wish. I prefer the static blue which gives a nice glow effect but you can choose lots of other configurations such as strobe and running effects too distracting for me but makes the stand very versatile. I'm really pleased with the quality of this product particularly the cooling effectiveness but also looks great.
4,The quality of this stand is fantastic it's really robust and clearly well thought out and designed to last.The LED's are bright and evenly spread giving a great visual effect.There are several grades of inclination for your laptop.The only two points which let this down for me are:There is no additional USB port on the stand to replace the one used by the cooling stand itself.The RGB colour effect as seen in the picture is constantly rotating around the stand which kind of spoils the effect for me - this is just a personal observation though you may like it like that.The bottom line is this is a fantastic cooling stand. Excellent build quality bright and vibrant LED's and the fan is reasonably quiet.
2,Silence et légèreté excellent mais pour ce qu'est de refroidissement 5 ou 8° et encore je suis gentilLa qualité n'a pas de secret mais cela a un prix et ce n'est clairement pas ce produit
5,Lovely and quiet adjustable to tilt and lights up
4,Après 2 ans nous avons déjà pu changer il ne refroidissait plus. Mauvais achat
4,Das Kühlpad sieht super aus und tut was es soll. Die Beleuchtung kommt super aber die Möglichkeiten sie einzustellen sind bescheiden. Die Kühlfunktion ist ausreichend um weniger aufwendige Spiele über Stunden zu zocken. Der Lüfter ist ansich leise aber die (vermutlich) billige Herstellungsweise sorgt offenbar des öfteren für eine leichte Unwucht und macht ihn somit nerfig hörbar. Zumindest bei uns der Fall und wie man ließt kein Einzelfall...
4,Great build quality but is let down by the noisy fan even though it spins at low rpm I think it's because the bearings in the fan are low quality
5,J'ai tout merci
5,Merci beaucoup ! Excellent produit
5,I have always been keen on using laptop coolers to extend the lifetime of laptops but have usually found even expensive ones to be unreliable and short-lived. I am pleased to say this is not true of this product! I purchased the Klim Ultimate+ in May 2020 and it has kept even my older laptop fully capable of running all my online working needs through the lockdowns since then. When I accidentally damaged the power cable the company swiftly sent a new one no questions asked - excellent customer service. This cooler has now already paid for itself and continues to function well months later which is more than I can say for any other I've owned. Also please be aware the RGB lights can be turned off if you don't want them! Highly recommended.
4,good for cooling laptops..
4,I bought this mainly for the stand feature (goes as high as 6 inches) and make my setup more ergonomic. I've yet to stress test my laptop and see the results but the fan is very quiet. Visually the lights are pleasing to the eye there are several choices of colour and modes of lighting.My only complaint is it seems it's designed to hold slimmer laptops and ironically not for large gaming laptops. My laptop is somewhat thick therefore it sometimes slips off on the highest stand. I hope the manufacturers lengthen the holder part so the laptop doesn't slip off.
4,I like it its stable it has some light whether you are for it or not you can turn it off.I think it does cool down for about 3-6 celzius with max fan speed.One complain when you set ur vent max speed it adds some weird noise but its really small compared to the noise of fhe vents on the laptop..I have 17inch laptop and fits perfectly.If you are looking for something like thisbuy it becouse it does its job.
4,我が家のゲーミングノート君の爆音が少しでも小さく、そして冷えてくれることを願い購入。他の方のレビューにもありますが、これでマックスかよ・・・と思う風量ですが、その分とても静かです。マックスでも我が家のノートのアイドリング状態のファンより静かです。こんな風量で冷えるのか、だまされた気分でノートをのっけて起動。4k動画のレンダリングで試してみると目視平均71℃→64℃に。この風量でこんなに冷えるか？と信じられないが実際に冷えてる(笑)周りの電飾はまぶしいので常時切って使用。ちょっと分厚いのが不満だけど、まぶしいほど光る(笑)、軽い、安い、冷える、静かです。
2,I have been using it on a daily basis since I purchased but one of the handles already broke from plastic exhaustion. I had to glue it together. It is holding for now but I expected more.
4,La qualité du support fait très "plastique bas de gamme" près à casser au moindre choc..Honnêtement je suis déçu je m'attendais à beaucoup mieux pour le prix surtout qu'il n'y a qu'un seul ventilateur.Le cable USB est trop court et l'embout qui alimente le support était un peu tordu à la réception.Dans l'ensemble c est très moyen il a de la gueule malgré tout
5,I bought this item as my laptop would sometimes overheat during periods of heavy use and hot weather. Since buying this item I have not had any overheating issues. The fan itself is quiet barely noticeable unless you're actively listening for it even at max speed. My 13" laptop sits very nicely on the tray. I think 17" laptops might have some overhang either side. The 4 adjustable angles are useful: I like the second notch which is at around a 40 degree angle. There is a plastic flap at the front to keep the laptop from sliding off. This seems fine for my lightweight laptop but I'm not sure how this would cope with a heavier laptop. The LEDs are pretty snazzy with 6 different modes (including turned off). The item is expensive for what it is but it does the job for me.
3,Ich hätte mir gewünscht das die Kühlleistung etwas besser wäre aber leider ist sie für mich nicht ausreichend. Evtl. lieget es aber auch daran das ich einen 17" Laptop nutze der übrigends von der Größe her super passt.Mit der Lautstärke kann ich ganz gut leben und bisher klappert da auch nichts.RGB ist halt ne schöne Spielerei und gut umgesetzt.Ergonomisch auch OK und ich finde besonders gut das die Halterung für den Laptop selbst in der Mitte ist denn bei anderen war es jeweils rechts und links und das hatte ich dann immer Kontakt mit den Handgelenken und es drükte dadurch etwas.Fazit: ganz OK aber ich würde ihn wohl nicht noch einmal kaufen sondern einen Stärkeren suchen.
5,It put a smile on my face to read the email received after purchase a nice extra touch. The Product arrived quickly and to spec. Lovely packaging the product build quality is solid and had no trouble holding my 9lb 17.3" laptop. The fan is super big and does a great job at extracting the heat from my device. The RGB is a spectacle to behold it's really well done and bright it also offers lots of customisation via the back buttons on the device. I noticed immediate drops in temperatures on my laptop. The CPU and GPU both ran cooler with this. It's also has a nice feature that it allows you 4 adjustable levels of positioning for the laptop to sit. I find my laptop much more comfortable to type on now over long periods. I can definitely recommend this product.  If your looking for solid built to last solution with beautiful RGB lighting and excellent cooling alongside great customer support then this is for you.
5,C’est efficace : un portable fin doté d’une nvidia 3080 et d’un I7 10eme génération pourra faire tourner indéfiniment le jeu le plus exigeant- il est assez flashy avec sa bande de led multi modes qui sait se faire discrète au besoin - il est plus cher que ses concurrents - sauront ils fournir les mêmes services ? Je ne sais pas répondre - c’est un bon produit - trop bon? À vous d’en juger
3,Comodo e bello da vedere ma se vi serve qualcosa di potente per raffreddare davvero il vostro pc non è il prodotto che fa per voia causa della ventola poco potente;se invece cercate solo una base comoda e bella da vedere che semplicemente tenga il pc ad una temperatura decente durante l'uso quotidiano allora fa per voi
5,Dieser Lüfter ist der erste den ich gekauft habe und bin begeistert. Keine lauten Geräusche bei voller Leistung des Lüfters beim Spielen kühlt 1A. Vier unterschiedliche Einstellung der Lüfterhöhe je nach Bedarf. Preis- Leistungsverhältnis top. Habe ihn jetzt ca. 2 Wochen in Betrieb und kann hier nur meine uneingeschränkte Kaufempfehlung geben.
5,J'utilise le ventilateur de mon ordinateur portable DELL et il fonctionne plutôt bien. J'aime les couleurs et les différents modes que je peux utiliser. Le service client a été vraiment utile avant et après mon achat !
5,Acquistata la versione RGB che è quella specifica fino a 17". misura che è piuttosto faticoso trovare....Stabilità per il PC da 17: ottimo più che soddisfatto.La ventola fa il suo dovere. Il rumore è percettibile in condizioni di silenzio o poco rumore ma non è fastidioso considerando il tipo di ventola che monta!Si può regolare la velocità fino a spegnere la ventola del tutto.I colori RGB sono belli c'e la possibilità di variare da multicolore a colore fisso..... ma siccome non mi interessano particolarmente ho spento la funzione con l'apposito pulsante.Testato sul PC al massimo del suo funzionamento (durante videoconferenza zoom e/o elaborazioni video) e mentre prima la ventola del PC correva a più non posso e faticava a raffreddare ora invece il PC respira e sta bello fresco.....e la ventola del PC riposa..... Buon risultato.Consigliato in questi tempi di superlavoro al PC.
3,Der Ventilator ist groß und erzeugt einen ausreichenden Luftstrom. Die Lautstärke hält sich definitiv unter dem ohnehin aktiven Laptop Kühler.Das Gerät an sich ist stabil so dass man sich keine Sorgen um den teuren PC machen muss der darauf steht. Kleines Manko hier ist dass der ausklappbare Stopper der den Laptop vor dem abrutschen schützen sollte ein paar Millimeter länger sein könnte um seinen Job gut zu machen.Meine größte Kritik ist das Bedieninterface. Dieses sitzt hinten am Gerät und man muss wann immer man Lüftungs Stärke oder Beleuchtung ändern möchte auf gut Glück daran herum fummeln. Die tasten an die Seite oder gar in die Front zu legen wäre hier ein großes improvement.Nice to have wäre wenn man es per USB mit einer Software steuern könnte.Abgesehen davon bin ich für den Preis vollkommen zufrieden und kann meine Kaufempfehlung geben.
5,Very efficient. Quiet fans. Without these fans my GPU and CPU average temperatures are 70 to 75°C. While gaming with KLIM ultimate my temperatures have dropped to an average of 60°C to 65°C. This also automatically reduces the workload of your laptops internal fans resulting in overall less noise. I would highly recommend this product
4,Collegato al laptop spento rimane sempre acceso. Bisogna ognivolta staccare la spina USB rischiando di rovinare l'attacco del laptop. Ho comprato quindi un multi USB con interruttori.Comunque è valido per tenere sotto controllo la temp del laptop. Velocita ventola e luci modulabili.
4,Erstes Gerät hatte nach kurzer Zeit einen Defekt. Die Kontaktaufnahme zum Unternehmen ging sehr schnell und es konnte in kurzer Zeit ein Ersatzgerät beschafft werden. Der Kundenservice ist sehr freundlich und lösungsorientiert.Das gerät selber ist wie beschrieben und kühlt bei Volllast des Laptops nicht extrem herunter hält aber eine Temperatur der inneren Systeme unter 90 °C. Nach Beendigung der Volllast kühlt der Laptop schnell wider auf rund 40 °C Leerlauftemperatur an CPU und GPU herunter.Alles in allem bin ich sehr zufrieden und würde eine Kaufempfehlung aussprechen.
5,I bought this laptop cooling stand a few months ago never had a single issue with it one day I could see the product wasn’t working tried everything contact them and promptly they replaced my faulty product very fast absolutely a no brainier. Would recommend this product and others sold from them.
5,ottima basetta
5,I purchased this laptop cooling stand based upon the amount of positive reviews it received. This particular cooling stand is more expensive than most of the cooling stands available on Amazon and i wanted something that would last and cool my laptop well. Out of the box the stand feels very well built and sturdy. You definitely feel you are getting what you have payed for. The large single fan is great for keeping temps down and being whisper quiet. I have purchased several stands before this one and you would think having more fans would do a better job but that simply isn't the case as my last stand had three fans but it was loud and didn't keep my temps as low as this stand. I also have to mention how good the RGB lighting is! It has a few preset modes and it looks great!  Definitely worth the purchase.
5,Aufgrund der stark entwickelten Hitze  oberhalb  meines in Betrieb befindlichen Onkyo Receivers TX NR 818 suchte ich nach einer Kühlungsmöglichkeit. Diese sollte preiswert unkompliziert ökonomisch vertretbar einigermaßen "hübsch" sein und natürlich den Zweck erfüllen. Beim Recherchieren im Netz wurde ich auf Laptop Kühler aufmerksam. Von allen angesehenen Kühlern gefiel mir der Ultimate von der Firma KLIM am besten. Bei der Entscheidung diesen zu kaufen wurde ich durch den Support von Klim ausgezeichnet mit wichtigen Informationen versorgt und unterstützt. Dort gibts sogar einen "Rund um die Uhr Service". Selbst zur späten heiligen Feierabendzeit  bekam ich die entsprechenden Informationen und einen soliden Rabattcode.Es ist letztendlich alles reine "Geschmacksache" aber mich stört der Kühler auf dem Receiver schon aufgrund der LED (RGB) Einstellungen/Programme) kein bisschen Geräusche sind gar nicht vorhanden und der Receiver ist kühl. Respekt vor dieser Kühlerleistung. Ich bin absolut zufrieden.Mir wurde damit schnell
5,Super Teil sieht sehr schön aus und macht was es soll mein Asus  wird nicht mehr laut!!!
4,Très silencieux le support à l’air de qualité (pas assez de recul pour donner un avis tranché) comptez environ un gain de 5°C (en été et sans clim du moins).La qualité du RGB est basique mais fait le travailil manque aussi la possibilité de personnaliser l’éclairage mais le rapport qualité prix est au rendez-vous.Il n’y a pas non plus de port usb sur le support.Si vous cherchez quelque chose de complet optez plutôt pour la gamme Cyclone si vous voulez finir votre set RGB avec un support sympa et assez efficace foncez !Le gros plus vient de la qualité du SAV de Klim l’équipe est très réactive et sympathique de surcroît !
5,Really good product! Worth the money!! Love the colours.
2,決してほかの方が書いているようには冷えませんでした。温度変化はほぼなかったです。まあ空冷で風量が少ないのであまり冷えるとは思いませんでしたが。音は静かなんで気休めに使うのはありかもしれません。2000円くらいで買えるものと同程度かもしれませんが。
5,Having a gaming laptop is great for the mobility and freedom it provides but it comes with some issues mainly the overheating.Some laptops perform better then others but in general if you have a high powered machine your gonna need something to help cool it.There's many different types of cooling pads out there but none I think so aesthetically pleasing as this.The rgb surround is stunning and with a nice variety of colours and modes.The fan itself is quiet and at first quite underwhelming but it works just fine. Also there is three positions for the stand too.Overall I am more then happy with this cooling pad and recommend it.
1,Am Tag der Lieferung angeschlossen und hat funktioniert. Ein Tag später geht der Lüfter nicht mehr! Die Belichtung funktioniert noch ist offensichtlich also kein Strom Problem. Gerät wurde auch mit beiden USB Steckern direkt angeschlossen.Fühlt sich ausserdem extremst billig an (Billig Plastik) und die Halterung um den Standwinkel zu verstellen ist sehr billig gemacht und macht keinen stabilen Eindruck. Für 50 Euro habe ich mir mehr erwartet zumindest daß das Teil nicht nach 1 Tag kaputt geht. Das ist heute wohl so üblich.
5,Fit to 17'' laptopvery silent as described.Work very nice  with Klim cool air vacuum at the same time as I thought from the start.Good money fast shipping and reliable  seller!Thank you!
4,Prestazione un po’ deludente.
3,Optisch macht das Gerät ein sehr schönen Eindruck. Die Lichteffekte sind eine schöne Spielerei wer es gerne Bunt mag. Zur Kühlleistung/Effekt finde ich es etwas schwach auf der Brust. Es lässt sich zwar die Geschwindigkeit einstellen vom Lüfterrad aber bisschen mehr wäre etwas besser.Die Qualität ist für mich für den Preis vollkommen ok. Es wirkt für mich jetzt nicht als billiger China Müll.
1,I am very dissapointed the cooling pad does not provide even close to good cooling the fan is not strong at all it is quite the materials are good it is comfy but that is not the point the point is it does not provide enought cooling lights are nice but otherwise not strong cooling pad. Better buy something else.
5,Eigentlich brauche ich keinen Notebookkühler  da ich meistens am PC Sitze . Und wenn ich am Notebook "arbeite"  dann wird es auch nicht sonderlich warm . . . Aber ich habe mir das Teil trotzdem bestellt  weil ich ein RGB Fan bin  und es klasse aussieht . Also über die Kühlleistung kann ich wirklich nichts sagen . Ich habe den Kühler auch nicht mit dem Notebook verbunden  sondern mit einer USB Verlängerung am PC . Der Kühler ist aber sehr leise  man hört ihn kaum .
5,Nunca pensé que una base enfriara tanto. Me ha sorprendido que haga tan poco ruido y sea capaz de dar aire bien frío al ordenador. Como se puede elegir el nivel de intensidad del ventilador puedes ajustarlo en función de lo que tu portátil necesite en ese momento.Me gusta mucho que la altura de apoyo también sea regulable y en mi caso parece muy robusta.Las luces yo no las uso porque me resultan molestas  pero para el que le guste puede elegir entre varios colores.
5,Good quality and satisfactory sturdiness
4,Solid platform. Decent cooling. The only drawback is the use of 2 usb ports for the lights and fan which is a major design flaw. If the extra port is needed then the platform should provide an alt port for the end user. Best cooling pad I have bought. I had to return the other 3 as they were terrible.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Bon packaging le produit à l’aire plus robuste que la moyenne. Le panel d’éclairage est large et facile à adapter selon les envies (ce qui est parfait).Le seul petit bémol que je trouve est que le plateau ne refroidit pas assez le pc à mon goût.Mais sinon l’esthétique  est au rendez-vous.
5,I’d say it is worth the price
5,Antes que nada si necesitas una buena refrigeración es bastante probable que ésta sea tu base.Hace poco me compré un portátil el cuál tiene un i7-8750H y una 1050Ti. Esto me llevó a necesitar una base de refrigeración y me recomendaron ésta.Que decir mi portátil tiene 156 pulgadas y le va muy bien ésta base.Trae 2 conectores usb para darle corriente con uno bastaría si no estamos dándole un uno intensivo.Tiene dos botones en la parte trasera una para cambiar entre modos RGB como arcoiris parpadeo respiración y estático y el otro para cambiar el color. Además trae una ruedecita para regular la velocidad del ventilador.Podemos inclinar la base con un soporte que trae para que la tengamos de la manera que nos resulte más cómoda.Conclusión: Trae todo lo necesario y refrigera estupendamente. Recomendado!
5,I concur with the majority of the reviews I've seen - I really like this product.I have a gaming laptop and I use it mainly to play Civilization VI. The big fan sits underneath the laptop and you can change the angle of the stand to adjust the angle that you look at the screen.Having one big fan I find is really effective and the base of my laptop is cooled right down. Still some heat at the top of the laptop but there is a substantially reduced temperature everywhere else.This product has reassured me that I won't ruin my laptop by playing too much Civ!
5,I dont normally leave many reviews but I was really impressed with this product. Ive had a few of these in the past and they have all worked well at the start but then packed up eventually. This one feels so much better made though it has a lot of metal parts in key areas which others dont.The fan is still audible but it isnt that bad at all. No louder than my laptop. If you turn the fan speed down it will make less noise obviously.With regard to the lights they are a bit of a gimmick but if you like flashing lights these are exceptionally good. Very bright and lots of modes and colours to chose from
4,Dopo qualche prova più approfondita posso confermare che la base fa il suo dovere ma lo fanno anche altre che costano meno. Ok non hanno i led laterali ma onestamente puntavo più alla sostanza tecnica che all'apparenza. Per carità rimane un buon prodotto ma per qualità prezzo non merita 5 stelle.
5,I don’t often write a review but I’m so impressed with the laptop cooler. Very well built and silent and it does the job I bought it for and that’s extra cooling for my gaming laptop and it does this expertly. Noticed a drop in temps and in 3dmark Time spy not only was it quieter but my score went from 7235 to 8120. I suppose the that fact this tech is stunningly beautiful is just a bonus.... don’t know why it has 2 usb to power when one is only neededUpdate…2 years later the cooler broke on the of chance I emailed klim. The customer service was incredible and within a week I had a new cooler at my door. Want to give more than 5 stars
1,パソコンの冷却用に購入しました。確かに静かですが本体内のファンがゆっくりと廻っているからで全く冷却出来ていないように感じます。パソコン本体の冷却ファンの音は変わりません。パソコンの放熱状況も明確には解りません。評価できるのはLEDのネオン位です。値段も高い物でしたので考え物でした。
4,This product in my opinion is the best looking cooling pad available on Amazon. I would of given it 5 stars. But I do feel the fan could be faster and stronger. Also having a design flaw with double usb.This product will keep most if not all laptops few degrees lower in temperature.
5,Macht was es soll und sieht auch noch gut aus einwandfrei 🏆
5,I've been through a lot of cooling stands and this one has been my favourite. My laptop no longer overheats and the lights are really bright and fun. It costs a bit more than other stands on here but the difference in quality and the guarantee from KLIM make the price worth it.
2,The good; The pad itself looks brilliant. It’s sturdy fits most laptops and the lights are really well designed.The bad; This simply doesn’t cool your laptop. The fan is too weak and spins too slowly to have any lasting or cooling effect. Will be returning and replacing.
5,Er macht einfach genau das was er soll super
5,My daughter loves it and it keeps her laptop cooler
5,The klim ultimate laptop cooler is a fantastic bit of kit. Premium build quality and packagingthe cooler offers lots of adjustment and features but most of all it helps keep temperatures down while gaming and the fan is super quiet. Gaming laptops are not cheap but im confident with my laptop on the klim ultimate as its very sturdy. If rgb lighting is your thing the klim ultimate offers an array of options but if it's not your thing you can simply turn off the lighting. The klim cooler has become an essential part of my setup and will surely extend the life of anyone's laptop due to its very good cooling.
5,PerfettaLa ventola che gira quasi non si sente pur tenendola al massimoI led sono belli con le modalità oppure nel caso si possono anche spegnere nulla da dire il pc almeno sito rimane sempre fresco
3,Pas d'interrupteur M/A et réglage des couleurs très difficile d'accès et compliqué à manipuler vente par deux exemplaires ( vente forcée ?). Sinon produit assez sympa
4,Le service client ainsi que le packaging et les petites attentions de Klim sont un énorme plus le produit est silencieux et conforme a la description.Seuls trois petits bémols a faire ressortir qui n’empêchent pas ce ventilateur de m'avoir beaucoup plu:-Légèrement trop petit pour mon asus rog 17 pouces-Premier "cran" d'inclinaison trop haut-Aspect un petit peu trop plastique a mon goûtCependant il a fait perdre entre 5 et 10 degrés de moyenne a ma cg et mon processeur est relativement beau et semble irréprochable d'un coté technique pour l'instant.
4,冷却性と静音性が思っていたほど悪くは無く、レインボーな発光もゲーミングの雰囲気があり面白いと思った。耐久性はこれから使い始めるため不明だが、商品の動き具合からして、すぐに故障するような気配等は感じられなかった。ただし、製造元かAmazonか配送業者のいずれかが原因だろうが、段ボール梱包では無く、パッケージ箱むき出し状態で届いた。しかも潰れた状態で。幸い、上記の通り中身の商品は使用できたので良かったが、もしこれに変形や破損があったら確実に「交換又は返品」になっていたと思っている。
5,Raffredda davvero bene silenzioso belle anche le luci.
4,Dieses Modell habe ich seid gestern und muss sagen das für einen kühler nicht schlecht ist. Mein Notebook hatte bei hohe Belastungen ca 95grad CPU gehabt und 85grad der GPU. Mit dem Gerät kühlt es die CPU um 15grad der die GPU um 10grad kühler. Ohne denn coolerbust meines Notebook zu nutzen ist das schon eine gute Leistung.Außerdem finde ich die RGB Beleuchtung ziemlich cool :)
2,Wenn es um Optik geht dann kaufen. Sieht schon gut aus mit der LED Beleuchtung. Geht es jedoch um Kühlung und das sollte ein Lüfter eigentlich können dann kann ich keine Kaufempfehlung aussprechen. Ich kann absolut keine Veränderungen bzw. Kühlung an der PS4 feststellen…
4,Its good for the money temp. drop by 11 celcius deegres
4,冷却性や大径ファンの静音性は申し分ない。ただ、ノートパソコンを傾けて使う場合、もっと緩い傾斜にできると良かった。また、傾けながらノートパソコン本体のキーボードを使う場合、端にあるキーを押すと、アームや本体プラスチックの剛性が低いため押した側が沈み込んだり、スタンド幅が狭く安定性が悪いので反対側が浮き上がったりする。総じてフラットな冷却台としては期待以上なものの、ノートパソコンを傾けて使用するスタンドとしては不満が残る。
5,Cette table de refroidissement fait bien son job. Pour refroidir mon portable gamer MSI 17 pouces qui surchauffe rapidement... avec cette Klime.... fini la surchauffe.... j ai gagné presque 20 degrés sur le processeur..... qui montait tout de même à 85 degrés.... ouf. Je recommande ce produit.
5,Bin mit dem Lüfter extrem zufrieden. Mein Lenovo Legion 5 wurde schon eindeutig Kühler sowie leiser. Der Notebook Kühler selbst ist auch angenehm leise selbst auf der stärksten Einstellung der Lüfter. Würde es eindeutig empfehlen.
5,(KLIM Ultimate)  Anfänglich war ich etwas skeptisch und hatte mir den Lüfter etwas größer vorgestellt aber hat voll den Erwartungen  entsprochen. Der Lüfter läuft superleise leistet aber genug  Zuluft und Kühlung das die Integrierten  Laptopcooler nicht Scheibe spielen wie bei meinem anderen Pad. Die Beleuchtung ist eine nette Spielereifür den der`s mag und ist zum Glück wähl-/ und abschaltbar. Etwas  doof finde ich  die Zuleitung/ Kabelgestaltung ist das Ding weg schaut man in die Röhre. Ebenfalls etwas hakelig empfinde ich den Aufstellmechanismus bei dem man wirklich immer beide Hände benutzen muss. Sonst liegt ein 17" Gerät gut/ satt auf und  der kleine Aufsteller hält das Gerät souverän an seinem Platz. trotz der kleinen Unwägbarkeiten von mir aber einen ganz klare Kaufempfehlung.
5,è praticamente legge sacra l'acquisto di una ventola di raffreddamento quando si ha un notebook di fascia alta.di fatto senza questo prodotto il surriscaldamento sarebbe inevitabile.questa in particolare è fantastica raffredda tantissimo ed è bella da vedere
5,Pc portable qui chauffe en utilisation Mao l appareil permet une bonne évacuation de l air chaud
3,Der Geräuschpegel könnte leiser sein. Ist schon sehr gut hörbar da sich die Frequenz im unteren Bereich deutlich von anderen Lüfter- oder sonstigen Geräuschen abhebt.Das Licht mit den verschiedenen Modi ist supercool. Allerdings kann man außer dem Standlicht nicht wirklich was anderes verwenden da zu verspielt/ablenkend.Ich hab das Produkt behalten weil der Kühler auch als Laptopstand verwendet wird. Und das ist echt geil. Auf dem Tisch oder dem Schoß es geht alles. Dadurch dass immer Luft zwischen Laptopboden und Auflagefläche durch den Ständer kommt wird die Unterfläche des Laptops nicht mehr heiß. Da braucht man auch nicht unbedingt den Lüfter anmachen.Der Lüfter ist "regelbar" macht für mich aber nicht wirklich den Eindruck dass es da groß was einzustellen gibt. Geräusch/Geschwindigkeit des Lüfters werden nur geringfügig verändert.Mir fehlen weiterleitende USB Slots da mindestens ein USB slot vom Laptop verwendet wird und dieser dann wegfällt. Das gibts bei anderen Kühlern und wäre hier auch angebracht. Schade.
5,Der KLIM Ultimate bietet eine sehr gute Kühlleistung und ist dabei angenehm leise.Da ich im Homeoffice oft auf dem Balkon arbeite kann ich bestätigen dass mein Laptop (ein Lenovo Legion) selbst bei Sonneneinstrahlung eine angemessene Temperatur beibehält.Der Kühler passt sehr gut unter mein Laptop und bietet meinem Rechner einen rutschfesten Stand.Einzige Vorraussetzung hierfür ist eine ebene Fläche auf die der KLIM Ultimate stehen kann.Die Beleuchtung lässt sich ebenfalls variabel einstellen und wem es dann doch zu hell ist kann sie auch ohne Probleme deaktivieren.Fazit: Ich bin sehr zufrieden.
3,Bon produit dans l’ensemble
5,Pros: Fan keeps laptop and legs coolerLed choice is great just discovered yesterday that I can hold a particular colour when it is pulsing through the colours which was a great surprise.USB powered was an issue at first but with a recent aquisition of a powered usb port no longer makes me choose between on or the other.Con: Not designed to sit on your lap for a long period of time (for me anyway)Buy this product!
5,Sehr leise und kühlt gut. Ich habe mir vor die Tastatur eine Stoffrolle gelegt damit die Arme nicht kalt werden. Top - das Gerät kann ich weiterempfehlen.
5,This is really good. I’ve been using it for some weeks. It is so quiet that it actually feels like it’s not even there.  It cools my gaming laptop CPU from 60 degrees to about 35 degrees just in few minutes.  Just one small thing.  The level of it when you put your laptop on makes it on a awkward position when you type where it hurt my elbows. Apart from that. I really like this product
5,Das Produkt habe ich seid 1 Tag im Test.Ohne Kühlung ist die Grafikkarte teilweise bis 98 Grad hoch gegangen. Bei Belastung keine Chance unter 90 zu kommen. Seid dieser Kühlung erstmals geschaft auf 70 Grad das ist sehr überzeugend.Max waren 82 Grad höher ging es nicht.Bin froh dieses Geld investiert zu haben.Dazu kommt das der Lüfter des Laptop nicht mehr auf volle Leistung läuft damit ist alles insgesamt leiser.Der Lüfter der Kühlung ist kaum hörbar selbst auf max. eingestellt hört man diesen kaum.Ich kann dieses Produkt bis jetzt nur Empfehlen.Die Zeit wird zeigen wie die Haltbarkeit sich durchsetzt.
5,Le support est vraiment bien il taille nickel pour mon gros GT060. Le gain en température est d'environ 7° ce qui est satisfaisant.Si je devrais lui trouver un défaut c'est qu'on peut voir l'espace entre les leds (mais bon là je chipote pour preuve j'ai mis 5*)Dernier point un gros point positif. J'ai eu besoin de contacter le sav et ils ont fait preuve d'une efficacité redoutable et c'est une qualité qui devient rare. Bravo l'équipe!

Realmente se siente un producto de calidad.He podido comprobar cómo realmente me ha bajado bastante la temperatura tanto de mi pc como de mi ps4 haciendo que vayan mucho mas fluidos (sobretodo en Sevilla casi en Agosto). Se entiende que tampoco es milagroso pero ayuda bastante. Los materiales se ven muy resistentes con algunos componentes de metal. Y encima se ve precioso. Se puede elegir la inclinación en bastantes posiciones y los colores dejando un solo color todos o ninguno dependiendo de la ocasión al gusto de cada uno y eligiendo también el ritmo del parpadeo y la velocidad del ventilador.La recomiendo para largas sesiones jugando en la cama sin quemarte las piernas o simplemente como elemento decorativo. Para la inclinación dispone de un tope que me deja libre precisamente el puerto jack para auriculares.Tras 4 horas de uso intensivo estoy mas que satisfecho con la compra. No lo veo caro para lo que ofrece y me estoy planteando comprar otro para dejarlo puesto en la ps4
3,Gerät funktioniert kühlt und ist relativ leise hat leider bei meinem Laptop (razer 15 Advanced) keinen kühlwert Laptop ist immer noch gleich warm wie vorher
5,An sich sehr gut!Die Farben sind schön und einstellbar.Wenn man es auf Max hat und es ein bisschen doof steht dann hört man deutlich den Lüfter quitschen bzw rattern. Ist jetzt nicht zu störend aber fällt in einem ruhigen Raum auf.Habe es Aufgemacht und die Magnetspule ein bisschen modifiziert. Daher läuft er extrem ruhig.Auch die Lüfterblätter habe ich mit kleinen lamellen bestückt (Luftbrechen und umwucht rausgenommen. Jetzt läuft er Perfekt.Das habe ich nur als Bastelhobby getan und es ist kein Muss. Erfüllt auf jedenfall seinen Zweck!(Bilder zeigen noch den Originalzustand)Gut weiter zu empfehlen!
5,A pesar de haber devuelto este producto no era lo que buscaba en en cuanto a tamaño no puedo decir nada malo sobre ella. Muy silenciosa cumple perfectamente con su función y si tienes un portátil grande deberías tener en cuenta esta base.En mi caso mi portátil es pequeño de 133 y me parecía demasiado grande y aparatosa pero aún así recomendaría su compra para portátiles de más de 15 pulgadas. Además el sistema de inclinación q incluye permite poner el portátil en diferentes posiciones lo cual puede ser un punto a favor si lo vas a dejar  en un sitio fijo.
5,Purchased for a MacBook Air that was suffering from heat throttling on the processor not ha lad a single issue since. Relatively quiet and easy to setup and use. Even has flashy lights if thats your thing.
5,Veramente ottimo prodotto io ho un nitro 5  gforce 1050ti  i5 scaldava troppo in game  ma con la ventola sento proprio a livello di superficie del PC la diversa temperatura  raffredda davvero  un pochino costosa ma se non volete bruciare un notebook  sono spesi bene .
4,El producto cumple muy bien con las expectativas propuestas la verdad que es bastante completo en general ofrece un buen nivel de ventilación el punto de luz rgb es bastante llamativo y tiene distintos niveles en grados de elevación la única crítica constructiva que le pongo esque los apoyos digamos las gomas que hacen de soporte para que no resbale debido al movimiento son mejorables si tuviera más agarre le daría 5 estrellas sin duda por lo demás una buena compra y la recomiendo.
5,Excellent cools perfectly and well built. Thanks Klim!!
5,Kühlt ca 10Grad mehr runter als ohne ! Ich finds super
2,Non ho avuto la possibilità di verificare se realmente abbassa le temperature. Appena utilizzato ho notato che è molto scomodo per la mano se volete utilizzare la combinazione di Gioco  W A S D. Troppo alto anche nella posizione più bassa consentita o addirittura senza regolare alcuna altezza. Scomodo davvero
5,Acheter pour mon petit fils il a installé il est content niveau refroidissement et bruit rien à redire très bon achat
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Ich benutze dieses Prachtstück beim Auflegen um das Macbook vernünftig zu kühlen.Stabiles Design stabiler halt sieht cool aus der Lüfter kaum hörbar wenn ein Notebook drauf ist. Farbmodi machen Laune und sehen cool aus :) siehe Video.Höhenverstellbar die Raster rasten gut ein da wackelt nichts. Gutes Eigengewicht fliegt einem also nicht gleich um die Ohren. Mir gefällt die Qualität. Auch wenn der Preis zu Anfang abschreckend war bin ich nun überzeugt dass ich nichts besseres hätte bekommen können. In dem Video seht ihr ein 17 Zoll Macbook um die Grössenverhältnisse mal einzusortieren.Von mir ein Daumen hoch bin gespannt auf weitere Produkte dieser Firma!
5,when led lights are on fan slows down very slightly. over all the cooler does reduce my laptop temperature
5,The sturdy built the size of the fan and the ability to do what it needs to achieve.  The light rgb combination is great too.
5,Super leise sehr stabil und Wärme gehört der Vergangenheit an. Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                           Das kühl Pad macht an sich einen guten Eindruck aber leider gehen die RGB Beleuchtung nicht daher wird es zurück geschickt echt schade
4,Die LED Beleuchtung lässt sich mit verschiedenen Varianten auf Knopfdruck an der hinteren Seite einstellen.Der Kühlkörper braucht einen USB für die Stromzufuhr klar warum aber kein anderen USB-Port dafür angebracht ist das Frage ich mich schon denn dadurch habe ich nur einen USB-Port für meinen Lap-top Anschluss "verloren".Kühlkörper hat verschiedene Höhen einstellbar. Die kleinste Höhe stellt das Notebook aber dennoch viel zu quer auf was nicht unbedingt der förderlich für die Handgelenke ist und sich auch dementsprechend anfühlt.
5,My laptop went down 10 to 15 on max fan speed. Fits AWESOME on a 17.3 Asus Rog Strix 3. Noise level it's okay. Can be louder to make the fan go faster. Material looks good but endings a little tiny bit cheap... But it's overall more than okay for the price paid. RGB doesn't add any special value at all... Consumes energy that can go to fan speed or even 2 more small fans... Overall happy.9/10
5,Das Gerät ist schnell angekommen und das Kühlen funktioniert ohne Probleme.Mein HP Omen 15 Laptop fängt sehr schnell an sehr heiß zu werden und dank dem Kühler laufen auch leistungsstarke Programme/Spiele nicht auf ~95° C sondern nur bis zu 70-80° C.Leider gab es bei meinem Gerät einen kleinen Fehler bei der Beleuchtung. Als ich diesen beim KLIM-Support gemeldet habe wurde mir äußerst schnell geholfen und innerhalb von 1-2 Tagen ein Gutscheincode für ein neues Gratis-Gerät zugeschickt.Insgesamt bin ich sehr zufrieden und kann das Produkt definitiv weiter empfehlen!
1,Horrible aunque ya se que estas bases no hacen nada para enfriar (solo levantan tu portatil y enfrian la tapa de abajo nomas) esta base es particularmente mala solo es apoyar la muñeca y se mueve escribes y la pantalla tiembla porque la base se anda moviendo.Si quereis algo que refrigere pillad una klim mistral o un IETS gt300 o gt500 (blowers con sellado de aire lo cual si ayuda a las temperaturas)Estas cosas solo sirven para levantar el portatil y que la parte de abajo no se recaliente pero no te va a mejorar la ventilacion interna.

5,Mon pc portable arrêter pas de s éteindre a cause de la surchauffe grâce a ce produit il ne le fait plus dutout et le ventilateur ne fait pas de bruit . Franchement je suis très content de cette achat de qualité allez y les yeux fermés
1,Ich kann für diesen Lüfter keine Kaufempfehlung aussprechen das Teil ist riesig! somit unförmig die LED's können noch nicht Mal alle Farben wiedergeben die angegeben sind (TÜRKIS GEHT NICHT 😕) der Lüfter ist extrem laut das ganze Ding klappert und rasselt als würde es bald den Geist aufgeben und kühlen tut es auch nicht ich habe das Gefühl das es die Luft nach unten hin absaugt aber nicht das es lüftet ( also Luft ausstößt).Somit 1 Stern mehr nicht.
5,Perfect timing in deliveryThe fan is really reliable and helps the laptops barely use their own cooling system
4,The LED lights are very nice the adjustable height is also very useful for different situations.The cooling however is a little on the weak side. Since this only has 1 big fan compared to the normal 4 fan version I find the fan not as efficient.However does its job well and my laptop is cooling well.The Lights add so much character to it!
5,Als Gaming Laptop Kühlung optimalKühlt gut und ist leise sowie es beschrieben ist
3,Ich habe einen MSi 173“ Laptop auf dem Kühler stehen. Für grafische Bearbeitungen und Konstruktionen habe ich mir dann zusätzlich dieses Coolingpad gekauft da je nach Anwendung der Laptop sehr warm wird.Als ich das Gerät angeschlossen habe merkte ich das sich der Ventilator in die falsche Richtung drehte (Luftstrom ging nach unten nicht nach oben) einfach die Kabel getauscht und fertig war die Kiste. Seit dem läuft sie ohne Probleme ist relativ leise und ist ein guter Zusatz für den Laptop.Standfuß ist easy verstellbar und stabil (es wackelt nichts). Beleuchtung kann man zum Glück ausschalten da sie schon nach relativ kurzer Zeit einfach stört mich zumindest.Ein Stern ist abzuziehen durch die falsche Verkabelung.Sonst ist die Verarbeitung Top👌🏻
5,Sehr leise! Und passt für mein Laptop 17 Zoll.Gern wieder!
3,Franchement pas trop déçu du produit (Klim rgb) sur niveau  efficacité ça va au lieu de 75 degré sur overwatch je tourne à 60 ce qui est pas négligeable les 2 seuls soucis c’est que pour moi le ventilateur Pourrais tourner un peu plus vite pour le rendre plus efficace  Et le deuxième problème c’est niveau support lorsque le support est incliné au maximum la petite languette a quelque difficulté A maintenir le pcMise à jour: ça a finalement fini en retour le ventilateur perdait en efficacité a cause des fortes chaleurs
5,The Amazon review asked me to put a # out of 5 star rating on warmth to which I gave it a 1. I hope this does not give it a negative rating. Maybe Amazon thinks it’s a coat or something. It keeps my laptop very cool while looking very sleek. I highly recommend this product. Good value and functionality perfect for gaming notebooks.
5,This would be great for any laptop/gaming set up.. The fan works really well and its so silent!! The led colour effects are really cool and 7 different modes to choose from.. I currently have this for my ps4 to sit on in my gaming set up with other lights and i have to say it looks great!!
5,Use just 3 days work good
4,光るところに惹かれて買いました！！光り方のパターンも色々変えられて綺麗です。風量最大でも全然気にならないくらい風の音は静かです(・∀・)傾き加減も変えられるし、USBを挿せばすぐ使えるので。機械音痴な私でも設定なく使えて良かったです！！
1,I wanted to get a laptop stand for my razer advanced edition 2021 and decided to choose this laptop stand. Boy was that a terrible decision. Delivery was late (I have amazon prime btw) by 2 days.When I got it all was fine. Basic box basic packaging. I used it for a day or 2 and just found it was so flimsy. The stand would just flex and move down if you were to put pressure on it. The lights are cool but just not fluid at all. They just looked awkwardly slow and had rough transitions as the lights lit up around the stand.The buttons on the back felt like they were going to fall out when I pressed them and the single cooling fan done literally nothing. If anything I think this stand made my laptop run the same if anything operate at hotter temps.I do not recommend this stand what so ever if you actually want good for your laptop. I am probably just going to get the razer chroma stand v2 off the razer website for an extra 40 or so euro.
1,Kühlung ungenügend.Billiges Material.Nicht ergonomisch.Zu teuer.Wurde zurück geschickt.
5,Acheté pour refroidir un DELL Precision 7730 I9 - NVidia Quadro Pro P3200 machine qui vous tient chaud en hiver et qui a tendance à être très bruyante quand ses réacteurs se mettent en route pour la refroidir.Le bruit est assourdissant raison pour laquelle j'ai opté pour ce support refroidissant.Ce support offre le service désiré les réacteurs ne se mettent plus jamais en route (plus aucun risque de décollage du PC ^^ ).A conseiller donc.
5,Ich bin begeistert.
5,Le produit qui m'a été livré était défectueux (problème de bruit du ventilateur). j'ai était tout de suite était pris en charge par le service client de Klim et ai eu un suivi du service à chaque étape que ce soit lors de l'envoie du produit de remplacement de la réception et assurance satisfaction du produit de remplacement.Encore Merci !
4,Mais la double prise USB est un handicap si l'on ne dispose pas d'un HUB USB.
4,Tengo il mio Laptop in posizione fissa vedi foto; inoltre utilizzo una tastiera e un mouse wireless e monitor e casse con sub. Ho smontato parte della base del Laptop perché si raffreddasse meglio ma la ventola girava spesso al massimo generando un fastidioso fruscio. La  Base di Raffreddamento è piuttosto silenziosa ed è positivo che si possa regolare. La luce RGB con tutte le sue varianti è carina. Speriamo che duri!!!
5,Excellent produit! Mon ordinateur n'est pas complètement froid mais l'article fait très bien son travail :)
5,Alles
2,The only good thing about this cooler is that its fairly sturdy and the LED lights but thats all. The fan is flimsy and there isn't much difference between the lowest and fastest speeds.
5,easy to fit and up and running in mins
4,Sehr leise und kühlt gut! Sie hätten jedoch die Drehzahl des Lüfters höher stellen können da es ohnehin ziemlich leise ist und man für gewöhnlich Noise Cancelling Kopfhörer verwendet hört man absolut gar nichts auch bei Belastung des Rechners.
3,Zunächst das positive: Das Gerät ist stylisch ergonomisch anpassbar die Lautstärke des Lüfters akzeptabel selbst bei maxmimaler Drehzahl und die RGB Effekte machen etwas her.Das Gerät hat bei meinem 16" macbook Pro jedoch 0 Effekt auf die CPU und GPU Temperatur; mein Programm zur Anzeige der internen Lüfterdrehzahl und CPU/GPU Temperatur (XRG) zeigt keinerlei Veränderung. Zusätzlich: Die Unterseite des Macbooks fühlt sich subjektiv und ohne Messung genauso heiss an wie ohne die Belüftung.Schade aber das Gerät muss leider zurück.
4,Si buscas una base con ventilador bonita pocas más funcionales que esta vasa encontrar. Se adapta a todo tipo de portátil (hasta 17 pulgadas) tiene varias configuraciones de luz (que no puedes apagar siempre están encendidas) y es muy fácil y simple de usar. Rebaja bastante la temperatura en CPUs que sufren y apenas hace ruido.
3,The stand is robust has a number of height settings and feels premium. If you like RGB lights you will certainly enjoy. The cooling ability of this particular model however is pathetic. Its an expensive stand. I sent it back and got the KLIM cyclone model which is a much better product for cooling but not quite as well built (not too far off).
5,Ok....
5,finally got a fan that cools my laptop down. tried all kinds of things to cool my acer predator as it was getting really hot. can now play COD all day long with everything running at full speed with no over heating issues at all If you have the same problems then this fan is well worth the extra money.
4,Il pacco è arrivato presentato con la scatola del prodotto nemmeno imbustato ma credo sia una pecca di amazon questa che non ho gradito. Il prodotto è di ottima fattura leggero silenzioso e design accattivante. Da rivedere la rigidità della base (rete metallica) con un po di pressione in più entra in conflitto con la ventola.
3,Works nicely as a stand. I usually have the fan switched off as it makes a low rumbling kind of noise when turned on. Other reviews mentioned it as "near silent" so I guess I may have a bad unit or the fan noise just bothers me more than most people.
1,PER L'ENNESIMA VOLTA LA KLIM MI DELUDE!ECCITATO DALL'IDEA DI AVERE UNA VENTOLA NUOVA PER IL MIO PORTATILE DA GAMING MI RENDO CONTO INVECE DI AVERE SOLO 2 LED FUNZIONANTI LA VENTOLA NON GIRA LE MIE PORTE USB FUNZIONANO PERFETTAMENTE.ORA LE COSE SONO DUE O IL PACCO HA RICEVUTO DEI DANNI (0 IMBALLO ESTERNO MI è STATA RECAPITATA SOLO LA SCATOLA CONTENENTE IL PRODOTTO) OPPURE LA KLIM HA GONFIATO I PREZZI PER DARE UNA QUALITà SCADENTERESO AVVIATO ED è LA SECONDA VENTOLA CHE RIMANDO INDIETRO E VOGLIO EVITARE DI MANDARE INDIETRO LA TERZA QUINDI CAMBIO MARCA ADDIO
4,In poche parole:Esteticamente stupendo il  mio portatile 173" ci va a pennello forse una sola  ventola mi sembra deboluccia per raffreddare tutto il computer quando è veramente caldo. Nel complesso bello da vedere e sopratutto MOLTO STABILE. Materiali con una qualità abbastanza buona  soddisfatto dell'acquisto Ripeto il punto di forza è la stabilità  e l'effetto led la ventola fa il suo lavoro non vi aspettate un vortice perché cmq è molto silenzioso!
4,Ha cumplido con mis deseos. No hace ningún ruido. Cuando envié un correo preguntando tres o cuatro cosas respecto a su conexión con una fuente de alimentación diferente al ordenador me contestaron inmediatamente y de forma positiva.Posiblemente para mi gusto y necesidades no me hacía falta las luces pero es fácil las conectaré cuando lo crea necesario. Comprobado que el portátil no se calienta demasiado.
5,PS4初期型に使用しています。気に入ったこと・出力最大でいつも使用しているのですが接地面が冷える冷える!冷蔵庫から出したサラダくらい冷えています!何に使っても効果は抜群だと思います！気に入らなかったこと・特には無いのですが音は少ししますね。普段ゲームは音を出してやるので図書館でゲームする人にはうるさいと感じるかもしれません。ヘッドホンやイヤホン等つければ全く聞こえませんしテレビから音を出してやる人も集中しない時にならないでしょう。
5,Absolutely brilliant Product. Such a beautiful elegant design. The fan is so quiet you cannot hear it. The different Colour lights are very good. If you don't want the lights on you can  turn that feature off and keep the fan on.Such a slick design. I will definitely be getting more
5,Keeps my large gaming laptop nicely chilled. Yes it may make a bit of noise but I always have my headset on.
5,Okay so to confess i actually returned this item because it wasn't exactly what I needed. HOWEVER I actually loved it. It us best for desk gaming and not really lap gaming which was why I returned it. Shame really cus the colours were great and so was the fan very cool underneath.
1,Mi dispiace ma questo coso non fa l'unica cosa per cui l'ho comprato: RAFFREDDARE è peggio di tutti quelli che ho provato. Funzionano meglio i cosi cinesi da 20€
5,Product is definitely worth a buy ! Cools laptop well on performance mode! Not noisy and nice ambient lighting !
5,Love this!!! Well built fits my 17.5 inch omega laptop perfectly!! That fan is really really quiet even on the fastest setting and the choice of light settings is great. Please please please read the little booklet that comes with it it will make you chuckle lol!!  10000% will recommend and buy from again.
5,Absolut sauber und gut verarbeitetes cooling pad für ein laptop. Das 17" gaming laptop meiner Freundin passt ganz entspannt drauf und hat links und rechts noch Überhang. Die rgb Beleuchtung ist top von der Helligkeit her und auch von den umschaltbaren Modi.Ich besitze bereits den KLIM Gaming chair. Kann somit beides empfehlen. Hier bekommt man für sein Geld top Qualität zu einem fairen Preis.
5,ci ho pensato due volte prima di acquistarlo dato che costa il doppio degli altri...ma data la delusione di tanti comprati in precedenza ho pensato di provare...ed ho fatto bene!il produttore allega anche un libretto in formato digitale su consigli informatici interessanti ed in genere non noti ai più.Ottimo prodotto (arrivato oggi ma già in funzione da 6 ore di continuo su un laptop che si scalda terribilmente in poco tempo) ottimo imballaggio ottimo design e come scritto nel titolo stabilissimo con varie orientazioni della base raffraddante con mega ventola che si orienta in varie posizioni per inclinare il pc robusto e...non si sente neanche con la ventola alla massima velocità.
5,L'ho presa per il mio MSI GE63 Raider RGB e devo dire che è veramente potente in quanto il mio workstation portatile sotto e ai lati è aperto si surriscaldava velcemente sopratutto in fase di rendering ... ma ora il problema non sussiste più.Ho provato a vedere il riscaldamento portandola al massimo del raffreddamento e ho notato subito che se prima arrivava anche a 40 gradi o superiore ora resta sui 20 21...Fantastico!Sono rimasto impressionato immediatamente alla prima accensione quando ho visto i colori RGB che al buio si combaciano perfettamente con gli RGB del mio portatile!Consiglio vivamente a tutti l'aquisto!Scusate il mio Italiano ma sono Inglese... :D
3,Im Großen und Ganzen ist es ein sehr gut verarbeitetes Gerät. Betreff. der Größe kann ich auch nichts bemängeln mein ACER Predator 173 passt sehr gut drauf und ragt auch nicht über den Rand hinaus (Rand ist sogar noch sichtbar).Der Lüfter arbeitet sehr leise wurde aber meiner von einem nervigen Klackern begleitet welches sicher nicht dazugehört und welches bei langsamer Stufe sehr gut hörbar war. Das war auch der Grund meiner Rücksendung.
5,my laptop is high-end and the cooling pad makes it much easier to use as my hands now don't burn when i put them on hot spots 10/10
3,Il prodotto è molto valido non fa rumore ed è molto stabile! Unica pecca la modalità di spedizione non è stato chiuso in nessuna scatola per cui ci è stata appiccicata sopra l'etichetta di spedizione con i miei dati (doveva essere un regalo) in più la scatola è arrivata rotta fortunatamente non è stato danneggiato il prodotto all'interno.
5,Does what it says and it does it quietly too. As a consequence  the fans (the noisy fans) on my laptop are hardly having to kick in at all
5,Ich suchte für meinen Gaming Laptop einen starken aber leisen Kühler. Bekommen habe ich genau dass plus eine geniale RGB Beleuchtung. Da mein Laptop schwarz ist und die Tastatur Beleuchtung genau in den Farben wie der Kühler einzustellen geht. Sieht das ganze aus wie aus einem Guss. Der Lüfter ist selbst auf höchster Stufe kaum zu hören dafür kühlt Er enorm gut. So gut das sogar mein Oberkörper etwas von der kühlen Luft abbekommt. Leider kann ich noch nicht viel zum Hochsommer Betrieb sagen aber bis jetzt beide Daumen hoch....
3,Ich bin kein Fan von solchen Lüftern aber brauchte einen aufsteller für meinen Laptop also hab ich mir den gekauft.Bisher hab ich keinen Knopf gefunden der den Kühler ausstellt und das stört mich ein bisschen aber abgesehen davon ist es auf jeden Fall ok und sieht ganz gut aus
5,ファンの速度も変え、側面のライトも複数色1色ずつもしくは7色(数は定かではないが)点灯してとても綺麗です。重量も軽く使い易いです。使い始めて、まだ1か月経たないくらいなの、耐久性は未知数ですが、今のところ調子良く稼働してくれています。満足です。
5,Sturdy and does the job keeping my laptop cool and stopping it from overheating.I love the wide range of colour options because sometimes I’m just not feeling bright and rainbows and just want a soft white. Great that it has a feature to turn off the light all together as well!
5,Ho trovato questo prodotto cercando una base di raffreddamento per un mio mac con problemi alla ventola non risolvibili se non sostituendo la scheda logica. A questo punto ho optato per una soluzione esterna e sinceramente ne sono completamente soddisfatto. In utilizzo base la temperatura delle cpu non sale mai sopra i 65 gradi. Il prodotto oltre ad avere una ventola di generose dimensioni ha una griglia in ferro che aiuta a dissipare il calore del case in alluminio e risulta particolarmente silenzioso. E' possibile regolare manualmente la velocità della ventola oltre ad avere dei led che permettono di creare varie soluzioni di illuminazione oppure essere spenti. Sono molto soddisfatto dell'acquisto.

But after 2 days of use the fan sounds like a vintage diesel engine. On the plus side the RGB lighting still works and it is large enough for a 17" Dell G7 Gaming laptop.
5,Been using it for a while now for my gaming laptop. it makes a massive difference when it comes to keeping my laptop cooled and running smoothly. I have no complaints about it whatsoever. love that you can change the colours on the edges (or opt for colourless aswell) and you can set the fan intensity. very very satisfied with this cooler!

Ein schwereres Notebook kann verwendet werden. Es ist stabil kann problemlos übertragen werden ich bin angenehm überrascht. Kann ich nur empfehlen.
5,Avevo provato un altro prodotto simile ma questo è un altra cosa! Qualità costruttiva eccellente e molto silenzioso. Le luci poi sono fantastiche. L'unica cosa che nn mi piace tanto è il cavo di alimentazione. Per il prezzo poteva essere fatto meglio e magari con angolo retto piuttosto che dritto... Cmq consigliato!
5,La base di raffreddamento è molto bella esteticamente e le luci rgb fanno un bel effetto scenico... Purtroppo per le mie necessità non rinfresca abbastanza avendo una sola ventola... Peccato... Nonostante questa cosa la consiglio vivamente anche sulla base del fatto che hanno una assistenza clienti veloce cordiale e professionale
5,La base di raffreddamento permette di regolare il getto d'aria tramite una rotella sul retro.La ventola non emette alcun rumore a getto basso-medio mentre a partire da medio-alto emette un leggero rumore ma è quasi impercettibile.Oltre che funzionale è anche molto carina perché possiede molteplici modalità di colore: Transizione Rapida Tr. Lenta Modalità Respiro Mod. Lampeggiante e Mod. Colore Solido.Sul retro oltre alla rotella per regolare il flusso d'aria troviamo i pulsanti che permettono di cambiare il colore e la modalità di transizione.La base è collegabile al pc tramite usb e possiede anche una doppia usb permettendo così di riutilizzare la presa occupata.
4,The lights are perfect The fan is really silent I can barelly hear it I don't like how it gets up because it goes backwards instead of going up but for the rest I love it.
5,Davvero funzionale e bello
5,Using it for my 17' Lenovo Y740  for my home office gaming set up.Works great very quiet (wasn't even sure the fan was on) and it works so well that my Laptop's fans remain much more quiet than usual when im gaming.Also looks great and the adjustable angle and height was exactly what I was looking for to prevent neck strain.Strongly recommend.
4,+It fits without problems a 17 inch laptop+Very quiet+The lights are ok+The laptop does not slide off the Cooling Pad even at high inclination+Temperatures dropped by about 5-8 degrees Celsius (CPU/GPU)-Requires 2 usb for full power-Cooling Pad is slippery on the table
2,The rgb is all good however the air flow is badly noticeable
5,Nach einigen Rezensionen hatte ich einen lauten Lüfter erwartet. In Wahrheit ist der Gräuschpegel sehr niedrig. Die Wärmeleistung ist super. Das ergonomische Design mit der Beleuchtung hat leider dazu geführt dass meine Tochter ihn beschlagnahmt hat. Der sieht nämlich echt cool aus. So werde ich wohl noch einen zweiten bestellen müssen...
5,Avevo problemi con il mio msi stealth portatile (dove colgo l’occasione per sconsigliarlo al 100%) e per sopperire al problema ho acquistato questo prodotto. Ho avuto inoltre bisogno di contattare l’assistenza che si è messa a disposizione immediatamente nel giro di pochissimo tempo per aiutarmi. Che dire? Prodotto valido ed assistenza impeccabile. Prosit all’azienda
2,I wrote a review on this cooler which was fairly positive. However longer use of it has made me and my son change our mind .Its simple my son has a ASUS 17 inch screen laptop with some serious hardware in it .And during a prolonged gaming session this cooler is just not up to the taskUnder light use it copes okayBut after a few hours of less demanding games (Sunless Skys) The cooler fails in its task the large single fan just doesn't move enough air to keep things cool .This is a shame as it well made bit of kit but it is premium money with out premium performance.
4,C'est pas miraculeux forcément puisqu'il brasse de l'air ambiant. Mais ca réduit sensiblement la vitesse des ventilateur de mon MacBookPro
1,A livello di design è intrigante. La mensolina che si apre alla base e che fa da poggia notebook è davvero comoda.L'unico problema è che una volta collegata l'alimentazione non si accende. L'accensione dovrebbe essere controllata dalla rotellina seghettata che parte con uno scatto e poi dovrebbe regolare l'intensità di rotazione della ventola. Ma dopo lo scatto la rotellina seghettata gira a vuoto e la ventola non dà segni di vita. Spero che sia un modello difettoso. L'altra coppia di pulsanti rotondi tra la rotellina si accensione e l'alimentazione sembra siano esclusivamente per il controllo dell'accensione spegnimento e controllo cromatico della fascia perimetrale illuminata della base.
4,Ja die teil ist da aber ich weiß nicht wie soll ich an machen?Keine Adapter in Packung-_-
5,Muy bueno tiene fácil funcionamiento cumple su función sin embargo me gustaría un poco más potente las luces van genial tiene buen soporte no resbala contenta
5,i had doubts at first with the namebut eventually i love their productsps:lights got faulty contacted amazonthey sent me to Klimklim was nice the decided to send me a replacement without me.sending the faulty item back.
1,Esteticamente valido anche abbastanza silenzioso ma sotto il profilo funzionale la refrigerazione è scarsa. L’aria spostata da un vecchio dispositivo intenzionato a sostituire corredato di due piccole ventoline è risultato più efficiente. Effettuato reso per inefficienza refrigerazione.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               ファンも静か、デザインも良し。なんと言ってもLEDの発光面積が大きく、明るく派手。若干お高めではあるが、こんな様なものを探してた方には特にお勧め。良いですよ。
5,1.　静かです。ファンの回転が 20cmで遅い 750回転/分　まったく音がしない、聞こえない。　　　この製品は　23db　他のシリーズは　27db　という事は2倍弱 静ずか　　　（20dbと40db　では　100倍の差）　2.　よく冷える。パンチングメタル？（風が通る穴が）の穴が他のシリーズより大きい。　3.　5年保証が安心
5,I can only say that this thing has significantly reduced my worries of my laptop overheating.In fact it hasn't gone hot at all ever since I started using it. A really good acquisition to say the least.
2,It is actually really silent and the rbg works and looks really good.the important part tho the cooling is really bad the one fan in the middle does not cool enough and does not reach even outside the fan diameter.
5,Verpackung kam nur der original Karton. Gut so. Funktioniert tadellos. Der Lüfter ist echt leise. Die RGB Beleuchtung macht echt was her. Hab mit coretemp gemessen. Ohne den Klim Lüfter hatte ich bis zu 102 Grad CPU Temperatur gemessen unter Volllast. Die gleiche Belastung mit dem Klim Lüfter Pad. Max noch 86 Grad. Die GPU war vorher bei max 75 Grad . Mit dem Klim Lüfter nur max. 60 Grad. Average liegt bei 55 Grad. Ich bin zufrieden und kann es nur weiter empfehlen.
5,Habe Diesen Laptopkühler für einen 17 Zoller bestellt. Passt kühlt Super ( mein Laptop läuft Teilweise 12 Stunden) ist so leise das man ihn kaum hört. Das Farbspiel funktioniert auch einwandfrei ist für mich aber nicht ganz so wichtig. Die Höhenverstellung ist Super und Stabil. Was will man mehr. Kaufempfehlung von mir.
5,音は静かて気にならない。色はカラフルで楽しい。
5,Leuchtet super ist Qualität könnte fester sein.
3,Der Cooler sieht sehr gut aus. Allerdings ist der große Lüfter bei mir sehr laut. Auf höchster Stufe gibt es ein permanentes klopfen. Ich weiß leider nicht woher es genau kommt aber es kommt definitiv vom Lüfter da das Klopfen aufhört wenn ich den Lüfter ausstellen. Ansonsten ein sehr schönes Produkt. Es sieht gut aus die Leuchtkraft ist sehr schön und auch die Einstellungsmöglichkeiten finde ich sehr schön. Vielleicht etwas teuer dafür das fast alles aus Plastik. Trotzdem wirkt es stabil. Bis auf das Klopfen was ein Montag-Produktfehler sein kann alles ok.
5,I have given them 5 star as they provide the best customer service experience. Their caring attitude towards their customers facilitates me an impetus to write this review.I would definitely recommend KLIM technologies .
3,It's not so strong as it says and for my gaming laptop it didn't do nothingthe fan even at full speed it was low.At least for my girlfriend normal laptop it was alright..
2,Allgemein gut verarbeitet allerdings kann ich nicht verstehen das man bei einem 50 euro  Produkt einen 2 Cent Lüfter verbaut der dermaßen beschissen von der Qualität ist und das bei einem Produkt wo es genau darauf ankommt sehr schade aber das hier ist nix
5,Fa il. Suo dovere come si deve qualità prezzo eccellente pienamente soddisfatto
3,Naja vielleicht hatte ich auch einfach zu viel erwartet. Der Lüfter liefert ein gaaaaaaaaaaaaaanz kleines bisschen Luft zumindest merkt man kaum etwas davon wenn man die Hand darüber hält. Aber das wäre ja noch ok wenn das Teil nicht so erschreckend laut wäre. Gerade in der heutigen Zeit gibt es doch nun wirklich flüsterleise Kühler und bei dem Preis hätte man vielleicht lieber auf ein paar LEDs verzichten sollen und das Geld in einen besseren Lüfter investieren sollen. Aber gut ein wenig Kühlleistung ist ja da und der Lüfter sieht auch chic aus. Deshalb zumindest 3 Sterne aber mehr hat er wirklich nicht verdient.
4,総合的には☆4光加減、色味は品質高い！
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               ゲーミングノートにぴったりなデザインだと思い購入しました。音もあまり気にならず、冷却効果も期待以上でした。買ってよかったと満足しています。
2,You will need to sacrifice 2 usb. Need to invest in usb hub as there is no hub on the device. It is cheap chinese build. I have dismantle it and the parts used inside are the cheapest possible on the market. Def not worth that money ! Fan is doing the job as it is a large one. All the money for fancy rgb I would say. I like the light build as I move a lot with my laptop so that is an advantage for now. Hope it will last more than a month.
5,Fantastic cooling pad more than handles a large 17.3" laptop RGB looks amazing too with different colours and effects. Temps are so much better. No real noise either one large fan best solution. Only thing that would make it perfect? A couple of cable clips for the USB power lead. I would suggest the manufacturer include a couple to have the perfect product.....
5,Plusieurs modes avec les led(magnifique au niveau des couleurs) Très silencieux air froid qui sort du ventilateur (je ne sais quel système est utilisé) qui permet de bien refroidir le pc. Plusieurs crans d'inclinaison très léger. Maintenant à voir au niveau de la durée de vie mais ça m'a l'air solide. J'ai un peu peur que les Led me lachent car je ne pense pas qu'on puisse les changer
5,パソコンやオーディオインターフェイスを冷やすために探していた。そして出会った今年最大の買い物と言える。
5,Der Kühler ist sehr leise dafür dass er meinen Laptop so gut kühlt. Ich hatte früher probleme wenn ich auf meinen Laptop Games gezockt habe auf der Maximalen Auflösung das er sich Überhitzt hat. Seitdem ich den Kühler habe ist es kein problem mehr und dabei ist er auch noch leiser als mein Laptop wenn er die eigene Kühlung anschaltet.
5,Bello e Funzionale ottima ventilazione
4,Der Kühler mach schon einiges aus mein Laptop wird nicht mehr so stark heiß von dem einen spiele was ich hab und es sieht einfach super aus:)
5,China Qualität!
4,Dezent aber dennoch schick!Funktioniert vernünftig und ist relativ leise.Steht auch stabil mit Laptop.Laptop wird gut gekühlt und läuft ruhiger (MSI Gaming)Könnte aber auf Grund des Materials ruhig ein paar Euros günstiger sein.
5,Ich habe 3 Artikel gekauft RGB Maus LED Mauspad und einen LED Laptoplüfter und bin MEGA begeistert :-)Der persönliche Kontakt mit Stephan von KLIM war absolut TOP!Vielen Dank :-)
5,+ sehr geringes Gewicht+ Verarbeitung hochwertig+ individuell einstellbare RGB-Beleuchtung ist sehr schick+ Neigungswinkel in mehreren Stufen einstellbar+ Belüftung stufenlos mit Regler einstellbarAnmerkung:Ich schildere hier lediglich meinen ersten Eindruck. Ich habe das Gerät heute erstmals in Betrieb genommen. Deshalb kann ich keine Einschätzung zur Langzeittauglichkeit des Geräts treffen.Der erste Eindruck ist durchweg positiv!
5,Impeccable !
5,This is the best cooler I ever had. I am using it for a few days already and it's doing the best job. I had a few coolers before but this one really keeps my temperatures down. Thank you very much and if you think to buy it then don't hesitate
5,EVEN THOUGH MY LAPTOP HAS AN IN BUILT FAN THE KLIM IS ABSOLUTLY BRILLIANT
5,HeyIch bin bis jetzt sehr überzeugt von dem Produkt. Design Leistung Ergonomie Preis und Funktionalität sind wirklich Top.Natürlich werden die Inneren Komponenten nicht extrem herunter gekühlt aber die Luftzirkulation unter dem Notebook ist deutlich besser und er läuft deutlich leiser!Ich würde es wieder kaufen!
3,Ottimo per per dissipare il portatile però per 50 euro... con i materiali al tatto cheap non lo pagherei di nuovo.I led sono molto belli aggiustabile e funziona perfattamente peccato per i materiali avrei voluto pagare il giusto.
2,As soon as I plugged it in I found out the wires that came with it are faulty and if I just move an inch it stops working ..
3,Ho acquistato questa base una quindicina di giorni fa e devo dire che il suo lavoro lo fa e lo fa bene. Led carini da vedere e molto bella è la presenza di più modalità. Ma una grande pecca è la rumorosità. dopo qualche giorno dall'acquisto la ventola ha iniziato a fare sempre più rumore  sia essa alla velocità minima che massima.Gran peccato. per il suo prezzo su amazon ci si aspetta qualcosa in più.
2,Das Kühlpad sieht gut aus die RGB Beleuchtung ist die schönste die ich bis jetzt bei einem Kühlpad hatte aber der Standfuß ist absolut minderwertig. Ich habe einen 173 Zoll Laptop auf dem Kühlpad abgestellt bei jedem schreiben auf der Laptop Tastatur wackelt das Kühlpad aufgrund des mittig angebrachten Standfußes allerdings so stark das dies nicht erträglich ist.Warum nicht die zwei Standfüße des KLIM Cyclone angebracht wurden ist mir absolut schleierhaft. Die stehen bombenfest nur leider hat der KLIM Cyclone eben keine RGB Beleuchtung.SO geht der KLIM Ultimate leider wieder wegen des mangelnden Standfußes zurück.
5,Ich habe diesen Kühler für meinen Cousin gekauft. Er war sehr glücklich :)
5,Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit der leistung habe mir ehrlichgesagt nicht so viel erhofft aber ich freue mich das ich falsch gedacht habe ^^ kühlt gut ist nicht laut und beim zocken hat man eh ein headset auf
2,Habe einen neuen Gaming Laptop gekauft welcher von Anfang an etwas warm läuft. Leider bringt der Kühler beim zocken quasi keine Besserung habe die Temperaturen mit und ohne Lüfter getestet es ist identisch ...
5,Extremely low sound of the fan very good product for your laptop to keep it cool👍Lovely ! 😍
4,Alles in Ordnung jedoch wundert mich eines.Sobald man das Gerät angeschlossen hat läuft der Lüfter. Es gibt keine Möglichkeiten ihn separat abzustellen wie die LEDs.
5,Très bon produit la couleur des lumières tout autour est vraiment de bonne qualité  le ventilateur n'est pas trop bruyant et il est réglable en vitesse. Il y a un service client francais aussi pour toutes questions
5,I have the product for 7 months now works very well. Had a small problem with the power cable but the customer service was great and it's all solved now.
5,Im Preis- Leistungsverhältnis ist der Kühler fast unschlagbar. Er ist unfassbar leise und kühlt meinen Laptop trotzdem sehr gut runter. Er steht sehr stabil und hält einiges aus. Außerdem beeindruckt sein Design.Kann ich wirklich nur weiter empfehlen.
4,Die Verarbeitung ist gut und mit der Beleuchtung macht es was her das einzige was stört ist die Lautstärke vo dem Kühler.
3,Only half of my LED lights are now working and I only received it on Wednesday!
5,I love this cooling stand perhaps one of the best choices I found on the market for my 17" Legion silently doing a great job and the RGB backlighting is charming. Not to mention its mark of quality doubly enforced by Klim 5 years warranty.
5,Finalmente il mio portatile respira…prima quasi fumava
5,Ne ho provate tantissime di tavolette raffreddanti questa mi sembra davvero una delle migliori. Raffredda davvero è regolabile abbastanza larga per sostenere anche un portatile grande. Il pezzo di plastica però che serve a trattenere il portatile se si sceglie un'altezza in pendenza sporge poco rendendo il tutto instabile. Comunque fa il suo dovere...fra le tante io consiglio di acquistare questa come tavoletta.
5,Lo uso per il mio macbook. Non mento non è sufficiente a tenerlo fresco nelle giornate più calde (in mansarda arriviamo facilmente a 35 °) però è il migliore che abbia trovato in commercio e devo dire che non ho più avuto più rallentamenti alla RAM da quando lo utilizzo. Inoltre la colorazione è molto figa e la ventola supersilenziosa
5,Adecuado en tamaño y parece duradero ya que da sensacion de robusted. En principio la refrigeracion es buena aunque con el uso se vera mejor y sobre todo lo que mas me ha impresionado es que aparentemente para portatiles pesado como los de 17" es muy adecuado ya que estos portatiles son grandes y pesados. Y el tema de las lucecitas como impresionan jaja. :)
4,Ich habe das Produkt verwendet um meinen Laptop zu kühlen. Es erfüllt seinen Zweck jedoch hatte ich erhofft dass es etwas stärker wäre.
5,Cercavo un prodotto che potesse raffreddare davvero il pc soprattutto perché ho un portatile "da gaming" che comunque riscalda parecchio. La grossa ventola sotto permette di diminuire le temperature che sono scese di 5-8 gradi in pieno esercizio (warzone dopo 1-2h). Gli RGB poi aumentano gli fps ovviamente.
5,Really happy with my purchase. Beautiful and very well made and for its purpose it does the job really well to keep my 17" laptop cool.
5,This product is perfect for cooling down my laptop. The fan itself is so quiet i thought it wasnt on! great variation in colour modes.
5,最高

4,Buono
5,The fan is extremely quiet and the quality of the materials is great! All together perfect! Meets the description
5,Great product easy to use and the additional description about the shipping of it made me laugh so much xD. Would suggest this as a purchase
5,Excellent piece of kit the unit works brilliant and stands out on a gig....recommend to anyone looking to keep a laptop cool on a gig
5,Un portátil potente de 17" se adapta perfectamente y lo mantiene a temperaturas adecuadas.
4,prodotto è ok però aveva un problema con le luci si accedeva solo  metà con un colpetto con la mano dopo si è acceso tutto...
5,Bought for my Alienware as old one was to heavy to keep moving this one is not only lighter to move but sturdier as well with very minimal noise from the fans no problems as of yet.
5,Good price Good product
5,The fan is cool quiet and effective in lowering the temperature.howeverthe stents were a bit thick for me and there was no choice of completely horizontal placement.
5,Pleinement satisfaits de ce fournisseur qui a répondu rapidement et efficacement à un petit problème rencontré avec notre refroidisseur KLIM ULTIMATE.Nous le recommandons vivement à d'autres clients potentiels à la recherche d'un bon refroidisseur PC
5,La base di raffreddamento per il Pc funziona benissimo utile la base con la luce io ho messo l'opzione che cambia continuamente colore ma si può mettere anche la luce fissa la base permette di raffreddare bene il PC inoltre volendo si può  rialzare il PC con l'apposita levetta. Sono rimasta soddisfatta. Ottima la confezione della spedizione e rapida la consegna consiglio sia il prodotto sia il venditore.
2,Raffredda poco .. un po rumoroso .. effetti led spessi ed eccessivi per i miei gusti.
5,Great budget cooling pad. Currently using it for my 17" Asus Rog which is a beast of a laptop the cooling from the pad does a fantastic job and well worth the money.
3,Das Gerät sieht gut aus der Laptop (HP) wurde aber nur unwesentlich kühler - vielleicht liegt es auch am Kühlsystem des Laptops...
4,Bin Sehr zufrieden bis jetzt sehr leise  und kühlt gut Haltbarkeit kann ich noch nicht beurteilenden aber die Verarbeitung sieht sehr gut aus .
4,un peut juste pour un pc 173 " le pc depasse un peut
5,Highly recommended product which is totally work its prize and works excellent..!!
5,Its largre and very quietSo colourfulI am grateful that I bought itIt's only large size and could not go into my laptop bag.
5,Sits the PS4 on perfectly and really helps keep it cool. This is a great buy and I am really pleased with this purchase. The cooling fan is sturdy and looks great.
4,Me viene perfecto para el portátil gaming un estilo muy moderno bonito ventilador silencioso lo que no entiendo bien porque el conector tiene 2 conectores usb
5,Très tres satisfaite de ce produit et la livraison a été tres rapide l'article et conforme a ca description convient parfaitement pour mon 17 pousse il et tres silencieux et le jeu de lumières et géniale. Je recommande cet article 👍
5,bel supporto e molto silenzioso..mi piace anche parecchio la varietà dell'illuminazione.leggermente piu caro di altri prodotti simili ma ne vale la pena
5,Ich hatte ein Gerät mit zwei Lüftern der krachmachte als Ersatz Klim Ultimate beschafft. schnelle Lieferung ein großer leiser Lüfter ist verbaut der sich in der Drehzahl anpassen läßt Licht außen herum ist einstellbar und abschaltbar.Bisher gibt es nichts auszusetzen. der 17 Zoll Laptop steht sicher auf dem Kühler. Die Neigungseinstellung ist auch einfach zu handhaben.
2,Lo compré  hace 11 meses para el verano para que no se recalentase el portátiltodo estaba bienperfecto.Lo guardé  al terminar verano en perfecto estadolo he puesto hoy y no enciende las luces ledpero nada de nada.No lo entiendoporque es caro para durar menos de un año y habiéndolo usado sólo 3 meses.Me lo expliquen.
5,Da meine Ps4 ProEinen sehr lauten Lüfter hat.Und alternative Lüfter die direkt an die ps4 gebaut werden bringen nix...Seit 1Woche in Betrieb. Und ps4 pro deutlich leiser und der Lüfter deutlich entspannter...Das RGB ist der hammer Vorallem das Bunte Licht ist mein Favorit.
5,Das Produkt ist wirklich sehr Hübsch anzusehen mit der RGB beleuchtung. Die Verarbeitung ist sehr gut. Und ich nutze diese Kühlung für meine Xbox One X und das passt perfekt und sieht Super aus.Gaming Equipment:Xbox One XKlim RGB KühlungRazer Thrasher 7.1 UltimateRazer Wolverine UltimateDX Racer F11Acer Nitro 27zoll 144hz WQHD+
5,Ho acquistato questo prodotto per raffreddare il mio macbook che si riscaldava tantissimo durante le registrazioni audio/video. Mi occorreva quindi qualcosa di efficace ma anche silenzioso. Nulla da dire se non che questo prodotto soddisfa entrambe le richieste. Consigliato.
4,franchement c cher .. mais c le top !!
4,Nicht für a Laptop mit 1660ti or höher
3,Is expensive for the money.Cooler speed is good but not impressive and I will like to have had faster coolers to perform better then one big slow one
5,Es muy practica y a mi gusto enfría bastante comparada con las demás que hay por ahí más que nada por que es bastante grande y abarca toda la superficie del portátil y eso que tengo uno de 173 pulgadas y aún sobresale un poco la base!
5,Sono riuscito ad abbassare la temperatura del pc incrementando la produttività. Ottimo prodotto.
5,El modelo CYCLONElo devolví por el ruido. Este enfría menos pero suficiente para mis necesidades. Es aconsejable inclinarlo en alguna posición para que ventile mejor. Me ha gustado mucho
5,Der KLIM Ultimate Laptop-Kühler kam super schnell und war gut verpackt. Die Bedienung (Beleuchtung sowie Lüftergeschwindigkeit) ist sehr intuitiv. Selbst mein großes 17 Zoll Gaming Notebook passt perfekt drauf und hat einen sicheren Stand. Besonders gefällt mir wie leise der Lüfter ist selbst bei höchster Geschwindigkeit.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               L'oggetto è bellissimo (gusto personale ovviamente). L'effetto "fade" delle luci che cambiano colore mi piace molto e lo preferisco a quello impostato di default che fa ruotare i vari colori. I materiali di costruzione sembrano di qualità PREMIUM e la ventola anche al massimo quasi non si sente! Il venditore super fantastico!!! Ho trovato un team di persone gentili e disponibili com'è raro trovare oggi (Amazon Esclusa poichè sempre perfetta! :) ). In conclusione sono più che soddisfatto!
1,Vorab: Kundenrückläufer! Artikel war mehrfach verklebt was eindeutig dafür spricht.Zur Leistung: Absolut enttäuschend der große Lüfter in der Mitte kühlt in meinem speziellen Fall kaum bis gar nicht die Komponenten des Laptops (MSI GP66) das einzig positive ist das Gitter wodurch die Luft besser entweichen kann als wenn das Gerät flach auf dem Tisch steht.Die RGB Beleuchtung ist nett wird aber nach 5 min langweilig bzw. störend und wurde von mir daher abgeschaltet.Insgesamt enttäuschend im Hinblick des Preises ich steige auf ein günstigeres Modell um welches dort Lüfter (obere Partie) aufweist die tatsächlich zur Kühlung benötigt werden.
3,Estéticamente me gusta las luces quedan muy bien y es cómodo de usar pero tira poco aire... Hace poco vi uno de 5 ventiladores y echa mucho aire más. Si lo quieres solo para enfriar el ordenador no lo compres. Yo lo he probado y no baja nada la temperatura. Aunque me gusta porque levanta la pantalla y es más cómodo.
4,Flotte Lieferung FormOptik Arbeitsweise gefallen. Bin zufrieden. Empfehlenswert.
5,Silencioso y bueno ofrece un buen stand y si te gustan las luces viene con muchas además que es de los pocos que consigues de 175 pulgadas para portátiles.
5,Auf jeden Fall perfekt kühlt extrem gut und ist dabei richtig leise.Ich gebrauche es Zuhause  fürs mobile ist es mir zu groß da würde ich mir ein kleineres Modell noch zulegen
5,Diese Kühlplatte ist zugleich auch ein Laptop-Stand für eine bessere ergonomische Sicht auf den Monitor.Sie macht einen hochwertigen und stabilen Eindruck RGB ist umfangreich einstellbar und das wichtigste: Sie kühlt meinen 17 Zoll Laptop hervorragend...keine Leistungsdrosselung mehr.Ich würde sie wieder kaufen!
5,sehr schöner und effektiver Lüfter. Hat große Auswirkung bei der Senkung des Tempratrurs bei einem Laptop.Sehr Empfehlungswert.
5,Conforme à ma demande et très confortable puis esthétique.
5,Awesome design and quite i love it. Got this for my gaming laptop
5,Very nice and sturdy plenty of rgb options fans only cool every so slightly but better than nothing.
5,I use it for a short time but it seems to be a good product light and fan control should be at the front
2,I really really wanted this to work well espically with a 60 quid price tag but it offers very little cooling made no difference playing normal games without out my own laptops fan boost on...... but it looks very nice the finnish is lovely and the rgb lights are really cool so yeah no cooling but looks awesome
5,muy buena calidad  buenos materiales buen funcionamiento resistente y cualquier duda su atención a cliente es la mejor la recomiendo ampliamente sobre todo para computadoras de gaming
5,Fonctionne correctement
5,La base è stata comprata per fare un regalo "su richiesta"! Riscontro positivo a partire dalla confezione per il prodotto solido e veramente carino per il design e per le luci. Sembra veramente raffreddare grazie alle dimensioni della ventola e sicuramente per il fatto che il portatile risulta essere sopraelevato dal tavolo grazie alle varie posizioni inclinate ed orizzontale che assume.
5,Actually really good pushes good airflow into the laptop very quiet and look flashy which is what the laptop deserved
5,The best one ever works perfectly!
5,Top pour diminuer la température possible aussi d'éteindre les lumières si on ne souhaite pas les avoir. Ouf !
5,良とても良い感じです！
5,ce produit correspond en tout point à mes attente je suis très satisfait de cet achat il correspond très bien à la description
5,Ha abbassato notevolmente la temperatura dei componenti del notebook: prima si surriscaldavano fino a provocare lo spegnimento del PC ora con il supporto raffreddante tutti gli elementi critici rientrano nei limiti di temperatura (verificato con software SpeedFan). Rumorosità assente; consigliato.
5,Buon prodottoOffre raffreddamento e sistema rgb.Rogolabile in quattro livelli di inclinazione (per me è sufficiente il primo) l’ultimo è un po’ esagerato. L’unica ventola presente è bella grossa e fa girare bene l’aria per il raffreddamento non è completamente silenziosa ma alla massima velocità non risultata nemmeno fastidiosa.
4,Purtroppo per le mie necessità speravo raffreddasse abbastanza da far diminuire il rumore delle ventole del portatile... ma evidentemente pretendevo troppo.
5,Produit conforme à la description. Lumière très jolie. Refroidit bien.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 DO NOT BUY IS A SCAM WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME
5,Ich bin kein Gamer sondern nutze einen hochleistungsfähigen Laptop für die Softwareentwicklung und sehr rechenintensive Aufgaben. In einem sonst sehr leisen Büro ist eine fast permanente  Geräuschentwicklung eines kleinen eingebauten Laptoplüfters sehr störend. Durch den Kühler ist die Geräuschentwicklung jetzt wesentlich geringer. Sehr angenehm.
5,Super
5,I love this cooling pad well designed and does the job. thanks!
5,very nice to look at and very quiet  many thanks
5,Top Produkt schneller Versand einfache gute Lösung zur Reduzierung von Wärme.
5,Avevo bisogno di una base di raffreddamento per poter giocare la sera d’estate. Soprattutto nelle serate più calde il mio pc si surriscalda e volevo una base che rialzasse tutto il computer e raffreddasse. La temperatura del pc è più bassa in modo molto evidente già dopo 10-15 minuti. Bello da vedere soprattutto le luci! Lo consiglio.
1,As a stand its fantastic.Avoid if looking for a cooling fan.As a cooling fan its pathetic. There are not 5 fans but one large one in the middle.Yes the fans is quiet but this appears mainly because it does next to nothing. Yes the fan spins but it barely moves any air.Hold your hand about 3cm above the unit and you won't even feel it.There certainly isn't enough power to push air in the vent under my laptop.I complete extensive tests over multiple sessions with the fan on and off. It made absolutely no difference to the GPU temperature.Yep the stand looks great and solid enough. But the cooling is absolutely none existent.
5,I am really satisfied with the product. Strong colors quiet cooler strong construction... simply perfect.10 stars for Customer service. (most important for every product is customer services)
5,Excellent laptop cooler well made great design and absolutely love the led's very bright and look classy not tacky highly recommended
5,Bought an addition unit for my sons laptop that was suffering from thermal throttling problem solved !Excellent product
2,It looks good it has good adjustment of hight but it doesn't cool nothing aswell as it is in the centre so if vents are at rear at both side it just doesn't work.
5,super cooling
5,Très efficace pour compléter le refroidissement du pc portable
5,It's very cute.
2,It looks great with the lights but does not keep my Mac mini from getting hot even on the base of the mini where contact is the fan is obviously not powerful enough. It is form over function on this cooling pad and a overpriced pad at that.
5,Schöne Farben und sehr leise. Dabei hohe Leistung bei der Kühlung. Bei der Haltbarkeit gibt's einen Abzug weil halt die Teile alle aus Plastik sind also nicht für die Ewigkeit gedacht.
5,Je l’utilise pour mon pc gamer. Il ne fait pas de bruit. L’ordi est beaucoup moins chaud.
1,Das Gerät erzeugt selbst im ausgeschalteten Zustand ein hochfrequentes Dauergeräusch ( Haustiere werden sich freuen). Der Lüfter ist selbst auf kleinster Stufe schon deutlich hörbar. ( leichtes Rattern). Für ein Gerät welches ein Materialwert von weniger als 3 € hat und zu einem solchen Preis verkauft wird habe ich mir wesentlich mehr versprochen. Ich bin sehr enttäuscht.
3,Muchas lucesitas que no sirven para nada pero a un ventilador de 5 voltios no se le puede pedir mucho...
4,livraison rapidetrès satisfait de l'achat
5,product in line with expectations
5,pour refroidir mon pc portable.très bien mais je trouve les explications insuffisantes.tout le monde n'est pas guik et ne devine pas à quoi sert le morceau de fil raccord pc qui pendouille sur le côté.
5,Very lightweight  works well... although could be better if the buttons were to the side instead of the rear
5,Bel desgin e belle linee. In estate quando navigo il laptop inizia a dare di matto troppo caldo. Con questo prodotto molto velocemente riesco a gestire gli alti di calore. Le informazioni riportate su amazon sono corrette e il prodotto corrisponde. Mi ha soddisfatto anche se il prezzo in effetti è un po’ altino...
3,Purtroppo la posizione della ventola centrale non ha aiutato al raffreddamento del mio notebook restitutito. Comunque prodotto di ottima fattura.
2,Faible puissance de refroidissement  déçu  je ne perd peut être que 3-4 degrés et encore ..
5,Did exactly as promised running three monitors from my laptop and not suffering from shutdowns 👍🏻
2,Product looks good but fan speed is low. It’s not really cooling anything just looks ok. Packing was terrible. Seller sent in retail box which was damaged. Can’t recommend product or seller to anyone.
5,Super produit et esthétiquement très jolie donne un beau rendu sur le set up de mon  fils  fait peus de bruit  et ventil bien
5,Parfait
5,Good
5,By far the most silent compared with two other cooling pads.Version with a single 20cm diameter fan.Note that air flow surface increases with the square of fan radius.Used with Dell XPS 15 i9 9thGen.
5,Das Gerät ist genau wie beschrieben. Es ist nicht zu hören bei Betrieb und entspricht voll meiner Erwartung.
5,Très bon produit mon ordinateur reste froid quoi qu'il arrive et il est beau en plus de ça
5,cooling my laptop .what else??
5,Plutôt bruyant mais avec un casque on ne l'entend pas du tout j'ai perdu 5 à 10°celsuis avec celui-ci
5,Ottimo oggetto prestazioni ottime mantiene il PC ben refrigerato non fa rumore eccessivo e la struttura è ben stabile
5,Leise bunt super Kühlleistung. 3 mal Ja!
5,per lavoro e per svago lo uso sempre. Rialza il mio portatile e mi permette di lavorare meglio sulla scrivania fa una buona figura per via dell’aspetto accattivante. Spedizione ultra veloce come sempre. Non trovo punti negativi al momento ma mi riservo di cambiare opinione dopo averlo testato a lungo.
5,Super lüfter angeschafft für meine PS4-Pro bin super zufrieden. Der lüfter ist sehr leise und stört kaum. Auch die PS4 ist nicht mehr so laut im Volllast Modus.
5,super perfect cooling pad
1,Wenig kühlleistung
5,Funziona
5,Top das Gerät sehr zu empfehlen!
5,nonostante le dimensioni non piccole l’aspetto è a dir poco gagliardo! Diciamo che non passa inosservato specialmente accendendo le luci. Raffredda e mi permette di vedere il pc portatitle più comodamente. Lo raccomando a chi come me ha bisogno di una postura migliore quando si siede al pc.
5,Top produit !! Juste 4 étoiles pour le bruit car on l’enten Assez bien quand il tourne à fond sinon nickel pour le reste 👍
5,Efficace et quasi silencieux parfait pour son utilisation
5,És el que buscava ara: tampoc és que canviï gaire la temperatura a ple mes d'agost a BCN.És una base que està bé i és discreta pots NO tenir llum així no sembla una fira mòbil.
4,Buoni i materiali basso il prezzo e ottime le prestazioni. Acquisto consigliato!!
5,Ho aspettato un po' prima di recensirlo. Sinceramente a prima vista è molto bello e fa il suo lavoro.A mio avviso manca una tacca di alzata per un giusto compromesso pc e supporto ma questo è un mio parere personale
5,L'aspetto è veramente bello funziona a dovere anche se mi aspettavo rafreddasse di più
4,Ottimo come da descrizione
5,Plus facile à utiliser les usb
5,Great cooler very quiet looks cool with the changeable lights on great delivery service
3,Bella presentazione  bel packaging  belle istruzioni chiare.  Piace meno il supporto inferiore in plastica sotto alle barre di sostegno in metallo  ed il rumore della ventola
5,Parfait pour refroidir mon portable. Pas de problème de taille (Lenovo Legion 17")
5,Extrem leise sehr leicht und sieht mega cool aus.
5,Spedizione un po’ a rilento però il prodotto c’è tutto. La descrizione nel sito corrisponde al prodotto e anche le foto sono realistiche. Raffredda il mio laptop senza problemi e mi piacciono le luci. Il prezzo forse è un po’ altino però direi che ci siamo.
1,Nach 1 Monat dreht der Lüfter nicht mehr
5,Pour pc portable 17 pouces c'est nickel seul bémol c est le câble d alim spécifique si un jour il casse il sera difficile à retrouvé
5,La lumière
5,War ein Geschenk kam gut an und erfüllt dort nun täglich seinen Job ohne Probleme.
5,Über die Haltbarkeit kann ich noch nichts sagen habe den Kühler erst seid ein paar Tagen.Ich benutze diesen Kükler für meine PS4 Pro und es ist genial.
5,Lieferung ging problemlos und das Gerät läuft einwandfrei. Durch die verschieden einstellbare Neigung kann der Laptop auf eine ergonomisch optimale höhe eingestellt werden. Rund um ein gutes teil.

1,Die Verbindung zum Ständer ist sehr locker Ich muss herumwackeln um Strom zu bekommen. Werde nie wieder bei einer Firma kaufen. Auf allen Bildern liegt es auch es sieht so aus als ob nur 1 USB-Anschluss benötigt wird aber 2 verwendet werden. Super nicht glücklich
5,good strong product great lighting system lets hope it lasts
5,It is amazing. It cools down my laptop realy well. I recommend it.
5,Pour un pc portable gaming msi gt83 vr titan sli 230 fr KLIM ultimate est génial et très futuriste avec aucun bruit. Formidable
3,Leider recht laut
5,alles bestens
4,Fa il suo lavoro
3,Produit conforme. 1 seul de fonctionnelle sur les 2 commandés
5,Dopo alcune settimane di utilizzo ho verificato l’abbassamento delle componenti hardware del pc dai 4 agli 8 gradi circa.Il rumore provocato dalla ventola è praticamente nullo e l’RGB fornisce alla base quel giusto tocco estetico.
5,Il mio PC misura 17.3 pollici e risulta quindi poco più grande della piattaforma che tuttavia mantiene un’ottima prestazione e mi permette di evitare il surriscaldamento del dispositivo. Mi ritengo pertanto molto soddisfatto dell’acquisto.
5,Schnelle Lieferung toller Artikel Beschreibung hält was sie verspricht
5,Bester Kühler für das Geld.
1,Ich besitze ein Acer Predator Helios 300 und wollte mir eine ordentliche Lüftung für mein Gaming-Notebook besorgen aber für jeden der genau dasselbe sucht rate ich von diesem Produkt ab. Es bringt null Kühlung - nicht mal einen oder zwei Grad Unterschied wenn es auf Hochtouren läuft.Ich werde dieses Produkt zurückschicken und mir stattdessen einen anderen Lüfter vom selben Hersteller ansehen - den Klim Wind. Dort habe ich eine Bewertung von jemanden gesehen der dasselbe Notebook wie ich besitzt also wird der nächste Kauf hoffentlich ein Erfolg sein.
5,Molto soddisfatto!! Eccezionale  raffredda bene ed è molto potente…per non parlare delle luci RGB che la fanno unica questa base di raffreddamento …. Consigliatissima!!!!!
1,the wire has already become loose and the cooling is overall shocking.there is not much of a difference in temperaturethe price is way too high for such plastic tacAvoid!
5,Uso moltissimo i software per videoconferenza insieme ad altri software molto "pesanti" per montaggio video. Il Mac book bolliva ora è fresco come una rosa!!
1,I don’t know how this product got any positive feedbacks? Cheap build noisy and worth maybe £10 max. I have to return it as I don’t like a cheap items on my desk with a £2700 laptop. I hope I will find a proper cooler which will be build in proper and not cheap way. £50 for this? It a no no. Don’t waste your money.
5,Very good!!!
5,Super ! Kann ich nur empfehlen.GEZ. E-Sportler
5,Finde es geil nachteil ich brauch noch eines
5,Genau was ich mir vorgestellt hatte. Sieht sehr gut aus und verhindert Überhitzung. Würde ich wirklich jedem empfehlen!

1,My laptop is still hot
1,One large fan that barely changes the the temp it's not worth what it's priced at and it's high rating seems suspicious.
5,Alles super
5,Super produit
1,Pour 60 balles c'est se faire avoir. Un pauvre plateau basculant avec un bandeau Led et un ventilateur.
5,Ottimo! Come da descrizione: solito e silenziosissimo
2,Wrong description arrived in an open box can not tracking the package.
5,Super
5,Refroidit très bien mon pc portable et ne fait pas beaucoup de bruit
5,Rien à signaler
1,The device is sturdy and colorful but the purpose is not served. It barely provides any cooling. RGB is full 5 star cooling makes me wanna return it!
1,Bonjour j'ai récemment acheter ce produit niveau esthétique il remplit sont rôle par contre niveaux refroidissement avec l'été la chaleur j'ai quand même acheter ce refroidisseur 50 euro mon PC portable toujours aussi chaud et bouillant ne perd pas de température obligé de mettre un ventilateur normal à côté pour faire baisser la température cela et inadmissible pour le prix sachant que les modèles Klim game en dessous sont plus efficace et moins chère
5,Super simple handbabe gute Verarbeitung
5,Très bon produit ! Il refroidit très vite le pc. Donc top
1,PS4の稼働音がうるさいので、購入しました。風力最大でも音は気になりませんが、PS4の稼働音に変化無し。風もそよ風で、熱を逃がしているのか疑問です。
5,bon produit tres bien les lumieres c top
5,Silenziosissimo e raffredda davvero sono soddisfatta
2,La base és muy chula por las luces que lleva pero muy poco efectiva. El ventilador casi no tiene potència y no refrigera nada el portatil.
5,Top

1,Pumps air like my grandmother breathing.... Basically no air is pushed at allAlso very very awkward angle hard to use my laptop if used on table.
1,Die Erwartung war aufgrund der vielen positiven Bewertungen hoch. Leider wurde ich enttäuscht. Das Produkt hat das Notebook nicht 1 Grad heruntergekühlt.SPART EUCH DAS GELD WEIL ES NICHTS BRINGT.

1,Mir ist nicht klar was an diesem Produkt ultimate sein soll. Das Plastik ist superbillig der Lüfter macht schon bei mittlerer Stufe Geräusche und von einer Kühlung kann ich auch nichts bemerken. Schrott. Geht zurück.
5,allesok
5,El RGB es genial

5,Pacco arrivato nei tempi stabiliti. Il sistema di raffreddamento funziona molto bene.
5,Un très bon rapport qualité prix.
5,No tiene problema
1,Esta muy guay por el tema de iluminación pero sólo eso. A la hora de enfriar no enfría apenas nada... Es como tener uno normal con lo caro que sale a menos por lo menos el que tengo yo.
5,Ottimizza le risorse del sistema mantenendo la temperatura sempre costante
5,Ottimo prodotto fa il suo dovere ed esteticamente fa la sua bella figura
5,La silenziosità della ventola ottima. Manca uno step più basso nell'alzata a leggio

5,Bellissima
5,ottimo
5,Per ora  ottimo
5,Perfetta!!
5,Quite a silent cooling pad compared to the other ones I've used. It does it's job but if you're going to buy this for a gaming laptop don't bother just get a stand or bed table. Because it won't show any difference you already got a cooling system build into your gaming laptop adding a cooling pad might drop you a maximum of 5 C heat but that's it. Nothing extreme.
5,Fan works great laptop went from too hot to touch to cool. Exceeds my expectations. Hopefully it works for years
5,Tydzień użytkowania. Wentylator działa cicho. Czuć powiew powietrza wytwarzany przez wentylator. Według moich odczuć temperatura laptopa dzięki podkładce spadła o około 5 stopni Celsjusza. Wentylatory w laptopie działają na mniejszych obrotach.Fajna jest możliwość wyłączenia RGB-nie jestem zwolennikiem takich gadżetów.Mój sprzęt Acer Nitro 5 17cali Geforce rtx 3060  i7-1075
4,It’s super quiet but cooling levels half ok.
3,Koeler doet wat hij moet doen maar het geluid is irritant net alsof hij aanloopt.
5,Great product- sturdy and works well even on my large and heavy laptop!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Just unboxed this cooler today and I got so madThe fan noise is amazing I can not barely hear it  but the rpg only work on the left side of the cooler. I need help!!!
5,Awesome
5,This perfectly fits my 17inch laptop! Sturdy and durable.
5,Very wholesome
5,I have an XBox Series X and mostly have no problem with overheating but when I play CoD Vanguard the console would shut down once or twice per session and upon restart it would warn me that the unit overheated.  Thing was I had followed all of the recommendation (e.g. don't place in cabinet keep space around it etc.) so it was simply overheating from dubious code in Vanguard (btw no issues on any other CoD game just this one).  It has even been relatively cool weather so the room is not hot at all.I looked online and read the reviews and picked this one - and am I ever happy with it so far.  It has a giant fan that really is super quiet (the XBox fan itself is louder than this one).  The speed of the fan is adjustable and even on highest speed it is still quiet.  The air zone completely surrounds the XBox blowing up into the intake at the base as well as around the exterior which is probably a good thing.Finally a big bonus for using it for a console is that unlike many other cooling stands this one actually lies flat unless you choose to angle it with the built in adjustment - necessary for putting the XBox on it.  It wasn't clear to me in the description that it would lie flat and I was planning on propping it up with a thin strip of wood or something but happily it wasn't needed.Although I haven't given it too much trial yet I did push the XBox with some intense Vanguard sessions and so far no more heat-related shutdowns.The lights are night (you can shut them off if you wish) but the cooling aspect is the real star here.  If you are looking for something to cool your console I suggest this one.
5,Awesome works as intended its just awesome i love it
2,it broke while holding my laptop! very lucky my laptop didn’t fall down and break!!
5,A acheté si vous avez un asus Rog Strix de 17 pouce
5,Más silencioso imposible. Igual uso audífonos así que no veo problema si hace ruido o no.
4,The fan and the light show on this little laptop cooler are great. However I’ve only had it since the end of January and gently setting it down has just broken the hinge that holds it up. The piece broke off I cannot fix it and I cannot find a way to contact the company. A waste of $50 if that’s how they all are.EDIT: KLIM replaced it once I found a way to contact them. It's still a good cooling pad the lights are nice etc but I'll be mindful to baby it a little extra as I don't want it replaced again.Customer service is really nice.
4,Very good and silent fan. I wasnt sure at the beginning because not much air came out but i guess you just need to give a little patience. i use it for my 14 inch gaming laptop. Very good investment. It will get you cold too at some point.
5,well built product i'd give 6 stars if i could
4,Se ve muy bien visualmente sin embargo siento que no enfría tan bien aunque cumple con su función. Los materiales tampoco se ven muy resistentes por lo que creo que con una caída bastaría para dañarlo.
5,Klime people are the best
5,Works perfectly cooling my gaming laptop very well.
5,LOVE IT! Seriously!
5,This is by far the best laptop cooler I have had the one big fan moves a lot of air while still being quiet. The RGB lights are bright you can set them to any pattern colour combo you like.
5,Se la regalé a mi hijo y cumple su función para bajar el nivel de calor que emite su laptop las luces RGB realzan la vista y hace tus se vea muy de lujo la recomiendo al 100%
4,En general el producto me gustó. Mantiene la computadora a buena temperatura lo que se evidencia en que se activan en mucho menor medida que antes los ventiladores de mi computadora. Visualmente los patrones de luz están bastante bien. El problema que tengo es que para lo costosa que es (es la más cara de todas las bases de laptop que he visto hasta ahora) el material de la base es un plástico bastante ligero y simplón que contrasta con los buenos materiales el peso y la calidad de manufactura del resto del producto. La empresa debería tener eso en cuenta si quieren que un producto bueno a secas se vuelva uno excelente y realmente valga lo que estamos pagando.
5,Great product and great customer service.
1,Noisy and flimsy
3,Doesn't cool the laptop that much don't understand how it costs so much but it does the same as other cooler just has an extra rgb.
5,Amazing! Sadly my port broke but the company was more then happy to help me! The fan does work really well to cool down my laptop- it is very quiet.
5,Cumple su función y no es tan ruidoso 🙌🏼 10/10
5,No DisLike I really like alot
4,Adds a good fit to my gear
4,Keeps the LT cool and all the leds still work .
1,Well...the lights looks good! But other than that I'm generally deceived! It is made of flimsy plastic and cheap aluminium and it feels poorly made on your hands! The fan is silent....because it does less wind than when my baby breathes! Save your money and go buy a fan from the Dollar store!
5,Very happy with the quality and performance of the product!
5,Duda en comprar este articulo pero ahora que lo adquiri estoy muy contento con mi compra.Lo recomiendo si quieren enfriar laptops de 17¨ jala sin problemas y el ruido que hace el abanico no lo logras percibir. LLego antes de lo esperando y tuve que venirme corriendo por el.Me hubiera gustado que tuviera un poco mas de fuerza el motor del abanico pero sin duda cumple satisfactoriamente.El apagar la luz es magnifico y el control de colores que tiene es excelente muy bien en RGB combino a la perfeccion con lo demas de mi escritorio.
5,It's a laptop fan and it does the job well. The RGB lighting is a great touch and it has easy functionality. You won't get a huge drop in CPU and GPU temps or anything but I wasn't expecting to anyway still though you might get like 3-5°C. Easy to use and looks good.
5,Great Build & Quiet fan.
5,Me sorprendió lo bien que ayuda a mi equipo con la temperatura después de un rato mi lap tiraba el aire súper caliente con este ventilador no se calienta para nada la temperatura al 100 después de un largo rato trabajando y lo más importante no hace nada de ruido
5,Excelente producto
5,This Laptop Cooling Stand is really cool. Arrived very quick. Convenient and beautiful. I like that you can change the lights on it. It cooling my gaming laptop tremendously perfecting the gaming experience. No noise very quiet. I am happy and completely satisfied! Thanks
3,With such a big fan and so low rotation speed the noise level is unacceptable and I can hear clicking sound from the motor. The wind is not strong enough even with the highest speed I can only feel wind at the edge I think this is a flaw of the product design.
4,Fan a bit rattly causing audible noise plastic frame feels a bit flimsy. Lowest angle still quite steep. But it does its job lowering temps by 5-10 degrees C depending on load.
5,it's just pretty cool but it isn't a cold as i expected
5,Perfect exactly what I wanted 5 stars
5,Klim Ultimate comes ready for all gaming needs with a 200mm fan that can run at a quiet 750RPM and that still provides plenty of airflow.This cooling pad is made to be flashy with its extensive RGB light strip that wraps around the entire circumference of the device. It even manages to support seven different colors and has five different lighting effects.
5,Bajo considerablemente la temperatura el material plastico de la base a soportado muy bien el peso de 4 kilos de la laptop. muy buen producto
1,I just bought this a few months ago and it’s already broken the cord that plugs into the back never stayed in it port so it didn’t even work half the time and when it did work the back supports that lift it up wouldn’t stay up it made me quite sad as I thought it was a lovely laptop stand just sad that it didn’t work. The fan also isn’t powerful enough to cool down a gaming laptop I have the ASUS tiff gaming laptop and this couldn’t cool it down
