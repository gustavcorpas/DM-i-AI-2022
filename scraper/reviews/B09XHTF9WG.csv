4,So I bought it liked it and might have given a bettrr review only I put it away for a while. Imagine my surprise when I saw a box in my drawer and couldnt remember what the brand name was for. When I opened it saw the printer I realized I had deleted the software in a phone purge a few days earlier - again because I didnt associate the brand name and it was unclear what it was. Would printing label maker on the box have been so hard?
4,It can be difficult to connect to your device. And it prints coming out facing down so that was weird.
5,The app is easy to use! the labels print super fast. I use it for my small business and have no complaints.
5,Was looking for a small portable label maker for travel and this is fantastic. Love the size and the features. Great that it's got so many different label options. Easy to use and install. The app is great too and works really well. Love being able to change font sizes etc. My favorite is the little round labels.
4,Es muy prÃ¡ctica y fÃ¡cil de usar lo Ãºnico negativo es que como muchas aplicaciones u opciones requieren compras adicionales para acceder a mÃºltiples opciones de impresiÃ³n y esto no me parece bien.
5,very easy to use and the labels are small but very manageable
5,I like it that it works with my phone. I didn't realize that when I bought it. But it's great
5,Cute little printer! I got for ~20$ to use for organizational purposes. The labels are super small but worked for me! Iâ€™m happy with my purchase :)
5,super facil de usar
4,This label maker does not support size labels I was interested in making
5,Device and app both easy to work with.Set up in a few minutes.Very convenient and helpful.
4,I had difficulty keeping it hooked to my Bluetooth but overall it works well. Can't complain much.
5,Really nice and easy to use. So far work great.
5,Easy to setup and use the app actually gives you a fair amount of customization for the labels... some graphics are sharper than others... you can use your own pics it's pretty cool.  Don't have to buy ink and the labels don't rip.  I got it for cords/chargers.  Small footprint.  Cheap refill labels.  Half the price of the handheld Epson's.
5,Super facil de usar muy until y practica. La recomiendo.
5,With a little reading and practice printouts it is a great little printer.
5,Megusto
5,Very good quality for the price!
3,I returned because it was printing to many mistakes.. Could be software could be machine.. Also the labels aren't very sticky
3,Requiero ayuda para poder usarla pues no imprime lo que escribo solo sale dobles lÃ­neas
1,This seems like a good idea -- a rechargable label maker run from an iPhone app -- but it has to pair with the iPhone first via Bluetooth and nothing I tried would get it to pair. Phone is new and this device is new so age is not the problem.
1,Labels are way too tiny
1,The stickers are so unbelievably small that the labels are pretty much useless
1,Bought this for Father's Day 2022. Only used a couple of times. No longer works. No "product support" available.
4,So far the D110 Portable Bluetooth Label Printer works well and I hope it continues doing so. The app needed to create the labels is rated 3.8 which is concerning but so far I haven't had any issues.
5,Our school requires a label on everything.  Each individual crayon (48) colored pencil (50) marker (24) notebook folder scissors etc.  Many parents spent $50+ on labels from various websites.  I bought this label maker and some extra labels with cats on them.  I spent half what they did and mine looked better.  Plus next year I am ready to do it all over again.This is a thermal printer so it is already waterproof.  You can find lots of cute labels on Niimbot's website or Amazon.  We went with cats and I ordered cable labels for my daughter's scissors and headphones.  Then I proceeded to label all my computer cables server cables and TV/Media cables.The printer is easy to use and easy to change your label type.  I liked the app and did not find it confusing at all.  I could adjust the font type font size add emojis/characters etc.  I was able to layer text and more individual parts around independently for the best look.  Overall I am very pleased.
4,This label maker is nicely packaged. It's easy to charge and easy to use.  I took one star off because I don't like the NIIMBOT app that you have to use to use the label maker.
4,Makes nice labels. I like that you can use a variety of fonts and save them. I'm using it to label things in my kitchen and all the plants I'm growing in my table garden. It is easy to use and the printing is good. I would love to have some different color labels. It's a good value for the money.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Â Easy to use as long as you have a compatible device android phone or iPhone not compatible with Chromebooks. Prints easily and great for back to school for labeling.
5,This is an ocd organized obsessed persons best friend lol. Syncing and set up is super easy. Not hard to learn how to use it. Dries pretty fast too.
5,I got this little printer out of curiousity.  I have an OLD Dymo that still works.I spent 5 minutes setting it up and it was super easy.  Other than looking for the app info i set it up without needing instructions.  The unit paired instantly and i was up and printing in 10 minutes.  This uses precut lables so you are a little limited but they have a range of sizes that should fit you needs.  I printed a few test labels and like the feel.  Scraping the printed label with my fingernail did not scrape the printing off  even after trying pretty hard to remove the printing.It's nice you can save your printed labels if you make multiple copies.. I am pretty happy with this device and will most definitely be using it.  Very nice little printer.
5,This printer was easy to set up and very easy to use.  The only issue is making sure you connect it each time via Bluetooth.  There are tons of options available and plenty of templates to choose from.  It is versatile and can create decorative labels as well as professional ones.  It comes with labels and it seems to detect the type of paper when it's loaded.  I am very happy with this printer.
5,This is a very handy labeler to have. Previously had a brother labeler that required batteries and I finally was not able to get labels for it so decide to get this one.  The label maker is very light weight and uses USB to charge it. It is very easy to setup once charged download the app and connect to it through Bluetooth. Inside the app there are a lot of customization options for fonts size etc. Once you made your label simply print it. If you want another the same just press the button on the printer and it will dispense another. This printer is simple to use offers multiple size labels and endless customization for its price point.
5,This is a very handy portable and useful little label maker.  You just load your labels download the NIIMBOT app on your phone pair your phone with the label maker via bluetooth and your ready to go!  The app provide A LOT of customization (fonts size bold underline etc.) provides a myriad of predefined label templates but is also easy to use. App is very user friendly and intuitive. You can purchase any number of labels (sizes colors etc.) to use.  The only thing is that it only prints in b & w  (without ink).  The printer has a recharge battery and is fast and compact. I think it's great!!
5,This label maker is so compact and is so easy to use. My 7 year old daughter was able to make a label. This label maker is easy to set up using Bluetooth and downloading an app. It is then ready to go. Within the app it has lots of features for various fonts sizes/styles resizing/spacing the lettering and more. I love that it is rechargeable as well. It would be a plus if it came with a carry case for easy transport and storage. It is a great value for the quality of the print ease of use portability compact and easy to carry Bluetooth capability and price.
5,This just arrived and I couldn't wait to get started with it. The instructions and video on the product site made it easy for me to get set up and printing labels in no time. I'll look into the other features later but for ease of use this is a great little label printer.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â I have several indoor hydroponic gardens and what happens often are the plant labels that come with pods don't hold up for an entire grow cycle. They often fade or come off because of weak adhesive.Well this label maker machine changed that. Now I can easily print more durable labels. They are water proof and have a strong enough adhesive. Its also rechargeable and offers a variety of customizations. You can use this to create labels for a wide variety of items and the label refill cartridges are easy to find on Amazon -- although a bit pricey but I still think it is a good value overall.
5,I'm having so much fun with this little label maker I've always wanted one just because so I went with this one and it's great! It's super easy to use too ðŸ™Œ
5,It's a nice compact size. It took me a while to connect the unit but once I got that everything was easy breezy
5,Cute. Small. Easy to use. Quick print. No smudge ink.
5,Once I downloaded the correct program it was so awesome!  I can print little labels for home and school use.
4,I got this for my mother because her nickname is ducky and I was buying the white one for myself both at a great price on prime day. They are fairly easy to use and you realize how much stuff benefit from having a label so there's no question what is inside. And theres no ink to buy! That was the selling point for me. So either one is a great addition to your helpers around the house.
