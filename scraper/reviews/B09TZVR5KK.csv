5,My dad is getting older and misplaces his belongings all the time. Besides that organization was never one of his strengths so I bought him this station to place his things on at night so that he can have everything in one place when he wakes up. Of course he was a little stubborn and my mom told me that it was still in the box after several weeks so I went over and opened it for him. He initially like the ash wood finish but was still reluctant to use it. I set up the his charger for the docking station and showed him where he can put his phone watch glasses and wallet. He called me a few days ago to thank me and tell me how much this gift has helped him keep his things all in one place at the end of the night. Great gift!
5,Bought this as a gift and he said he loved it. Very easy to assemble and looks really great. Will be buying more for gifts
5,This my second review. I received a replacement since the first one was broken and it's beautiful.
4,Very nice organizer.  I took the advice of someone who posted a review and used wood glue as well as the provided screws.  Came out very sturdy.  Recommended!
4,Was a gift and basically okay. There was no hole or screw or anything to hold the piece where cell phone would set so had to buy adhesive glue to get it on the stand. Also had impression on wood of where a screw would be laying on its side and pressed into it. Holder was okay for what I needed but could have been sturdier and other issues not occurred
5,Cute

5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             this wood docking station was purchased for me as a gift and has been great at organizing my nightstand.  This item at a glance is very masculine and sleek in appearance so it looks good ok my side of the bed. The materials its made from also feel strong and sturdy in hand so it is expected to last me while.  In the mornings when that alarm goes off everything I need to head out the door and function as a normal human being is right there on this stand! Saves time and keeps me organized!
5,* A nice and strong wooden multipurpose stand.* It works as a phone charging deck  watches wallet keys and other small thing holders.* Easy to assemble. Takes 10 min max* Wood finish is very smooth.** A great option for a gift to your loved one.
3,Nice item but didn’t really put together all that well holes where pegs go in to assemble where off so it doesn’t quite fit right after messing with it and getting it to go it’s not all that stable bump it and it falls apart eh I don’t know it is what it isIf you glue it together it will be perfect use wood glue
5,My husband loves this thing.  Took him 5 minutes to put together with no issues.

Finally here my wife comes to save my day - she bought me this product as a birthday gift.Multifunctionality - fits all kinds of small items in the structureUSB-friendly - I got 3 phones and I'm tired of those cords getting tangled all the timeEasy to assemble - took me like a couple of minutes to put together the small parts
5,I bought this for my husband. Now he can find his cell phone watch glasses... well organized in one place. I like it there is a slot under phone it gives space for charging connector and avoid tangling the charging cable. Usually it was put on the nightstand. Sometimes my son or me would "borrow" this organizer to put on his study desk for video chatting or his "well-organized presentation".
5,Like everything about it.
3,It’s great but it never came with a part 4
5,Love
1,Arrived damaged! The piece where you would charge your cell phone was damaged (as pictured). The holes do not line up where you are supposed to attach the cellphone piece to the back (as pictured). This same piece is a completely different color than the rest of the item. Very disappointed. This was supposed to be a gift. Don't waste your money!
1,The rack looks great but when I tried to put it together I noticed that the screws are missing. I can put it together. $42:00 dollars down the drain.
5,Got it for my dad as a gift he used it right away ! Very nice.
5,I want sure how much of like this when I ordered it but it is a really nice way to keep the stuff that littles my nightstand organized. Definitely recommend!
5,My dad loved it for Father's day! It's perfect for the table next to his recliner and everything he has laying around fits on it perfectly.
5,Bought it as a gift to my friend. Worth the price. Small and attractive.
5,Amazing product with good quality
5,Well made. Needed this to organize my gadgets.
5,I like the fact that receiver of this gift started using it immediately. It was the right size and color.
3,Purchased as a gift for my husband he loves it. But I can’t give it 5 stars he had to rest I’ll the peg holes for the cellphone stand the holes did not line up so it would not assemble correctly. Luckily he owns every tool in the world so no big deal. But for most it would have had to been returned.. it is great for clearing clutter off that night stand. And it’s a nice dark almost cherry wood looking finish.
5,Super easy to assemble nice quality.
5,Great product that free up the desk space and makes using phone easy
