4,Great charger but cord is short. The outlet must be close to you if you plan to use your phone while it is charging.
5,It's charging power is just as fast as the charger that came with phone. It works good. I use for traveling and it's a good value for my money
4,Bought it for my galaxy S10+. Charged my phone from zero two hours roughly. Definitely worth the money.
5,Works perfect so far !
4,Like it
4,I really like this cord but sadly the side of it cracked off? Idk how! It was in my little backpack ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
5,My husband and I love this!  It charges our Androids in an hour.  No more putting phones on charger before bed!
5,This is the fastest charger I have ever used! I wish it was a bit longer but it is excellent and has saved me so many times! I highly recommend it.
4,My grandson was very happy with it..except the cord is short...we're going to get a longer one..all in all it's a fast charger and does exactly what it says it does! I would recommend!
5,Perfect just what I needed and price with cheap...
