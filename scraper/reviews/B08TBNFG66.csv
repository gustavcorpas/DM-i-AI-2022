4,I bought this dashcam for the following reasons:1: high resolution sensor2: Easy app access;3: dual camera support4: 70mai is a subsidiary of XiaoMi which is famous for making decent products much better than the other vendors with unknown reputations;I installed on my car just a couple of days ago in no way it's a longevity review so take my review with a grain of salt.Good:Image quality -- better than my older 1080p dashcam and I can see VERY clearly the license plante on vehicles 20 feet ahead and on neighboring lanes. The h.265 codec compression works excellently as well which only takes a relatively tiny space on mSD card;The app -- The app connection is VERY easy and smooth and reliable. App is easy to use. So absolutely no complain here!So-so:Please know the 1944p resolution gives you a 4:3 ratio video which in dashcam use case the vertical space doesn't mean much;Also the lens distortion is pretty bad. But I know I cannot use the DSLR standard to judge a dashcam and the license plate on the left/right extreme is clearly visible which is the bottom line.Concerns:The dashcam doesn't have any ventilation slots/holes and it does get quite WARM even when working under room temperature. I installed it under the cover of the pedestrian detection box so the unit doesn't receive much direct sunlight but it still feels uncomfortably hot under normal drive/recording conditions. I live in Houston so the summer vehicular heat can potentially kill it quite quickly. Knowing it will most likely void the warranty I am going to drill some holes on the body and hope that helps.
4,Update it suddenly started working properly. But what i said Below this is also true. Because it’s seems it can be immensely unreliable i would tread light.Read the questions about memory cards being killed it’s a common problem and it’s too late for me to get my money back.I’ve been through multiple SD cards of extremely high quality. Bought from the micro center with a warranty because they keep getting killed by this device. I have A Samsung evo plus 256GB  130 mbs micro SD xc (3) 10 A2 v30 .  I have A 128 that got killed instantly. If they could get this issue fixed I’d say this is beyond a bargain. But they can’t and you never know when your memory card will just fail leaving you in some of the worse possibly situations. I live I’m nyc and driving here is not easy in the slightest nor parking and leaving your car. I have this for insurance and safety and it utterly useless because of this SD card issue.  Save your self the trouble.
5,I just got it all installed formatted a new sd card and updated the firmware.  Everything seems to be working perfectly.  Some people stated that the time lapse function was gone but it was there in both versions of the firmware that I tried.  The only thing that seems weird is the rear camera integration.  I can't figure out how to have both cameras on the display or my phone at the same time.  The video files are separate as far as I can tell.  I am very pleased so far with this dash cam.
5,I had a car accident recently. I still can't believe how could this happen. An idiot Korean (women) hit my car and said she didn't see my car. That's rediculous. I showed the police my dash cam video immediately and we run through the insurance very easy thanks to this dash cam. It is awesome you can download the video thru the app. Very convenient.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 June 14 2022 edit: Annoying start-up sound still exists. I do not recommend that the average user buy this camera.I used this dash cam for five minutes and was going to return it. The issue is the boot sound that can't be turned off in settings. I found a hack online (for Androids and maybe for iPhones) which worked and I've decided to keep it because of the great video and ease of use of the device. Also the sub-$100 value for front and rear cameras is superb! In short if you can tolerate this start-up sound or use the hack (instructions below) to disable it I think you will really like this device.When I turn on my car the dash cam powers up and plays an extremely audible and short jingle. It is very loud and there's no option to turn this off without downloading an app to "hack the system." [See end of review for steps] Even if the volume were low I still wouldn't want it. I drive almost every day and prefer quiet so I get annoyed extremely easily. I've read accounts of other people who don't like this as well. However some people may want to know that their dash cams are turning on and working... but the sound is still way too loud. [The company is going to update firmware for future products but this one is stuck with this issue.] In addition when you set up this camera there's a deafening beep when you toggle through options. I've never heard anything this loud. I don't know what the product people were thinking!I have several other quibbles. This dash cam takes 19 seconds from boot up to start recording. Seriously??? This is 10 seconds longer than my cheaper dash cam. Also the cables are on the right side of the dash cam - I prefer that they be center or on the left so that they are more concealed in my car and less visible to the passenger. Your mileage may vary.What do I like about this dash cam? It is well designed. It looks fine in a minimalistic way - nothing too pretty about it but nothing hideous. The buttons are an absolute joy to press and operate. I've owned three dash cams and these buttons are by far the best. The video quality is fantastic. I played some videos on my computer and I could see houses and cars pretty sharply. I'm sure 4K will be nicer (and at least twice as expensive) but the current resolution is more than sufficient for me.In order to view the videos on your computer  you may need to download a codec (Microsoft.HEVCVideoExtension_1.0.43421.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe) or a free video player like VLC otherwise the footage will be black and you will only be able to hear audio. Newer computers probably don't need this.I haven't used GPS but it's one thing I was excited about. The price: you get a front and rear camera for under $100. This is remarkable and I applaud the company for this. The rear camera is 1080p and isn't amazing but it's good enough.If you don't want to go through the below steps and disable the sound (some people who aren't tech savvy or don't have Androids may be screwed) you can spring for a different dash cam. There are many out there to choose from - many cheaper ones. Even if the quality is lesser these cheap cameras will still work and not have the annoying start-up sound. The main purpose of the dash cam is to prove that you are not at fault and most dash cams will do this. Secondary is capturing license plates.The bottom line: I've decided to keep this dash cam set because I found out how to fix the initial deal-breaker. It's not hard but you do need to connect to your dash cam and be a little patient. I have an Android and I'm good with tech so this took 10 minutes for me. I'm not sure if the app is available for the iPhone. When you update the firmware the dash cam settings are factory reset so you'll have to go through this process again which is very frustrating.1. Connect to the camera via hotspot with your phone's wifi.2. Download the "Mobile Telnet" app from the Play Store3. Telnet settings ---> Remote host name: 192.168.0.1 port: 23 (this is the default)4. ConnectShould display the NVTEAM login labelType "root" and then ENTERThen type this command (in one "sentence" and press ENTER at the very end) with a space between "mv /" and "raw /mnt":mv /mnt/app/res/voice/public/bootsound.raw /mnt/app/res/voice/public/bootsound_1.rawThen ENTERIMPORTANT:If you want to put the sound back you must type this:mv /mnt/app/res/voice/public/bootsound_1.raw /mnt/app/res/voice/public/bootsound.raw
4,I just had car accident and come back to review this it helps a lot for me to say words to police for car accident. really strong words to help me speak out
4,This is THE best value you'll get for a dual dashcam setup at this price point. Lots of features and decent camera quality at a relatively affordable price. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was because it was a pain for me to setup the app that goes along with this camera. Eventually got it working after about a week but I've had no issues to report aside from that.
4,Overall the quality of camera is good. Look and feel high built quality. The front camera is good with high resolution with driving speed and GPS location. The color dynamics isn't good enough sky is washed out and trees are too dark in a not very sunny day. The back camera isn't good even though having1080p resolution it has very soft focus and details. The color temperature of front camera and back camera are not calibrated in sync the back camera is too color saturated comparing to the front camera.
5,Great looking product that is small and easy to set up (albeit a little tedious if you want the wires hidden but worth it).Hopefully I’ll never need it’s function but gives me peace of mind.
3,It looks good but only one camera can view in the screen at a time. Also it always shows the front camera view in the Mobile application. I did not see any option to switch to rear camera in the mobile app. Also it requires the hardwire kit for parking survivalance that is of additional cost and you might have to connect to your cars battery (I did not buy). There are several cheap dash cam that doesn't require a hardwire kit for parking survivalance; instead they use internal battery to automatically turn on and capture the pictures if something happened when you parked your car.Pros:- Easy to use- Good user interface- good picture quality- Good audio quality- additional electrostatic films for mounting- good packaging- looks a standard deviceCons:- memory card is not included- requires hardwire kit for parking survivalance- hardwire kit not included in the package- screen size is very small (2in) but okay- Poor batter backup- only Front cam is showing live in the mobile app- The live view in the mobile app is super slow and lag.- The camera is not flat it is more or like fish angle lens.
5,I did a lot of research into dash cams and found this to be the best. The cameras are small unobtrusive and provide great quality and a lot of preference options. The access to the camera footage through their own app on my phone is vital and much easier than trying to access the camera itself or having to go through the card when moved to a computer.  Very happy with this purchase.
4,I tried multiple different SD cards with the device as well as updating the firmware nothing works. It always says sd card damaged. Really unfortunate because i loved the previous 70mai cams and this one has failed me.Edit: 70mai has reached out to me and graciously sent me a replacement. Updated from one star to four because when it works it's great. Lets hope this one works out!
4,Buen producto
5,I left my camera on with the option to turn off after 10 minutes if no displacement is detected. Well it stayed on for 4 hours and my car started up normally. (I did this while I was working and normally work around 4 hours) I didn't even realize it had stayed on til I turned on the car. My car is a 2007 ford mustang coupe. Not much drain going on with that car in general so if your car doesn't have a lot of drain you could try out leaving it on. Just have a method to charge your battery if it drains too much that you can't start your car.Also if you care there doesn't seem to be a widescreen 16:9 option but I don't really care myself.I might eventually go with the hardwire kit for the 24/7 parking monitor option but for now those few hours is all I need.I might update later with how much it drained the battery. I just didn't check the volts before starting it up.
4,Among many nice dash cam and digital mirror I bought this one for a particular purpose Lane keeping assist. I was not sure when I bought this it made by Chinese though. I love this buy because It works pretty well. It tells me when front car moves and it alert when I change my lane and it also warns me if some car cut my suddenly.. good enough camera.. only missing part are these two. 1 not enough setting (I cant put permanently on back camera. 2 no digital mirror.. why they don't sell extended digital mirror with this dash cam.. I am happy with it but still missing digital mirror with it..🥲
5,No problems with it easy installation.
4,It has useful features for the price but some parts need to be fixed. In particular it is difficult to cleanly install the rear camera. The connection part of the electric cord is thick so it is impossible to install it hidden
5,It really was quite easy to install and set up. One gets used to the on off alarm.  I'm not taking it apart like others suggest just to shut it up.  After a while I just ignore it.  It is very sensitive.  I slammed the door and the emergency recording started.  I go through pot holes and the emergency recording starts.  I don't like the rounded view of the recordings and I didn't let the system run 24/7 because I worry about battery drainage.  I know it says it's not much but I owned a Kia/Hyundai in the past and those batteries die if you leave something connected to it. So far I like it well enough.  Just wish the view wasn't as rounded as it is.  More like a fish eye wide angle than a square wide angle.
5,El producto es muy bueno tiene una excelente calidad de video lo único que no me gusto es el sticker no lo pude pegar y me los gaste todos
4,this is a solid dash cam. its small enough to not really stand out from the front of the vehicle and the cables are plenty long to have the front and rear cams attached in a full sized jeep with cable slack to spare. the biggest drawback of the unit is the startup sound that can't be disabled and volume of the sound can't be adjusted. i followed the instructions on another user's review to "move" the sound file from the internals of the device by telnet'ing into the unit (it runs linux internally). after the "hack" it is basically one of the best dash cams i've used for the money.
4,La cámara se ve de buena calidad tiene una excelente imagen y no es complicado la instalación ( preferible que l instale un técnico)
5,This dashcam is absolutely incredible for the price. I really wanted to get a blckvue but couldn't justify spending that much money on an addition that I hope I'll never actually need to use. This one does the job for a fraction of the price feels solid and very well-made is easy to use connects seamlessly to the phone app no complaints. I am pleased with the quality of the footage. The front camera has higher resolution so naturally the footage quality is better but the back one isn't bad too. The only thing they could do better is offer a battery pack option where the dashcam could connect to the battery pack so that I don't have to hardwire into the car to utilize 24/7 parking mode. Installing the dashcam was a breeze for the most part. The rear was a bit tricky to install because I have a convertible and don't have a rear windshield to secure the rear unit permanently. I ended up using velcro and securing it onto a headrest. Not perfect but works! I was so pleased with the quality of this dashcam that I ended up ordering one for my boyfriend's CR-V too. The installation of the dashcam was much more straightforward with his car. It comes with everything you need to install the dashcam with ease!
4,Have a 18 Rav 4 tried to install the rear cam broke the wire had to call AAA to tow the car to dealer to fix the rear gate. Installation of rear cam is NOT for DIY. Front cam and overall is a good product.
5,There seems to be a growing issue of hit and runs in my area so I decided a dash cam would be a good idea. I friend has the 70mai Dash Cam Pro Plus and I was impressed with the rear video quality and he seemed to like the camera system. I did some extra research and the 70mai got great reviews based on quality and price. The cam went on sale and I purchased. I received yesterday and had installed in less than an hour. The cables are tucked inside of headliner and routing was simple to the back hatch for the rear camera. The side of the front camera is of a very small size. The rear camera is much smaller and not intrusive when mounted. The install I did looks very clean minimal wires are seen and I am happy with the out come. I am still learning the features and so far this is a 2 thumbs up 5 star purchase
4,Lo unico es que para que funcione el sensor de parqueo necesita un accesorio mas de resto esta genial.
5,I have a larger new suv it took a while to install so that the cables are hidden but otherwise good. Also for me would have been better to order 2 separate cameras since the rear camera cord has to reach from rear door to windshield..
5,Super fácil de instalar y discreta
4,Dashcam keeps saying out loud sd card damaged. The sd card is not damaged and is samsung class 10 32gb micro sd and has been formatted in the dashcam. This item is defective and has been like this since the first day it was installed.  Past 30 day return so is waste of money and hardwire kit cost also.  Update Seller kindly sent me a new camera and it has been working good now.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is my first ever dash camera and sometimes I am good with technology and sometimes I am not. This is a wonderful dash camera for the money! I got a 65GB SD card since it doesn’t have one. I got it all set up in around 45 Minutes I was making sure to tuck all the wires away. The rear cameras cable just barley reached the back window in the 2017 Toyota Corolla. I like having the button to push if there’s a incident and the camera put it in a lovely folder and you can download the video to your phone from the app. It’s a really cool system.I really like the look of the camera it’s sleek and fits out of the way. I was able to hid the camera out of my sight behind the mirror.I although have not tested out park mode or the Driver assistance stuff.
5,Works great. I received one for Christmas. 4 months later a car comes into my lane and sideswipe me. Cops came to write up accident. The other guy spent 25 mins showing the officer his car and very animated telling him how I came over into him. After he was done the officer came to asked me my side. The first thing I did was pull up the clip from my 70mai app and show it to him. He said that's all I need. Thank you. The other guy was charged with  contributing to the accident. Not me. EVERYONE NEEDS ONE OF THESE.  I BOUGHT 3 FOR MY KIDS AND GIRLFRIEND.
5,I have bought this camera 2 times for my 2 cars and I have recommended it to my friends and family it records very well the app that it comes with is super easy to use and has a lot of image quality and the best thing about it is that it comes in several languages and is easy to install in the car.
3,All of the sudden the micro SD card started being ejected from the device.. Would you go flting and cross the vehicle and I'm able to find it now.
5,Had to buy a dashcam since drivers are crazy out there and went with this one because of its low profile look and extra rear cam. I've been using it for almost 2 months now and like it a lot. It was actually fairly easy to install however the cord for the rear cam is very long so you will have to manage that somehow. Good video quality and visibility during the day and night license plates are easily readable at certain distances. I don't use the app it doesn't seem to be needed for my uses at least. This dashcam does have a startup sound that you get used to so that shouldn't be a deal breaker either
3,good dash cam garbage app.....it wont cconnect...which means you will not be able to check the footage from your phone..
5,Got this for my friend birthday since there is a gps tracker. Good way to track your car whenever you drop off your car for service and you don't know if they took your car for a joy ride or not.This is what happen to my friend he drop his car off to service and it was suppose to be ready within couple hours. We went to pick up his car at the end of the day and they told my friend the car isn't far yet. We went back the end of the day the following day they don't know where the car went.It took them 3 days to figured out the car was actually in the lot. When he get his car back he noticed the mileage was higher then usual.With this product he can find out where has his car been whenever he drop it off to service
4,I the description was written that camera has parking control function. Why it's not described in the title? I thought that it's already in the camera but I have to buy additional supply for this function working.
3,I used to use this company's basic dash cam. It was ok but it only had a front cam. Thought this one (pro + A500s) could be an upgrade of the old dash cam and did not need to rewire.The images captured by the front cam were very clear. They were super clear even if they were taken at night. The rare cam was okay. But the app is so horrible. There is no way I can connect the cam to my iPhone. I googled the problem and some reviews suggested to turn off cellular first before connecting to the cam. I followed the steps but still could not connect to the cam.The second problem is the beep sound when I start my car. The beep is so loud and cannot be turned off.Even though there is a built-in battery but it does not support parking surveillance.  Some other brands can still capture picture or film a video without hardwiring the cam.Will be returning it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This dash cam quality is amazing in my opinion. Because I have a tint on my rear glass it shows dark on the rear can. And the rear dash cam doesn't mirrored which is great. Catching near accidents.
4,This seems to be a very high quality dash cam for the price.  It was fairly easy to install and came with extra static cling stickers for your windshield in case you mess up the mounting location.  (Which I did.)  I am seriously considering returning it however because I cannot the app open or work properly with the wifi.  This device serves me no purpose if I cannot get the data back in case of an accident.  70mai has no customer service number.  Not everyone is 20 something and tech savvy.  It would be nice to talk to a human being instead of waiting days for an answer via email.  If I can get the app to work I will update my rating.
5,Talk about timing. I was going away for a month for a work so I installed this camera a day before I left on my wife's car. 2 days later she was involved in a hit and run. No she didn't  do the hitting and running but we did manage to get the plate from the a hole that did it. Can't really compare to other dash cams but the quality and frame rate is awesome. For the price it's a must get for anyone. I would get one but I do too many dumb things so the less evidence the better lol
5,Me encantó
3,It's a great dash camera and a good price. The image looks good and the voice prompts are a nice feature. However I had to modify the rear camera because it wouldn't swivel enough to mount to the angled rear window of my civic.
5,Buena calidad buena imagen y buen producto en general
5,So far except for the serious fever no problems hindering the use have been found. The electrostatic film is easy to fall off. The use of double-sided tape will be very firm but it will make it difficult to remove. The front and rear cameras are very clear. The emergency recording mode is sensitive and will be activated under a certain degree of vibration. It is recommended to manually clean the video regularly. Compared with the dual camera devices with more than $200 on the market (they may not be real 4K) I think this one has a higher cost performance.
2,I have installed this with their park mode cable. The timelapse works good but the parking incidence mode does not get triggered easily. Yesterday I had my camera in a service center and timelapse mode recorded everything when car was off including being jacked up 5 feet high and parking incidence mode did not get triggered. Is this software bug? If I see fix on this I will change the rating. To make sure this incidence recording mode works I have removed the camera from mount physically and  shake it vigorously to trigger it. It did trigger and recorded video but I don’t think I am going to get that kind of movement in any kind of parking incidences. Please note that the parking mode sensitivity is set to high.
3,We arranged this dashcam based on price and reviews.While installation and performance is amazing make yourself a favor and do not spend extra for the rear dashcam. Yes you can just have the front one.In our case the rear cam never worked or has "woken up" to record anything.
5,No issues with it. Quick and easy to install. One thing I might suggest is on the rear camera cord to add a coiled cable for those of us who have suv's/vans/hatchbacks. I have to keep the cable dangling in order to be able to open the cargo space so it doesn't rip out the cable from the baseboards. It's just an asthetic issue. But everything else was great
1,Let me start my review off by saying this camera was exactly what i wanted when searching for a dashcam.I have owned a few other dash cams and for the price this camera has lots of features and decent camera quality at a affordable price. The design is perfect its low profile still has a screen and has both front and rear cameras.My only complaint is the 70mai support. The camera I purchased died within 3 months of the purchase date. It started randomly rebooting while driving and then eventually just stopped booting at all. The camera would make it to the 70mai logo and then just crash. I figured everything would be fine as it was still under warranty but man was I wrong. Their support team is by email only and its absolutely abysmal. I went around and around trying all the things they suggested and after 30 something emails and multiple attempts at all their tasks they ended the support saying I needed to contact the original retailer for assistance.If you get a good camera and can live with rolling the dice on its long term quality the camera is great. However just pray you never need warranty support as even though my camera was under warranty I was never able to obtain a replacement and decided to buy a different unit from another manufacturer in hopes that they will provide better support over the warranty period.
4,I like the camera and all of the hardware but the software seems outdated and it kind of difficult top use. you can only look at the saved video's when you are connected on the cameras Wi-Fi hotspot and the videos save in weird increments.
3,The rear camera has to connect with the front camera also the rear camera doesn’t turn as much( 90 degree )If you have a SUV when the trunk pop open camera disconnect( due to short usb line)Camera works awesome though.
3,I’m very impressed on the quality of the video. Fairly easy to set up but ran in to an issue on mounting the front dash cam. Turns out it’s missing the mounting plate or base to mount the actual cam on. Not sure if this is something that’s available through their site yet so I’ll update this review as soon as I find out.
2,The app for this cam is completely unusable. I got it to connect twice for the time I had it which was really frustrating. I ended up returning it because while my phone connected to the cam's wifi it would not open the files on the app or show me what the camera could see. Why keep it if you can't view the files easily on the phone? Turns out several people have reviewed the 70mai app and have had the same exact problems. The sound and military time was not customizable either and the device is quite loud even with a low setting and the speaker covered with duct tape. The cam was low profile and easy to install but pass this one up. I returned mine and got a Rove instead that I can actually access the files. Trust the reviews of the Rove and shell out the extra $20 for it.  It may not have a rear cam but it is much more user friendly.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is a nice camera. I am ready to prove someone wrong!
3,The idea of dual camera front and back is great for the price. Image quality is great that being said 3 min clip takes 500MB for front camera so you can calculate how big SD card you need. I have returned it because of no parking monitor without extra cable you have to buy. Most newer cars comes with non-stop 12v power outlet to power the camera simple as that. Another issue I had is that camera was shutting down while parked possibly due to over heating. For the price the cam is great but with issues I have encountered it a no go for me.
4,La batería estaba dañada y es muy difícil cambiar y conseguir no hay técnico que las arreglen
3,refunded
5,Muy buena compra. La camara frontal tiene muy buena resolucion en cambio la trasera si le falta. Facil de instalar. Lastima que no tenga la funcion de voz que la mas basica si trae.
2,The dash cam always say low battery after 10 month use. Very disappoint!
2,It’s a cheap front and back dash cam. Except after about a month of use the back dash cam doesn’t work anymore so I’m not sure what that’s all about.
5,So far so good.  Easy to install.
4,Excellent video quality easy installation
2,I constantly get an error that the memory card is damaged.  I have tried 2 different cards that are made specifically for dash cameras.  It doesn't matter.  The system will work just fine for a little while and then will give the error.  I have tried resetting the camera unplugging and plugging it back in.  Re-seating the memory card doesn't get the error to go away either.  I am at my wits end.  The company website doesn't really provide support other than a half-hearted FAQ session that doesn't really address anything.
1,I purchased this camera with the highest of hopes. The camera appears to be amazing in every way upon delivery and installation. However minutes after starting the camera it rejected my microSD card. I removed the card and it was nearly too hot to hold on to. I replaced it with a different card. The exact same events followed. I tried to read the cards on my computer and they were destroyed. I exchanged the camera with Amazon. New camera brand new SD card. 5 days later the camera reported bad microSD card and shut down. I unplugged immediately. Reviewed SD card on my computer. Files were still good. SURPRISE!!! one must purchase an app to read the video codec. $.99 for a codec that due to failed camera can not be used. At least the SD card is not damaged. 70mai tech support is useless to say the least 2 day response time as you are dealing with tech in China. 2 separate cameras same issue. Highly recommend just moving on to another product as I will be.
2,I’m a fan of these Dashcams and have several in my vehicles. But this one malfunctioned after 5 months which is unacceptable. Will not be purchasing any more 70mai products.
5,So good
5,Es una DashCam de muy buena calidad. Fácil de instalar. Las grabaciones son excelentes. Entrega en Colombia en 4 días
1,Let's start with the pros:○ Compact design○ Great image quality and very saturated picture/video○ WiFi is toggled ON on demand  keeps my phone from getting connected to dead WiFi unlike my YI dashcamNow to the cons:○ Startup and shutoff sounds are annoying minor I know○ Rear camera is difficult to install properly with hiding the wiring on a hatchback.○ BIGGEST ISSUE the camera cannot withstand any heat. If you live in hotter climate think twice about a camera with battery. I had to replace my original purchase because it damaged three microsdxc u3 cards. It records for 10-15 seconds and then it gives error. I'm down close to $50 in cards so I'm hopeful that the replacement will perform better and as it should. I don't want to think about having to undo the wiring I spent several hours running properly.
5,Works wonderfully with affordable price. User-friendly menus wifi data transfer works well. To make it clear this product doesn't come with voice command feature.
1,I installed this camera on my MB GL550. The camera turns on then suddenly off. All my 12 volt socket wouldn't work. I have 4 12 volt sockets total in my car. Fuse was burnt. I have had my old Yi dash cam and other USB charging device without any problem. So I gave it a second try couple days later. I removed all my other charging devices only have this dash cam plug in.  It worked for 5 miinutes then off again.  My fuse burt again. I wouldn't want to try it again. So I package the item back and return it.Worst of all! I got charged $17 restocking fee!  For an item that's defective? I chatted with Amazon agent. First one said the item was shipped back damaged. Second agent promised me a full refund. Third agent admitted that it was the seller that charged customer restocking fee. This was listed as PRIME item but no PRIME guarantee because it was not sold by Amazon! I wouldn't buy an item from seller who charge restocking fee for defective item!  DON'T BUY!
5,I bought this dash cam because I got hit in a parking lot.  My nephew recommended it too me as he owns the same one. He won the court case thanks to this dash cam. It was easy to install!!!! Easy to use!!!! I am loving it!!!!
5,The cameras were easy to install and video looks really good.  Great price compared to other cameras that do the same things. The app on my phone works well and easy to use. Can’t say for longevity of product but have the same brand in my Jeep for a year now. Love it thanks
5,It’s easy to hide behind the mirror if it bothers you and u can turn off the screen if it distracts you
1,This set would get to hot and quit working and turn off or just beep with a black screen until you disconnected power.Do not waste your money if you live in a hot climate.Did not even last 90 days.
2,Rear camera quit working after about 2 weeks and still won’t display image I started a return and haven’t heard back from anyone
2,For you yo have parking surveillance it ask for a cable even that the system have a internal battery  it will no allow you to set up parking surveillance.The real reason why I change to this one  I will return it now.
1,Cons: Unreliable app and wifi hotspot features. Parking mode is deceptive because you would have to hardwire it to your vehicle’s battery. Wifi/app connectivity are widespread and customer service is a pain in the ass. As a matter of fact it’s like having a conversation with someone using Chinese translated to English via google translate. So annoying. Feel free to buy this if you have the time and patience to deal with getting the device to work or if you would be happy not using the wifi/app feature at all which is like 50% of the worthwhile features.Pros: Good concept packaging all these features in one compact device.
1,Bought this camera to record any accidents and  found out it not only did not record the accident but recorded here and there. Do not buy. Have a 64 gb sd card in it and hasn’t recorded anything for the past 2 days.
3,I couldn’t be able to connect though my iPhoneit said the Wi-Fi setting is on however didn’t load on my screenso wired!
2,Updated!I have not been able to make it work I have bought several class 10 memories and none of them work for me I do not know now whether to continue buying memories or spending more money or wait for someone to answer me which is the correct memory card.——-WellFor now I just opened box and all looks very good good quality and material
2,Camera is pretty slick.  Connected as instructed validated power for ACC and power for constant hot.  When car is on it allows me to set up parking surveillance.  When car goes off the camera switch’s to parking mode.  If I turn on while off says no cable found…does turn on in parking mode but only when I hit the camera itself moving the vehicle does not trigger the camera to turn on.  Emailed vendor for support and no response.
1,The picture quality is great but the app is an absolute nightmare to use. I went to download a clip to iPhone 11 followed all the steps and settings and when the app said "downloaded to local album" I clicked local album to find the clip so I could download it to my phone but nothing was actually saved into the local album. It's empty. I have tried several times. I wouldn't recommend this dashcam because how hard it actually is to retrieve footage when you need it.
5,Have purchased a few cheaper brands...  Buy this one...  Very good product...
1,La cámara no graba cuando esta estacionado.  No hay advertencia que debe comprar un cable adicional.  Lamentablemente por está falta de información me chocaron estacionado con un costo de más de usd$5.000.  Muy inteligentes !!!  Deberían advertirlo y destacarlo!!!
2,This dash cam will burn/damage sd card. I have tried quite few new sd cards sumsang nyx San disc. None of those brand works in this dash cam.
1,Installed and fired up but could not get it connected to I-phone.  Tried multiple times to send email and get help but got none.  Poor support
5,Thank you
5,Excelente producto.
1,It’s not easy to install doesn’t come with a memory card and won’t work without it. Rear camera never worked. Bought a memory card and about 5 hours into the trip it said the card wasn’t working and need to replace. Like it was damaged or something it said. Brand new card and largest amount of memory I could buy.I’ve been so busy I haven’t had time to return it.Waste of my money and time
1,Bought this as a Xmas gift and didn't install it for 2 months. Then when the unit was fired up it kept dying. Turns out the internal battery is no good.  Confirmed that by removing the internal battery then the unit works fine except it won't remember settings without the battery.70mai does not sell the battery so I'm going to have to source one from china.Buy something else.
1,All else remain at default settings except for ADAS and Parking Surveillance mode turn on. ADAS interferes with Parking Surveillance function by making Parking Surveillance remains in record mode indefinitely until the car battery runs out instead of going into sleep mode after one minute of recording. Both ADAS and Parking Surveillance modes are the major advertised functions of the Dash Cam Pro Plus+ A500S but the device could not even run properly. Major Defect in Design.
1,During the 5 days road-trip my camera has to upgrade software twice constantly warning I didn’t connect charging cable even tho I didn’t touch it at all. I was in an accident and I wanted to get the video but I found out it didn’t record at all and it start recording right after the crash. After the first day it constantly shows my SD card is damaged even though it’s brand new it also resets my SD card twice so I ended up getting no recordings at all. My friend’s seems worked fine so I’m very disappointed
1,I'm so disappointed with this dashcam I really liked it at first but after a few weeks of use it started failing... stops recording by it self turns off by it self and I have to reset the card very often or it won't work.I don't recommend this dashcam.Do not buy!!
5,excelente producto llego antes de lo indicado
1,Installed this dash cam about three months ago and it already stops working.  I thought this was a great dash cam due to all the good reviews but I have to admit the picture quality is very good for the price and I would give it a higher rating if it would’ve last longer.  If you want a longer lasting dash cam then you should look else where.
1,Don’t record don’t work properly
1,I was super happy with this dash cam but after a month a rear camera stopped working. It is recording but not capturing an image just a black screen.Any chance I get a replacement please?
1,Rear cam didn’t work after 3 months!
1,I bought it on May it’s system always down when it’s hot outside. If it cannot resist the hot how can I use it in the summer? So don’t buy it!
1,keep getting sd card damaged messages and the device wont record. Tried two different micro sd card (samsung brand). formatted it with the dash cam. The device is not reliable for day to day recording. returned it. look for something else.
1,Rear camera records but all is black background. I need to replace.
1,I have tried different memory cards and none of them work.
1,It's a good camera of car but I bought it for ease of use and to connect to my phone. But it didn't. When I connected my phone to the camera's Wi-Fi it didn't connect the phone to the camera.
1,I was hoping I had gotten a good cam. It worked for a while then it started turning off and on all the time. More Chinese garbage for the American people!
1,This camera seems to damage the SD card for some reason I am now on my 3rd one and as of today that is damaged as well over 3 different brand all high end quality.
1,This device is always very hot.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I don't know what the problem is.  Since I installed it on my car and started recording the camera keeps restarting every minute or two and sometimes three minutes.  I tried searching in its settings but unfortunately I couldn't find anything to solve this problem.
1,I purchased a high end memory card (Samsung evo) and the camera would randomly fault on the card.  It’s GPS was extremely inaccurate.  I returned it within the time period.
1,It is easy to install. However used for three months and it stop working.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Totally a trash do not buy it. Shutdown for no reason while driving.
1,Avoid - won’t work or connect in IOS
1,My phone can’t connect the rear camera only shows the front in app. And it says my memory card was damaged.
1,when i got this package the box was not new and was repackaged and taped back together. the screen of the camera was full of fingerprints and was dirty. Extremely disappointed.
1,The rear power wire is not even close to long enough. I guess I paid for 2 cams but can only use 1
1,Need I say more?
1,The camera I received is not brand new it been used. It has scratches on it.
1,The camera looks good but I have given up trying to install. Direction tiny booklet too difficult to read.
1,It’s so loss don’t accept memory card after few mins
1,Save your money but something else
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have not been able to use it ever since I bought it…. It keeps going off & on all the time. Have not had the opportunity to even set it up.
1,What a waste of time.  Cheap ass company won't include SD card. So its useless to me. Return and never buy this brand again
1,Upon installation the USB port for the dash cam was defective and wouldn’t stay connected to power
1,Camara does not connect with the app. Emailed the customer service twice now and no response.
1,It does not work.  No funciona.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM AND FROM THIS SELLER.
5,I spent a lot of time watching reviews on Dash Cameras before I decided to purchase the 70mai Dash Cam Pro . The 70mai got a lot of good reviews but you never know what you are going to get with these dash cam companies. My wifes car has the Vifo dash camera so I had another dual 1080p camera to compare it to and the 70mai blows it out of the water.The biggest win this camera has is the form factor. What I wanted most out of a dash camera was something I could hide out of the way while also having great video quality. This camera meets both of those needs without any compromises.For me I didn't need / want all the features nor want to pay extra to get parking mode lane departure etc. All i was concerned about was its video quality and if it would work reliably. I struggled and was tempted to purchase a higher resolution dash cam but realized that I just wanted a very simple small and reliable dash cam that I can place in my car and forget about it.After receiving the 70mai I was extremely pleased with the video quality. I wish it had a capacitor instead of a battery to be able to handle the heat during the summers but I haven't had any issues so far. Just make sure you keep it out of the direct sun and I think it will be fine.The one negative i did find with the camera is the app. I really didn't like that it needed access to all my phone information as who knows what its doing with that in china but you do have the ability to setup this and use it without the app if you use the local buttons on the camera. I ended up skipping the app and programming everything locally.Overall im extremely impressed with this camera and im considering buying another one of these for my wife's car to replace her VIFO.
4,La instalación en general es muy fácil y rápida trae las herramientas y accesorios necesarias para hacer una correcta instalación. El único problema que tuve fue la vinculación con un dispositivo iPhone 7 pues aunque se conecte a la misma RED de la cámara no se refleja un estado óptimo para su uso se realizó diferentes pruebas y en diferentes ocasiones y no se pudo vincular el dispositivo.
1,1st 2nd and 3rd don't waste your money on this camera. While the picture quality is good and it's easy to install the problem is in the software. Within 3 days of installing it I got an error message saying the SD card was damaged and needed to be replaced. First I tested the card on 2 laptops and found the card to be working fine. Next I tried a brand new SD card with greater memory AND speed. When I installed that one the camera told me the card's quality was too low even though it was higher in both capacities. I'm sending this one back to the manufacturer knowing full well they will give me every excuse in the book not to refund my money. And it wasn't cheap. In short this is a product made for foreigners who typically don't complain about garbage merchandise or who don't want the hassle of dealing with a Chinese company. Spend a bit more on a more reputable company and product.
1,This was a gift to me but unfortunately right out of the box the camera buttons would stick and not work making setting up the camera impossible. Also the beeps and sounds it makes are very loud and sharp. I'm extremely disappointed.  Back in the box it goes... Worst Christmas present this year.
5,I own three of these. I hard wired them without any problem. Both the front and rear cameras have good quality video but can’t compare to others because these are the first dash cams I’ve ever owned. Now for the bad part. It took a while to connect it to my phone. I kept trying and could not get the verification to show up on the dash cam to allow the phone to connect to it. I searched online for days before figuring it out. On the iPhone you have to allow gps and data connection to the app at all times before you can connect to the dash cam. I had it set to use gps only when the app was open. Other than that great camera. Easy to access videos on your phone.
4,Plastic film provided for mounting is super easy to use easy to remove yet very secure attachment.The only complaint is that the alert volume is too high even at the lowest setting.
5,this is much better than older versions with single camera easy installation and long enough cable connection between cameras but power cable is little short to run to middle console that left me with no option but to use an extension cord witch i don't like .previously i bought to cameras for front and back of my car by those cameras need two memory cards and you cant control them simultaneously on phone app but this version done a lot better job this one has GPS built in but older versions need to have GPS module separately.overall 70mai  done fantastic job on their dash cams no matter what's the model tombs up for the quality and user interface .
5,parking mode not working after connecting hardwire kit for same company. software saying. no cable for parking mode.but working non stop parkt. have power for parking mode .they have to fix software. or i have to return.update. that was wiring problem on parking mode. great camera. front and rear.
5,I love how the road looks when reviewing the videos on my computer. It is a quality product that is definitely worth the price. Installation instructions could be a little clearer - the clear plastic pieces that came with it for installation did not work so I just removed the adhesive on the back of the camera and stuck it on the inside of my windshield. When I tried to install the app by scanning the QR code that came in the box I got an error message that it cannot work in my country. One of my friends who has one said he just searched for the 70mai app in Google playstore and it worked for him so I will try that. Overall I am pleased with my purchase.
5,I have this installed in my jeep. Works exactly as advertised. My ONLY small complaint is that it's hard to see the black-on-black button to switch to rear facing. After a dozen times my finger knows where to push (when I am driving). Highly recommend.
4,The camera seems to have decent quality do not update the firmware cause the WiFi range will be much shorter.
5,Very easy to install and so far works perfectly. Nice quality. Print is small but online instructions much easier
5,Buena cámara se adapta bien al coche
4,Was not had to install. Little difficulty setting up parameters due to sloped screen after installing on windshield. Some setting not explained in the manual. Upgrade has been a total bi_ch installing and making it work. Techie daughter had to help with upgrade. Love rear camera views.
1,Overall is not satisfied from what I paid for ($90) the angle view is ok but not wide enough for me. I do expected vdo quality a little bit better than 1080p due to 2.7K ultra full HD but it’s about the same I still can’t see car tag. ADAS system is useless it’s not accurate i have to turn it off.Spend a little bit more money to get better quality it’s very important when you do need a evidence.
5,the front camera is perfect but the rear is fare and there is a problem with high temperature the camera is turned off but after cool down you can turn it on manually
5,Calidad excelente y muy fácil de instalar
5,I love product with one exception. I wish in description I had been told I would have to order parking surveillance mode cable separately. I had the 70mai without rear view and it worked fine in parking surveillance mode without such a cable. Otherwise excellent dash cam to own. ADAS system works very well. Rear view A OK.
5,Like I expected
4,Nice picture quality
5,I have used 5 dash cam before and this is the one with best quality e.g  I cut the wire open and found out the wire is made of solid gauge of material instead of cheap slim cooper hair. Interface is friendly. The reminder sound is a little bit loud but you can turn it off
5,Muy buen producto
5,Clear picture and easy installation.
5,Easy to install and good quality.
5,We have been using this brand for several years now.  There are no complaints.  Great product durable easy to use and install.  Reliable.
5,I think this is the best dash cam. High quality video image easy to install just need some patient to install in the car very easy to control and smart ADA
5,Has dual channel camera support. Easy setup.Has a built in GPS a plus and can track your speed just in case a corrupt poly officer pulls you over.
5,The image is far clearer comparing to my other branded dash cam. Considering the price this is a great buy!
5,This camera was very easy to install. Seems to work great so far.
5,Worth 5Worth 5 stars
5,Ergonomic design high res. They give a spare film to stick to the window but i wish there is more or if they sell separately.
5,Works great easy to set up good app easy to update firmware.Feels and looks very well build all you need is a 128gb micro sd card.
5,I hired someone to install it. Other than that great dashcam for the price!
5,Interesante facil de instalar...La calidad de la imagen mejor de la que esperaba..El producto cumple con lo que promete....LO MALO-La dashcam posterior tiene un angulo que para ciertos parabrisas hace imposible que queden en un punto adecuado para grabar... concretamente mi C200-No tiene modo centinela como dice la publicación....
1,Amazon recommended this product to me when I bought the '70mai Dash Cam Pro Plus' (it's a great camera) it feels with quality materials good picture but it doesn't work with that GPS module it can't fit with the camera. Read well the model of dash cam you are going to buy to make it work with that module.
5,Only price is good when is on sale
5,Great quality for the price. I was surprised on how good it got the video. I recommend
5,Nice.
4,La cámara está excelente la calidad de la frontal también fácil de usar funciona excelente pero la camara trasera tiene mala calidad apesar de ser fulll HD no se distinguen las placas la app no funciona bien solo puedes ver la camara frontal una vez que entras a ver videos se suspende la grabación
4,Todo iba bien las primeras semanas buena calidad de imagen en la cámara delantera adecuado el uso de GPS para ver el recorrido del vehículo la camara trasera no tan buena pero cumple su función pero recientemente a un mes y medio de adquirirla estoy notando que cuando se calienta mucho se apaga y deja de grabar eso es molesto por que hay que esperar a que se enfríe y vuelva a prender que mal por eso apenas note que si no conecto la cámara trasera tarda mas en calentarse ya apagarse.
4,Se tarda en reproducir un vídeo desde el celular aún necesitan mejorar esa parte lo demás está exelente la dejé en el estacionamiento con una pila portátil y se mantuvo grabando todo el tiempo aún no descubro cómo apagar la luz verde y la pantalla cuando está encendida (en la mayoría de lugares es preferible que no sepan que estás grabando)
1,No funciona no lo pidan lo tuve que devolver
5,Excelente imagen no distorsiona con los defectos del camino soporta memorias de 128gb
4,Funciona muy bien tiene gran ángulo de grabación ambas cámaras funcionan como deberían. Califico con 4 estrellas porque en ocasiones he dejado la cámara colocada mientras el auto se encuentra en un estacionamiento sin techo durante periodos de 1 hora al regresar y comenzar el camino a mi siguiente destino se apaga después de unos minutos y hay que volverla a prender manualmente. Es raro porque hemos hecho viajes largos durante días muy soleados y no falla pero si se queda un rato apagada al sol después es cuando presenta esa falla.
5,Es muy buen producto que me ha funcionado muy bien en las dos semanas pasadas que llevo de uso cotidiano su interfaz es facil de usar y es facil de instalar.
1,I was brought front and rear camera. After I got for a weeks. They adjust price for rear only need add about 30dollars I was spending too much for rear cameras. Not worth
3,me encanto el producto su calidad y presentación pero la aplicación para wifi no funciona y la descargue en 3 celulares apple de diferente versión fue imposible de configurar compre una memoria clase 10 y en la configuración y uso previo para ver su funcionamiento e instalar no se por que razón me la quemo y por mas que intente borrar y recuperar ya no funciono.....me quede con la ilusión de utilizar esta camara y me ilusione mucho por que vi muchos videos y funcionaba bien...en la aplicación dice que desde la actualización del IOS de 2021 falla el proceso de conexión ......a mi no me dejo ni verla en el celular
5,Excelente producto justo lo que esperaba y llegó antes de lo indicado por UPS
5,Buena cámara pantalla chica pero no es necesaria si se maneja doble cámara y buen material
5,Esto deberia de ser obligatorio
5,Son excelentes y cumplen con su objetivo tiene buena nitidez
5,Ya había probado varias dashcam y la verdad esta me sorprendio ya que su calidad es muy buena la recomiendo.
5,Es un buen producto de muy buena calidad. Lo recomiendo mucho. El único inconveniente es que cuando detecta varias vibraciones fuertes seguidas se desconfigura el horario.
2,Funciona muy bien pero si está mucho tiempo expuesta al sol presenta fallas hay que quitarla para que si le de el sol directo.
5,Excelente producto no se arrepentirán el mejor costo beneficioCumple con creces
5,La cámara se siente de buenos materiales muy fácil de configurar y la calidad de video es muy buena.
4,Great little camera for the price.
5,Awesome dashcam with a lot of functions. Nice design and the app is easy to connected. Stay tuned for a review after using
