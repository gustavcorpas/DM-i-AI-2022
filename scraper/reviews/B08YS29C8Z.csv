5,I was very pleased with the product. It is exactly what I needed for my office.
5,Good quality
5,I love the touchscreen. It is easy to jump between screens
5,This is a high quality monitor. There are certainly better out there but this is just a really good monitor. The end user is very happy. Due to crazy market prices at the time of this purchase the 27" version was actually cheaper than the 24" version. Shrug.
4,Only thing wish it had a camera
4,Good monitor. A little too bright but you can adjust it.
5,the screen's quality is very good
5,Gives you the ability to adjust direction and height easily. Have two now and like them both
5,This monitor is great - we have 3 of them now.  Very bright crystal clear and the stand / swivel is the best.  Truly a great work monitor
5,Worked for what we needed.
5,This quality is great.  No problems hooking it up.
5,Great addition
5,Perfect for the office
2,Gave it two stars because it has no camera or speaker. Guess I should‚Äôve had my husband order it. What a look of disappointment on his face when he said I chose this one ü§£ü§£ü§£
1,So you have to make extra purchase in order to connect to Mac because there aren‚Äôt needed cables for Mac
1,Monitor audio doesn't work with a macbook so if you need sound then don't get this product.
1,This is MUCH smaller than a 27 inch curved monitor that I bought a few weeks ago setup was easy but it's TINY!
1,Faltan partes
4,I bought this directly off the Dell website. The actual monitor quality is great. However I added this detail. The monitor did not come with an HDMI cable to plug into my Dell laptop but came with multiple other cables. When I tried to talk to Dell customer service (not Amazon) about it I was transferred between 4 different people. That was not a good experience. When they asked me to write a review and I gave that feedback Dell said: ‚Äú Thank you for your feedback. Unfortunately the review you submitted does not meet our website guidelines. We hope to share your comments in the future.‚Äù Ok Dell‚Ä¶
4,Great monitor for my wife's work purpose! She works in label print and design and this has a great picture quality for QC'ing her projects!
5,light  easy to adjust color and brightness to suit. swivel left & right tilt forward & backward can adjust up and down as well.. a number of USB ports too. will need addiitional cable.
