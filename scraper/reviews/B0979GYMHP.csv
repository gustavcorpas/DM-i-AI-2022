rating,review
5,A lot of people are review bombing graphics cards right now and don't understand that prices are only high because of current chip shortages and a whole slue of different factors. So ignore those reviews where they only whine about the price those aren't relevant or helpful.I was fortunate to grab this while it was on sale for $869 (31% off its original price). That's my recommendation for buying a graphics card these days wait for something to go on sale and buy it (anything that is more than 15% off is generally a great deal).I've been running this card for about 2 weeks now and it has been performing amazing. I have this card running with an AMD Ryzen 7 3800x 8 core processor and it handles it very well. I've been playing games like GTA and Rainbow Six Siege on max settings and it only uses about 8 GB/ 12 GB and gives me a constant 144 frames per second on my 144 hz monitor. It's normal operating temp for me is about 63° C and bumps up some when playing graphic intense games. I've seen other reviews here that said their card was running overheated but that could largely be their own fault if they don't have good air flow through the case or various other things.If you do purchase this card you can register it on EVGA's website so if it does malfunction or break within 3 years of purchasing you can ship it to them and they will fix it for you.So far so good with this graphics card hopefully wont need to upgrade for a while now.
4,Let's all be honest.  You're not buying a GTX 3080ti because you want to get the "best bang for the buck."  This card is NOT a good value; it's severe diminishing returns.  This is one of the most expensive cards available and its performance shows.3D card prices have been skyrocketing ever since Web3 and crypto became a thing.  Finally prices dropped down to a bearable level and I made the purchase for a nice upgrade from my 1080ti.This particular card seated perfectly for me no trouble with adding the extra power cables that 3D cards require.  Card is nearly the same dimensions as the old evga gxt 1080ti so zero space issues either.  For smaller cases be VERY cognizant of card dimensions this card is a BEAST.Card at 80% use (locked 144 fps in Cyberpunk max settings at 1080 no drops? NICE) fans are still quiet through my case. I never noticed a difference.Had issues in Win10 with drivers had to do some finicky nonsense in safe mode uninstalling all nvidia software and then reinstalling reference drivers.  I had serious massive FPS gains but ymmv.All in all very happy.  Was it worth it?  Probably not.  It's a 1000$ toy.  But you're not reading this because your scared of the price you want to know if this card will help your FPS and it will; if you already have the specs to take advantage of this card's greater power.
5,This card is a welcome upgrade from my EVGA GTX 1080. Handles MSFS22 at 4K Ultra with a visibly smooth framerate. 3DMark score of 16800 on a Ryzen 7 5800X with 128 GB of DDR4 @ 3600. For the price it's comfortably within the standard range of performance for this hardware despite being slighly below average for the 3080 Ti chip. You will probably get better results with the FTW3 variant of this card but it will cost you a bit more. I'm happy with the price/performance of the XC3 and it smokes my GTX 1080. It does bench hot it gets up to 86C under 3DMark bench. Hopefully this does not harm the longevity of the card. My EVGA GTX 1080 SC still works great after 5 years of moderate use so I have high hopes for my new RTX 3080 Ti XC3. I can recommend this card to the casual PC gamer. I am not an overclocker I just want fly fake planes in 4K.
5,Card runs amazingly well! It absolutely crushes games at 1440p and probably does a bang-up job at 4k. Certainly overkill for gaming at 1080p unless you're shooting for 300+ fps.The cooler could be a bit beefier. I wouldn't say the card is under-cooled but having gotten used to the oversized FTW3 Vapor-X and Strix coolers from previous cards this one falls a bit behind. In a 73F environment with fans at 100% the card will sit at 78C or 79C while in Unigen Heaven. I fully intend to water block for the card in the future (my biggest reason for getting an EVGA 3080 ti over a cheaper MSI Ventus or Zotac card) so the cooler being mediocre for now isn't a big issue.Feels like a pretty good value at the price point of $900 in Aug '22 but with 40 series around the corned we'll see if 4070 steals it's thunder for a few hundred dollars less or not.
5,I'm using an older motherboard and this GPU doubles my old GTX970 benchmark without overclocking and using a PCIe 2.0 interface when it is PCIe 4.0. I am extremely happy with this card however just after buying Amazon sent an advertisement for an RTX 3090 for the same price (around $1K with tax and shipping). With the RTX 4000s coming out soon (currently Sep 10 2022) you may be able to get this for significantly less but I think it's a good value in the $800- $999 or below price range.
5,I purchase this GPU because EVGA is no longer making GPUs. RIP EVGA and I love your product so much keep up the good work.
5,Full hash KR RTX card EVGA quality and finest support very reasonable price. Why XC3 and not FTW3? XC3 takes less slots and has the same real performance and as my gaming workstations are stuffed with different expansion cards and NVMe adapters there will be more space inside and better cooling as well.
5,I'm coming from a gigabte aorus 2080 I know i'm late the the 3080 party with the 40 series coming up and what not.Love it it fits much nicer is much cleaner of a look with no gpu droop because of it being smaller and lighter and it performs how I was expecting a 3080 ti too with 1440p gaming and rtx on. No regret with buying before the 40 series came out. Was gonna wait happy I didn't.
5,It easily handles any game I've played just fine so far (as a lay gamer). I'm outputting dual-4k with no issue whatsoever.
5,Pairs well with an EK waterblock. The air cooler is bulky like most other 30series cards so you may want a support. I’ve been running games at max graphics setting and have hit a max of 75% card utilization. Running with a Ryzen 7 5700x in a custom loop.
4,performs as expected. handles VR and rendering well.
5,It works great I went from 1080ti to 3080ti it was a big defense went from 80 farms on COD to 140 farms.
5,What’s more to say? This card handles everything that I throw at it like a champ. It’s pretty hard not to call the 3080 Ti the best bargain in PC gaming for this price point and they’re still dropping in price. In conclusion I am a very happy customer as this is a nice upgrade from the GTX 1060.
5,Runs A little hot but I guess most EVGA GPUs do according to research. Works perfectly in my rig. No issues yet.
5,I was looking at reviews and I wanted to set a few things straight This is a 3080 TI not a 3080. The MSRP for a 3080 is 700 while the MSRP for a 3080 TI is 1200. So with that being said this GPU is being sold at 1363 Dollars which is a great deal. Why did I have to bring that up well we got people who do not know the difference between the two and are saying this is double the price.......  Now some draw backs on the card I have noticed depending on what game you are playing the fans do terrible and let the card get hot enough Burn an egg. example RunesScape "not the old one but the new one" that can run on a GT 710 with ease put the thermals over 80 C?!?!?!? to fix this I had to install MSI afterburner to manually set the fan speeds. Seems like a problem on EVGA's maybe? besides fans not kicking in when they should this card works great. Also I am running Windows 11 Pro with the latest updates not that gosh darn preview version. Last thing I promise  I noticed a review on someone saying something about  artifacting that could be caused by the card overheating I have a feeling if that person just manually sets the temps so the fan kicks on then they will be fineeee. Hope my Review on this card helps other Gamer's or Gaahhhh Miners. Cant believe I just said that. ENJOOYYY.
5,One of the best and cheapest RTX 3080Ti cards. Very happy with it.Well packaged original and fast shipped!
4,I’ve been waiting for 2 years for a new GPU.  Was one of the suckers who waited at launch for the 30 series and was hosed by bots and scalpers.  Noticed prices coming down so jumped on this card.  First off fan noise shouldn’t be an issue these days where most people who game have headphones on so having the silent mode at stock was somewhat confusing and I paused wondering if I had a defective card.  This was not defective just had to tweak MsI afterburner and now idle is around 45c.  I never thought I would see the day where I could play Star Citizen at 4K and get 45-69 frames anywhere.My recommendation would be to wait till prices come down even more and buy when this card is around 1300-1200 usd or lower.
5,The 3080TI are amazing cards… my 0 rating goes to Amazon for not refunding my credit card in a timely fashion. Called customer service yesterday and the excuse given was that manager approval for credits over $1000 is required. As a Prime member for over 12 years I think it’s an insult.UPDATE: Refund received thanks Amazon!!!!
1,For starters this card is a gamble. I saw the reviews demonstrating a few concerns such as poor stock voltage calibration and the potential for absolutely massive energy draw but I decided to take the plunge anyway.At $13 shy of $2000 shipped this was a mistake. After a year of waiting to even find one of these in stock on amazon or any other online retailer I thought I was about to experience 200 fps 4K gaming and whiz-bang benchmark scores to measure against everyone else's e-pen. Instead I removed the EVGA box from the packaging and noticed the Amazon box was immaculate but the EVGA box had a dented corner. No matter; I removed the old 1070 plugged the 3080 ti in to my Seasonic X-850 and the rest of my Ryzen system and started the system. Desktop was reached loaded up the freshest nvidia drivers and finally started a game.Doom Eternal was just the game. I cranked all the settings to Ultra-nightmare enabled RTX effects and loaded up the Super Gore Nest.I looked EXCELLENT for about 10 minutes--at which point the game began to experience visual artifacting such as strange interlacing-looking problems and a picture-in-picture look where the HUD showed across the entire screen but the gameplay was confined to a tiny quarter of the screen on an otherwise black box. Flickering was rampant. My secondary HDMI monitor also cut out intermittently.I thought perhaps that the card was running too hot. Afterall it's the smallest 3080 ti on the market without a reference cooler. All others appear to be 2.8-3-slot designs whereas this is just shy of 2.5.Maybe I'd try an easier game to run: GTAV. Maxed out I easily achieved 100+ fps-- for about 10 minutes. It appeared every game I tried would crash to desktop or experience severe visual artifacting. Time to reduce the voltage!I followed the steps shown on many youtube channels to reduce power draw and increase card longevity and still no dice. HWMonitor showed powerdraws of 180-450W fluctuating RAPIDLY during gameplay. This should NEVER be the case and I'd attribute this for the 1-star review.After only 1 week's use my system refused to POST. It turned off one last time killing the motherboard a MSI B450. All the other parts of the system including the power supply have been since reconstructed after a motherboard replacement and are working as they had before. The 3080 ti was tested in a second system and when the same initial problems arose (crashing instability) I quickly removed it. Not worth destroying a second system.So here's the kicker: the card cost almost $2000 on Amazon but only $1199 from EVGA at the time of posting. Despite much back and forth over the cost of returning Etech makes no effort to rectify this issue and instead continues to focus on whether or not the card is defective always dodging my questions and never addressing any of my concerns.For the last 3 weeks I've been sitting with roughly $3.5K in parts $1.5K of which I only got back up and running on 10-23. Now should I RMA the card to EVGA and get a used card only worth $1199 new? Or do I return the card to Etech and have them take a $400+ cut of $2000? Quite the pickle and I wish everyone luck on their gamble because that's what you'll get here: poor packaging price gouging and a guarantee to be gouged harder when it fails.Wait longer and let these poorly designed over-marketed power gulping fire-breathing dragons be forgotten. I know I'll have trouble forgetting how bad this experience was and continues to be. If you want to give over $800 away buy this card!
2,Look I'm just like every other "gamer" out there right now trying to get their hands on a high end card. I opted for this one after seeing the price looking for reviews on YouTube and searching throughout the various sites on Google. After HOURS of extensive research I've determined that this card while it does what it says it does practically doesn't exist.Go ahead try and find a video review of this card and not the FTW from top channels like Linus. You'll find the 3080 videos but not the TI. This card is like a ghost and it's kind of sketchy.Hell I even looked it up on Best Buy by "EVGA 3080 TI" and only got the FTW. I had to specifically search for the XC3 to get it.In my opinion I wouldn't get this card. While it does what it says it does it burns quite hot for a sub-par performance. My Founders Edition 3070 was actually performing with more stable frame rates AND at a cooler temp.Pay a smidge more for the FTW if anything at all. I can't in confidence recommend this card.
2,This model probably exists to consolidate lower-binned parts. I recommend skipping it.There's not much room to overclock because this card is power-limited. Spec'd for 350W that's a full 100W below EVGA's FTW3 and both are the same GPU. Multiple anecdotes online of folks unable to get near 350W from this card (seems like 320W is a hidden limit).It could handle the heat to overclock further despite the okayish cooler but power is the limit. The problem is that this seems like the power and cooling solutions for a 3070/3070ti was slobbed onto lower-tier GPU and memory for a 3080ti and sold in the waning twilight of 2020-2022's "they'll by anything" seller's market and mentalities.Finally a good indication of the low value of this card is that the touted full metal backplate doesn't contact anything to help cool. There are no thermal pads on the back of the pcb so it doesn't matter if it's full metal or plastic; it's a ploy that fails to elevate this dissapointing card.
4,La GPU está muy bien por parte de EVGA funciona perfectamente por un precio dentro del recomendado aún en la escasez. No le pongo 5 estrellas solo por un tema: Es el enfriamiento XC3 no es robusto apenas 2 slots para una RTX 3080 TI y llega temperaturas de 85 grados Celcius. En conclusión es la mejor alternativa hoy por hoy costo - beneficio.
5,I don't usually write reviews; however this deserves one for sure. I placed my order on a Thursday night around 10:00PM EST. I received update Friday that my package was shipped and expected delivery was Wednesday of the following week. My Item arrived on Monday 2 days EARLY!! This was a great experience. Also the Item was the coveted 3080Ti!! THANK YOU Custom Hardware!!! I only gave it 3 stars for Value for the money because still higher than MSRP otherwise great customer experience and great card!
5,Great GPU. While I wish the price wasn’t so steep but I completely understand the current GPU market is trash anyway seller had super fast shipping and packed it nice and safe arrived in perfect condition. Can handle anything and everything I throw at it ray tracing and all the bells and whistles perform great. Recommend downloading the evga X1 program on your computer to change the color of the lights on the card itself. And you can also manage fans and what not.
1,Purchased this card after similar waiting periods of other people two years. Card worked for apx 24 hours then stopped POSTing. Tested using 2x Ryzen 3600x systems 2 different power supplies completely different chipsets still does not work. I've read every review where the experiences were both good and bad. Card finally came in stock so I took the plunge.Worked wonderfully for about 24 hours then computer shut itself off. No power no diagnostic LEDs nothing. Purchased new 850w power supply (also EVGA to potentially replace ANOTHER EVGA 850w PSU) and it does not work at all still. Moved card to second computer in the house (which is currently housing a 2080) still no life.Swapped back to my old 1080 and computer works wonderfully no boot problems no POST problems just massively diminished graphics settings.Disappointed doesn't really cover the gamut of feelings I'm feeling right now. 2 years 1700$ a TON of wasted time that frankly I DO NOT HAVE. As a business professional with a very limited amount of time I buy the best that I can afford sometimes sacrificing money in place of time - because it's the same thing. Time and money.System specs - (Primary Computer)Ryzen 5 3600 (yep I know it bottlenecks a bit)32gb DDR4 3200EVGA 850BQ + EVGA 850GQ (gq is only an hour old and works fine)MPG X570 Gaming Edge WifiKraken 180mm Cooling SolutionSecond Computer (Also tested on)Ryzen 5 3600x15gb DDR3200Gigabyte GA-AX 370m-dsw3h-ds3hEVGA 850GQStock CoolerThere are many reports of mixed reviews of this specific card - lots of good and lots of bad. The bad seems to be related to CSM-UEFI booting as well as specific boot drive formats some people can't get a video signal out of the DP 1.2 and only works on HDMI. I do not have this problem it simply doesn't work anymore. When power supply is unplugged then plugged back in - fans kick on for a split second then nothing.First EVGA gpu I've ever had and the first I've been able to find (in the last 2 years) in quite some time. NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE and will likely affect future purchases. I have a massive amount of respect for EVGA as they cater to the enthusiast and took measures to limit scalper purchases/sales during the GPUocallypse which likely allowed many people to purchase for MSRP what would have been 2x - 3x the cost  based on suppy/demand. None of that really matters if the card doesn't work.Will exchange for same card as I have faith in EVGA as a company but unlikely to recommend as my experience was not a good one.
5,good gaming ? good price
5,Ordered two days ago from Computer Upgrade King on Amazon and it was here quick! Was brand new as described and was packaged very well and cared for. I'm glad I waited for price to go down. Still a hundred and some change more than msrp but better that paying $2000 for it like it was months ago.
3,This video card worked great for 3 hours. Turned off the computer for the night tried to start it up the next day and the card caused the motherboard to fail to POST. Working with amazon now to get a replacement.
5,Bought a 3060TI first for a new build regretted it.  Bought this no regrets and very visible difference in performance at 1440p.  Well worth it.
5,Got the product brand new for just a little over msrp and couldn’t be happier. The 3080 Ti is a beast.
4,Those who give this card any less stars are simply not b getting fair. Price of any products are demand driven in any free-market. If you think the price is unfair then don't buy. Your action will actually keep a downward pressure on the pricing. The fact of the matter there's a chip shortage it will translate directly to higher demand vs supply which will result in higher prices.This is a perfect 3080Ti with all the bells and whistles... If you need one then buy and enjoy.
5,I recently got done building a gaming rig with the 3080 Ti and let me tell you it's been a joy. I can comfortably crank my settings up to max on most games without too much of a frame drop and RTX looks stunning on the games that allow it. Minecraft is a different game with this card. I play a lot of CoD Battlefield and am trying out the new Halo and this card has everything I need to get the most out of each of those games.
5,This card is a massive improvement over my previous GTX 1070. Very fast crisp colors games like Metro Exodus are just gorgeous and run smoothly. No real complaints so far but note you will have to tweak the fan curves as the default fan settings still run the card pretty hot. Also check your setting in NVIDIA Control panel. Setting to maximum performance will leave your card drawing 120W power on idle. I wish the card were cheaper but that's really just the laws of supply and demand.
5,Given the current GPU prices this is the most affordable option for amazing performance. On top of that EVGA backs it up with a great support by default of 3 years which can be extended to 10years depending on your needs.Highly recommend this card for gamers and more recently for miners (can easily be OC'ed)Obviously the price is high but the card itself is worth the money.
5,It's pretty good product & it's 100% legit
5,GPU Market as of 2/22 is still awful. If you’re gonna overpay for a card. This is the best value
1,I installed it a week after I got it and only played light weight games. I booted up FF7 remake on Steam. and thne first 5 hours it worked good.  This wasnt a 5 hour straight session it was a jump on real quick for an hour.  or 2 on the weekends.  I jumped on yesterday and 30 minutes in my whole system powered off.I removed the GPU and noticed it powered on with my old 3070. I thought maybe the motherboard and power supply cant handle it. Went out  upgraded from a 750 W to 1000W PSU and bought a better motherboard for my 3800x. Still nothing came on. Put my 3070 and everything came back fine.  It literally died a day before the final return date. I will be returning it tomorrow since UPS is closed.
5,nice cardgood pricegood customer service
4,Even though scalping is a problem rn its is a legit 3080 ti. inflation sucks but it is what it is.
5,Despite the prices it is a great card. Don’t buy it if it isn’t worth it for you though.
1,This is literally my first Amazon review and I thought it important to let people know how my experience was. First and foremost I bet we can all agree on how disappointing the current market price for graphics cards is. Anyways I bit the bullet and purchased this 3080ti from this seller and upon arrival the box had shown signs of being previously opened. I put the card in a brand new motherboard and did all my necessary installments. About 4 days into my enjoyment my screen went blank (only Microsoft word was open mind you no hardcore gaming no overclocking etc.) I shut her down and restarted.I ran through diagnostics and found the card wouldn’t work or register with any other motherboards or monitors. For the record I did put in different graphics cards to see if I can rule out the 3080ti but unfortunately they worked. I tried everything. The card was just dead. 2k well spent.
1,Unfortunately just two days before the 30 day mark of having this card the far left fan had failed. This is by no means the sellers fault as its an issue with the card. The card was shipped properly and quickly. Although I would take a look at getting a different model of a 3080ti card. It is surprising to me that in 28 days of having this card in my PC that the smell of burning electronics and a faulty fan have already happened.In the images attached you can see FAN 1 running between 100-200 RPM and it may not even work at all when the other fans are running. It also makes a really loud clicking noise ever since I smelt the burning and issue with the fan not being able to operate to its full capacity.
1,Don’t trust the third party seller I got this from the card is great gaming wise but 2 fans blew out in less than a month and I cleaned it daily I tried the warranty and calling them and they were rude and we’re being very shady I’m just gonna water cool the card and make it better since it still runs good even with one fan since it’s a 3080ti but it still over heats a lot and I’d like to be able to overclock and keep the card healthy but the third party seller is being scummy and unless you have extra money to do that don’t buy anything from them
5,Perfect card
5,overpriced
5,Works great runs a little warm but that is expected from the xc3 series. All in all I am happy
5,Wohoo. The most powerful card ever. Can't wait to try it. Will update soon.
5,Expensive but it's legit
1,GPU is undetectable by device manager or Geforce software. I never ha such as issue attempting to install a 3080. The seller than refuses to replace it using the excuse of the return window. I didn’t open the product and try to install it until a month later after purchase since i was waiting on other hardware for it
2,the product is over priced.
1,Fast shopping and decent product. The card was already overpriced by nvidia and now its really really overpriced.
5,Cost and Gaming Performance:$500 more than a 3 fan 3080 and gets about 10%-15% better performance. $300-$500 less than 3090 with only 1%-3% worse performance. Get the 3080 for best price for performance. Get this is you want to spend for money for more performance. Get 3090 only if you know how to/will use the 24GB of memory.Features:Access to EVGA precision x1 tool is great. Custom fan curve for better cooling with increase sound. Default is near silent with 80 degrees C  90% fan speed at max load gets around 70 degrees C. Easy to use overlock and monitoring tools all there.
1,This card is listed for more than double its MSRP.
1,Nice price gouging
5,I got exactly what I ordered and I ordered the quicker shipping option and got it a day before it was projected to arrive. No complaints. Oh and it’s a beast. Runs BF 2042 on Ultra settings no problem whereas my Radeon VII would crash on any setting. GeForce all the way.
5,Despite the fact my gpu died I couldn't recommend this more. Compared to all the other gpus out there at the moment I think this has the biggest bang for buck. It pumps out frames in any title to meet your smooth max graphics needs it warms up your room when your dad turns up the ac just a little too much and it's a little bit more modest at guzzling all your power compared to the higher end cards. Though i did just get a 3090. It was just 70 over what I originally got this for and maybe the death is just a 3080 ti thing.  The thing that tops it all off though is the customer service. They only responded on week days but they were very polite concise and despite my return window closing they went through with helping me with a full refund anyways. It's a massive relief knowing you can rely on these guys if something goes wrong in the card which you had no control over. The customer service agents who helped me were Brian and Daniel. Thank you guys again.
5,Except for the obvious price issue the card delivers in every other way.... easy to install and configure... great frame rates (I do primarily flight sims) beautiful visuals.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quick shipping and great service from this 3rd party vendor.  I am very skeptical of 3rd party vendors but I did some research and it paid off... they delivered as advertised and I would highly recommend this vendor and card if you can get past the price issue.
5,This card is FAST and with 12 gig memory i can run all my games in high/ultra settings. Install is easy and quick.
5,This is a pretty solid card. I put a mild undervolt on it and it is running beautifully. This might not be the most powerful option out there but is pretty solid once dialed in. I'm running an average of 70 degrees which is pretty nice. I payed a little more then I wanted but was glad to be able to update my system with this card. The card arrived quickly and in new condition.
5,Does the job
5,Tutto Perfetto
1,Es la segunda tarjeta en menos de dos meses a la que le falla lo mismo uno de los ventiladores!Y por estos precios bochornoso.
