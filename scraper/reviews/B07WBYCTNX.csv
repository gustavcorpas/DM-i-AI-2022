5,I always carry it with me it is light super easy to use and has a case! I even didn’t know how much I need it before I bought! Do not hesitate to buy it.
5,from previous reviews I wasnt expecting much but it is actually a pretty nice laptop stand it folds into itself so it fits nicely in my laptop bag and it ezpands pretty wide so you can use it for a laptop or even a iPad. I work from home and once I week I need to go into the office so it’s important for me to able to travel with me laptop but also have things that my 8 hour shift comfortable at work this laptop stand does just that
5,I love the portability of my laptop but hate the ergonomics of it.  The screen is too low when you put it on a table the keyboard/trackpad situation just are not ideal for hands that are trained to use a mechanical keyboard and actual mouse.  A while ago I invested in a more portable mechanical keyboard that I could stuff in my backpack and carry with me when I have to go into the office or work from the car dealership.  But that left me with the laptop screen being too low.This stand works great for my needs.  The stand folds up nice and small and has a cloth bag for storage.  It's also pretty light.  It elevates the screen somewhere close to where I need it to be to not have a sore neck.  It keeps the keyboard and fingerprint sensor out in the open so if I need to to use them I can.All in all I'm very happy with this little stand.
5,is an article that allows to have the laptop in the right position besides being able to regulate the position and leave it to the measure of the need.
5,I have two.  I use it for working at home and travel.  At home I am currently using a Thinkpad and for travel I use a Surface.  Both devices sit comfortably on the stand.  The stand is quite sturdy with pads on the bottom of the legs to keep it from moving on almost every surface.I strain less reading my laptop screens.  Added benefit was the reposition for better camera placement during Zoom calls.  The stand folds easily for travel.
5,Great portable stand
5,I bought this stand for a new gaming laptop to try to help ensure good airflow. Most of the time it doesn't move from my desk at home but it is lightweight and compact enough to make travel a breeze.At home I use it on the highest setting which aligns the top of the screen to the top of my 27-inch monitor. The non-slip pads on the feet the arm bars (where the laptop sits on) and the lips at the end really help to prevent the laptop from falling over from accidental bumps. I've also found that the height of the pads on the top are just enough that I can use velcro straps in the gaps between them to secure my cabling and help prevent impedence of air flow.Since it is a gaming laptop it is larger and heavier that a typical laptop would be but the sturdiness of the build and the stability provided by both the width and the non-slip pads ease any concerns I might have of placing my laptop on it.I did not rate the ergonomics as 99% of the time I use an external keyboard and mouse. I am 6' tall and at the highest setting it puts the top of the screen right at eye level.
5,Works just find
4,It’s very easy to use and has many adjustable height. It could be prefect if it become wider when unfolding.
4,"I like it it's a nice addition to my laptop & kit.  The first one I bought was not very good it started coming apart & the rubber pads wouldn't stay in place the way the front of the ends were made I added a small screw to each side to keep my laptop from sliding off.  This one is really good & it works much better.  My laptop is a refurb it's about 8 ears old & it's heavy.  So for this little stand to hold it & not wobble or let my laptop move around is good.
