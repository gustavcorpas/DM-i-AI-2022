rating,review
5,I bought these so i could plug in the plug in coolers i got for my car inside the house. These work well I've used these for plugging in the coolers and even for the usb chargers that are car jack set up. This is great. I'd reccomend these to anyone who has car plug things and wants to plug them inside
5,The title gives it all away. No complaints here. Good product. Would buy again!
4,This will fit my needs well but is very heavy.  The attachments are secure but hard to push in initially.  I thought it was defective at first but my husband pushed the connecter in harder and all works.  If you have weak wrists like me watch out for this.  Cord legnth is great.
4,I bought this because I was tired of using my big tank compressor - and needed a DC/AC converter for my portable compressor. Well I have 2 portable compressors and tried each one with this converter. One would work fine the other would turn off as soon as it tried to push air into the car's tire (but it would stay on if it was just turned on but not connected to the tire). Well it seems like cigarette lights use a 15amp plug and one of the compressors needed that 15amp. The other compressor was fine with the 10amp. I ordered a different converter that said 15amp and that one worked fine with the 15amp compressor.... It was than that I noticed that this product description did say 10amp.... so just be aware of the amp rating that you are ordering.
5,The converter outputs 12.2 VDC which leads me to believe that the output is regulated. The unit is powering an ICECO cooler and it works perfectly.  The cords are very high quality and plenty long.  The blue LED power indicator is a welcome addition.  I highly recommend this product!
5,Good product little pricey
5,got this for my hot logic lunch box to use in house or break room at work. its awesome! just plug car 12 volt into 12 volt socket and plug in wall....cant live without...while traveling plug stays in trunk and i plug lunch box into cigarette lighter 12v socket.
5,My OEM battery pack I received with my GMG Daniel Boone kicked the can in 2 years.  Now don’t get me wrong I used it almost every other weekend (if not every 3rd weekend) for almost 2 years for 10-16 hour cooks.  I checked out a new one from GMG and it ran about 80 bucks.  I tossed a couple brews back found this and figured I’d give it a shot.  Everything on the OEM battery pack matched up with this battery pack.  Oddly enough even the OEM battery pack states it’s for indoor use only - I don’t know too many people that smoke meats indoors but to each their own.  Anyways for the price it’s spot on.  Will keep up with a post if it fails “too soon” but I have high hopes.
4,ok product took three tries to get it to work right. Used this on an air compressor to inflate tires. Turns out it was easier to plug the inflator into the car than use this plug into the wall in the garage.
5,Been using this full time for a while now and no issues at all.
4,I bought this to replace a converter than quit working. This is better than the one I replaced thanks mainly to it being a higher wattage.  I use it for 2 purposes to blow up pool floater and to power my 12v portable cooler. I would have given it a 5 star but I'm stingy with the stars.
5,Make sure you the power cord is fully connected in the converter box. It's a little snug. Used to power charge my jackery power bank since I lost the power cord and had the cig lighter cord left only
4,Works as stated
2,Lo compré para usar dentro de casa la aspiradora del auto y aunque dice que entrega la misma corriente que necesito no es así. La aspiradora intenta arrancar pero no recibe suficiente energía cuando se conecta a este convertidor.
5,Does not work when using to convertNo power
5,Great product
5,Great inverter works well with Colman 12v cooler
5,Do not waste your money! I purchased this to power a 12 V thermal cooler to keep drinks and snacks cool when not in my vehicle and the very first time I took this device out of the box plugged into the wall and hooked up the cooler it fried the device. Now mind you the thermal cooler is nothing but a fan that draws air across aluminum fence to cool the condensation inside the cooler. It is by no stretch of the imagination a big power troll. It would not power up or even show an indicator light. I tried several other outlets and it still did not work.  I unplugged it for 20 minutes plugged it back up still no power. Unfortunately I was outside the return policy so it went straight into the trashcan. Buyer beware of this cheap Chinese made piece of garbage.
2,Product seemed good but unfortunately it did not work on the air compressors we have to inflate our paddle boards. I was able to return. Item seemed well made and would work for other applications I’m sure.
5,Hard to contact and is easy to disconnect when I do not want it to disconnect
5,Cover my needs!
4,Be very careful if you use this P/S for extended periods of time (> 30 minutes) at more than a couple amps.  The brick will get very hot.  Otherwise it seems to be a good P/S for the money.
2,I bought this to power my 9 amp pump for my inflatable paddleboard. I got this because it claims 10 amps. When I plugged it in the pump indicated 12.1 volts. When I activated the pump voltage dropped to 10v in about a second and then it shut off. The description claims this will work for a refrigerator (which is also just a pump) but I am skeptical.
5,Worked like it should work.
5,This does the job for a fish finder I needed for 12 volts. The price was reasonable and quality looks great. Received it quickly throug h shipping.
5,In mid May 2019 the seller sent me a replacement converter with revised firmware. It works very well with the "Tire Inflator Arteck Portable 12V DC Tire Air Compressor Pump 150 PSI". The pump can run continuously without the converter getting warm. I suspect that the original firmware set the amperage limit based on resistive load but the pump is a reactive load. The change made by the seller works. The converter runs cool even without a cooling fan.Before I posted the negative feedback I tried contact the seller (ALITOVE Customer Service) through Amazon who never forwarded my message. The seller contacted me after they saw my negative feedback. It is the kind of customer service I expect and appreciate.Below is my original 1-star comment which is no longer applicable to a replacement unit I received:I purchased this power adaptor for the "Tire Inflator Arteck Portable 12V DC Tire Air Compressor Pump 150 PSI" which has a 10A power requirement. The tire pump will run only a few seconds with this ALITOVE AC to DC Converter but runs perfectly when plug into the car cigarette lighter outlet. A clear sign that this is not a 10 ampere converter.
5,Al tener varios accesorios para el auto que necesitan 12v estos no los podía usar a estar sin el auto. Esto me ahorró tener que comprar otros accesorios para 110 a 220 v.
5,I used this to power my GMRS radio base station. It doesn't take up space it performs the job and hasn't had any issues with any of the needs it is rated for. Good product.
3,Pretty sharp cuts in and out of power there isn't a way to have a constant smooth power from this converter
5,I bought 3 of these.  2 are working fine but 1 of them did not work upon arrival: blue light did not come on and no voltage on the terminal. No visible external damage. Alitove -from Chine- immediately proposed to replace the item or give me a refund.  No hassle at all.  This is what I call attention to customer satisfaction.Yes sometimes it happens that an item arrives defective but if the supplier solves it that swiftly it deserves a 5-star rating.  Especially since the other items work great !!
5,Very powerful.  Works great.
5,Needed a new converter for our electric cooler. This was just what we needed. Works great.
4,I just plug it in (my cooler for camping) a couple of hours before I go camping and I'm good to go no over heating NO problems!
5,ease of use fast ship and works
4,Great item and price
1,I purchased the converter to power an old car air compressor/pump.  I used the 110 outlet in my truck and the compressor would start stop start stop.  The compressor's actions was like a sine wave.  I tried plugging the unit into a standard wall outlet and had the same issue.  Using the air compressor/pump directly out of the vehicle's cigarette lighter outlet works fine.  So with all the good reviews I'm thinking this was just a faulty unit out of the box.  I am not going to try to exchange.
5,After several seasons (including outdoor storage) the 12 volt adapter on my Green Mountain Grill smoker died. The smoker works fine on a battery but it is so much easier to plug it in.  This adapter had the necessary connector (cigaret lighter hate them but that's what the smoker uses) and current (10A nameplate rating).  Other reviews have stated that's not a 'true' 10 A rating but the smoker only uses ~6.7A to light and only ~2A to run.  In any case it works great in this application.  (And yes I'll store it inside over winter!)
3,Because it's only 10amp it won't run a 12v tire pump you need 15amp minimum
3,I'm sure it's great to plug cigarette lighters and radar detectors into while sitting in your garage but it doesn't have the capacity to run a tire inflator which is why I bought it. I was able to steal the connector off of it and hook it up to a real power supply though.
5,EXELENTE inversion
5,Works great.
5,Just as advertised. Seems heavy duty
2,Goo
5,Thought it didn’t work at first when I pressed the A button just give it a couple seconds and also you have to press A twice for continuous run  . Pumps fast and I really like it .
5,My husband uses this for his aerating minnow cooler and he absolutely loves that he keeps his minnows alive for so long!
5,Buen producto
5,I used it on my portable cooler and coffee maker.
2,My cord came in. I ran a fridge off it for about 4 hours then it stopped providing power. After messing with it a bit I determined the car adapter socket on the power cord was flaky (moving the socket would *sometimes* cause power to flow again.I took a Dremel to the socket and sure enough the wires are barely soldered to the socket. The two wires have the smallest of solder joints one at the rear of the pin and the other on the barrel. The whole thing is incased in rubber making is unservicable to any resonable adult. Good thing I'm not reasonable. Once I have the rubber removed using my Dremel and some pliers I scratched up the metal contact points on the socket and applied a generous amount of solder. I next cut and stripped the wiring again tinted them and resoldered them. I sealed it all up with hot glue (an epoxy or something more clever could be used to insulate the now exposed socket) and now the cord is working again.tl;dr: It's a cheap cord with crap quality. You get what you pay for. If it doesn't work fix it rather than give someone more of your money.
5,Overall I'm very happy with the purchase. I use this converter to power an air pump for my motorcycle. It saves me a ton a trouble from trying to plug the pump up to another vehicle. So far it doesn't overheat and the pump performs just as well as it did when plugged into a vehicle outlet.
5,It works good if ya don't move or touch it ..Acts like it has a short at times very touchy and you have to adjust it and don't move it it works fine...Will look for another brand next time not so touchy ....Update in my review ..the company reached out to me to help with the situation of it not working properly ... I'm happy to say after plugging it in and out several times it is working without a problemng now ..I guess it was so stiff I had a problem pushing it into the brick hard enough to make a better connection ... Thank you and yes I would buy another one ..especially  from a company that backs up its products !
3,The power plug is crisp. Used 1 from an old laptop and now works great
2,I bought this to run an air pump for a stand up paddleboard.  My pump runs fine when I plug it into my car 12 volt outlet but it will not run with this.  The pump display indicates low voltage as soon as I turn the pump on and the blue light on this unit goes out.  I'm returning it for something a little beefier.
1,Bought this to power a DC pump well within specs for which this is rated.  The maximum draw on the pump is 10A (at 12v).  But this couldn't even get stage 1 going - couldn't even get to the compressor stage where there would be a greater power draw.  It'd spin the pump up for one second then die.
5,Has a higher output rating than the original converter that came with my electric Colman cooler. (Which did burn out.) So less likely to overheat and burn out. Ran cooler with this converter for 7 days non-stop with no problems. Seems to be solid construction.
5,I bought those because I sought on a popular Youtubers channel. It’s great because it has a 12 V cigarette lighter socket so you can use your mobile radio indoors easily. Cord  is nice and long and it puts out plenty of current.
5,looks and works just like the orignal.
5,This converter was used for 10 consecutive 24 hour days. The cooler stayed cold and saved much in ice and geeting rid of the water.
3,We ordered our adapter to install upon a 12v water pump to feed water to our tankless water heater which in turn heats out inflatable spa.  The unit arrived on time as expected. After checking continuity we installed to our pump. Unit works great has near a ten amp output we use 5amps off of it. After about 45 minutes we let the pump rest as we are aware we are not using the power supply nor the pump in the manner for which they were created.  Works great perfect for small projects and replacement power supply.
5,The unit get hot
5,I bought this adapter to bring my Wagan cooler indoors overnight while driving 4 days round-trip between NY and FL. The adapter fits the Wagan cooler’s car plug perfectly.  It has a long cord which is convenient especially when traveling since you don’t know where outlets will be. And even after being plugged in all night the plug was just mildly warm. Although I would have preferred it if Wagan had included the adapter with the cooler I am very happy with this purchase!
4,The fan is a bit noisy but not really intrusive.The unit doesn't easily lend itself to being restrained in a car using the car seat belt. The belt slips off the shape and smoothness of the casing.A pity the power adaptor does not allow usage on 240v AC power source (which we have at home) so we had to purchase another brand power source to do the job for when we take it home with us after our trip to the US & Canada.It works well though and we are happy with it.
4,This adapter works really well; as when I want to clean my car with a portable car vacuum and don't want to plug it directly to the car it works just as well as plugging into a wall outlet. My only gripe is that I wish the cord length was a bit longer. But overall a good product.
5,I have a vehicle vacuum that my sister got me for Christmas but I intended to use it for house use mainly to clean the dust off all the computers and this adapter allows me to do exactly that. Supply's enough power to have the vacuum work at its full potential.
5,good
5,I bought this thing so I can run my 12 volt inflator in the house. I have a hand truck with a tire that leaks and I'm too lazy to buy a new tire. The cigarette lighter adapter fits perfectly not too tight that you tear up your shoulder pulling it back out. Works fine doesn't get particularly hot.
1,If I could give it zero stars I would as I'm that much disappointed. Bought it to use specifically with a car vac for jobs outside the car and it didn't work at all. Waste of money as I cannot return it.
5,I purchased to use with a 12v car cooler/freezer.  It works just fine although I wish that the 12v receptacle was a bit deeper to engage the male plug better.  It works as is but being a EE I would design a more robust receptacle😳
5,Works really well with my pellet grill after my factory power supply died.
5,I was sorry the wires get too hot sometimes and cause a damage but so far so good working great.
4,Works very well and does not create too much heat.  However it does have a very shallow connection socket and I had to use wide electrical tape to keep the connection solid when josselled a little.
3,happy it work with my dash cam charger
4,A very useful item a must have in every garage but the AC power cord has a cheap plastic body and snapped open at the female end with two uses exposing the wiring inside. Power output was also intermittent before that. I had a spare cord  so will keep the power supply for now.
5,I needed to purchase this for my portable refrigerator / Freezer that we travel with. I forgot to pack the 12v converter that came with the unit. Got this one as it had more power output than the original. Well made and the length of the wall chord and well as the output chord are plenty long. This is a big plus that makes it easy to plug into a wall outlet and reach the refrigerator easily.I highly recommend this unit.
4,Recently purchased with other items which qualified for free 2 day shipping-Received as described. Purchased for use with a Coleman Power Chill 12volt cooler whose previous 5 amp converter quit after 2 yr. Hoping this 10 amp will have longer life. I tested out of the box for 24 hours works well. Be sure the AC cord is FIRMLY plugged into the converter side so the the indicator light is lit.
5,Edited: Excellent customer service. All issues were resolved. Would order from this manufacturer again.Previous: Plastic at connector broke and a wire shorted with less than seven days of use. Would not recommend AT ALL.
5,great deal.
5,I am using this product to power a mobile cb radio that I placed on my desk to use as a base station.  It is working great and I have no issues.  I simply plugged the cb radio's cigarette lighter style plug into this product and powered it up.
2,I got this to run a blower that draws 10A at 12v (120w).  This wouldn't even start it. Either this is underpowered for the advertised wattage rating or my blower has a higher startup amperage than the listed 10A.  It didn't work but might be fine for lower amperage needs.
4,used for car vacum
5,Value for money easy to use
5,Working good
2,This may be a good adapter for 12V devices that require a 12V automotive plug but disappointed that the 120W power adapter can't handle a 106W automotive vacuum. The vacuum starts up and then almost immediately stops. The issue may be due to the in-rush current required by the vacuum and the inability of the adapter to handle it so it is worthwhile to be aware of this issue before buying.If you have a 12V device with a motor that you want to power off of this 120W adapter double check the wattage of the device to make sure it is well below 120W to be able to handle the in-rush current. If you need more wattage look at the higher wattage adapters.
5,Bought a portable fridge and my power station has only 1 12V DC plug.  This adapter comes into play when plugging in more than 1 12V DC plug into the power station.  I've also used this to pre-cool the fridge prior to heading out to go camping.  Does the job.
5,Works great for the car.
5,I have bought many replacement power packs here and this one is one that finally works. And powers the object I bought it for. It measures 10amps and powers a car vacuum wonderfully from in the house. Thanks you.
5,The 8 year old Coleman AC adapter for my thermoelectric gave out recently. I bought this to replace it and it seems to do the job nicely! It doesn't run too hot and I've run it for several days and it seems to be fine.
1,Ordered this unit as I was looking for a decent priced low power unit that would be here quickly. This one had high star rating and for an extra $3 I could have same day. Literally within five minutes of delivery I tried  to use it and it would not turn on. Now its too late to order something else to get today.
5,I can now use this with the car vaccum I ordered from Amazon
5,I use the ac/dc adapter to get my electric cooler cold before I head out for trips in my truck.
5,It works great for times with electricity. Good for getting cooler ready for trips using in a motel and reheating foods.
5,I ruined the powerpoint and fuse block in my last vehicle using a portable tire pump.Now I plug my tire pump into this AC/DC converter and I don't have to worry about damaging automotive components.
5,Bought to operate a fantastic fan that I put in a cargo trailer. Been using for 2 months with no problems
5,Works Great with the tire inflator.  My thought was it would be to weak for a 15 amp Tire Compressor. but I tried my Emergency inflator first with a 10 amp fuse and it worked fine. So I ordered the Convertor and when it arrived; it worked A OK.
3,I don't like that it heats up. Works well.
2,It works but if you plan to use any motorized devices like a tire pressure pump don't get this.  Get the 20a version instead.  Inrush current from motorized devices when they start up generally exceeds steady state current many times over.  This adapter will not likely be able to handle it and will shut down due on overcurrent when the motor starts.
5,Many devices operate from an car lighter socket and cannot easily be operated from inside a building. This compact and sufficient power source overcomes that limitation by providing a wall operated supply that has a lighter socket DC output like that of an automobile. It supplies enough current to operate many automotive devices from a source which is an AC wall outlet power supply. This expands your options and provides a great advantage. I bought a second one because the first one worked so well.
1,The connecting power cord doesn't connect well. It sparks on outlets (tried different one and even a different house same results). Didn't last long.
5,Works very well. Great to have.
5,A bit higher than other brands but absolutely worth it.
4,Unit fail with two times of use ??? 👎
5,We use these units to power 12 inch 12 Volt DC cooling fans.  One fan draws about 80 Watts.  We use one power supply  per fan.  So far these power supplies have been rock solid 100% reliable.The blue LED power indicator is also very useful in case we need to do any power delivery or fan motor troubleshooting.Both AC and DC cords could use another foot in length.
5,Purchased this to charge my son’s Traxxas batteries in the house. We have 12v chargers. Just making it easier than leaving them in my pickup truck to charge. Will also be able to use it for my wife’s portable breast pump when/if we travel.
1,I purchased this to be used with my green mountain grill.  My original one from green mountain was left out in the rain and I found it in about 3 inches of rain so I understood why it failed so I found this replacement online. We were having a large 4th of July bbq and that's when this one decided to go faulty after 2 months of use.  Terrible timing on something to malfunction.
1,Useless. The male / female parts fail to make a solid connection because it doesn't 'click' to engage just stays loose.Additionally it has insufficient power to run a 106-watt handheld auto vacuum. The vacuum spluttered (weakly) but never actually powered-up.Total time-wasters. I should send them an invoice for a wasted journey to & from the pick-up locker. It's infuriating.
5,This is a must have if you use the Igloo Thermogenic cooler.  It works great for many items where you want the ability to convert 12V into a standard electrical outlet.
5,I bought this to help power a Cooluli Classic Electric Mini Fridge Cooler and Warmer with a 12V power input. The pack in AC adapter was 110V-only and I needed a 240V AC adapter. I have been using this power adapter daily with the mini-fridge 24 x 7 and there have been no issues. Would recommend for those who need to trade out a power supply with a 12V output that requires a different power input. It supports 110V or 240V power.
5,Used for power supply for all my boat gps/fish finder to load sll my information in the house
5,I bought this to use with a Skywatcher EQ6-R pro telescope mount. It's been used for several hours at a time on many nights without any issues. Oh yeah. And it's 1/3 the price of Skywatcher DC converter.
1,This item would not power my 8A air mattress air pump.  When I would plug this into the wall socket and into the air pump the pump would just pulsate on and off with no air coming out.  Return this for full refund from Amazon. Thank you Amazon.
4,Works well!
1,I bought this for my Setpower TC20 12 volt fridge based off the reviews and the fact that it was a couple of dollars cheaper than the Setpower version. I shouldn't have. The DC input is not well made. It doesn't maintain a connection with the DC plug.  If I jiggle the DC plug the refrigerator may turn on for a second but I couldn't find any way to maintain the connection. Looking inside the DC input part there's a gap around the base and the inside has a yellowish tint so maybe that has something to do with it not working (see picture). I'm returning it to Amazon and buying the Setpower one. Hopefully my next one will work.
3,I bought this so that I could use my portable auto vacuum in the house but it turns out the the lighter plug for this doesn't securely hold the plug getting the vacuum in place I constantly have to push them together to get it to work.
1,El equipo vino defectuoso no sale voltaje de salida 12v. Ya lo bote
5,Great Product
1,This did not work for me. Waste of my money
2,No funciona con dispositivos con compresores portátil para automóviles de inflar llantas o gomas
5,I use this to power my vehicle's 12V air compressor for other items around the house such as bicycle tires and air mattresses. I had a converter from a 12V camping cooler I thought would work but it was only 2 amp output. The 10 amp output from this converter runs the air compressor without issues. It has provided a consistent power supply. Does't get too hot. Feel like a solid build. I would buy another if needed. It's a nice product. Well worth the money I spent.Very much recommend this.
5,This product is exactly what I need. Works very well with my tire inflator. No longer do I have to open car windows and plug into the car power supply to check and inflate tires. This actually allows the pump to work better as there is no battery loss from the motor running.It has provided a consistent power. Does't get too hot. Feels like a solid build. Well worth the money I spent.  Could not be happier.I recommend this 100%.
2,Air inflator that runs fine on my car's 10A cigarette lighter (and is specified as requiring 12V 10A) doesn't work when plugged into this. It runs for half a second then stops.
2,Would rate it 5 star for performance & versatility....inflating grandkids pool toys in back yard....BUT....I purchased 11/02/19. Transformer was garage kept & when I went to use a few weeks ago I could not get power to Bell tire inflator because of rust in receptacle...see photos. I tried steel wool sandpaper knife edge even light coat of naval jelly all to no avail. So i tried to email Alitove @ 2 email addresses they list for solution or replacement  see they're listed garuantee (sp) but email goes to cyberspace.  so beware of limited life or rub Vaseline in receptacle os something ???
5,This converter makes our Coleman 12V cooler into a 120V unit.  We can take it on trips keeping food and drinks cool while driving then plug it in at our destination to serve a a mini-frig.  Exactly what we wanted.
1,Bought this to use for a electric pump for a paddle board.  Seemed like it should work fine but didn’t work at all
1,I bought this to run a air compressor used to simply add air to my tires and it didn't work. Here's my air compressor's model and it doesn't work with this item. https://www.amazon.com/Slime-40051-Digital-Tire-Inflator/dp/B074XHFN6Y/ref=sr_1_2?c=ts&keywords=Wheel+%26+Tire+Air+Compressors+%26+Inflators&qid=1658982503&refinements=p_89%3ASlime&s=automotive&sr=1-2&ts_id=155346011
5,is as advertised other than a short lighter socket on the end of the cord I have no issues the male 12 volt plug in cords that are from a few years back are just slightly longer and want to work out causing what you have plugged into it to stop working other than that no issues
5,Works as intended
5,I like the size of the converter compared to the old style converters this one is a keeper. I don't have to worry about moisture interfering with using the converter outside. Works excellent with our cooler it's up for the job!
5,Polecam
1,Utter garbage.  It failed literally after less than 5 minutes.  Sending it back.
5,My oem ac adapter on my davy crockett went belly up and I saw this one.  Great price and works really well.  I have had for a month and working flawlessly.
5,Purchased to use with a portable air compressor that recommends 120W AC to DC power.  The compressor had no issues getting the needed power to inflate 4 tires.  The cords seem to give about 7-8 feet of length from socket to socket.  No issues with the build quality of the power brick.
5,Works as expected
5,I can not complain abput this at allI hard wired this into my boat. To run my 12 volt. Acc... And so far i can not complain.. This can power 3 led flood lights  one police led spot light . and 12 led lights i have on my boat all at the same time.
5,Bought this for my husband after our son was admitting into the hospital 2.5 hours away from us in the middle of a snow storm. The husband’s cochlear implant batteries died and he only had the car charger with us now he keeps this in the truck to allow for indoor charging as well.
5,Purchased for a x-country drive last summer.  Massachusetts to Montana with stops at 4 National Parks and 2 National Monuments.  It kept my supplies cool overnight in my plug in cooler (12 V) in motel rooms.
4,Perhaps more power than I need thus I paid more than I should have.  There was nothing on the product description that helped me determine the right accessory power cord for my small travel cooler.
5,Works perfectly.
4,bought as a 110 power source for a portable 12 volt cooler. I was surprised when unit (no load) sparks at the plug when plugged in. Now using with a switched fused power strip.
5,I purchased this AC to DC converter based on the reviews and I’m happy I did. It worked flawlessly and performed as expected. I’d surely recommend this product to anyone looking for a solid AC to DC converter.
4,works as advertised.  When plugging in the transformer cord it has a very tight fit and it took a couple of tries to get the cord into the transformaer so that it operats properly.
5,My old power supply to my green mountain green stapled working. I ordered this one as a replacement and it worked perfectly.
1,Did not work right out of the box! When plugged in to a wall outlet the blue power light came on and within a few seconds went out. There was no power on the output end verified with a multimeter. Save your money and time and buy a quality power supply like Coleman. This is just trash. On the positive side the return was flawless and easy. Thank you Amazon.
4,Convenient works wellCigarette lighter socket is a loose fit
1,Tried to use it with a car vacuum. Did not work well at all.
1,This thing did not provide enough juice to run an air pump that has zero problems running off of a car battery.
5,First I bought a 5 amp power supply for my Coleman 5 amp Cooler.  After 20 minutes it died. Got my money back on that different vendor no problem.Splurged and bought this 10 amp power supply. Ran it for over 2 hours and not  a single hick-up.Moral of the story: Buy a 10 amp power supply for a 5 amp cooler... :/Aim small miss small.
3,Worked great for a while. Then the cord started to seperate and wires were showing. Had to throw it out.
5,Took it on a camping trip where we had electric at the campsite and plugged in my 12 volt cooler.  Left it running for two and a half days with no problems.
1,Bought for for my pump as soon as the pump went to high pressure it shut off.
3,Size of 12V cigarrette  female socket is not tight.Male socket is inserted  loosely.
5,I needed this for my DC powered cooler and work great just as described.
1,Bought so I could use my mini car vacuum in the house for small cleanup jobs. First unit didn't work at all. Replacement flashed a blue light and pumped minimal power into the vacuum...just a hissing sound lol. Units were both either defective or not up to the task. Returned.
4,Came on time work perfectly to run a compressor refrigerator 12 vote when I'm inside.
5,It performs exactly how you want it to. I use it primarily for my air compressor that is made to be used in the car and it doesn't disappoint.
5,This is great for running just about any device powered by cigarette lighter socket.Originally I got it to run a scanner and a CB in the house.Now I use it when I need to program a GPS.Any device I have used with it has worked great.
1,did not work right out of the box  shooting sparks when plugged in to ac outlet.
5,I have a 12V chainsaw sharpener that connects to my truck battery but when I am at home I want to use 100V ac. Most 12V cigarette style ac to dc converters only provide 5A which isn't enough to drive the sharpener. This provides 10A and works great. Good quality and does the job.
5,I use it for my Air Pump for the Car since my Car Lighter stop working
5,Many converters are not rated for all voltage ranges. This converter is.Highly recommended.
5,I have an Igloo electric cooler that plugs into the cigarette lighter in the car and sometimes need just a little extra space for extra grocery items I bought that won't fit in the fridge (which is already full). Now I can use said cooler in the house. The ALITOVE AC to DC Converter is just the ticket/
5,Used to power a bike tire pump which requires some reasonably high wattage.  Works as needed.
4,Item works great a little pricey but overall it's a great product
5,Package arrived in time in a nice little box. I bought two of them to power up a telescope mount that needs 12V/10A power source. These adapters are suited perfectly for this cause.
1,The circuit breaker in it turned off right when I turned on my car vacuum.  The car vacuum works just fine in my vehicle's 12-volt cigarette lighter.  Highly disappointed as the inferior version is one-third the price of this.  I paid big bucks to have it work and it failed.  Waste of time for me.
5,works good and fast tire pump that plugs into car lighter now can be used direct to wall plug. long cord is handy to.
5,It works like I needed it to. I used it to plug into wall to precool my portable cooler before plugging into car
2,Hooked it up to an 8 amp load and all it did was cycle.  Couldn't handle the load.  Sent it back.
5,Operated my 12 volt air compressor and vacuum with ease!
1,It was a great thing…once. Went too use it a second time…nothing.
4,Not a bad converter but was shorted a power cord.
1,I got this to power a car seat heater for my wife to use on her easy chair.  It died after 6 months.  This is unacceptable.  It was not moved cords not tangled.  It is 10Amp and the heater that was plugged into it was much less.  Not happy at all.
1,Says it is good for 10A but 1A pump overloads it and causes the converter to pulse the pump so it doesn't run continuous.
5,Works great with my air compressor. Easy to use and nice long cord.
3,Advertised as supplying 10A..  Did not come close to that number based on readout. Is quiet seems decently built for the price but clearly lacking the ability to handle a larger load.  Just one additional note the 12V cigarette lighter socket is shallower than I would have preferred. It was not a "secure" feeling with the 12v male plugged in.
5,Bought it so I would not have to start the car back it into the cold and wet outside just to be able to use my portable tire inflator.  Works perfectly in the quiet dry warmth of the garage.
5,Pump does just as advertised.
5,This AC to DC converter works great.  I use it with a Car Cigarette light adapter with USB to charge up my remotes Apple Nano Kindle Paperwhite and other items that can be recharged over USB.  This converter can output up to 10 amps.  It is fused protected.
5,Now I can use my tire inflater in my garage too.
5,Great value for the money
5,I used this to hook up an air pump from my car which normally would plug into the cigarette lighter. Totally works. Great AC to DC converter. Repeat. Strong enough to work with air pump. I think I could use anything that has a cigarette lighter. Highly recommend this alitove converter.
5,We used this to power an electronic cooler for an entire week. It worked great.
1,It's sole purpose is to run a small tire compressor once a week to inflate the tires on my riding mower.  It can't handle it very well.  This was the higher AMP and Volt model available but it's almost like it has a power 'brown out' 50% of the time when trying to start the compressor.  It's a very small compressor that I normally run off of my cigarette lighter of a non-running vehicle.  I have to unplug the unit from the outlet give it a minute to reset then try again and it usually works.  Due to weather I've only used it once but I may send it back and try again in the spring when I can try it run it a for a few attempts to better review.  It's not for emergencies so maybe I'll just deal with it.
5,To survey the wilderness around house
5,I bought a portable 12 volt cooler for my car when I travel and added this converter so I could take the cooler in my hotel room to keep my drinks cool for the next day. It worked perfectly.  No issues at all.
5,I needed a p/s to test various 12v devices. This works great. A previous unit could not power a 7" monitor. This ran the monitor and 2 color cameras with ease.
1,Crappy manufacturing / defective unit. Plugged an air pump in but the power would just cycle on / off every second. Returning.
5,Works like it's supposed to that's why I like it
5,Reliable dependable.  Works exactly as described.  We use it with portable electric coolers for parties and camping (okay this is for the glamping and not so much for the roughing-it trips).
3,Converter works but considering it would be mostly used in garage or outside it is not build well to be moisture of weather resistant. Also 12V socket is a big loose for the pump plug that is very snug in my car.
4,Received item quickly. It works well with my air pump.
5,Worked perfectly with the car charger shower head pump so now it can be used indoors in a cabin that has electricity but no well. Remember you have to heat the water up before pumping or brrrr..... Don't leave plugged in unless you are using it.
5,Works great for my million candle power brinkman spot light.
4,Will do fine
5,bought to power a  12 volt cooler  a friend gave me years ago so we could keep some thing cool at a job site the 12 volt would drain a car battery fast with out the car running
5,Can use 12 volt appliances at home now like portable cooler fridge and unit will not get hot.
5,Price and Quality..............
5,It works great! Great value with excellent quality!
5,IVE USED IT TO HOOK UP A 12 VOLT RADIO IN THE GARAGE
5,Provided plenty of power for the money
5,Robust quality.Worked well to have our 12V cooler on during the times we are not on the road.
4,Works well.
3,This item could not handle an s bar heater/knock off Chinese heater electric pull needs I kept getting the low battery warning light when using it. It was pulling 235 watts at its max thought the inverter I was using.
5,Bought it to charge the scanner for work because I only have a car charger so it does the job. I plug it at home and it charges good. No overheating or any other problems.
5,My other converters would not work with my portable 12 V refrigerator.  This one has no problems; and I have used it for several days at a time.
5,This is a solid AC to DC converter with 10 amp capability.  I use it with a cooler that operates off the cigarette lighter.
5,I used this transformer on many 12v devices and they all worked flawlessly. Very well made.
4,Bought to use with a chainsaw sharpener that requred a battery or an adapter like this.  Worked as expected.
5,It works
5,Awesome inverter works great in my truck
5,This ac/dc converter is made like a battleship... solid and reliable... running 24/7 for months now. Perfect. Also; has a blue LED to keep you aware it's working... nice.
1,It was not powerful enough for my device.
3,It works okay abd doesn't get too hot. Using for small ice chest.
5,Works great!! Very hardy:)
2,My paddleboard pump has a car lighter plug. I bought this product so that I could fill my paddleboard at home. When I plug this product into my home outlets it emits a spark which does not seem safe. My home outlets do not provide sufficient power to fill my paddleboard: the pump will stop around 10 psi. So I am still inflating by paddleboard with my car. Very frustrating.
1,Did not worik
4,it works as adveritsed
5,works great with my pressure tire thing i keep in my car happy with item
5,Works perfectly for my needs
4,I use it for the car
5,Works perfect with the Set power dc refrigerator.
4,Working great
5,Thank you for a great product
5,It was either buy this in the $20 range or buy a more expensive inflator to run on house current instead of having to run the car outside to inflate tires or other.
5,Did the job intended
5,Been looking for a unit like this for a while.great for accent lighting in the house. You can hook up a lot of L E D s and you wont lose any brightness due to power load
5,Works well & came in on time
4,Nice
3,Did exactly what I expected. I ran a Dometic refrigerator that draws 8 amps on start up and it handles it just fine. Little bulky but has a good long cord
5,Perfect! Just plain awesome.
5,Works well for a Portable/ car DVD player
4,Useful to convert 110 v to 12 v to recharge an item.
5,I used this to operate my portable travel refrigerator that only has a DC plug in the cabin we stayed in on vacation that had AC power.
5,Works great
5,I use this to power an expensive handheld spot light at home. Works great!
5,Like it alot!
5,Rapid delivery highly impressed me.
5,Returned because I did not keep the devise I needed to use it with
5,Good converter
5,Everything as promised.
5,Run a 12 volt car refrigerator inside the house on 110v ac
4,Unit works great...I use it to keep drinks cool in the garage!
5,Worked well with my factory Hyundai air pump. Seemed to supply enough amps to function properly.
4,Working well - in constant use
5,works as expected. get it running before going in the car
5,Got this to use a car vacuum (B&D) at home. It did the job.
5,GREAT
1,The product does not work. The unit only puts out 4 VI bought it and did not use it or try it until the yesterday when I needed it. Now they say I can't return it when it never worked.
1,I bought this to power my scope and was very disappointed. It could not maintain even 12vdc at 3amps let alone the 10amps that is advertised. I don't recommend this item.
5,Compact and easy to store
5,Great and useful product to convert DC to Ac Power.
5,Good product works good going to buy a second one
5,Next day deliver!
1,I received this item and instantly tried it out. I have an air compressor that is only used for inflating tires. It is small and mobile and uses a cigarette lighter in a car to power. I plugged in my compressor and it powered on however when it came to actually compressing nothing happened. I checked all connections and tried various power outlets in my home and the only thing this converter did was turn on the compressor. For whatever reason it didn't give enough power to run the compressor motor. I had to refund the item which was fast and painless. Great customer service - I just wish it would have worked as I really need one.
5,Good!
5,Soo glad I ordered this. I can pre cool inside.
5,Works great well packaged. Only used a few times to power my 12v air pump. Will update if anything changes.
2,It might be ok for electronics but it doesn't produce enough steady power to run tire inflator.
3,This product is capable of running our portable refrigerator from an AC 110 volt outlet. My previous purchase did not.
5,i user this to charge my marine radio in the house as the radio only came with a cigarette lighter plug
1,I have a 12volt cooler. I travel a lot. My  Coleman power adapter went bad. Found this on Amazon and thought why not try it.Didn’t last 24hours. My cooler was working when I started my trip at 6am and by 4pm it had stopped working.I plugged my cooler into the truck cigarette lighter and it worked.I’m a truck driver and have electrical outlets in my truck freeing up the limited 12volt for my GPS and other needed items.
5,Works fantastic in hotel rooms when no refrigerator is provided. No overheating of the cord or plugs. Very nice!
5,Traveled cross country using this power supply to plug in our 12V car cooler when we stopped for the night at hotels.  Worked as advertised..!
1,Product worked fine first time delivering 12.2 volts used to test several LED pods for a roof rack install. Second use plugged in same location after keeping in drawer it's acting crazy. Blue LED on body pulses and rated voltage jumps around randomly 0.5 to 10.4 and anywhere in between. Tried to contact Alitove but their website has been suspended...Some reviewers have seen short life span as well. Good luck getting a replacement. Returning and going with a different brand.
5,Works Great for home use
5,Works good well made
5,Product performs great when used within the items specifications.
1,I double checked the numbers before purchasing this for my portable tire inflator which was rates at 10A.It does not work when I pkuf into the outlet. The lights turn on and the pump digital readout works but it does not inflate.It all worked when I plugged it into my car outlet. Do yourrself a favor and get the husky dial 12v/120v digital version to have the best of both worlds.I thought this would be great with my portable version but in the end is as big as other better know brands when you consider this adapter and the smaller portable tire inflator.
5,Good product well builtworks great
5,I use it for a 12v vent fan in the sealing in my Franklin coach which is 120v. I forget it's up there. Just flip the wall switch.
5,Works good but gets very warm.
5,works fine.  left the original one outside in the rain and it shorted out.  this replacement looks the same and works good.
5,A little bit large for what it is but it works great. An affordable way to power those items with 12V cig plugs
1,I had to get a third converter before I got one that works
5,Bought it for my green mountain grill and it works perfect.
5,works as advertized. i use it to power an ATV speaker system for home use. I use it as a second subwoofer for tv movies
5,works great
5,A/A/C conversion to DC to power portable electric Cooler and DC powered air compressor.  Suits both great.
5,Love it it has literally been running for 4 months straight and not a problem
1,Main purpose of my purchase was to connect to the outlet and use my 12 V tire compressor to pump the tires on my car in the garage. It didn’t work so I thought  the compressor was bad then I plugged it into cigarette lighter in my car and it worked perfectly. Bad and cheap
2,Hard to keep it on if you move it will turn off I have to position it a certain way to keep it on
5,Muy útil.
5,I like  thanks
5,AC to DC Adapter worked as described.  I plugged my 12V DC tire pump into it and put air into my bicycle.
5,Used this converter to power the strobe light for my flying saucer at Christmas
3,It's useless. And doesn't even work also it's adapter is very loose and doesn't fit half of the time.
5,Replacing its predecessor that quit it worked fine and saved me having to buy a complete new travel refrigerator.
1,I used this to run a car cooler and a cab used it about 5 times each and went to use it today and this was dead already.  Don’t buy it is garbage.  They have a one month warranty and it lasted about that long.  Buyer is a scammer.
5,I use this to power a Koolatron cooler. Works great. Gets warm yes...but not hot.
2,Great idea but possibly poorly built. Was fidgety from day one then burnt out in a couple of months under light use. Amps of device pulled in was within range on power adapter.
5,I thought this would be junk and it turns out to be well made and heavy duty.
5,Lasted about 2.5 months then it wouldn’t work anymore.
2,The website says the ALITOVE AC to DC Converter will run several items including tire pumps.  It will not run my Bell 6000 tire pump which runs very well from the car DC.  I would not recommend it.
5,Works great
1,We use the converter with our plug in cooler.  On our third trip the converter stopped working after being plugged into wall after several minutes. Unit works fine plugged into car cigarette lighter.  Customer service does not respond.
1,zero voltage output when plugged into a 115v ac outlet
5,Using for vexilar in ice house works great
1,I am looking for an adapter to run a Paddle Board pump.  This shuts off as soon as I turn the pump on. (even a very small pump) it won't handle the current. It may work for something else but disappointed it won't work for my needs
5,Only tested it with air pump we got.  It works.  Will see how it holds up.
1,Power cord does not reliably connect to transformer when plugged in.  If you jiggle the power cord a little power can be lost.  Bought a second unit hoping it would perform better.  It did not.
5,Works great for my DYI Blue tooth Stero
1,I've used this item about six times all under gentle conditions. When plugging it in today I saw that the insulation on both ends of the power cord was broken. In addition the insulation on the underlying wires was also broken exposing the copper conductors. This is exactly where your hand will be when plugging this in creating a significant danger to the user.Amazingly bad quality. There is simply no excuse for something this shoddy and dangerous to be sold.
1,Sadly I waited too long to use this converter and missed the return window.  I got busy and paid the price for total device failure.  It merely clicks and flickers whenever anything is plugged into its socket and fails to power anything.
5,I like it very much Very useful tool
2,Only lasted 2 weeks. ASTRO A1 much better
5,I don't use it everyday but it's still working great!
1,Bought to use with a 12v 8.8amp car vacuum and this '12v 10amp' has it revving like a failing to start vechicle.  Does not work for my requirement.  Big waste of money basically bought a paper weight.Update: supplies only 12.47 v 1.37amps....waste.
5,Good quality product. Price is little high.
5,Super long length works without issue
5,As described. Works good. Great price.
5,Use it to charge a battery booster.
1,Neither one worked. Junk
1,Ok at first... Bought this for a plug in cooler. It powered the device for 8 months then developed a very notifible high pitch whine.  It’s quiet(er)now but my device isn’t working properly.  I tested with a voltmeter and the converter is only supplying 5.6 volts with the device powered on 12.1 volts with no load. This item is just more cheap imported from China junk
5,Easy to use. Great for traveling
1,Is not working with my car vacuum
5,EXCELLENT converter. Highly recommend this vendor.
5,Work as advertised 👍👍
1,The lights wouldn't even turn on let alone power my device.
5,Use this for my xm radio in the house
5,This adapter worked very well so far no issues.
1,Couldn’t run my 6.5 amp pump that tops out at 10 amps.
5,working good so far
1,Complete trash. This thing immediately blew an internal component after being plugged in to 110V  AC outlet. Immediately shot sparks from the block and made a loud popping noise. This was with NO device connected at the 12V DC end so no load or current should have been through the adapter at all. Afterward the adapter is dead checking with a multitester shows only 0.008V at the DC end and the LED does not light.Also it looks like the compliance marks might be forged
5,Great product
5,Bought it for my 18 l demotec fridgr works amazingly fine
5,Para una bomba de 12 voltio
5,Works great not noisey. Great Ford length. I like it.
2,Not strong enough for little tire pump
1,DC plug keeps popping out of socket - not a secure connection. Tried with multiple devices and problem persists so I assume that the socket isn't deep enough or doesn't have any kind of feature to make the connection more secure. Sending it back as this is one annoying design flaw. Move it a couple of inches and it pops out.
5,Works just great for my Serius Music when camping thank you.
5,Works with my small air compressor for lawn tractor. I'm satisfied with product.
1,Was really excited to use my CB radio inside since someone was a genius and made it DC only. I plug this into the outlet DOESNT TURN ON. I’ve tried several outlets and the little light that lets you know it’s working doesn’t turn on nor does my radio. a waste of money in my books.
5,PLENTY OF AMPS
1,Converter heats up and shuts off only after 5 or 6 hours I can’t depend on it so that’s why it’s getting a one star l. I need it to be dependable as I have milk eggs and other perishable items.
2,Cord failed right at the 12v socket.  If I wiggle it I get a connection again.  Pretty disappointedIt was only a couple months old stationary in a moving truck.  I ripped it apart and resoldered the 12v connector.  Working again
5,good value
5,Perfect match for our cooler. Thanks
5,Made it easier to use my air pump at home
1,Ours failed while we were on a trip using it to power our 50w portable cooler/refrigerator.  I had to rig a 12v system to keep my foods frozen. Would not recommend it. Too risky.
5,Used this in a motel for 5 days.....worked great !!
5,I love this I use it all the time works wonderfully thanks
5,Worked as described.
5,Needed for cooler to travel in truck.
5,Worked great for my 12v fridge. Went to Florida and used fridge in room with adapter.
1,Bought this product to go with a refrigerator cooler that works in your vehicle. This unit was recommended converts the cooler so it can be plugged into a regular household outlet. This product sparks every time it has been used. We have gotten shocked from the unit and will no longer use it. Dont waste your money on faulty products!!
5,Great product
5,Very helpful tool recommend it!
5,Excellent works as advertised. Great cord length.
5,I love this very cool
5,Works perfectly
1,Adapter is not able to power on a tyre inflator rated to work with 10 Amps. Seems like converter is not able to generate enough amps to meet the power requirement.
2,Bunch of BS
5,Excellent product!
5,Works like very well and nice quality. And delivery was fast.
5,Awesome works great with my laptop
5,It works with my new cooler!
1,Worked for the first 10 minutes of it's life then it died. Made a few audible pops when it went out and the indicator light and power output would no longer work. I was using it on an iceless cooler which only draws half the capacity this thing can put out (about 5 amps instead of 10). Not sure why it couldn't handle that...
5,Works
5,As promised
2,From power source to box I had two buy a new cable in three months.
1,I had only had this converter for about two weeks when I noticed the outer casing on the 110 VAC power cord was broken just beyond the plug in.  I do not use this item more than two times every week so I was surprised to have it break the outer insulation on both ends of the 110 VAC cord and in turn the wires broke not very safe.
5,Fantastic to be able to use my DC car products on an AC outlet
5,Great product and works as advertised
1,My use for product was for a led display requiring about 5-6 Amps.Left plugged in overnight (display powered down i.e. no amp draw)  power brick no longer provides output voltage. Led no longer lights up when plugged in to 110v socket.Tried different socket and different power cord same result.As the power socket has been removed (wired direct to terminal block) will be contacting seller in regards to replacement.
5,Good amps for the money. Quick delivery.
5,Exactly as described. On time.
5,Delivered performance as promised as specified
5,Works great with our big cooler
1,Unit works fine however there are loose parts inside the sealed case that have the potential of shorting and destroying the power supply or worse yet causing a fire.
1,I wish I could give zero stars this broke after one day of use while on vacation absolutely junk don't waste your time. Amazon refunded
2,Used twice a week for tire pressure checks. Worked well until it crapped out after 14 months. Disappointed with short lifespan. Expected more.
1,The product is not working. I used it for about ten times and put it away on August 20 2020. Today I was going to use it for my bike tire compressor and it does not work. The blue light goes on for a few seconds and it goes out.
1,Got it for our camper. The first one we ordered didn't work power box light didn't even light up. Ordered a replacement and same thing. None of them work or connect when plugged into a power source. A little disappointed as we picked this one because of the best reviews but maybe we got unluckily and received 2 duds
5,great converter for the money
5,Product as described
1,Junk. Used it once for our Green Mountain Grill. Worked fine. Second time it did not work despite fact convertor power light indicated it was on. Trouble shooting with other equipment/appliances confirmed it was the convertor. Not putting out enough power. Unfortunately passed the return window time frame. Would not recommend this product/manufacturer.
1,Bought it for an air compressor for my RV. Didn’t work at all. If you move it around it works for a second.
1,I use it for a car vacuum cleaner and it did not work.
5,Work great . You can use continuous.
1,Shut the pump off every time I tried to put air in a tire. Returned it.
1,Going to send it back does not work out of the box.  Waited a week for this now I have to find something else.
5,PERFECT FOR THE JOB
5,Works like it should
5,Works as advertised.
5,Perfect for my needs
1,Terrible product. Cheap make and definitely does not work even for my little 12v air mattress pump.
5,No complaints
2,This cord died on Thanksgiving Day. Sure not a good value. Caused a lot of grief because I no longer could use my portable oxygen machine!
1,The item stopped working within 2 months of purchase after less than 10 uses. Do not recommend.
1,Doent work. Checked power supply all were good except  converter.
1,We purchased this adapter for trips. It didn't even last the return trip before it quit working.
3,Only lasted a week then burned up
1,It was defective. I tried to blow up my air mattress and it would not power my 12V pump.
1,was on fire from just being plug in no load
1,I bought this product to complement my car Vacuum i only use it once and in the middle of using this it stopped working.. i had to put it in the trash
1,Socket is to short nothing stays in itdc plugs keep popping out.Poor design
2,Junk.  Wires came loose in 1 month
1,Wanted to use this in charge to handle pumping up my paddle boards.  Not powerful enough for that.
5,It is perfect
1,Headline says it all. Worked for a few months then stopped. Obviously I would not recommend this item for purchase.
1,Unit is dead in less than four months. Used item about 10 times to vacuum my vehicles with a compatible auto vacuum and to test out a compatible iceless cooler. Never exposed to elements dust or debris; lived in my garage during it’s short existence.
5,Meets the specifications.Good product.
5,We love it
1,this AC power supply does NOT have the Amp rating listed.  more like 3amps
1,Didn't work right out of the box.  Discouraging for grandkids trying to blowup a tube
1,Broken out of the box. Cheap!!
1,From the first time use we had to push the plug in multiple times to get it to power our unit. Now 5 months later it won’t work regardless how many times we push or wiggle the cord.
1,Easy order fast delivery all that I expect from Amazon.com.  Unfortunately......Opened package plugged it in with my electric ice chest.....did not power up.  Checked with a DVM yup non-working model.  We will now see how quickly they refund my money.
5,Compact
5,Worked as described.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I m semi truck driver.. I used in truck but extension wire not working proper
1,We tried using this converter in two different houses multiple outlets. It sparked every time we plugged it in and tripped circuits (even a 30 amp one). Useless. Maybe a faulty unit but not worth trying again.
1,Cant evaluate other than item was damaged upon arrival. Loose pieces rattling inside.
1,Fail to run a THISWORX Car Vacuum Cleaner 8.8 A
1,Did not work
1,Is not 10 amps not working with 8 amps mattress pump
1,Worst purchase I’ve ever made.  Had problems from day one and now the item doesn’t work at all.  Would not recommend this item.  I think it completely quit working within two weeks.
1,Unit was completely dead on arrival. Unfortunately I had already remover the cigarette socket to splice it into my application but after extensive testing I found that there was no 12vdc coming out of the converter/transformer.
1,This clearly was a returned product. It was sent out again without fixing the problem.
1,This product is not as advertisedIt has no Cigarette lighter socketI thought it was a mistake on first receipt.Replacement was identicalProduct title and picture are very misleading
1,It does not work
1,Today I went to use this product for only the second time and it doesn't work anymore!Of course the return deadline has expired :-(I ended up throwing it in the garbage!
1,Stopped working 2 days during my camping trip.
1,Had to use electrical tape to make the car charger contact with this converter.  Not ideal.  Trying to see if I can return it and get a different brand
1,Didn’t work. Gets no power!
1,Arrived missing the final adapter to mimic car DC.  I purchased right before trip and spent more money given the good reviews on Amazon to not worry.
1,Didn’t work right out of the box.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Have a little car vacuum cleaner that can't turn on with this adapter
1,Was not able to power my car tire inflator. May be good for low power items but not for critical items that draw more power.
1,Total junk
1,IT DOSE NOT WORK !!! We connected it to the electricity but it dose not start . The item is defective !!! How do we return this item ???
1,I arrive defective
1,Try running my little lighter operated compressor and shut down after 5 minutes. what a waste of money. The good news is the owner refunded me my money.
1,I bought this a little less than two months ago and this morning when I went to plug it in—dead. It worked very well until today.
1,There was no car plug adapter plug-female port supplied with product per description.  Will be returning purchase.  WTF....
1,Is either broken on arrival cannot handle 110W 12V (as advertised) electric pump.  Reaching out to seller - will update review with results.
1,Crappie
1,Lasted just over a year before it stopped working. Maybe used it five times.
1,Failed first time when plugged in...Light glowed but no 12volt.Testest 12 volt item and it worked!
1,Does not provide enough power to run a small handheld portable air compressor. Basically useless.
1,Product arrived damaged.
1,Plug is to narrow to fit in outlet.  The three prongs are placed too close together.  Was useless.  Sent it back.
1,Did not come with car cigarette lighter socket like listed.
1,The product did not have the AC cord with it was not useable
1,Not able to use auto air pump. Only 10 amp. Need 15 amp or better.

1,Stopped working after 1 week.  Garbage.
1,Product failed to work after first test
1,Feel apart after 4 days. Trash.
1,Does not work!😩Missed my window for return!
1,Brand new. Did not work. No output.
5,Use it in my sailboat to power a sump pump at the dock and I have had no problems with it.
5,I originally messed up and bought the 5A back in January of this year when I should have this one (10A) converter. The 5A failed (my fault) when trying to use my car tire inflator again but ALITOVE was helpful in replacing the unit I burned out for a appropriate 10A converter. Customer service like this makes me glad I went with this brand. They stick by their product and it was proven to me in this instance. Props!
5,The second item worked as  we ordered !!!
1,broken right out of the box..
5,I plug it into GCFI and it helps me with conversion from house power to 12V. What else to say?
5,Perfect for me!!!
5,Works great
5,Works good
5,Thank you
5,It converts ac to DC and doesn't suck
5,Using as a replacement power supply for a Green Mountain Grill Davey Crockett smoker. Works great!
5,It does the job
5,Simple fast not complicated instructions easy to use
5,Used for truck beer cooler. Does the job ✌🏼
1,Mine self destructed just out of warranty. Ran hot running a cooler so for people that say they are running these 24/7seeing is believing.
5,This device was purchased to power a 12v CPAP machine when 12v power was unavailable. It worked well.
5,It does get hot but boy did it save us in a pinch. Original went out and our new fridge was on backorder. Coleman cooler saves the day.
5,Sheerness good and easy to use
5,This item performs exactly as expected and desired. What more can you ask right? I am happy with my purchase.
1,Tried to use it with a car vacuum and it didn't work. Going to look for something else.
5,Great
5,The product worked as described.
5,Good
4,Great for using a 12v air compressor in the house for  reverse osmosis tank.
1,I bought this for the sole purpose of using a portable inflator in my garage. The first time I needed to use it. It would not power my inflator. When plugged in it shows it has power but dies immediately when activating then device plugged in to it. Did not work at all. My mistake for not testing it immediately when it came in the mail. Now I am past the return period. Seller if you read this how about contacting me with a solution as to why it isn't working.
5,I am able to use my electric cooler In my house now
5,Works as advertised. Use for my furrion S trailer cams monitor inside rv.
5,Since I had the small compressor but no means to inflate golf cart tires without having AC power I got this converter.  So glad I got it as it was so easy to use and it did work exactly as described. No more low tires. Am a happy camper.
5,Good quality 10 amp converter. You need this to run a mini compressor or mini vacuum cleaner. 2 amp converter for electronics won’t work.
5,It works perfectly for what I needed it for.Thanks it works great!
5,This has the amperage that I wanted for my cooler the other ones out there are weak and don't last long as they can't keep up with the amp draw.
5,Works as expected.
5,Using this to power a 12v cooler. Overkill for the 3a my cooler uses but wanted room to use a splitter and power other devices
5,Use it for tire air pressure car vacuum and don't worry about draw car battery.
5,On time delivery and works as advertised
5,No problems with kareoke speakers
5,I’ve bought the less expensive ones to use with our portable electric cooler and they end up melting.  They are a fire hazard.  THIS ONE IS VERY WELL BUILT.  Great quality.  It gets warm but that is normal and The materials withstand the heat.  I’ve had it in constant use for over a week and it performed without hesitation.  Spend the money on this and be done.
5,Very happy with this products. Works great.
5,I wasn't sure if it would pump out enough current for my project but it has exceeded my expectations. Quick shipment.
4,Why drain your car battery with a tire air compressor when the car's in the garage?  This adapter is an inexpensive way to plug in car accessories at home.  The air compressor I bought was less expensive because it wasn't made to plug into the car's lighter port and the home.  This adapter plus that compressor was cheaper than buying a compressor with an adapter.  Works great.  Would be nice if the cord was longer so I wouldn't need an extension cord to reach the rear tires - of course if my garage had an outlet that far down the wall it wouldn't be an issue.
5,Outstanding product
5,No dislikes and it worked great for what I needed it for
5,Had issued with broken cord. Sellers made it right and replaced  it
5,Made well
5,My husband wanted it for his drill. He says it works great. Would definitely recommend.
5,Works great so far you always need a AC converter
5,I used it to power a heated seat back for my office chair.
5,So far so good
4,Never saw the product. The person who received it liked it.
5,Worked great for my portable cooler. Didnt seem to over heat during our camping trip. I had plug in a whole week straight no problems.
5,el surtido fue excelente y el producto es de muy buena calidad
1,le fil de branchement pas canadian fait pas dans les prise
1,Je ne peux pas le brancher dans le mur(Canada). Pourtant sur la photo sur Amazon la prise est bonne mais une fois le colis reçu la prise n'est pas la bonne
1,Picture shows the plug was for north America but when I got it it was 240v and looked like a plug from China or some other place
1,Item was not for North America as it was advertised
3,The converter arrived with a wrong 110V plug type I believe New Zealand instead of north American one. I had to buy a new power cable and everything works well now
1,Picture shows the power adapter plug is for Canada Style and looked like a plug from China (Type I) or some other place. Not at all useful.
1,The specs for amps was listed as 10 it’s only 8 not enough power to run the plug was 3 prone but not the right style totally useless for my application ( photos and right up it was perfect what I got not even close )
