5,Product summary: I love this and would buy it again without hesitation.Before this product I had a Loopy phone case and used a metal plate inside the case to attach to a low profile magnetic vent phone holder. I loved it. No clipping in a phone no pinching no obnoxious holder no suction cups dash mounts or window mounts etc.I've transitioned to MagSafe devices; phone case phone stands chargers etc. so I needed a new car mount. I picked this because of the color the price and how low the profile is. I want accessories like this to blend in.I love it! This slides into/around my vents nicely. It doesn't scratch my vent plastic and it doesn't slip or fall from the vent. When not in use it blends right in with my black interior (Subaru Ascent). I often ride in the passenger seat as well - I can quickly move it from one vent to another to mount the phone on whichever side I sit (driver/passenger).I haven't had any issues with my phone sliding off or not staying attached to the magnet so in my eyes - that's great! If it's out of mind then the product is working as it should! That being said I haven't "put it to the test" or anything - and I can't say I have a desire to see if it lifts a 5lb weight.A couple things to note about vent clip phone holders that may or may not be obvious. It blocks the airflow from the vent (doesn't matter to me.) The one thing that does impact me though is that in the winter when my heat is up my phone and vent clip holder get uncomfortably hot to the touch. Maybe it's because my SUV throws out burning hot heat either way - something worth noting - specifically referencing vent clip holders in general not a concern specific to this product.
4,This car mount magnet is a really good product if you looking for something quick to mount your phone too while driving. I am extremely satisfied with the product and have used it every single day since recieving it. On the odd occassion (wich is rare) it may pull the mounting off from the airvent when trying to pull your phone off the mounting - however that proves the quality of the magnet (which is brilliant). Overall I highly recommend this phone mount magnet - it is one of the bests I've seen for the price!
5,I recently purchased an iPhone 14 Pro. I tried several but they either did not hold the phone securely enough were too tight for the air vents or wiggled too much. I was very happy with the TechMatte grip I had used with my prior phone so gave this one a try. It works perfectly for me. Strong grip. Discrete. Fits the air vents. Another winner from TechMatte!
4,As others have mentioned wish the connection between the rubber vent tabs was more tightly connected to the magnetic disk.
4,I have an iPhone with a MagSafe case and this works excellent!
5,Pretty flat might interfere with vent handles but it sits tight and gets the job done.
4,Worked better than a Belkin!
5,Loved the stability and sturdiness’sGreat accessory for the carA must have for mag safe phones
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 i had an xr and put a stick on magnet on the case and i don’t like how it looked. I was very skeptical about whether this would work with out a magnet but to my surprise it works well the magnet seems to be quite strong. im assuming it uses the charging magnet in your phone but it looks much better than a big round circle magnet. Honestly i wish I knew this existed sooner!
4,Magnet is strong to resist bumps in the road yet I can remove my phone easily with one hand. Due to the large size of the magnet to work properly with MagSafe it hits my vent adjustment (I was aware of this prior to purchasing). As a result the mount doesn’t fully grip on to the vent slat and would come off when I attempted to remove my phone. I ended up removing the magnet from the mount and glued it on to a smaller vent mount I was using prior for a different phone. It works great! Wish I didn’t have to do the extra work but I knew this going in.I am happy with the product for its price. Would recommend to anyone who needs a larger magnet for a preexisting mount.
4,The product is sturdy but attaching it to the vent doesn’t work so great.It comes off from the vent when removing my phone. Maybe it’s my vent but it is doing the job right now.
5,Works as described. Would purchase again
3,Perfect magnet strength hold the phone great. The clip for the vent is where it lacks. I literally pull it out of the vent each time I take it off. Being said it works great until you take it off.
3,Wanted to find a vent clip that was compatible with my iphone 13 pro. I don't like grip holding car mounts. I find them annoying to put on and take off and too bulky. I purchased another brand at first but didn't like how much my phone protruded from my vent and it didn't keep my phone from facing downwards. Before i wanted to purchase the belkin car mount I wanted to try this.Their magnet is strong. I have no complaints on that. It has not dropped my phone on any bumps along my drive. It's easy installation and doesn't protrude out far so it's not in my way of my center car monitor. My only complaint is that the grip for the mount will come off the vent very easily. I will pick up my phone and the car mount will still be attached to my phone. That's the only annoying part of this product. Otherwise it's worth your money if you don't mind always reattaching the mount to the vent.
5,I keep this in my bag for using in rental cars when I travel. Works great on every car I try (and works well at home on my Camry and Sienna too. It stays put 99% of the time. Since it's just a little rubber bit pinching the vent blade it CAN stay stuck on the phone when you grab the phone... but a subtle twist of the wrist is all it takes to keep the mount in place when picking up your phone. I find this true of all magnetic MagSafe accessories.
4,Holds the phone great but easily comes off the air vent so you have to put it back every time.
5,I love this product! I recently upgraded to a newer iphone with magsafe so I could no longer use my prior car vent phone holder. I will stress that I never write reviews for products unless they exceed my expectations or severely disappoint. This vent clip is great! Although it may not work for everyone's vehicle I will say that in my circumstances this product does the job well. The magnet is ridiculously strong and hasn't caused my phone to fall in the floor. Great work 5/5!
3,Gotta search for a few seconds for the magnet to latch on. It does hold but always seems like as if any big bump or sudden stop it may pop loose..
5,After using several methods to hook my phone to the dashboard this magnetic mount is a game changer. It has made my life so much easier I just take out my iphone 13 and snap it to the mount easily every-time I am in my car.
4,Not for the 12 pro max since it’s a bit heavier or not sure if I received a faulty one phone kept falling. Didn’t feel safe. Wouldn’t recommend for the 12 pro max. The mounting grip on the vent was strong and sturdy but the magnet wasn’t that strong! Move on to something else don’t waste time!Update: received a replacement one!! Holds my 12pro max in one place! Not MagSafe charger magnetic strength but can confidently say it won’t fall down!!
5,Full disclosure I was provided this product free of charge as a free sample. The manufacturer did not request I post a review or try to influence me in any way. That said I’ve used their products before and their customer service is top notch.The magnetic car mount works really well. The magnetic hold is very strong. No issues with my phone falling off even when going over bumps at normal speed. Only minor complaint is that the hold is so strong that sometimes when I pull my phone off the entire mount comes off the vent. Might be due to the thickness of my car vent. I have a Honda Pilot and am using an apple leather magsafe case. Not a big deal. Using two hands to keep the mount in place while works fine.
5,Bought this for my young driver in the house can us the gos on the phone as well.
5,Holds super well. Works perfect with magsafe phone case on my iPhone. Grabs it right away and has yet to fall off on all terrain. Looking for a simple magsafe holder don’t think twice.
5,Holds phone really well. Maybe a bit too well though sometimes my phone takes the mount with it when I take it off.
3,This product is ok. Yes it works with my Iphone 13 pro with a magsafe case but the part that goes into the vent is terrible. it is very loose and often comes out completely when I grab my phone.
5,Love that this one is half the price or less than others and it works so well. Clips don’t usually stay in my vents but this one stays pretty well. Not perfect but better than others I’ve tried. Plus the black matches the vents.
5,As long as the vents are thick enough for the device to really stick on this works perfectly for the new iPhones. I chose this one because of its low profile (it doesn't stick far out like others on Amazon). This one sits flush is simply designed and works perfectly well even through some non-MagSafe cases (some but definitely not all).
5,Holds my iPhone 13 Pro Max great while driving and while going on speed bumps. I never have a problem with it.
3,The magnet is strong and the design is fine. But I have a Toyota with thicker vent slats and this mount is impossible to use with them.Other mounts I’ve used have offered two degrees of separation for thinner or thicker slats. I would recommend this manufacturer do the same.
3,Could have better grasp on the dash. It often comes off if you don’t pull the phone off the right way. So far it has worked mostly but it’s a little annoying. I want one that doesn’t come off my vent.
5,I was skeptical of this product because of the low cost but was pleasantly surprised at how well it works!  The magnet is VERY strong and works great.  The mounting clip leaves a little to be desired but this thing is inexpensive enough and works well enough to overlook that.  This is a pretty good product.
5,so far its good I use Spigen Ultra Hybrid MagSafe for my 13 Pro. Its also depend on your car vent mine fit perfectly fine.
5,No review needed. Very strong magnet and was perfect for my iPhone 13 Pro. Fantastic
5,Works great. Does exactly what it needs to and the magnet is very strong.
3,The magnets in this mount are a bit weak in my opinion. I'm using a magsafe compatible silicone case. My iPhone 13 Pro and case do stick to it but the adhesion just feels weaker than I expected.
5,Got a new iPhone 13 and the Apple MagSafe case. My old magnet phone mount wouldn’t hold the phone. This one does. Just what I needed!
3,Product works great once the magnets are in range it locks right on there and does not fall off.  Just tough to remove it from platform without it pulling out of the vents it hangs in.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 If you see the video I took the mount is held together by a small screw that you can easily take apart. I see it breaking in the future and my phone falling.The reason I bought this mount was the minimal design which I do like.We’ll see how it holds up over time but the quality isn’t great
5,Works pretty well in my e90 BMW. Holds my 13 pro and does not pull off vent when removing.
3,I have a hate/love for this product! It clips so well with the phone the only thing I hate about it is that it always comes off with my phone when I’m trying to take my phone off the mount.
3,if the iPhone has a case the Mag Safe Magnetic holders don not work on the dash of the car.
5,I have been buying products from this manufacturer for some time like all the products and the support. I just wish it had a little longer stem for more clearance from the vent but it still works great
2,So my phone does attach quite easily. It’s hard to get onto the vents in my car and it comes right off when pulling my phone off. So I have to reattach it. Not worth it to me.
5,This thing works really well and is low profile on my dash. Normally not a fan of air vent holders this ones worth the purchase. Holds my iPhone 12 with no issues.
5,Super strong magnet that holds my iPhone 12 in place when driving. Connects to the air vent on your car and is a great solution for those who need a MagSafe mount
5,Works great
2,Motion of the car or touching the screen should not cause the phone to fall from the mount
2,My iPhone 13 pro max stuck pretty well however the issue comes when you try to remove your phone the whole piece comes off too instead of staying attached to the vent.
5,Works perfectly
5,Purchased a Magsafe compatible case and works very well.
5,Works as expected. Holds phone very well.I am very happy with this purchase.
2,Not enough space to slide prongs on either side of vent slat. Way too tight.  I’ve had several vent mounts and this is one of the worst fitting.
5,Wanted a very simple phone mount that I could leave in my car without being too flashy. Works great.
1,Holds phone just fine but does stay in vent. So what’s the point?
5,Perfect for what I needed with iPhone 12 mini
5,magsafe is GOOD just lock mount on vent is not very fix
2,The air vents in my car are angled enough to where if i stick this thing on it won't clip all the way and when i put my phone on it does not hold and is obstructed by the plastic around the vents
5,Muy cómodo para usar
1,plate and shaft separate when pulling off vent doesn't fit on my vents doesn't grip enough not enough clearance for phone since shaft doesn't exert out away from dash... poor quality poor design
1,It’s a strong magnet with a cheap chip clip style attachment.  The weight of my iphone13 and the magnet are too heavy for the vents.  When you grab your phone the magnet stays on the phone.  Just a stupid cheap design.  I’m left with a $16 magnet…
1,The magnet is not strong enough to hold over bumps on the road if you are using a thin case. The case holds fine with an apple branded charger at home but the magnet on this car mount is much weaker.
2,Did not hold onto case with magnetic in it.
1,Magnet is extremely strong every time I go to take my phone off the mount the entire mount comes out of the vent. Not worth using unless you want to reinsert the mount every time you use your phone.
1,I have a otter box MagSafe case and this wouldn’t come close to attaching. Even out of the case it barely held my phone. Had to return it.
1,Just bought this item and it was a big disappointment the magnet is incredible weak and does not hold up the phone with or without a case.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.
1,I have an iphone and It does not hold the phone at all. Dont waste your money!Now im having trouble getting my money back
1,The magnet on the one I bought did not hold my iPhone 12 - without any case.  It was weak at best- disappointed.  I am returning it.
1,It’s different from the items that show in market
1,Didn’t stay inside air vent kept falling out
1,No es par ventilaciones redondas. Se cae. Para rectangulares quizá sitva nomlo puedo comprobar.
3,Vents are angled phone ends up too close to vent and stuck at a upward angle.
1,Can;t even hold the weight of an iphone Max.  Adhesion is horrible.  Threw out immediately.
1,It’s even not holding iPhone 13 pro without case.
1,Doesn’t work  if you use the case
1,This was not strong enough to hold my phone.
5,Have been using these vent adapters for a bit. Typically I would get an adapter and place one of those steel plates inside the case for the phone to stick. That's not needed any longer with the new iPhone's. This thing sticks very strongly. Better than I thought it was going to work. It's very strong and my phone never feels like it's going to fall off. And to pull it off I just grab the phone by the bottom and tilt towards me slightly and it comes right off. Also the legs that wrap around the vent slots are very tight. I was afraid I was going to break my vent slots but it did not happen. And the adapter stays on really well. It hasn't come out since installation.I would definitely recommend.
5,What’s not to like about this car mount. It fits my CX-5 vents just fine. Grabs the vents very tightly and hold my iPhone 12 Pro with MagSafe case very firmly. I had an older TechMatte magnetic holder that I really liked. This one is a bit larger in diameter but thinner and every bit as strong. I don’t like big mounts that hang several inches out from the dash so this mount is perfect for me!
5,Muy practico
4,Pretty happy with this MagSafe mount works great with OEM apple case dose not work good if you have a third party slippery case falls off.
4,Don’t get me wrong the strong magnet is a good thing it keeps my phone secure at all times through bumps and everything . But sometimes when I want to take off my phone the entire mount comes with it. Not a huge dealbreaker for me just thought some would like to know.
4,Only downside of the product is you can’t adjust the angle and the mount comes off whenever you dismount the phone. So you have to put the mount back every single time. Given the price and the suction power. There is very little to complain about.
5,As price range is low and next one good is much more expensive this one is perfect buy.
2,Every time I try to pull my phone off the mount follows the phone! Series design issue
4,Not sure what I was thinking forgotI ordered it and when it showed up I looked back and couldn’t believe I paid like $15 for it. That’s way more than I works usually spend on  this
5,Magnet is really strong even with case on. Highly recommended.
5,I use to hold my phone driving with one hand because I want to watch direction on GPS. It solved the problem easily. My phone is securely hold tightly to the MagGrip. Great buy. I highly recommend it.
4,It’s a little hard to adjust to avoid sun glare. Also I noticed on my Mag safe phone cover the white circle in the back comes off when I use it with the magnet. Makes for an unattractive case but as long as it holds and doesn’t fall off I’m OK.
5,Works perfectly just wish it was a little cheaper since it's such a simple product.
4,The MagGrip Car Vent with MagSafe works exactly as advertised. Pop it into the vent of your car and it will magnetically attach and hold onto your iPhone 12. The magnetic connection is quite strong and it did not slip or fall off after many miles of driving. My only complaint is that there is no adjustable arm to change the angle of the phone once it's connected. In my Honda Odyssey the vents tilt slightly upward and my iphone12 pro max has to lay at an awkward angle pointed towards the roof liner making the screen hard to see. In addition the dashboard is at such an angle that if I try to pull out the MagGrip a bit to try and adjust the angle it will fall out of the vent.I would have no reservations buying the MagGrip if I had a smaller phone or if I had a different vehicle where the vents and dash were designed differently.
5,I had been wanting to get a product like this but wasn’t willing to buy the apple one. This is such great quality for the price. The magnet is very strong it keeps my phone very safe. I love the simplistic design I have the 12 mini and I can’t see the mount behind my phone.
5,Simple and functional easy to install and it has a good magnet.
5,Bardzo dobrze współpracuje z MagSafe mocny magnes trzyma urządzenie bardzo mocno
4,Il répond bien au besoin - le téléphone tient parfaitement et n’est pas trop difficile à décrocher
3,Den är för stor för att få plats ordentligt min BMW e90 skulle inte rekomendera dessvärre
4,Perfetto per Iphone 12! Estetica minimale non troppo ingombrante come tante altre che si trovano in vendita e rimane ben salda alla bocchetta dell'aria. Come riportato nella descrizione è essenziale usarlo con un telefono senza cover o con cover con magsafe.. vedrete che non cadrà!
4,The mount is very sleek and doesn’t look out of place in my car. It holds my iPhone in any orientation. However it either doesn’t hold onto the car vent very well or holds onto the phone too well as when you go to remove the phone from the holder it pulls the mount off too.
4,Por la posición de las rejillas en mi coche no queda bien fijado y se cae una y otra vez con el coche en marcha con el consiguiente riesgo. Lo que está muy bien es la sujeción a la rejilla la más fuerte que he visto. Supongo que en otros modelos funcionará estupendamente.
5,Excellent product and customer service.
5,Ottimo grip sulla presa d’aria lo utilizzo quotidianamente con cover magsafe e non si smuove nemmeno con vibrazioni da dossi o buche. Comodo e rapido nella presa del magnete consigliatissimo
4,Auf der Suche nach einem Magnet Halter für die Lüftungsschlitze im Auto bin ich lediglich auf dieses Produkt zugestoßen welches eine große Fläche bzw. In der gewünschten Größe diese Runde Form hatte. Vorher hatte ich einen Magnet Halter der ebenfalls stark war aber der lediglich einen 2€ großen Kreis halten sollte. Nun zurück zu diesem Produkt hier. Ich kaufe ausschließlich ESR Produkte und somit kaufte ich mir für mein neues iPhone 13 pro ein Case welches extra noch hinten wie bei den original iPhone Hüllen einen weißen Kreis Magneten hat. Ich habe hier einige Rezensionen gelesen gehabt wo welche davon berichten das der Magnet zu stark sei und beim iPhone abnehmen direkt der ganze Magnet mit heraus kommt und das kann ich definitiv bestätigen. Nach erstem Test also iPhone 13 pro an den Magneten dran gehalten und Zack wow Bomben fest hielt es. Kein wackeln nichts. Angekommen und iPhone abnehmen wollen und ja tatsächlich kam die ganze Halterung bzw. der Magnet mit ab. Es hielt weiterhin am iPhone bzw. CASE hinten dran. Das Case kann nichts für. Die Halterung kann nichts für. Ich erkläre mir das so dass die Fläche vom Magneten physikalisch gesehen zu groß ist und auf der iPhone Rückseite eben Bomben fest einfach hält. Wahrscheinlich gibt es Magnete die nicht so stark sind aber dennoch einen super halt bietet aber müsste man suchen. Ich fand von der Fläche her lediglich dieses Produkt für das iPhone 13 pro passend.Also da kann man niemanden Vorwürfe machen jedoch der einzigste Kritik Punkt ist der Wucher Preis ! Maximal 6€ wären fair so nach dem Motto leben und leben lassen. Bei nicht gefallen einfach weg schmeißen. Jedoch was soll man bei diesem Preis sagen? Ich habe es gekauft ja weil es sonst Magnete gibt die leider nicht dieses gewünschte Format haben. Einen Magneten im Auto hatte ich ja schon wo ich das iPhone 12 mini benutzte und wunschlos glücklich damit war aber dieser Magnet hält nicht bzw. funktioniert nicht mit einem größeren Gerät.Ich denke hier hat der Verkäufer ganz klar seine Chance ausgenutzt und sein noch "einzigartiges" Produkt für einen Wucher eingestellt bzw. Verkauft.Ps. Amazon danke TOP service.
5,Ottimo pratico e affidabileottima la presa non si stacca mai da solo
5,Molto bello elegante ed essenziale ! Calamita molto potente !
5,Très bon produit iPhone bien accroché.
5,Hält das Gerät sehr gut fest. Man muss dazusagen dass eine MagSafe fähige Hülle zwingend erforderlich ist falls man das Handy mit einer Hülle benutzt. Das Gerät hält ohne und mit einer MagSafe fähigen Hülle sehr gut. Es ist such einfach anzubringen. Kann ich nur empfehlen!
5,Abbinato a esr cover Magsafe è quello che cercavo. Ottimo prodotto
5,Tiene muy buena sujeción con la funda MagSafe de Spigen. El móvil no se cae incluso pasando por unos baches grandes y en curvas rápidas
4,Starker Magnet
5,Malgré certains mauvais commentaires j’ai tenté et je ne suis pas du tout déçu.
5,Magnet ist stark gefällt mir sehr gut!
5,Es bastante resistente y sujeta el móvil muy bien además de que se puede poner en horizontal o en vertical. Ahora que lo tengo pienso que podría haberlo cogido con cable para que me sirviese también de cargador...
5,Kein Handy Case Keine Metallplatte & keine riesen Handyhalterung!Einfach in den Lüfter damit und fertig.
5,Die Handy Halterung macht genau das was sie soll. Nämlich das Handy ordentlich festhalten. Dies ist hier der Fall. Natürlich bewegt es sich etwas in den Lüftungslamellen aber das ist normal. Ich kann bei meinem A6 nichts bemängeln. Abnehmen lässt es sich auch ohne das die Halterung sich löst. Kurz und knapp: Alles bestens !
5,Super simples e facil de usar adoro
5,Overall great product. Sleek minimal looks and sturdy build quality. Very strong magnet and stays well in the vent. Using it for iPhone 13 PRO in a 2010 VW Polo.
4,Magnete davvero eccellente  si regge molto bene in auto e non si stacca praticamente in nessun modo
3,Lässt sich leicht ins Lüftungsgitter klemmen.Leider ist die Konstruktion dann aber so schwer dass alles nach unten zeigt.Also nicht mehr wirklich praktisch.
4,Según lo esperado.
5,Die Halterung ist minimalistisch schlicht und bisher bei uns ohne Kratzer. Wenn kein Telefon daran befestigt ist fällt sie im Auto kaum auf.Als Handy haben bereits ein iPhone 12 und ein iPhone 13mini bei unterschiedlichsten Reisen daran geklept. Ohne dass sie abgefallen oder heruntergerutscht sind.Auch super ist dass man das Handy dank des Magneten auch horizontal befestigen kann. Google Maps funktioniert so finde ich noch besser.Für Eltern vielleicht auch super um Videos im horizontalen Format abzuspielen.
4,Very impressed with this car mount for my iPhone 13 pro max. The phone itself is fairly heavy but is no problem for the mount. I’ve driven 100’s of miles with my phone in as a sat nav and has not fallen off once I love the sleek look this one has compared to the others listed on Amazon as they’re too bulky
4,si incastra bene nella bocchetta dell'aria della mia Polo 2012. Ho un iPhone 13 Pro Max e per il momento sembra attaccarsi bene al supporto ed è abbastanza stabile. Per il momento non ho riscontrato nessuna negatività
4,Buon supporto magsafe abbastanza stabile nella norma insomma.
5,Preisleistung unschlagbar
5,Sencillo práctico y cómodo brindando al móvil una sujección segura y estable. Ideal para utilizar el GPS del móvil.
3,An sich kein schlechtes Produkt.Leider zieht man die Halterung mit heraus wenn man das Handy nur gerade abziehen will.(Wenn man das Handy dreht beim Abziehen funktioniert es dass die Halterung drauf bleibt)Könnte somit stärkere Halter benötigen ansonsten alles Super.
3,Anfangs war der Halt an den Lamellen der Lüftungsdüsen noch in Ordnung und man konnte das iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro) problemlos vom Magnethalter ziehen ohne dass sich dieser selbst aus den Lamellen der Lüftung mit herauszog. Leider nach gut 4 Monaten täglichem Gebrauch ist kaum noch ein Platz in den Lüftungslamellen zu finden wo sich der Magnethalter wirklich dauerhaft befestigen läßt! Die Saugkraft des Magnethalters und/oder des iPhones ist so stark dass der Magnethalter jedesmal beim Entfernen des iPhones aus den Lüftungslamellen herausgezogen wird! Einfach nur nervig!
4,I've been looking for a while for my iPhone 12 using the MagSafe case magnet. The vent holder is really good except that you cannot pull your phone of without pulling the car vent holder with it which means you have to re fit it every time you remove the phone. I'll stick with it though.
4,Il supporto è di buona qualità. La potenza di aggancio è buona. Non mi è mai capitato fino ad ora che durante la guida mi cadesse. Anche lungo strade bianche. Lo consiglio
3,Dopo pochi mesi di utilizzo balla tutto l’attacco
5,- Iphone 12 Pro Max con funda HaloLock una combinación perfecta!- Probado con 500 CV. Perfección!
3,Ist ok aber nicht auf dauer
5,Usato per iPhone 13 pro MaxPerfetto
5,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo
4,Tellement puissant que le support vient avec le téléphone. Mais malgré tout je le retourne pas pratique en conduite quand on veut le prendre.Dommage.
4,Bon produit s’aimante très bien mais le soucis c’est que la disposition des grilles de ma voiture ne permettent pas dans profiter correctement.
4,Ottimo prodotto compatto e bello da vedere unica pecca quella che ogni tanto si stacca e l’iPhone cade.
4,Très bon produit l’aimant colle vraiment bien c’est même trop puissant. Le diamètre du support magnétique est bien adapté pour les téléphones avec un anneau métallique type magsafe ( ø ext 55 mm ) s’agrippe bien dans les ailles d’aérateurs.
5,Ich liebe es mein iPhone 12 pro max war Bomben fest und ist auch nicht abgefallen auch wenn die Fahrbahn Mal uneben gewesen ist.Nur der Preis war viel zu teuer für ein Magnet ansonsten einfach genial nimmt nicht viel Platz weg und ist bombenfest .
4,Nel complesso un buon prodotto. Il telefono aderisce perfettamente alla superficie metallica e la presa è ben salda unica pecca sono i ganci da inserire nelle fessure dell'aria che a mio parere dovevano essere più strette e dure per evitare che il prodotto scivoli sulle plastiche.
4,Magnet is strong enough but sometimes it is so strong that the phone holder comes off with the phone.
3,Teil an sich ganz gut . Die Klemme hält nur nicht so gut. Der Magnet würde Leier am Handy bleiben als an dem Lüftungsgitter . Es Schein als wenn die Metallarme in inneren sich immer wieder ausdehnen und es damit locker wird . Nervt halt zum Teil leider . Dafür aber angenehm flach und schlicht .
4,Stabilità ottima peccato la forza di attrazione del mag ma comunque il telefono rimane ben saldo
4,Easy to install doesn’t look messy in your car.
3,Hace tanto iman que cuando coges el teléfono te llevas en la mano el telefono y el soporte detrás…
5,Bought this for my new car. I have an iPhone 13 pro max so I was a bit nervous if it would hold due to the weight of the phone. It holds like a dream with my MagSafe phone case! Not once has it nearly come off the front vent or the phone falling off. My only qualm is that the grip holding the phone to the front vent is a bit too tight! It took me a while to get the stand onto the front vent. Now that it’s on its ideal. Would definitely recommend!
5,Use it for my iPhone 13 pro which is a heavy phone. Magnet strong enough to hold it. Initially the holder kept coming off with the phone but once I pushed it in fully and used a side clipping of manoeuvre it works fine. Easy to install. Just push into the vent.Works well with myMagSafe case. No need to attach a metal strip to the phone or case.
1,Die Qualität ist sehr dürftig für den Preis. Einfachste denkbare Bauart in dieser Preisklasse bieten andere eine deutlich bessere Passgenauigkeit/Materialien und vor allem eine handy-/hüllenschonende Oberfläche oder Beschichtung.Die harte scharfe Gehäusekante um den blanken Magneten steht etwas vor und schneidet sich so schnell und deutlich in das Apple-Leder-Case (nach der ersten Fahrt dauerhaft beschädigt) dass auch bei härteren Cases spätestens nach einer Weile eine Beschädigung zu erwarten ist.Der Magnet hält gut die Klemmung in der Lüftung nicht gut genug um beim Abnehmen des Handys klemmen zu bleiben. Damit kann man aber umgehen wenn man das Handy seitlich statt senkrecht abzieht.Schön ist die flache und einfache Bauart - aber die Ausführung ist ein klares KO-Kriterium.
5,Diese sehr handliche MacSafe Halterung macht was es soll. Sehr stabil im Lüftungsschlitz verankert und auch der Magnet hält das iPhone ausreichend stark fest.Besonders ausrichten kann man das natürlich nicht aber dafür wie gesagt sehr schön kompakt.Kann ich nur empfehlen.
3,Nicht ganz so optimal.Magnethaftung ist sehr gut nur beim Handy abnehmen kommt die ganze Halterung mit da die Befestigungsnippel nicht so gut am Lüftungsgitter haften.Würde ich so nicht nochmal Kaufen habe mich für das Belkin OtterBox entschieden definitiv besser und es bleibt am Gitter haften
3,Ottima adesione con magsafe ma il sistema di aggancio alle bocchette dell’aria non riesce a tenere a tanta forza magnetica…risultato? Ogni volta che vai a prendere il cellulare tiri via tutto il pacchetto….il che non risulta tanto comodo
2,Supporto auto mag safe con calamita molto potente e resistente ha però un difetto…quando tenti di rimuovere il telefono si rimuove il supporto dalla bocchetta dell’aria…è molto antipatica come cosa.Poi non mi sono accorto in fase di acquisto che ha la testa fissa e non mobile.Virato su altro prodotto più performante!!
4,Molto comodo per chi ha magsafe
5,Queda discreto en el salpicadero y es muy cómodo de usar con un IPhone con MagSafe
2,Il porta telefono di per sè funziona ma è necessario togliere la cover (il che non è per niente pratico) altrimenti il telefono cade evidentemente la calamita è troppo debole per un telefono come l’iPhone 12 o 13. Ho dovuto fare il reso.
5,Mein iPhone 12 wird super gehalten mit Hülle. Hebt super an der Lüftung.Sehr schlicht Qualität gut.
5,Holds my iPhone13 Pro Max no problem. It has a powerful magnet which grips onto the MagSafe in my case. I have a genuine Apple silicone phone case with MagSafe. Cannot comment on its strength for other magnetic cases. 10/10 for the price I’m really happy
2,Le ventole della mia macchina non sono rigide da muovere ma abbastanza leggere e il telefono non sta dritto ma punta verso il basso
5,Oggetto di buona manifattura che tiene saldamente in mio IPhone alla bocchetta del condizionatore.Testato anche sullo sconnesso funziona senza tentennamenti.Lo consiglio
3,Magnet hält super aber Halterung an der Lüftung nicht sehr lange
3,Buona aderenza grazie alla tecnologia magsafe l unica pecca è l ancoraggio alla bocchetta di areazione dell’auto non molto stabile. Ma tutto sommato Per il prezzo che costa ottimo prodotto
5,Le seul bémol de se produit pourrait être au moment où l’on décroche le téléphone … l’embout ne reste jamais sur le système ventilation et reste toujours sur le téléphone au vu de la puissance des aimants
5,Simple et efficaceAttention à bien avoir une coque de téléphone adaptée sinon adhérence de l’aimant faible
5,Gut
3,troppo piccolo e stretto non si riesce a muovere il telefono
5,Ich war auf der Suche nach einer Magsafe Autohalterung die Klein und Fein ist da die meisten die hier angebotenen sehr Groß sind weit heraus stehen und klobig wirken.Das anbringen an die Lamellen ist sehr einfach und die Haltekraft reicht für ein Iphone 12 Pro mit Apple Leder Case vollkommen aus.
1,Nach einer Woche hat sich die oberste Beschichtung gelöst. Handy hält super ist aber so unbrauchbar.Ich möchte mein Geld zurück.
5,Alles bestens
1,Qualität nicht gut man zieht immer wieder die Halterung aus den Lüftungsdüsen und der Kopf löst sich schon von der Halterung nach 1 Tag.
3,Muy caro para la tontería que es.Algo positivo que tiene es que se le puede quitar el gancho y así poder pegarlo
2,Ne tiens pas dans la grille et je doit tenir le support pour retirer le telephone
5,Ottimo prodotto. Con IPhone 13 funziona perfettamente sia con cover che senza. La cover deve però essere originale Apple con magsafe integrato altrimenti usando una cover generica potreste avere problemi di tenuta.
5,Era da un bel po’ che cercavo un supporto MagSafe per iPhone 12 ne avevo ordinato uno prima di questo ma non andava bene per le bocchette dell’aria della mia auto VW Polo. Questo è perfetto facile da installare e ha una presa bella potente ovviamente con una cover MagSafe o al limite senza cover! Lo consiglio!!!
5,Je suis très satisfait de mon achat il est très résistant et ça colle bien 🤩
5,Bien pour la voiture il faut pas une coque trop épaisse…….dommage que le système ne pivote pas de droite à gauche !
5,Only down side is if you put your phone on upside down
2,attacca perfettamente al telefono pure troppo.Infatti non rimane attaccato alla presa d’aria della macchina e ogni volta che si prende il telefono il supporto rimane attaccato.
5,Practico sirve perfectamente para lo q es!!
2,Very powerful magnet / so much so that it comes out my air vent every time I remove my phone.UPDATE - this now doesn’t work at all. Totally failed. My iPhone 13 mini just fell off and won’t reattach. Disappointingly expense for 6 months use.
5,Habe mir kürzlich ein iPhone 13 Pro mit dazu passender MagSafe-Hülle gekauft und mir deshalb diese Handyhalterung zugelegt. Die Halterung hält das Handy perfekt und vor allem sehr fest. Nur zu empfehlen!
2,Leider passt die Halterung nicht in einen Skoda Enyaq. Der Magnet scheint das iPhone zwar halten können aber die Halterung selbst lässt sich nicht stabil in der Lüftung fixieren.
2,Returning as it fails in its primary task.
5,Unreal product
1,Il prodotto ha una capacità magnetica talmente modesta da non riuscire a trattenere saldamente neanche il mio iphone 13 MINI che non é certo lo smartphone più pesante con magsafe.la distanza tra il piatto magnetico e il fermaglio in gomma per le alette dell'aria é talmente minima che se avete un cruscotto appena inclinato il telefono non riuscirà ad attaccarsi (e ripeto io ho un iphone miji che é il più corto) .Purtroppo 19 euro buttati via. Si perché tentare un reso ad Amazon in quest'ultimo periodo é diventato un terno al lotto. Sono più i resi persi e non rimborsati che quelli che vanno a buon fine. Auguri a tutti.
2,Der Magnet hält zwar was er verspricht jedoch der ist so stark oder wiederum die Halterung so schwach dass das iPhone 13 Pro zusammen mit dem Magnetischen Autohalterung vom Lüftungsgitter mitgenommen wird.
1,ATTENTION ARNAQUE !Produit livré mais emballage VIDE !!!
5,Dall’aspetto essenziale e minimal rimane discreto sul cruscotto della macchina e il magnete è molto potente. L’iPhone resta ben saldo e non cade anche viaggiando su terreni sconnessi.
1,Positive is the MagSafe is strong however mine looked used already with marks visible. Even the plastic looked like it was reapplied after waiting nearly two weeks for this to arrive with no update from the seller I’m very disappointed rather than sending it back I said I’d try it but for the iPhone 13 pro it doesn’t hold it very well from the vent. It’s too thin and the vent pulls down it’s only when the dash connects with the phone to support the mount it stays. After multiple vent mounts over the years this is terrible and I have to return it.
5,Ottimo funziona bene magnete molto forte !
5,Molto resistente ma solo se si toglie la custodia dell’ iPhone diversamente a me si stacca il telefono senza custodia invece non può cadere ha moltissima presa
1,Die Haltung geht leider postwendend wieder zurück. Der Magnet selber hat zu wenig Abstand zum Armaturenbrett bei meinem Mazda2 so dass das iPhone 13 gerade so daran hält. Da aber das Teil nicht fest genug am Lüftungsgitter sitzt hat man jedes Mal die komplette Halterung in der Hand wenn man das Handy abnehmen möchte. Da hilft auch kein Drehen da sich dann die ganze Halterung mitdreht. 👎 Für mich leider ungeeignet.
1,wenn Ihr eine Hülle mit Rundem Magneten habt bei dem der Innenkreis nicht ausgefüllt ist wird diese Halterung das Produkt nicht halten können
5,Parfait pour mon iPhone 12pro
1,Die Aufnahme hat nur einen Schlitz wer also ein Lüftungsgitter mit horizontaler UND vertikaler Verstellmöglichkeit hat bekommt die Halterung nicht angebracht. Ich dachte mir was soll‘s und habe noch einen zweiten Schlitz reingesägt. Hielt dann und hat gepasst allerdings ist der Magnet sehr unterdimensioniert und konnte mein iPhone 13 Pro nicht wirklich lange festhalten. Laut Beschreibung wäre das Gewicht aber kein Problem. Ab in die Tonne.
5,Eine super Lösung. Als Saughalterung sehr gut!
1,The attachment is too big for my air vents in the car. The suction is strong however it stretches the vents in my car despite showing that it is suitable for most air vents. This is disappointing as I had a similar product with my iPhone 11 Pro Max and it is a very convenient phone holder.
5,Solido affidabile perfetto per il suo scopo
1,Me llego la funda rallada nada mas abrir el paquete
2,Me acabo de llegar y parece que está despegado de una parte. Por 18euros que cuesta no parece muy confiable. Habrá que probarlo pero no me inspira confianza
5,Lo sto usando da poco ma sembra avere una buona tenuta. Se avesse lo snodo orientabile sarebbe perfetto.
2,New  It comes already with not in good shape
5,Ottimo prodotto Amazon o perfetto
1,La calamita è molto debole!! Poi gli incastri dove si deve inserire nelle bocchette sono molto hrandi e quindi le alette delle bocchette si piegano
1,Aiment juste…
1,
1,Ne reste pas en place. Tombe avec le poids du téléphone. Se détache quand on veut reprendre le téléphone. Objectivement c’est inutile.
1,Did not fit my car vents nor my iPhone 13 mini. The magnet is way too large. Avoid this.
1,Das Magnet ist ganz gut aber die Halterung rutscht immer aus der Halterung. Daher ist die Halterung unbrauchbar.
1,Suction power is not the problem. The thing attaches to the phone alright but it comes the car dash every time you pull the phone out.
1,Trotz der größeren Fläche sind die Magneten nicht stark genug das Mobiltelefon festzuhalten. Bis zu einer Montage im Auto bin ich gar nicht gekommen. Ohne Hülle ist das Pixel 6 Pro einfach vom Magneten runtergerutscht.
5,Buon prodotto
1,Una porcheria dopo neanche un mese il supporto cade da solo dalla bocchetta dell’auto. Almeno l’aggancio alle bocchette fatelo a croce che magari regge di più. Una ladrata.
1,nicht gut
1,Mein Handy hält nur ohne Schutzhülle. Sehr ärgerlich.
1,Usato in auto e al primo dosso è cascato il cellulare …pessima presa
1,This could not support the weight of myiPhone at all. The phone just kept falling off. Had to be returned.
1,Item arrived damaged. The vent clips has come off the magnet
1,À la moindre secousse le téléphone tombe! ne fait pas le travail!!
2,Not compatible only works for certain type of vents
5,Es un buen soporte es sencillo pero estable y muy facil de instalar y usar. Resiste el manejo y es facil de manipular el telefono para quitar o poner.
