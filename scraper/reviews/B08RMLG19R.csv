5,This works really well üòå ‚ò∫Ô∏è for my game system.. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
4,I saw a lot of reviews saying that these don't work but they connect to my Xbox fine. Even without my battery in my controller it worked perfectly. Cord was strong and long enough.
5,highly recommend this
3,I'm not sure if it was just the controller but the cable didn't plug in well leading to a lack of power making controller just not work on general. üòï
3,this is a great charger if you‚Äôre looking for one to fit in the Microsoft branded wired controllers that have the weird rectangular hole that leads to the charging port this is exactly what you want. just wish both of the cables came functioning but ill more than likely buy this pack again
4,Thumbs up work as advertised no complaints from me.
5,Dudes. These are the best off brand micro USB controller cords I've ever used!!! When you plug it into your controller there is this snap you can feel like it just POP locks into place. It's a secure feeling and fit. They don't stick out too far threatening to snap apart like some. And they fit perfectly down jnto that recessed charge port on the controller. They are also super long which is an absolute must! I've also used them to charge my phone and battery banks. Zero issues whatsoever. I'm very impressed with these. I have a9 and a 5 yr old who are notorious micro USB(and hdmi) cord serial killers. Not even they have put a dent in these bad boys. Love them. Will most definitely be ordering more
2,So I don't own an Xbox but I have an Xbox One controller that I use for my PC gaming. This cable does not sync it only charges. It might work fine with an actual Xbox and the problem might be with Microsoft honestly. The fact that I'm running Windows and my Microsoft built controller doesn't work seamlessly through Bluetooth says a lot about the company. It literally needs to be plugged in to work properly which is why I bought these longer cables but like I said they don't sync so for me they are useless.
5,Alot of reviews say it doesn't fit..  well it fits perfectly on everything I've tried. It locks in tight. And the flexibility of the braided cable is amazing. I always play games wired and it's so light and flexible you can't even tell you are not wireless.  Would always get this type again
5,Very long. Love that it‚Äôs the braided rope stuff so it won‚Äôt break so dang easily. Perfect for using my Xbox controller with my PC
5,Great product I can finally wire my Xbox controller to my Xbox one s and pc
5,It is a lot more sturdier and durable then the common cords
5,This works perfectly as described and its long cable too. I'm loving it. Works with my Xbox One S
2,Only one of the cords worked.
2,It's a pack of 2 . One works great does the job no issues the other one doesn't work at all . Wouldn't work in any of our 6 controllers. I don't see any damage or reason for it not to work it just simply won't power anything on. Bad wiring inside?  So mixed reviews had they both worked easy 5 star.
5,My nephew needed it for gaming.  It worked great.
2,The cord itself is nice BUT it doesn't have any grips on the sides that connect to the controller. After a little time of play the cord disconnects due to vibration of the controller. I have since gone back to using an old cord that stays connected vs getting killed due to ontroller disconnecting.
5,Not gonna lie I was a little skeptical based on the price but these cables work great!! 5/5 recommend.
5,They work
2,Doesn't worth it
1,These cords stopped working after only a few weeks after purchasing them. They were cheaply priced and performed that way. I wouldn‚Äôt but them again.
5,Like the length used for x box
1,Wiring sucked more than the thought of you making the wire‚Ä¶If I were you I‚Äôd give up fire chastise or even revoke wiring ever being made again‚Ä¶Rappers sing about a lot of money but this is just terriblenow I‚Äôm starting to see the effects of more money because of this terrible wiring y‚Äôall did everyone need to just stand back smart phones need to just need to die down because terrible wiring like the product I was givin should not be aloud under any surcumstances never should be played or used of this is the way you give products‚Ä¶I thank you for your time energy money go to hell and I will be keeping the product I was sold $11‚Ä¶.Wiring needs checking checking CHECKING!!!!! Thank You!Your wonderful customer‚Ä¶.Drew

3,This cable is a data syncing cable. I bought this thinking it was only a charger according to bottom of listing stating that it was only charging. Using a Bluetooth controller and charging at the same time will mess with your computer and make double inputs for system.
4,It worked cable is long
5,I got these for my 13yo gaming son. He‚Äôs pretty rough on his things and chargers happen to be one of the things he can‚Äôt seem to keep working for very long. These chargers have actually held up nicely for almost 6 months now and I‚Äôm shocked! He played his XBox all summer and now plays on the weekends and uses these cords constantly. They haven‚Äôt shorted or given out at all. A nice length as well. We definitely recommend these!
5,Needed a replacement charging cord for both our Xbox controllers and my son's Samsung Tab.This cord is long and very sturdy with the nylon construction. The port connection is very snug and fits tight on the Xbox controller. We are using the other to charge our USB-B tablets as well and it charges at high speed and again nice secure port connection.Overall very satisfied with these cables and will order again when the dog destroys them.
3,The end of the plastic that boxes in the micro USB is too wide so it doesn‚Äôt let me plug it into my controller. If the plastic was slimmer it would fit in my controller. I‚Äôm disappointed but there isn‚Äôt anything I can do. Aside from this issue the cord seems really nice.
5,Good quality charging cable. It's sturdy and holds up well.
3,I think this cable works well. But personally I would prefer you buy a wired controller for  the Xbox One instead.
