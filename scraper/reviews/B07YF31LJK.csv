5,I bought this to help elevate my Lenovo ThinkPad wired keyboard.  The keyboard has two little feet that can help raise it up a little bit but it's still too low for me.I started looking for aftermarket keyboard risers; these fit the bill perfectly.  According to some reviews of the ThinkPad keyboard the keyboard is probe to flexing inward/downward when typing.  I wanted a keyboard riser that would provide additional support underneath the keyboard preventing it from flexing.  The GPG2 Esc Flip Keyboard and Laptop Stand does just that.Additionally the three different heights allowed me to play around with how high I want to elevate my keyboard.  I've set it for the medium elevation for now the height reminds me of when I first learned to type on a typewriter.  That said even the low elevation can work for me.  Of course I also had to pair the keyboard with a wrist rest to make typing that much more comfortable.I haven't tried to readjust the stand after I initially set it in place.  As a result I cannot vouch for its ability to be reset/repositioned.  If I ever do end up repositioning the stand I'll come back and updated my review.
4,Have only had the items for a few minutes but it definitely does what it's supposed to. The only complaint that I would have is that it appears to be somewhat overpriced though not by much.If you want to put your keyboard or laptop at a higher angle this definitely is for you.
5,Having the height options is a game changer— better wrist movement
3,Originally when I purchased this it worked well. I could get lost in typing and didn't have to worry even when I needed to move my portable keyboard from place to place. However in recent months the adhesive no longer sticks to the back of the keyboard thereby rendering this almost completely useless. Once the adhesive went so did the stability when using it just to hold the keyboard at an ergonomic height. I've even thought about trying to use the picture hanging command strips to keep this device at least functionable but honestly I'm not sure how they would work since command strips aren't flexible which is a very good thing if used for their intended purpose.So as a result I've ordered a keyboard stand that I hope will work in place of this. It sucks because it will take a bit more effort to pack up for travel needs but it is what it is. Using this little handy device was fun until it became a nuisance and now just a wasted effort on my part.
5,I've had three of these on various computers for about a year and thought it was time to write a review.Basically all of them have worked perfectly:  None of them have come unglued yet they were easily re-positionable when needed; none have broken; all have been completely stable; and of course they hold keyboards up at angles that for me (high angle) and my wife (low angle) make typing more comfortable.
5,Sturdy stable easy to carry -- I use this stand all the time with my laptop at home and especially when working outside.
5,This product should be your first and last option. I tried various keyboard stands which did not help or postion to my liking. These footers are perfect and meet my adjustment requirements. Don't waste money on the stands.
4,Great quick fix for keyboard angle.Would like finer adjustments.  But worth the buy! I ended up buying three sets.Wife’s desk my desk and computer in my family room
5,Was skeptic at first. I love my Logitech MX keyboard but man does it sit to low. It’s the perfect keyboard now with this simple attachment. Would’ve gotten sooner had I known this product existed.
4,The clips on the back of my keyboard broke so I purchased this to take their place. It works great. I wish it was a tad bit longer for my keyboard but for the smaller size keyboards it would fit perfectly Adheres great and has great angles.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have spend a week trying to get it to stick by putting clamps on it over night washing the sticky part. Maybe I just got a bad one.
5,Great product works very well!
5,Pleasently surprised that it is a great hight for typing. Decided to make a review since most of the reviews are for keyboards. I actually use it for my macbook pro--- and this is great. Will be buying others as needed. Thanks.
5,Unobtrusive perfect minimal setting and solved a problem I didn't know was bugging me until using an older magic keyboard model with the battery chamber serving as the same ergonomic comfort. Dunno what Apple was thinking but this tricks out the keyboard without detracting from aesthetics. Great economical and solid product. Bought one for work station too.
3,I really wanted to like this keyboard stand but I’m not thrilled with it. I have two of them for two keyboards and I’ll be typing (not aggressively) and then the stand pops off the back of the keyboard. I’ve tried the washing them with water and it doesn’t make aDifference. I did see someone who answered a question say she picked up some rubber pads (used to keep cabinets from making noise when you close them) at her local hardware store so I’m going to try that.
5,I installed this on my Apple keyboard and it helps my ergonomic posture.  I type faster more accurately and my wrists feel better after a long day.
5,HOLDS KEYBOARD STEADY
5,very happy with the purchase! simple and it works easy.
5,The product does work on our full size keyboard. The length is shorter than expected and length is not adjustable.  Dims are 9" x 2".  The design is great. Soft rubber feet keep it from sliding around on our desktop.  Overall we are very pleased with this product.
5,Easy to attach to my apple keyboard. I finally have relief and no longer having to take long breaks in between. Getting work done.
5,Got a new computer at work which came with a super thin keyboard. Adding this stand was a big improvement.  It could be a bit wider and it would be more stable but this hasn’t been too much of a problem.
5,It was exactly as described and so adjustable. Highly recommend! I’ve removed it from one and attached to another keyboard without any issue. No residue and it stuck to the other one like it did the first time.
5,I bought this not so much to relieve stress on hands fingers etc. but because my MX keys keyboard was giving me glare under the lighting conditions on my computer desk.  The angled legs gave me a comfortable viewing angle and actually I like the angle for my amateurish two finger typing.  I find it sturdy and comfortable to use.  Easy to adjust the legs and seems to be sturdy I am happy with my purchase.
5,I wished I had this last year when I was working from home.  This is great!
3,Works great!! If you have a flat back keyboard. If it has the slightest change in that then it slides. In fairness I really liked it and it was the perfect height. But I was constantly having to straighten it.
5,This is exactly the thing you need if you want to add an angle to your magic keyboard so that it stops hurting you when you type. I spend a lot of time at my Mac mini and had recently gone back to using an older plug in ergonomic keyboard for windows because I couldn’t take the flatness of the magic keyboard. But with that I lost so much functionality with my mac. This little keyboard footer was the best thing I bought from Amazon this month.It has 4 different heights depending on if you leave it flat or open the feet. It’s a wonderful investment.
5,My company recently brought us back to the office. I had developed a set-up at home that involved propping up a laptop on a catalog that really worked for me. Back in the office I immediately missed that angled keyboard. After a week of propping it up in various ways I went looking for a real solution. This works. It securely attaches. The legs are sturdy and stay in place in all positions. The middle setting is just right for me. Depending on where you attach the stand you can definitely find the right height. Moving the stand more toward the center of the back of the keyboard even a little changes the angle quite a bit. For me installing as directed was just right. The other selling point for me was that it is removeable as the keyboard is company property.  I use a full-sized keyboard with the number pad. Even though the riser is small enough to use on a much smaller keyboard it works beautifully with mine as well. Highly recommend.
5,I primarily work on Apple computers and my work gave me a magic keyboard and magic mouse. No issues except the keyboard sits flat. This product does a wonderful job making typical much more comfortable. Apple should include this in the box. Highly recommend
5,There should be a sturdier version w legs that lock and height adjustable. I’m sure they have it but other then that this is working great for me.
5,This works awesome
5,I like it and it’s make my life easier. However if they can add measurements paper for installation on magic keyboard (for iMac) or common keyboards will be grate. Overall I liked it and strongly recommend it.  5 stars
5,I recently bought a new wireless mac keyboard only to discover that it's totally flat - no little flip-up feet like on previous models. Not very ergonomic. This set me on a quest to find an additional part that would elevate the back of my keyboard. I tried a couple of other things including just sticking erasers under the front of the keyboard. Those options were cheaper and they didn't require me to affix anything to my keyboard. But they also didn't work very well - I couldn't move the keyboard without readjusting the position of whatever was elevating the front and sometimes they shifted around on their own as I typed (I'm a pretty fast and forceful typist). I finally got over the thing about having something actually stuck to my keyboard (I haven't tested whether it really is easy to remove) and I'm glad I did. It really makes it a more stable setup.
5,This is exactly what I needed for my Apple wireless keyboard. Just a little lift works wonders when typing and the grip keeps the keyboard from moving. I use the lowest setting. Application was quick and easy. 👍🏻
5,It’s a great product! I wanted to use it so badly but it didn’t work for my keyboard which had built in ones. My keyboard offered no space to place this one or I would’ve used it. I have to return it regretfully.
5,This is easy to stick on the bottom of a keyboard.  There are 3 different heights that can be used. It's a great way to change the height of your keyboard.
5,Your enjoyment will depend greatly on the size of your keyboard. I bought two of these stands and used them on two very different keyboards. One was a small slimline Bluetooth keyboard and the other was a full size gaming keyboard. The smaller keyboard had a perfectly flat back and the stand fit nearly perfect on it. The larger keyboard's back was contoured so the fit was not nearly as well. However the stands performed well on both keyboards. If you're a heavy handed typist then you might flip these over or cause your keyboard to rock while you type. I have learned to type more lightly due to these stands which keeps them stable and effective. The two settings work fine though I noticed that the higher height setting was much less stable on my desk. Could be my desk. Thus far I've had these for months and they are still holding firm on both keyboards haven't slipped off and still work as advertised. Definitely worth the money.
5,this was far better than the one I returned.  It stays in place and is comfortable
5,It seemed expensive for a piece of plastic but It's worth it.The last keyboard I bought didn't have little feet to flip up to get an angle (frankly they usually don't give a good angle anyway) so I had it propped on a low box which got annoying. This gives a perfect angle for me and you have 2 options plus the keyboard doesn't slide aroundAnother thing I like is that I can reuse it. I buy a new keyboard about once a year because the lettering wears off and the stickers for the keys don't last long and I can remove this a put it on a new keyboard.
5,Very useful!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I gotta say I love this little stand. It raises those tiny Apple keyboards up high enough that I can actually see them well. It's well made and has three settings of height which you can see in my little video. It also comes off the keyboard and is reusable due to the sticky pads on it which once washed are super sticky again which is great too because I can use it with multiple keyboards if I want.  I'm gonna need to purchase one of these for all my computers! Very well made and sturdy too. I mean i wouldn't stand on it but it does not buckle under my hammer finger typing. Greatly little device. I doubt you'll regret this purchase.
5,For sure will buy again it really fit my needs
2,The position and height are good but it just doesn’t stay in place. I have to adjust it multiple times a day.
4,I could not get the keypad at the angle that I like to play games. The ESC flip did the job for me. now i can see the improvement in my game play. with the adjustable feet you can adjust the keyboard to your liking.
5,Love this. Helps so much when I’m typing all day. If you work from home or at an office you need this.
5,I loved this raiser. Currently using 2 of them and looking for purchasing another one for my new device.The only thing that may not work for everyone is that the folded version is not low enough. You still get a decent raise when you fold it all the way down. In other words you don't have flat or kinda-flat option only 3 levels of raise. Which is perfectly fine for me personally.Also the microsuction pads are reusable. They don't sit perfectly when you inspect them. But on the practical side you would realize any difference. Importand thing is you have the option to take it out when  you want to and the process doesn't damage your device the raiser itself.Great product!
5,1. Shipping was great. Delivered within 24 hours as promised.2. Product was smaller than I expected. But then I was using it for an Apple Magic Keyboard and it fit perfectly. Once aligned and stuck to the keyboard it was balanced and didn't move when I typed.3. Adjustable heights was easy to use. In picture I had it on the lowest height as I found that was easier on my wrist. The highest was too high. The medium height was not too bad but my fingers were almost 45 deg to my wrist. So the lowest height was perfect. If I do get a wrist keyboard rest I might see if the other heights would work. Note that the height will change the angle of the keyboard to your desk. So it doesn't really raise the keyboard but moves the angle of the top of the keyboard.4. Product didn't move when used.
5,Great potable fan.  It’s light weight smalll but puts out great volume of air!  Not noisy.
5,It has given me more desk space for my home office.
5,Keeps keyboard at a good angle and you can move it around under the keyboard.
4,This is perfect. My one complaint is that it tends to slide forward as I am a firm fingered typist. I added an extra rubber pad at the bottom to assist. Frankly the manufacturer ought to investigate a more non-skid padding as not all typists are gentle.
5,This product works great.  I liked it so much I bought another for my MacBook.  There are three height options to choose from.  Slim sturdy and lifts my new iMac wireless keyboard the perfect height.  I recommend.
5,Had to buy a second one! Wife loved it so much for her work computer (basic Microsoft wireless 850 desktop) she wanted one for her gaming rig (Logitech G910). She has wrist problems and likes having her keyboard elevated at a steeper angle. We are now free of the random junk she's been using to prop her keyboards up. Four stars on adhesion only because one of her keyboards had some weird texture design on the back that was giving her issues. She has since handled it somehow. ( I don't know the details or even which keyboard had the issue) All I know is they are both holding up great and she loves these risers.
3,I purchased these to use with the new Microsoft Natural Ergonomic keyboard as it does not have legs that can be raised in the back.  This looked perfect.  It is a great design and has 2 separate heights that you can put it to which is great.  But make a note.  These are smaller than the picture makes you believe.  I had to use 2 of them on my keyboard (see picture above).  They seem to be built well enough and were easy to attach but the curve of the keyboard added a little more complexity.  So I'm giving 4 stars with the notice to be aware of the size.
3,....until it works itself off.
5,I needed something to prop my keyboard up just a bit higher so I could type more comfortably. This worked well. It essentially has 3 settings. I tried to photograph each. There are two "legs" on the strip that is adhered to your keyboard. For the highest lift extend them full for a medium lift flip down the "legs" to the second level and for the lowest flip the "legs" all the way down. Thats the setting I use for just that little bit of extra lift.The directions says you can easily remove it by using water and then reapply it I haven't tried that yet to see how easy it is to perform.
5,This was just what I needed raise my Logitech K780 to a more comfortable angle. Four height adjustment make it perfect. The water activated removable adhesive pads form a tight bond to the keyboard and require some force to remove the stand to get to the battery compartment on the keyboard. But on the positive side the stand is not going to fall off.
4,This is on my Apple Magic Keyboard with numeric pad. I was worried how this stand would work being that the keyboard is long. However I was pleasantly surprised at how perfectly it fits. The stand has three positions/angles (completely closed then there’s a set of short legs and long legs I use it closed). The adhesive is remarkable and works very well (it is reusable I repositioned it a few times). The only reason a star is deducted is because I think there’s a little too much angle and difference between the settings.  Despite having three choices there needs to be more. In other words it could be more adjustable. Despite that it’s a great keyboard stand and I recommend it.
4,Exceptional. Excepting the fact that nobody in their right mind types with the keyboard at an angle as steep as this allows. Would have been better starting at medium height and going one size smaller than the minimum. Would have been better served ergonomically by using an alternative stick on product.
4,New Microsoft ergonomic keyboard has no back flip things. Had to break it to make it work with wave design. Two piece option would be nice for large keyboards.
5,This keyboard riser replaced the stacks of post-it notes that for years I had taped and elastic banded together underneath my keyboard. The post it notes were no match for this keyboard riser I wish I had known about it sooner!! The adhesive fastener is truly repositionable (I've already stuck and re-positioned three times and it remains sticky). Having three height options is also great - and since the riser is repositionable moving it up or down on the back of the keyboard further allows you to play with the height. The rubber stoppers on the bottom of the feet make it solid no movement whatsoever when typing.  This is a simply but elegant solution to the problem of keyboard height and has made my keyboard so much more comfortable to type on. I can't believe this product isn't more popular it's really fantastic - highly recommended.
5,This is the second time I’ve purchased this product. It’s absolutely worth it! Sturdy stable easy to install on a keyboard and has never failed me. Great solution trusted brand thus far. Will not disappoint.Make sure your keyboard has a smooth back though otherwise this won’t work for you.
5,I used this under a wireless keyboard that I use with my Apple iMac computer. Definitely a hand and wrist saver as it allows me to rest my wrists on my desk!  In fact I just ordered another one for another similar keyboard I use with my Macbook. Great device for my keyboards!  Thanks!
5,I'm very pleased with this simple little device that perfectly to elevates my Roland V-1HD Video Mixer.
5,Yes!! THIS is what I needed! I need something to lift my magic keyboard up to reach the height of my wrist rest without putting it on an angle. I like my keyboards flat like on a laptop. I thought about using two to achieve this but I wasn’t sure if it would work. Then I saw a review for a person who did just that! It works perfectly for what I need it to do! I’m so friggin happy!! I had my keyboard sitting on a notebook at first!
5,Very easy to attach to both our keyboards and the multiple angles are great.  It's a bit short so is not solid on one end.  We solved the problem by buying an extra one and cutting off the ends and using one piece as a third leg.  The low cost made this custom adaption inexpensive and provided great stability for even the longest keyboard.  And we can remove and reattach them whenever we change keyboards.
5,Material and design are perfect. Was a great purchasing for me. I loved.
5,Realmente cumplió mis expectativas  es funcional  cómodo y de buena calidad  se puede graduar a la opción que uno requiera y para el teclado de Apple fue la mejor solución . Lo recomiendo .
5,All come with a smile inch face!!
5,I purchased two of these in order to lift my MX Keys keyboard to be more flush with a gel wrist rest that I use. I installed one unit upright and one upside down and the adjustable height worked perfectly for what I was hoping to do. I was a little worried about stability on the number pad but haven’t had any issues working from home or with personal use even when typing angry emails or getting frustrated with Excel and taking it out on my Escape key. 😉
5,Left keyboard foot keep snapping so I needed something that would last. Enter this thing. It is a very solid well made accessory. Sticks to keyboard extremely well. Lifts full size (100%) keyboard to angles keyboard feet can't reach.Does not affect keys in far corners like some reviews say. You either have to put serious pressure on it for that or not put it on right or both.Thing costs $18 for what is ultimately a first world problem but it's something you will not have to worry about again. Also comes presented well in a nice box.
5,I just bought the Logitech MX Keys keyboard and absolutely love it for working from home and programming use.  The only con I didn't like was that it didn't have much of an angle or slant like normal keyboards that I am use to.  This product was perfect and allowed me to slant my keyboard perfectly.  It is now very comfortable to type on and I have no issues so far when typing!  I can't speak for other keyboard brands/models but if you're looking for one for Logitech MX Keys this is the one to get!
3,this is a great item if you happen to own or use Mac Keyboards. it sticks very good and has adjustable legs. I do not even have to raise any of the legs because if I did it would be too high. using the default folded legs is plenty high enough. I would recommend this item to anyone who wants to get a raise out of their keyboards.
5,I cant believe it took this long for me to upgrade the angle of my keyboards. Especially now with remote work the demand for data entry is high. My wrist used to feel so heavy and tired but just using your product today I noticed a difference right away. I typed quicker less typos and the keyboard felt like an extension of me. Excellent product.If you are a designer like me writing code editing video building info graphics and UI/UX you need this product.
3,The product seemed a little small even for my keyboard which is on the smaller side (it's a 65% size very compact mechanical keyboard).  My solution was to just cut off the feet with the adhesive so I could place them at the edges of my keyboard so it would be much sturdier.  The product itself is well made thick plastic (was hard to cut through had to use wire snips) and seems durable.  Adhesive works like it's supposed to.  I would have liked it much better if they just provided the 2 feet as separate pieces and not one piece.  Also docked star because they seemed a little pricey for what you got.  I paid around $20 which seems a bit much for a piece of plastic with adhesive on it.
4,I love this thing! It has made typing so much more ergonomic with my Apple keyboard. Highly recommended.
5,Worked well on my standard size Logitech wireless keyboard. 3 height choices; I prefer the highest setting.  Keyboard feels stable while typing despite this add on not being particularly long so happy with that.  My only concern is that where I have to adhere it to center-underside of keyboard happens to fall directly over the battery compartment (so I’ll have to remove it in order to change the battery when the time comes) but that’s no fault of the gadget and I’m hopeful that by following the directions I’ll be able to re-affix it afterward. The little feet also have a little bit of grip to them so it shouldn’t slide around the desk which is nice.
4,I could not attach this stand as directed (within one inch of keyboard edge) because it covered my battery compartment -- removing the adhesive and re-attaching the stand every time I need to change my batteries would have been very time-consuming and would have worn out the adhesive. I was forced to attach it more than two inches from the edge instead. However this seems to be working and the height is just right for me.
5,Exactly what I needed for my wireless keyboard. It keeps it at the right angle and the rubber feet stop it from sliding on the desktop.
5,This is a great product for a full-length keyboard when you need better ergonomics. I found it adheres firmly to the underside of your keyboard and it is very sturdy and there is no wobble. The stands have grip to the underside so that your keyboard does not move around. I also like the fact that it has multi-levels depending upon how tilted you would like your keyboard to be. I would definitely recommend this product and buy again
4,Light weight and works well!
5,It's great. I can type with one hand and it doesn't move. The 3 different heights are perfect. I use it at work and have already thought "I'm not leaving this behind when I retire "
5,I got the esc Flip today. 3 Positions! Just slightly higher than no stand in low position. I like it. I like the finger notch for removal. Packaging nice and small. Back is easy to read. The 3 position capability is not noted on the back. I like the grippy feet. Dark grey color is good also. We started using it in the middle position and like it. Putting the feet down makes it easier to pack in a computer case. The picture on the back shows alignment to the top edge of the keyboard/laptop which is not possible on the MacBook because  of the rounded shape. Once we got the position right We have used it in the “no feet up” position. Very easy to use and no need to remove it for travel.
5,I bought a Mac Mini M1 and bought the Magic Keyboard and it I believed that maybe I should have gotten a new Airbook instead of the Mini because I would have to live with that keyboard which was impossible to work with.  I found this item and it fixed everything and I can type again.  Wow I feel restored.  This stand is easy to put on the keyboard and works great.  I am relieved.
4,It works great but for some reason the left leg will move out of place if I move it even if I lock it.
5,Love that the ‘legs’ lock. That fixed issue with my keyboard.
5,I am mad at my own self  that I  did not get  theses adjusters  before now!  They really make a difference.  Now my keyboard is looking at me instead of me hovering over it  . O.K. O.K. I can't type as well as some people and  I need an edge and this tilted keyboard helps as well as being more comfortable.  Not only that....I ordered one day and it was delivered the very NEXT day!!!!!Doris Titanic
5,It has 3 heights and its very comfortable! Aimple but effective
3,Goods arrived well packed and on time. only concern was the item was short to be used for a full sized keyboard as only ideal for small ones. Bit of a let to tell you the truth.
4,For new users the flat keyboard would probably work fine.  But for someone who has used a keyboard with a number pad for a very long period of time it is very awkward to type on a flat surface and use the numbers above the letters.  If they are used to a slant to the keyboard the adjustment heights attachment  is a great addition to the keyboard. It is solid and does not wobble when typing.
4,Like the sleek design with multiple height options.  I would say this is a 4.5 item.  My only critique is I wish it was a little wider.  The ends of the keyboard are not as sturdy.  I am using this on the Logitech MX Keys.  This is excellent for a keyboard with no number pad attached but it needs to be a little wider for better sturdiness on keyboards with the number pad.
5,Bought this for my Logitech MX keys I was torn between this stand and a keyboard holder made of acrylic. I am so glad I purchased this adjustable stand. My biggest concern was the stability of the keyboard corners. I didn't want to hit the escape key and have the keyboard topple over. Because the MX keys is about 18 inches long. However I am so glad to report that I positioned the legs in the center of the keyboard under the hump and the keyboard is rock solid! So glad I purchased this stand! Takes the keyboard to a whole other level.
5,This is exactly what I wanted for my apple magic keyboard. The former magic keyboard was more slanted but the new model is almost completely flat so this makes is it really nice for me now.
5,The original small and flat laying iMac keyboard was difficult and uncomfortable to use long term however this  ESC Flip Computer Keyboard stand helped raise the keyboard to a more comfortable angle. And was overly impressed with how quick I received the package from Amazon as I'm out in the middle of nowhere but they were able to deliver the package the very next day after putting in the order!! Amazon impresses me with their quick shipping and delivery even when I ain't a Prime member.
5,Lately I been getting new keyboards for my home computers and more often they do not have the pop out legs/risers to raise or tilt the keyboard at a comfy angle to type on it. Lucky I found this item for my keyboards and it was fairly easy to attach to the underside of the keyboard and in under a minute it made my keyboard easier to type on. 2 or 3 adjustable levels you can use on this keyboard riser stand. 5 stars for this nifty sturdy item for newer keyboards with no riser to tilt them.
5,Apple's almost flat keyboard was a pain until I installed this. It was easy to attach. The keyboard is completely stable.
5,Fast shipping worth it enjoy it the most
3,Overall it is very well made.  Solid quality construction - no complaints there.  As another reviewer mentioned it needs lower height settings.  I use it without the legs extended at all - I can't even imagine using it on it's highest level - that would be way too steep.  I've been "computing" since 1984 so I do have some experience but admittedly may also be set in my ways.  Anyway I do love the product and just ordered a second one but I can only give it 3 stars given its height levels.  The "medium" level (small legs extended) should be the highest level and there should be a lower level (without the legs extended it is slightly higher than your regular keyboard legs - which is perfect for me but the other height settings are useless to me).
4,The piece itself is really good quality. The second level is a tad too high or the first level is too low.  Regardless there is nothing like this out there.  The adhesive is pretty unique that it can be removed and replaced.  It seems to be made of good quality material.  It does the job well.  This is my second purchase.
5,Does what it’s supposed to do.  Very uncomfortable typing on a flat keyboard.
5,Helps hands position to keyboard.
5,this product is exactly what I wanted and it worked exactly as I expected.I had to make a move from linux w/s to apple laptop because my new employer insists on MacBook Pro (yuck) for all developers. I found the keyboard (I use a separate keyboard/Monitor connected through a dock not the laptop keyboard) to be too low. I wanted something that would be more like  the keyboards I was used to in the past.. and this product delivered.
4,I have two minor issues when using the Apple bluetooth keyboard  1. When typing on the keyboard the keyboard does slide a little on my slide out keyboard shelf. Maybe I type a little harder than others.  2. Could improve the item a little by having adjustments on the bottom of the stand also to increase the heightI do like the item and it is definitely it is worth the price
5,very great and helpful!!!
5,Just as advertised. I bought this stand for a flat wireless keyboard. There are 3 levels and the angles are perfect for my needs. The stand attaches simply with adhesive tape on the back of the product. Extra rubber pads for the feet were included in the package.
5,Works perfect for the ATEM mini extreme ISO.  And allows it to have room for ventilation. Good quality built and firm grip.
5,I use this ergonomic keyboard to lift up my Apple Magic Keyboard for my MacBook Pro and really like it. I set it up as the lowest profile as that is my most comfortable height level. The suction pads that are used to "stick" to the bottom of the keyboard are pretty sturdy and adhesive yet easy to remove if I need to.
5,This was delivered super quick.  It is easy to install and is made well.  I work perfectly for my mac magic keyboard 2 magic keyboard with the numeric keypad.  I was worried that it would be wobbly and lightweight because it is made of plastic.  The material is solid and it stays put this is an excellent product I will recommend it to anyone that does not like the low profile of the apple magic keyboard.
3,This is a fine product. The legs are sturdy and it has essentially three heights because there are two leg heights and it provides a smaller angle just by attaching it and leaving the legs folded up. The sticky pads are great hold firmly and clean up easily with just water to become sticky again. BUT...It would not fit my Logitech wireless keyboard. The bottom of your device must have a perfectly flat area measuring at least 9" x 2" or the stand will not attach properly. My keyboard does not have such a flat area because there are protrusions for screws and other mysterious things (see photos).All in all the product is good but it just didn't work for me.
5,Nicely manufactured and easy installation. Excellent price. I have ordered 4.
4,Works but is tipsy when you type on keys toward the outside of the keyboard.
5,Perfect
5,Wish mac added this by default but this fixes the omission
5,I loved it. Very practical
5,I received a new keyboard at work but one of the legs was broken off.  I ordered this and it works perfectly!  I highly recommend it.  It was easy for me to install and I've had no problems with it.  I love it!  Thanks for a great product.Tammie
5,The keyboard I have at work has a broken riser/foot which made it work like a table at a restaurant with an uneven table leg -- but this changed all that AND helped me to adjust the keyboard's tilt to an angle that is better for my wrists.  To make this even better I can easily take this to another cubicle should I move later on.  Thanks for making a great product.  I do wish this was a few inches wider to better fit more modern keyboards or perhaps add a third leg.
5,Bought this for my keyboard at work and it works great
5,My productivity has increased by adding this to my keyboard at work.
4,This keyboard stand seems to work well although I wasn't sure at first.  I was concerned the keyboard might rock because the stand does not span the width of the keyboard.  But that doesn't seem to affect the stability of the keyboard - absolutely no rocking at all.  Easy to install and there are two levels of legs to choose from.
5,One leg of my favorite wireless keyboard broke ☹️ I found this product and I am so glad I did!!! It is sturdy adheres great and provides me several additional angles for keyboard entry which allows me to change my wrist position as needed. Love it! Would purchase again and highly recommend to others.
5,It does a great job of supporting the keyboard and giving it leverage to the user it works great for me and I am very happy with the purchase.
5,I super glued it to my m1 laptop. Great riser no sarcasm.
5,I'm using the stand with my full-size HyperX Alloy Core RGB keyboard the keyboard is 17.5" long and 7" wide. I was a little afraid that the stand wasn't long enough to stabilize a large keyboard but it works perfectly and stabilizes it from corner to corner and keeps it rock solid. This thing really works.
5,Very simple to install and works great!
3,The typing angle on this thing is like 45 degrees. Unless your keyboard is completely flat and doesn't already have feet I cant understand who this benefits. I feel as if this would cause even worse wrist problems and instead of being a small adjustment is just too large. It's a fantastic idea especially in the keyboard hobby as there's hundreds of custom keyboards all with different angles and such but needs to be made slimmer or at least have 2 different size options. Even with no feet extended it is still very very steep.
4,My computer stood higher .what I needed.
5,I was a little leery because of some mixed reviews here. It just showed up today attached easily to the bottom of my new iMac keyboard and works perfectly. It gives just the right amount of angle to the keyboard to make typing a pleasure. If you were on the fence don’t be. Just buy this one!
5,Love this. It attaches exactly as advertised. My keyboard a lip for the batteries on the back which is about 0.5” wide.My one wish is that the adhesive feet were smaller so I could attach it to the battery lip move it closer to the top of the keyboard. I would buy this again.
5,Adhesion is not the best initially so I would highly recommend that whoever wants to buy this lets the adhesive stay for a day at least. However once all that is done it works very well for my Asus Falchion keyboard since the stand it comes with are absolute garbage!
5,Like the support to my wrists
3,I love the product but it keeps coming off my keyboard. The sticky surface is clean no dust at all. A few days after purchase it started coming off and now it constantly does it every few days. There are times when I just reach over to lift the keyboard from my desk to find that it has detached itself from my keyboard. My keyboard is the Arteck backlit keyboard which has a plastic rear surface so I do not believe it has anything to do with the surface of my keyboard. This is highly annoying as I need to realign it every time this thing comes off.
3,It's ok. Not worth the price imo. I took mine to work and it added about an inch of height to my keyboard tilt. Not as much as I expected. It also tends to slide around on my desk. It'd prefer it to stay in place.
5,Love this product my apple Keyboard was flat and I’m not in love with that concept I prefer a keyboard that stands up and is angled at you in a way I bought this little gem and it works perfectly it adhered to the Mac keyboard with ease and I didn’t even need to stand it up have the pieces folded in added enough lift for me. Definitely recommend it for a flat lying Mac keyboard it’s the perfect companion!
5,Very happy with this purchase. It has three different heights and I am using the lowest one. It was easy to attach and it has made a difference in my comfort while typing. I’m glad I chose this instead of those acrylic keyboard holders. With that kind of holder you get stuck with one height. With this one you can adjust the height into three different levels.
4,Perfect for the back of my iPad case that didn’t have a lot of low tilt options for writing. Adheres well enough and has little grips that also stay on well. The quality is good but I will have to see how it holds up over time. Great product overall.
5,I like using my Apple magic keyboard so much more now with this.  It has three different angles which are so much more comfortable to type on than if the keyboard just lied flat.  It makes the keyboard feel sturdier and it's easier to work.  It's a good product.
5,This tray had three different settings to adjust the height of the keyboard. It makes it comfortable to type all day.
5,It works for full size keyboards! Was skeptical at first that this would work however once i found the appropriate & correct placement (so it wouldn't block battery access or cause it to tip my keyboard) it worked like a charm
5,This keyboard stand is significantly shorter than the length of most keywords to accommodate different size keyboards. I use a Logitech MX Keys keyboard a not-so-heavy but not extremely light keyboard either and the stand sticks to the bottom of the keyboard very well. I don't have issue with the keyboard being wobbly while typing which one may expect if the stand is significantly shorter than the keyboard.
5,Because of neck issues I was searching for a product that would raise and tilt my keyboard to a comfortable level. The ESC Flip Computer Keyboard Stand & Laptop Stand was the perfect answer. I have a keyboard that does not allow you to adjust the height. I tried other products but they did not allow me to adjust to the height and slant to my needs. This product does exactly that. I strongly recommend this product!
4,Does the job like I wanted. I used it on my apple keyboard. Works like a charm till now and im happy
5,I need to buy one for each flat keyboard.  Multiple heights.  A miracle.
5,I always felt like I was pounding the table w my iMac keyboard so I decided to buy this little gadget  it did the trick I love it how it angled my keyboard finally I really like to type now.
5,I love this little gadded.  Easy to put on and it has three settings for whatever you are most comfortable with.  use the highest setting myself.  The stand does allow for some minor slipping around of the keyboard but really not enough that bothers me too much.  I think this would also work for laptops or even tablets.  It has a very STRONG grip so no worries about it falling off.
5,Can adjust keyboard to 3 different angles (no slope small slope large slope)  Does what I needed it to do.
5,Ordered a keyboard and mouse combo from amazon and the keyboard did not have a kickstand so I ordered this one and its perfect. 3 different ways to slant my keyboard that provides relief for my wrists. Definitely recommend.
5,I was looking some someone to adjust my keyboard height and thought this was at a good price point so if it wasn't any good wouldn't be too much of a loss. The stand is nice and durable with the "sticky" pads that keeps the keyboard from sliding around and it can be adjusted to different heights.Very good stand I definitely recommend.
5,This product is perfect for making my keyboard just a little higher than I needed it to be. Great product!
5,I purchased the Logitech MX Keys keyboard. To my surprise it does not have the keyboard stands to adjust the tilting position. I was searching for keyboard riser and ultimately stand and this is the closet to perfection I could find on Amazon. I guess Amazon has it all and this is a wonderful idea and it's all worth. The quality is great with ability to adjust multiple tilt positions. Look no futher and this gives me flexibility as opposed to others with a fixed position.
5,Great little keyboard for my iMac…. Easy setup and is adjustable…. Fits on the keyboard drawer….
4,Overall solid. A bit too vertical but you get used it. One of my clips broke on my mech keyboard this fixed it right quick. Sturdy enough for  gaming.
5,I required a little elevation for my Apple Magic keyboard and  my problem is solved with this stand. Very sturdy and stable with no wobbling. The adhesive  is durable and I can fit my keyboard in my laptop case with ease.
5,Purchased this to replace the broken legs in my Logitech keyboard. This mounted easily and is a perfect keyboard angle match for the original legs.One concern is that I had to cover the battery compartment cover. The instructions say it’s easy to remove. We’ll see.
5,solid Snappy.
5,I bought this for use with a Logitech K780 Bluetooth keyboard that has no "feet" on it.  It was easy to attach works perfectly and is very sturdy at both levels.  I hesitated at first as I thought it was a tad pricey but now that I've got it I find it's worth every penny.
4,Adhesive could be stronger otherwise I am happy
5,I bought this to elevated my magic keyboard with the numeric pad. At first I thought it would be too small but it fits perfectly. I don’t really use the other parts of it to elevated it more. Just putting it on was enough for my liking. It works great so far.
5,Serves it purpose-sturdy
5,Simple to install works great. Needed this because I snapped one of the original legs of the keyboard.  It works allows for more angles and is really sturdy. Forget that it’s there and that’s what you want from a product like this.
5,No regret in buying this for my keyboard.  I hate typing on a flat keyboard and after a WFH order from my company due to the pandemic I ordered it.  Little pricey but the angle is adjustable to your comfort level and very easy to install.Guessing I'll buy another one for my work keyboard when I return  UGH: (
5,Perfect ideal. I love it.
5,Works well on my Twelve South MagicBridge which holds an Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad 2.  Very sturdy.  I have it on the lowest setting. The second and third are really high. Makes a positive difference when typing.
5,I love my Mac keyboard but sheesh it's so flat. These little lifter things are perfect. Easy to put on with multiple heights. Great buy super happy.
3,I think it was very well made and fit the description.  However I have a Microsoft ergonomic and it was a down slant and I needed it up slant.  The device was not long enough for my keyboard.  However outside of that not bad.  It was a tad expensive for what it was however which is why I gave it a 3.
3,This is a great idea for working with keyboards that have broken or lost feet or whatever you call those things. Unfortunately this product seems to be made for those small wireless keyboards.  It works for larger keyboards but when you hit something on the upper edges of either side it wobbles.  A minor issue is the traction between it and the keyboard.  I put some of that grippy material for lining drawers underneath the keyboard and it works good.  Would give this 5 stars if it worked better with full-sized keyboards.
5,One of the best purchases I made in my life!!
5,Works but will not work for keyboards that have any sort of grip already  on them so check the material on the bottom of your keyboard before buying
5,Lifted by Apple Magic Keyboard to a more comfortable level but would still appreciate being able to lower it just a little more. I am also using it with the Magic Keyboard Wrist Rest Ergonomic Keyboard Stand Compatible with Wireless Magic Keyboard 2 (MLA22L/A) (Black Silicone)…sold by VAYDEER on Amazon. Together they make the keyboard more comfortable.
5,It’s so convenient and helps with the pain in my wrist.
4,I needed something easy to attach to my keyboard and this worked great. The only thing I would say about this product is the adhesive used to adhere the product to the keyboard
3,Love the product as it works really well with my Jelly Comb keyboard but the double adhesive that it comes with is terrible.  The company was very nice and sent me a new one.  My advise is to find a good double adhesive tape yourself as there are many better quality tapes that work very well and are much better than the adhesive that comes with the stand.
5,While the Apple Magic Keyboard is nice it’s hard to get used to typing on a flat keyboard after the more ergonomic PC keyboards.  This inexpensive stand gives you three angles making the Apple Keyboard more ergonomic and easier to use....ok maybe easier to use for an older guy.......  I bought two one for work and one for my home office.
5,We enjoy how well built the item is and how it has worked to reduce wrist strain. Wish there were a few more options for securing it to the keyboard. We had to created a center support. Works well and easy installation and set-up.
5,Exactly what I was looking for for my Mac Magic keyboard.
5,Simply work as promised on my Magic Keyboard w/ Number Pad period! Recommended!
5,This is perfect!  I needed something to lift the front of my keyboard up and didn’t want to purchase a new keyboard. Seems to stick very well no slipping or sliding. Definitely a good buy!
5,Finally I have my keyboard as I want. I love to have it tilted and for years I was using just a thick book or a box. What a relief now. Easy mounting great experience. I hope it will last long."x 2" for I bought this item again. Now my wife enjoys it. Thanks guys!
1,I purchased this for blue tooth keyboard at work.  Looks good but the it comes off almost every day; no matter what I do.  Useless and waste of money.
5,the apple keyboards are so flat that I needed something to raise and this item did the trick.  three different levels to choose and it is very sturdy.
5,Love this item.  Works well on my keyboard at work.  Would definitely order again
5,I wasn't sure about this product when I first got it but I don't know how I ever lived without it. It makes typing on your Mac keyboard very comfortable. I wish Apple would have came up with this product from the factory. It will work with almost any keyboard and it's better than expected. I highly recommend this product. Try it and you'll love it!
5,I used to make my own or if styrofoam and was not as sturdy as this item I’ve always liked my keyboards higher and this definitely does the job
5,I was skeptical about purchasing this but am glad that I did.  It is great quality and extremely easy to adhere to your keyboard.  I would highly recommend
5,I used all sort things to raise an Apple keyboard to a level that is comfortable for me when typing e.g. door bumpers.  This thing is an answer to my prayers.  Fantastic!
5,This is a great add to my laptop! I love the multiple adjusting heights and the ability to still fit it into my laptop bag.  I bought it to elevate the keys so my wrist won't bump the mouse pad anymore. Problem solved!  It also helps vent the heat so the surface it is not so hot when I'm done.  I wish I would have found it sooner.
5,Works great and adds less stress on my hands.
5,This little contraption is awesome. Stuck right underneath my keyboard at work and instantly felt more comfortable typing! It does note but ill remind you your keyboard has to be one of those flat ones for it to adhere well.
5,So glad they made this type of stand.  My keyboards have been flat even with a little kickstand on the back.  The way I have my computer placed I needed a higher stand and this one came through.  The good reviews are true!
5,I got this to replace the broken feet on my corsair K95 platinum.  this is so much nicer than the factory feet the keyboard is fully stable and the feet dont just collapse down when sliding the keyboard around.
5,Was looking for a new keyboard "with feet" couldn't find anything to fit my needs but found this instead.  It fits under your keyboard and raise it to three different levels the smallest one works for me.  In fact we ordered two more for additional keyboards.
5,Works perfect for what I needed. Its light and out of the way. Not sure if I would use it for a my laotop but def for my keyboard!  Excellent product
5,Great
5,I bought this stand for my keyboard at work. It has the ability to adjust the desired height which is very convenient. I ended up buying another for my coworker . Sturdy adjustable comfortable not bulky and worth the price. Delivery was quick. Highly recommend.
5,I bought 2 of these for  my 2 home tower computer keyboards.  I prefer a higher angle than my husband so this is the perfect solution.  The legs don't break (a common problem I've experienced with the keyboard legs).  Sturdy; a great value.
5,Good one for Mac magic keyboard since they don’t come with any. Little expensive I wish price would little cheaper.
5,Just got my esc Flip. It was easy and simple to setup. My home office feels more complete with it. Out of the 3 positions the low is delivering what I've been needing for my Apply keyboard. Took it off the Apply keyboard rinsed it transferred it to my Massdrop CTRL Mechanical Keyboard and it attached perfectly! This is a great affordable find. I Highly recommend it!
5,Provides adequate slant to the laptop.
5,I was skeptical of the suction cup technology but  it worked very good even on part of a curved surface on my keyboard. So far they have held in place after several weeks in a sturdy and comfortable fashion
5,Many of the newer keyboards don’t tilt the degree I need and other solutions like wedges or other risers are only one size bulky or unstable. This is perfect!
5,Very comfortable. I use this and the small wrist wrest for my keyboard and it compliments very well. I use it on the first setting as the highest setting is too tall for me. I would definitely recommended even for the magic keyboard with the numeric keys. Fits great!
5,Needed something sturdy for my new MacBook Pro 16 inch. I use this to prop for a good typing angle. Simple but efficient. I recommend.
5,I was looking for a keyboard stand but I didn't want a plastic one because I didn't want to deal with the lip. I do a lot of typing and this stand is like a dream come true. I'm able to type now without a lot of wrist discomfort because it's just the right height. It's also adjustable which is nice.
5,I love this. It was so helpful for my Mac keyboard because it flat and hurts my wrist when typing. This made it all better and I love the way that you can raise up three different ways. Excellent but I highly recommend it
5,Very easy to install
5,Works perfect on iMac keyboard which on their own seem to sit t flat and are not comfortable to type on.
1,It does what it's supposed to do but as the title says - it leaves tiny scuff marks on my black desk pad and once a week have to scrub it down - super fun.
5,Very nice and practice
4,I like the adjustable heights. It was exactly what I wanted. I would have rated 5 stars except for the fact that it doesn't always remain intact.
5,Awesome. Kills two bird with one stone. I have tried and disappointed with those tringle qubes metal stands and plaric clip designs.I installed it on my HP Specter 15 laptop back.1. Will keep your laptop cool.2. Provide comfort while typing.
5,I did not like how flat my keyboard was and tried to find a solution.  Turns out this was it!  Great product!  Sturdy and a perfect fit.  Don't hesitate to buy as you will be happy!
5,It is just what I was looking for to angle the key board up and make it easier to use. I used a book before I ordered it to determine the height required. I use it on the lowest setting.
4,This key sta d is exactly what I needed. Just wish the adhesive was a little stronger.
5,Just got this for my new iMac keyboard. Very nice.
5,perfect fit in my MX Logitech keyboard
5,I use a Mac and their keyboard is just not elevated enough for me.  This keyboard stand just fills the bill!
5,Fair price
5,Thank you!  It is a terrific gadget and is well put together.  It is a pleasure using it on my keyboard.
5,This is the perfect fit for the Logi keyboard!  makes all the difference when typing!
5,Just what I needed for my keyboard.  Works perfectly for my arthritic hands.
5,Works well on my Mac wireless keyboard. I needed the lowest level in order to get the tilt needed for the keyboard to be at the appropriate angle. Recommended.
5,I needed for my keyboard to be tilted up more that the built in legs would allow and this did the trick!
3,I have it on my MX keys and it is very sturdy the only problem I have is that it keeps coming off. I already tried cleaning it with warm water just like the introductions say but its still coming off.
5,I love that it has 3 levels yet is small enough that it can fit in my carrying case for my keyboard & mouse.
5,I just love this product!!! I didn't want something that would fill my desk or just have extra things on my keyboard so after reading some reviews and pics I decided to go with this and its absolutely amazing!!!!! See pics!!!!
5,this works good for keyboards or laptop! ive tried both. I love it for my mac book pro 13 in. It fits perfect and makes typing so much easier. helps my posture
5,does the job and i like the 3 different heights you can set it to
5,This product worked perfectly. Easy to put on the keyboard. Highly recommended.
5,This is just the item you need to give your keyboard that perfect angle to type. It is a great item and reusable incase you need to put it on another keyboard. Highly Recommended!!
5,It's nice that this stand can be re-used as I will frequently change keyboards.Nothing negative to report...seems to be a well-made product
5,This keyboard stand is just perfect for what I need and my hands have been comfortable with the hand height!
5,Apple's full-length keyboard does not have the much-needed tilt hence this buy. I had to move the stand a couple of times to get the right angle that I needed but once I got it it was perfect!
5,The keyboard adjuster works great for my keyboard. The adhesive is not that good but it works for me.
5,like it a lot. I have a hand tremor and this helps a lot
5,I love this item. It makes it very comfortable when typing. I definitely recommend. It sticks in the keyboard easily and it’s pretty sturdy. I haven’t had issues with it and my keyboard is used every day for servers hours a day.
5,Honestly it's perfect for every height. Using on the keytron low profile
5,I have a Mac and the adhesion seems not work so great with the metal covering. I do not have a case on my laptop although I think that if I did it would work better. /Users/roxanalopez/Downloads/IMG_1324 2.jpg/Users/roxanalopez/Downloads/IMG_1336.JPG/Users/roxanalopez/Downloads/IMG_1337.JPG/Users/roxanalopez/Downloads/IMG_1338.JPG
5,Great product from the americans thanks so much for  great invention
5,Exactly what I wished for and easy to install
5,It made an apple keyboard much more ergonomic.
5,This product is awesome sturdy and well made. Would buy again if need another one. Good job
5,Lifts the keyboard just enough to make typing comfortable and eases wrist strain.  My keyboard has the built in elevators but it was still uncomfortable. I was concerned that this product would not raise it enough but it is sturdy adjustable and has worked fine.
5,Works great with Apple Magic Keyboard!
5,I love this thing!  My God the perfect discovery.  Three tiers to adjust your keyboard sturdy compact.  Easy to adjust just flip up or  down the level that you want and voila.  Loved it so much I bought another one.
5,Works the way I expected.
5,Since sticking the keyboard lifts on the back of my keyboard typing has become easier for me. I am able to sit with the correct posture which has improved my typing skills overall.
5,This is perfect for my keyboard at work! With 3 different height adjustments it is very comfortable for the wrist. No problem with the adhesive wirh the silicone it can be removed and reused. Great product! I highly recommend.
5,makes typing easier less strain on wrist
2,Did not fit on the computer I purchased it for because of the design of the back of the computer. So I put it on another laptop and find that it is difficult to use. Have to reach in and pull the legs out and they are hard to grasp. Legs often flip down on their own and the rubber pads on the bottom of the legs have fallen off numerous times. I find them on the desk and the floor and put them back on. Not well designed or made.I ended up cutting a small pool noodle in half flattening out the top and used that as my keyboard lift. Works well!
5,It a good buy for the price. Easy to assemble
5,This little keyboard riser works exactly as advertised!
5,easy to install - makes the magic keyboard more ergonomic. Also the 3 different height settings add additional flexibility to your setup
5,After a few months of use this thing holds up great. No issues. I would recommend.
5,The Magic Keyboard is great but lays extremely flat so this helps you get it in the position that is most comfortable for you. Works great and easy to install.
3,Works okay but there's really only 1 elevation that's useful.  Probably could have found another solution and really doesn't seem worth around $20.
5,This simple product provides the perfect keyboard slant/angle!
5,Love
4,Great buy
5,The best thing could’ve ordered for my wireless Mac keyboard. I needed a little lift for proper tying and comfort and this product does not disappoint. Three easy positions to choose from.
5,Really like because height is adjustable!
5,Mine keeps falling down wont stay clicked in space. I have to keep clicking them back in place
5,I attached this to my Keychron at work - it provides just the right angle (without using the legs).  I can’t speak to longevity but so far so good.  I have really enjoyed it so far.
5,this product works good right out of the box
5,One of the supports had broken off my keyboard.  This stand fits my Microsoft keyboard very well.  It elevates the angle more and fits between right my desktop computer stand.  It adheres well to the keyboard too. Thank you.
5,Well this little gem has made my life so much better! Was having trouble with angle of keyboard at work. Popped this little baby on and ta-da! Super small and easy to install. 5-star perfection.
4,The product works as designed and has helped me a lot!
5,Very mobile very cool! Love it💜
5,Expensive but it works
5,I love it makes it so much easier to type
5,I use this on my keyboard to lift it and angle it for a more comfortable fit for use. I am please with this purchase.
5,Love this
5,My keyboard was very flat and this helped me put it at a more ergonomic height.
5,Simple and works well - exactly what I wanted..
5,No complaints what so ever great product will ore from the seller agin.
5,I used these to be able to see my screen better on my Headrush Gigboard and my Mooer Oceans Machine! These work perfect for how I'm using them on a table top!! I'll be buying more!!
5,Great Value for the $$$
5,It works good like it
5,Did the job
5,Great Product with adjustable height.  Great for flat wireless keyboard that came with an All in one computer we bought.  Would buy another if needed.
5,Easy to use
5,The ESC Flip is exactly what I needed for my keyboard.  It works great doesn't slip.  It's working so well for my keyboard I just ordered another one for my laptop.  I highly recommend this product!
5,Easy to install. Made a big difference using the keyboard at an angle. Wrist doesn’t hurt anymore. Would recommend this product it’s sleek and lightweight
2,This item is less than 9 inches long.  My keyboard is 18 inches long.  I centered it on the bottom of my keyboard but feel it's subject to wobbling since it's so small.  You would need two in order to raise your keyboard securely.  Also I found the adjustable feet collapse on their own.  Very disappointed with this product.
5,Excellent keyboard stand! Provides the perfect angle for my mechanical keyboard at home and MacBook Pro for when I work remotely from coffee shops. Would highly recommend this for anyone that’s looking for a simple and good quality stand.
5,Great adhesion multiple heights/settings perfect little gadget to help make any keyboard more ergonomic.
5,Used this to tilt and elevate the LoupeDeck+ editing keyboard. Worked great. adjustable height. Tucks underneath. and I can still put the keyboard in its travel case. I highly recommend!
5,Just what I needed for my apple keyboard
5,Exactly what I needed
5,no more flipping legs or uneven keyboard recommend to anyone who broke a leg off their keyboard
2,Broke first time I used it!
5,I wasn't sure this stand was going to be as sturdy or useful but i love it. 3 height setting help make a world of difference.
5,I like all
5,Props up an Apple keyboard
5,Works great
5,Absolutely love it
5,GREAT !!
5,Todo perfecto
5,I like it because  of the 3 levels  of height. Easy to adjust.
5,Perfect angle to relieve the strain from my wrists!
5,I really like this little stand . It has made my computer time much easier.
5,pk
5,Put this underneath the Apple Magic Keyboard (non-full size) and it dramatically improved its ergonomics. Seems to be built very well.
5,Just what i was looking for nomore sore wrists from an unbalanced keyboard...
5,Perfect
3,Maybe it’s just my keyboard but there simply aren’t large enough flat surfaces available on the back of it for this to adhere. Otherwise love the height and comfortable to use.
5,works for me
5,Great producr
5,awesome very niceExcellence
5,Love this product. I honestly didn't think it would fit the extended Apple keyboard but it's perfect.
5,This little guy is amazing!  Has several different height options and you can remove and reuse.  Love it!
5,Perfect
5,Works great no issues.
5,I love it
5,It work perfectly my keyboard doesn't slide around on my desk and the height is easily adjustable
5,I love that this product is adjustable! It was easy to attach and so far I’ve had zero issues.
5,Best one I've used
5,Works great. Exactly what I needed.
5,Perfect for small keyboard..Easy to lower and raise
5,Love this product...easy to install and use! Product arrived on time. Would purchase again.
5,This is sturdy and has 3 different adjustments.Great product worth the money!
3,It raises it a couple different levels.
5,This is a great stand. Perfect to position the keyboard. Thank you.
5,Like it! Works best on a wood surface
5,Works perfectly for me.  Great product.
5,So simple and adds just why you purchased it! Wish I'd though of this first.
5,Perfect keyboard stand! I brought 2 one for work and one for at home
5,Great for Apple Mac desktop keyboard
5,Works as indicated
5,I like everything about it. It’s very comfortable when typing on my keyboard.
5,It does just what I need it to do.
2,Still not enough height. When using the keypad nothing there to support it therefore causing the keyboard to tilt on right side. Had to put something underneath to keep from tilting. Disappointing...everyday!
5,Works great
5,This has two different angles of tilt. It works perfectly.
5,This works perfect for what I needed. It's very sturdy.
5,good product
2,The device tends to unstick regularly. It can be quite annoying. Also the design I think needs more contour as the back of a standard keyboard is not straight and flat.
5,Easy to install and helps elevate my keyboard to a height I like.
2,Thought this would be great for my keyboard...turns out it's not. Does not stick kept having to try and press it back on. Returning it hoping to find something better
5,Exactly what I was looking for.
5,Worked great to enable the laptop to tilt upward for viewing and using the keyboard.
1,Se despega con facilidad
5,Love the different height adjustments. Attaches easily. Work shreat!
5,This is just what I needed.
5,It was as described. very comfortable
5,The lowest height is enough for me. Love it!
5,Best thing I ever bought and very easy to install
5,Product is really good
5,Just be careful where you place it behind the key board.
5,I like having 2 levels of adjustment.
5,Works did the job just what I needed.
3,It stuck but it slides all the time and it keeps unsticking
5,Great item A+
5,Great
5,Works great on my keyboard. Very happy I purchase this.
1,I like the concept but did not work for my Dell keyboard.
5,Works perfect
1,I purchased this product because I thought the adjustable angles were appealing. The product was awesome when in worked -- I did not move my keyboard after placement of the product. However the adhesiveness is so poor I am constantly having to re-attach it. It has gotten to the point where there is no stickiness at all and it simply falls off due to gravity.I should note that keyboard I am using is brand new. Very disappointed
5,exelente
1,It won't stay attached to my keyboard. Falls off after about 20 minutes of use.  Have tried cleaning it and reattaching as the instructions state to no avail.
5,Easy set up. Works great.
5,Great product
1,Did not work out for me did not stay in place
5,Lifted my keyboard perfectly!
1,This is a good idea but not very durable. The adhesive doesn't stick to my keyboard too good. I have to keep putting it on my keyboard.
2,The stand's shape is a tiny bit off. That makes the track pad charging port is partially covered by the stand. I had to pull the trackpad up a bit in order to charge it..
5,Great product
5,Love it
2,Interesting design but poorly made. Small part broke off within 5 min of use. Also design not good for those who use a wrist rest as I had to put a book under the riser to get the keyboard high enough for a wrist rest.
5,Love it!
2,It works. I wish I would have shopped around a little more for a full length stand or maybe have gotten a better keyboard. I just have a small apple keyboard. It’s not super comfortable to use.
1,Useless
1,This product doesn't support the entire keyboard. I have a full-sized keyboard and if you place to much pressure on either end it flips. I use the 10-key portion of my keyboard on every call I take. Can't put up with the flipping it is going back.
2,Cheap.  Had to be made in China. Didn't function as advertised.  Don't believe the "excellent reviews" you are seeing..
1,2nd time ordering since I did not get the initial order. This time pieces of the product not included in box of product.
1,Buyer beware! I purchased this based on the reviews. It did not meet my expectations. The adjustable part is nice but everything else is not true. The non-slip rubber foot grips come off and pushing them back on has not been easy. Unless I got a defective one from the bunch I would not recommend this product. Especially not for the price.
1,Really not made well .. Not sturdy at all . keyboard moves when typing . ot a good buy for someone who types 8 hrs a day have to keep moving it  back and forth .
1,Loved it but it will not stick to my Logitech keyboard for some reason. Did everything as directed & it keeps coming off.
1,Very cheaply made it does not stick design incorrect
1,I had high hopes for this.  It wouldn’t stay in position and kept collapsing. Also If you have a laptop with the airflow on the bottom it has to cover it to work properly  which covers up the flow.
1,I didn't read in the reviews that the item can be placed over the fans on the bottom of my laptop.
1,Legs do not support the weight of the keyboard. They just fold under.
1,The adhesive does not adhere! This has become so useless since my keyboard slides around.
1,The adhesive used wast very strong my keyboard stand doesn’t stick to my keyboard.
1,I received the keyboard stand today and it has no adhesive backing. It was obviously returned and repackaged and sent out as new. I’m very disappointed. I have to now take my time and effort to return it.
1,Adhesive is not good...already threw it out.  Don't waste your money
1,Did not work for me
1,Arrived broken and unable to be used.
1,The highest setting does not stay up as you are typing.  Too bad because it would be the perfect height.
1,Even the least angled setting was too much for my wrists. Super uncomfortable. I was using with the Apple bluetooth keyboard.
1,After a month the rubber bumpers just fell off. Complete waste of money!
5,I bought this for my MX Keys Mini and it's magical. You can sit it flushed right below the battery compartment. The ingenious design lets you adjust multiple angles that suit your need. It's the second best thing for MX Keys Mini if you need your keyboard to rise up. It is lightweight easily removable and won’t permanently damage your beloved keyboard.
1,Came without the adhesive pads. Otherwise looks durable. Very disapointed. Was looking forward to using it.
1,Too little too small. fragile.
1,Will keep falling down. I purchased two and waisted money
1,I like this product I received what I expected
4,This is a GREAT product and does a great job.  That said when I purchased they didn't have the item that you can expand to full keyboard length.  8.5" wide is too short and leaves my larger keyboard unstable at the sides.  I had to remove and re-attach - off center ' and more UNDER my main keyboard or my keyboard would rock down on one corner - due to the feet being too far from keyboard edges.  If I were buying again today - I would order the item that allows you to expancd the feet to the edges through the slide open design.  ALSO - if you have a wirless keyboard keep in mind you can't mount this OVER the battery door - or you'll eventually have a problem getting new batteries in when needed.  I'll live with the shorter version until down the road when the keyboard dies.
5,I picked this up for my wife. She is very happy with this stands.
1,The pictures shown go against everything that I know about ergonomics for the last 28 years.  A positive tilt pinches the blood vessels in your wrist causing carpal tunnel. A flat or negative tilt is best.
5,I buy pretty expensive keyboards and mods and it's funny that keyboards worth hundreds of dollars usually don't have flip-up feet. I guess it's a manufacturing risk to have moving parts on the outside of the keyboard's case. I've actually had keyboard feet and rubber stopping pads fly off cheaper keyboards in the past. This product isn't that great for aesthetics unless you're lucky and your keyboard exactly matches the color of this product but I don't mind. What's more important than looks is ergonomics and functionality and those are the kinds of keyboards I buy anyways. I've tried and I can't find a product anywhere on the internet that comes close to the functionality of this product especially at this price point. If I could I'd buy this in bulk and attach it to all my keyboards. For now I'm only attaching it to purely flat keyboards that obviously need flip-up feet.
5,Great quality keyboard risers. I admit that I was skeptical about this being flimsy but it is not. Very nice and sturdy. I’m constantly scooting it around and probably a little too rough with it but it’s in A-1 condition regardless.
4,This really does give me a perfect angle on my keyboard.  I do have one con however.  The keyboard stand moves around when typing.  I sort of fixed it with double-sided sticky tape.  Overall I really like this product.
5,Delivered fast Perfect for my keyboard.  It is exactly what i need.  Very easy to attach.  I absolutely love this for my keyboard.  What a difference on my wrists.
5,We have 2 of them one for a Lenovo X1 6th Gen and one for a Lenovo ThinkPad Wired USB Keyboard. They stick on well don't obscure the cooling vents much on the laptop and have 3 good easy to adjust heights.
5,Bought a keyboard that was a lot lower than in used to...and really needed something to prop it up...really pleasantly surprised at how nice this is...and how well it worked...wpm went back up to normal...good product!
5,Very pleased with the way this accessory sticks to the back of keyboard. I used it on my ergonomic curved keyboard and although it is designed for your normal rectangular keyboard it works with mine. I used the lowest of 3 settings. Money well spent!
5,I did a take good decision after started using this to lift my keyboard my fingers wrist stopped hurting. Really recommending this product very good quality and goes with any key board model.
5,Smaller than I was expecting  but after I easily attached it it was perfect.  Very sturdy and a good solid riser.  I love it!
5,This gadget helped me a ton my wrists were bothering me because it was so low.  I was quite surprised on how sturdy it is. I plan to buy another one for my 2nd keyboard. I highly recommend.
5,Works well for my PC and I would purchase it again.
2,This didn't not work on my keyboard as the back of it isn't flat. I would check the design of your keyboard before purchasing.
5,exactly met my need with apple's new magic keyboard to lift the keyboard at a perfect angle.  Ridiculously easy to install and a great value
5,What a great product this is! Easy to install and has stayed in place well. Different levels of height is so helpful!
5,Excellent just excellent! Bought a couple more for future needs and better tilt-ability.
5,Simply love it
5,Excellent product and fast delivery!
5,I like that it has 3 different levels. So far there are no problems!
5,Super quick and easy to install in took seconds Making a big difference in how I type! Great price!!
1,It would not stay stuck on my keyboard waist of money to
5,It was exactly what i needed. Very happy that I was able  to find this.
5,Egonomico
5,Just received today and put it on my keyboard and I love it already and I can't wait to use it
5,Love this I have it on all my keyboards Keychron K1 104 and my Logi mx keys at work give you three different heights to choose from
5,Easy to apply. Flexible in location on device.
5,I found myself with a full size Apple keyboard and it was very flat on the desk I prefer something more angled. This thing to the rescue!I have it on the lowest setting and it gives me just the right amount of angle the back edge of the keyboard is about 3/4" off the desk. I cleaned the back of the keyboard with alcohol before installing this and it's stayed in place and I am super happy with it!
5,Worth the money. My keyboard was too flat and I started having wrist pain. I ordered this product easy set up and my wrist problem was resolved with in a matter of days! Great products!!
5,Great product! I needed something to give height to the keyboard and this worked perfect. It has 3 different height levels. It comes with 2 adhesive stickers that you peel off so that you stick the stand to the bottom of the keyboard. I highly recommend!
5,Perfect solution for adjusting your keyboard to the perfect height!
1,I was not impressed with this product at all.
5,Lovely product. Works well with my magic keyboard for the apple desktop. Tried taking some pictures but it didn't work out.Its definitely amazing
5,I was a bit skeptical of the sturdiness for a full size keyboard but it has maintained wonderfully. If your keyboard leg pops off this is a must buy!
5,Perfect Fit
5,This is an excellent product. Great industrial design and ergonomics. High quality materials.
5,Easy to install I have the iMac keyboard- it's flat and not good for my wrists. I use this to adjust my keyboard. It's perfect.
5,Works great for the Apple Magic keyboard to give it just enough lift to be more ergonomic. Definitely recommend it. It’s also suction so it’s reusable with no sticky residues
5,This is a perfect accessory for my Mac keyboard that had no way to change the angle of it
1,After only a week of use this fell off the keyboard. Supposedly you can wash it or get it wet let it dry and it is suppose to stick again. Nope.
5,The new wireless Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad lays so flat and I need it angled or tilted slight. There’s no way to adjust it on the newer rechargeable Apple keyboards and used to place a rubber eraser to prop it but it keeps sliding off whenever I’m typing and breaks my flow or concentration. The grippy adhesive on this stand was perfect as I type a lot and not have to worry of coming off. It’s a bonus that it has multiple setting for the angle of the tilt. Love it!!
1,This item is defective and not even usable.  One side of the flip stand was assembled backwards and thus this item cannot even be used properly.
5,Fantastic product and it really helps me set up my office more ergonomically.
5,My keyboard stand was the perfect for what I needed.  It is sturdy adjustable and stays in place and made it easy to type all day.  Loved it!
5,great for office use
5,Good product to help elevate the keyboard
5,Seriously why was something like this so hard to find??? And my does apples Magic Keyboard not adjust like this. This is reusable. And has three levels of height. This was exactly what I needed and I have no clue why it was so hard to find. Love it!
5,The standard feet on keyboards is still too flat for my liking. These are PERFECT. I bought them for my full-size keyboard and they work flawlessly. They are SO easy to apply and use. You can also customize the height. If you are in the market for keyboard feet BUY THIS!!!
5,I like the three different levels. Easy to put on the back of the keyboard.
5,works great
5,I bought this for my Keychron Q1 keyboard which I found a bit too flat for my preference (~1° angle by default). This raiser has 3 possible settings: if you keep the feet tucked in it still has fixed nubby feet that are pretty small but work perfectly for me. You can also extend the feet and choose between the small tabs and the larger ones.Photos: close-up of the feet on the lowest settings 6° angle on the lowest setting 15° on the medium setting and 25° on the highest setting with the largest feet extended. The lowest setting is what I found works best for me. The angle you get will depend on your keyboard and your placement of this raiser stand.
5,Love it.
5,We purchased this for my wifes keyboard.  The installation was easy and the adjustable height was perfect for my wife.  This was worth the money!
5,I have a Mac and with the new bluetooth keyboards they lay flat. I saw this and decided to give it a try. I also have another bluetooth keyboard and so I purchased 2 of them. Let's just say I LOVE IT!. It definitely takes the pressure off of the wrist. It has 3-different positions and I'm sure that one of them will work perfectly for you. So it works great and it's very practical. I told my wife it's amazing how someone finds a simple niche that's practical and simple and it just works. If you're looking for a simple way to help with typing fatigue I'm pretty sure you've found it.
5,I was leery of affixing an aftermarket device to my beautiful new Apple keyboard; however this ESC Flip stand is perfect in every way--high quality unobtrusive functional and sturdy.  The shortest adjustment places my 11-inch long keyboard at the optimal level for typing comfortably.  Highly recommended.
5,Love the different positions and love that you can lay it flat for easy traveling.
5,Love the keyboard stand lot easier to type with it compared to keyboard being flat. Also has threeadjustments
5,Good Quality and work as adv
5,I Love this product.  So much easier to type especially when using the smaller Apple keyboard.
5,It does the job just wish it was longer to cover the whole keyboard.
5,I have a Drop Preonic keyboard and it ket perfect along the bottom.I like the three different tiers and its pretty sturdy on there. also came with a few extra rubber bottom replacements but they are pretty well attached. Exactly what i wanted.
5,A great addition to any keyboard
4,It doesn’t match the length of the keyboard but it works nonetheless.
5,Very easy to install. The other brand without the bar makes it hard to eye it you have to measure. With this one I just eyeball my placement and bam...all good. It comes with 3 extra rubber feet for wear and tear...nice.The legs are sturdy and the rubber feet work great.  I'm Happy... a good buy.
5,Exactly what I needed to lift my Logitech K780. The feet feel robust. The adjustability is a great bonus.
4,my old keyboard does not have a riser im not sure why but this solves the issue.
5,One of the plastic legs on my keyboard broke.  This is the perfect fix and love the different level options.
5,By choosing where to stick it onto your keyboard you can easily customize your keyboard setup. The quality is solid very nice upgrade to my workspace!
4,So this is not magnetic like they advertised so that did bother me and why it gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. HOWEVER the sticky tabs are not permanent and I can remove it from my very expensive macbook pro max without tarnishing the exterior. And it STAYS ON--most important. The adjustable height is just perfect and it's so much more ergonomic now as I type--no more wrist pain!
4,Good for ergonomics.  Different angle adjustments.
4,Got a new keyboard that didn't have an angle or height adjustment.  This worked great  just wish it was a little wider as sometimes if I type on the far left or right side of the keyboard it seems to jump.
5,It works! Why didn't I buys long time ago? No wobbling at all. Three different levels.
5,All I wanted was a simple inexpensive way to prop up my keyboard a little. This works great but note that it is not height adjustable.
5,Easy to assemble...taps slip closed...
5,Works great- does the trick!
4,It works as intended. It is resistent and the adhesion is strong enough. No mayor problem with it. I just dont see a reason to justify the price when there are other feet for half the price. If price is not an issue you will not be disappointed
5,Pleased with this product. Works as advertised.
5,Raises the keyboard just the right amount. Makes typing quicker and easier.
5,Just buy it
5,Great when working with any keyboard.
5,The extension is very well designed and has three levels of support (height adjustment) if needed.In my case the default height of the stand was sufficient to give the right angle to type on the keyboard.Happy with my purchase.
5,teclado con luzel bluetoothencendido en el tecladolo i dependiende del monitor
5,This worked great!.  My husband can now use the keyboard without propping it up with other stuff to fit his hand. Love the fact that it adjusts to more than one height.
5,This has been a blessing to have. My typing has gotten so much better and my wrists don’t hurt after a long day of typing.
5,This product fit well and stays put.  I added it to my aftermarket backlit keyboard which placed it on top of the battery pack so the lowest setting is not quite as low as it could be.  Otherwise great product that is well made and delivers as advertised.
5,perfect just what i wanted
5,I love this little thing. It really saved my wrist after the manufacturer lift broke on my keyboard.
3,Thought this was a stand for my keyboard to sit on but it is a bar that sticks to the underside of the keyboard. Not at all what I expected.
5,Got this about a month or so ago and have not regretted it for one second.  It's easy to put on your keyboard.  I have a magic keyboard with numeric keys and it's still perfectly stable.  I went back and forth between this one and another one and ended up choosing this one.  Sure glad I did.  My only regret is not buying it sooner.
5,This was exactly what I needed to have a slight arch to my Apple keyboard. The highest setting was too high for me mid setting doesn’t stay propped up properly (the legs flop down to the lowest setting) and so I use the lowest setting with no wrist pain after a long period of typing.You have to stick the whole thing to the back of your keyboard and I haven’t tried to remove it since but I will update if I ever need to take this off and if there leaves a sticky residue.
5,I bought an iMac which came with a Touch ID keyboard. I have a mechanical keyboard hitch I could use but the Touch ID is addictive once you start using it; however the Apple Magic Keyboard’s flat profile frankly sucks. I didn’t hold out hope of actually finding an adapter but a Google search proved me wrong. Is this solution more expensive than two corks to improvise rubber feet? Absolutely. Burt it’s height adjustable and can be repositioned so for me it’s worth the money. I like a low profile angle so the base extension is good enough but it can extend higher with two extra profile positions. I hope this helps for anyone who wants to love their flat keyboard!
5,I've been waiting to do a review until I had to remove (or move) it and now I've done just that so I can put it on another keyboard (I switch between keyboards now and then).Folks there is ZERO residue after removal. I had it on the first keyboard for over a year and a half. Absolutely fantastic product.
5,You can't really ask for anymore in a keyboard stand. I keep it at its lowest level as it makes for a comfortable typing position for me. But you'll find there are at least be 4 positions with 2 that are more clickable.The only thing is I'm not sure how easily this stand comes back off once you've applied it to the base of the keyboard. My keyboard—not the stand is something I'm thinking of replacing. But anyway that's got nothing much to do with the stand.I probably could have got away with sticking something else underneath my keyboard but something so unobtrusive has to be worth a closer look. ;)
3,I bought this to change the angle of my Jellycomb wireless keyboard and align it for better wrist comfort. The item itself was a bit of a disappointment - on unwrapping I discovered that it was a simple slim strip of black plastic (similar to a school ruler perhaps a touch wider) with two adjustable feet that in turn had another set of feet nested within them to increase or decrease height.While the main body of the item felt fairly strong I had my doubts about the adjustable feet which felt a bit on the flimsy side - an issue not helped by the double nested 'pegs' to increase or decrease the height - the lower setting in particular seemed very prone to pinging back into resting position.On the plus side this was a super simple installation as it adheres to the base of the keyboard by a sticky strip. This is where I began to have problems I aligned my keyboard base and the sticky strips of the device following the instructions - but the second I began typing the adjustable base would slide around under the pressure of the keys movement or the adjustable feet would collapse down entirely.I would understand if I was flailing away at the keys like Jerry Lee Lewis but I am by no means a heavy fingered typist even applying the normal amount of pressure meant the dratted thing just would not stay in the one position. In terms of one size fits all for this - I can see from other reviews that other people had a better experience with a range of keyboards but I remain doubtful of this items' stability particularly for larger keyboards.I felt this was overpriced especially as (for me) it lacked the stability I needed. I had expected something a little bit more robust for almost £20.
5,This is great for an Apple Magic keyboard. It’s so much more comfortable to use with three choices of height incline. Although a bit expensive for what it is it’s made the keyboard easier to use and stopped it sliding about.  There’s a spare set of rubber feet included too.
5,I got this for my new Logitech MX Keys keyboard. Even though the keyboard has a bump on the back it was not enough. This fits perfectly just inside the bump and even though it is not as wide it is very sturdy. I have not tried to unstick and restick it so cannot comment on that. The three settings are great. I use the middle one. The feet are sturdy and feel of good quality. The rubber feet help keep it from drifting as I type. I am very happy with this purchase. Price and quality are good enough that if I used another keyboard (and kept the old one) I would get a separate unit for the other keyboard.
5,... and it works. Three heights. The highest you would never use. But the first and second heights are good.There is absolutely no flex in my keyboard with the apparatus attached. The product is sturdy and easier to type on. I haven't experienced the slipping that some others have.All in all an excellent product.
5,This NiftyStrongLightweightSmall Ingenious Piece Of Work - Deserves A MedalOn the order page the stand looked large and a bit clumsybut no not at all using it for my Apple Magic Key Boardprobably great for every keyboardwill notdisappoint.  *****Plus  :-)
5,I like my keyboard unusually high up because I find it helps my wrists and this stand certainly helps. I love that there are two height options to choose from. The only con is sometimes it wobbles but I think it's because I am a somewhat aggressive typer when I am in the "zone".
2,This thing has one job. The left risers both the tall and short do not stay up if I have the misfortune to move the keyboard. They click into place and *seem* like they'll stay put but they do not.I deeply resent this device.
5,Apple Keyboad(指紋認証機能無いタイプ)スタンドとして利用しています。初代の乾電池式のは幾分傾斜があったのですが、バッテリータイプになり傾斜があまりなく入力はかなりし辛いものでした。キーボードに高さと傾斜を出すためにと購入しましたが、傾斜も2種類あるので利用者個々の好みに対応できるのではないかなと思います（自分は小さい方を利用）入力時の安定性と滑りなどもなく、針付きもしっかりしているのでキーボード入力がかなり楽になりました。
5,My DasKeyboard’s stock tilt options were always disappointing.  This sticks well to the keyboard and gives it the perfect tilt for me.Loved it so much bought another for another keyboard also lacking in tilt.
5,I am so glad i took a chance and ordered this keyboard standit IS everything a keyboard (or laptop) stand should be = PERFECT
5,I have only had it for a couple of days but so far it has worked well.  I am hoping the stickiness remains when I switch keyboards in the future.
5,Love how there are two levels of I Cline. Great product - wish they came in packs of 2 or 3 for a discount.
5,Purchased this thing and was able to stick it to my keyboard that arrived yesterday. Still has good hold on my keyboard and provides a comfortable tilt to it as well.
5,Did what it was supposed to - raised my flat keyboard a little at the back so that it slopes a little like older keyboards.I find I only need to use the lowest setting which maybe the older versions of this device didn't have.Works a charm.
5,Easy to attach and I can type comfortably now. My keyboard is sturdy when I type as well.
5,Nice product !
5,Does  The  Job
4,I honestly did not know what to expect when I purchased this.  But for the price I told my self - 'why not try it?'A few weeks later I have this constantly attached to my Apple Magic Keyboard so that I am able to adjust the angle of the keyboard to a comfortable degree.No problems with the nano adhesive either.
5,I hate the fact they make keyboards so flat. It’s uncomfortable to work like that. So I thought let me see if they something I can can to the keyboard to help raise it. This is perfect. I has 3 levels and is very sturdy. My wrists no longer get tired through out the day.
5,高さや使いやすさがとても良いです
5,I've always liked the Logitech G15 keyboard. A good solid device with great mechanics. However the feet that come with it only raise the angle very slightly. I've lived with that for years and then I saw the ESC Flip keyboard stand.I sent for one and it arrived next day (thanks Amazon). I very carefully prepared the surface with alcohol on some paper towel so that it was good and clean then carefully offered the ESC Flip up so that it sat in the centre at the top.The ESC Flip has improved my keyboard immensely. It has two positions to allow some adjustment of the keyboards rake. but even on the top level it's not excessive.  Despite the fact that this is a monster sized keyboard and the stand only occupies half the width it is incredibly stable. There is no wobble at all even if I push down on one of the edges. It triples the rake of the keyboard over the originally fitted feet.From a build perspective it seems to be well made and solid without any apparent give or movement. The bottom of the feet prevent slippage.  I know some reviews have complained about the adhesive being inadequate which is something I was worried about as I have to move the keyboard every morning to make way for my work laptop but I've had no problems so far.  I think that you need to pay extra attention to cleaning the surface to get good adhesion.Basically it's a good piece of kit that has given my favourite keyboard a new lease of life so it gets full marks from me.
4,最も高くするとかなりの角度ですおよそ５センチ高くなりました慣れると楽です手首の負担が減りますね耐久性は高いと思います滑ることもありません
5,ノートパソコンでなく､HHK professional HYBRIDの裏にはりつけて利用しています。安定感があがりとても使い易くなりました。
5,I was looking to buy a new keyboard for my PC but after looking at loads of different keyboards I realised the only thing I didn't like about my keyboard was that it was to flat not enough angle!I saw this excellent gadget that can tilt the back of the keyboard up with three different levels!It's perfect! Just the job!
4,My wireless keyboard has a full length projecting section on the underside near the leading edge to house batteries. The keyboard stand had to be fixed to the projection covering the access hatch to the battery compartment. The fixing pads are bigger than the projection so only around two thirds of the pads are in contact with the keyboard. No problem at all. The pads are self adhesive and have stayed put with no signs of parting company with the keyboard. I checked that the pads can be prised off which they can so I can change batteries and then re-fix. It is a very neat design sturdy and firmly holds 3 positions of tilt. Excellent device but I thought slightly over priced hence the 4 stars for price. Very satisfied proof of which is I don't even think about it. It just works.
5,かなり打ちやすくなりました。疲労も減り気味。
4,ノートPCの高がさがちょうど良くなって、タイピングもだいぶ快適になりました。ただ、リュックに入れての移動中に滑り止めのゴムが途中で取れてしまうのと、背面上辺に取り付けするとがちょうど排気口と重なるという難点がありますが、概ね期待できる製品かと思います。
5,It's a great product it gives me more height than the normal legs that came with the keyboard (Tecware Phantom RGB) I only have it on the 1st notch and I have placed it a little off-centre due to my key puller and it's sturdy on both settings.I wish they had the ESC Flip Pro which can be extended to reach the edges so that you get the natural way to adjust the height of the keyboard instead of going behind the keyboard. I might just get the saw out :)
5,Good value for the money
4,繋がっているので、場所を選ぶけど、くっつけることができれば安定性は良い。スタンドに滑り止めが付いてて、スタンドに遊びがなくグラグラせずに安定する。好みの問題だけど、存在感がありすぎるのでもう少しシンプルにしてほしいのと、ホワイトが欲しい。耐久性については、まだ2日目なので分からない。
5,Very simple and straightforward to apply and the ability to change the height means you get the perfect level of elevation. I shopped around for a while but having the feet on a board means you will get them perfectly level rather than two individual feet
4,PERFECT
5,ロジクールのワイヤレスキーボード（MX KEYS MINI）用に購入しました。幅が約19cmですから、フルキーボードにはちょっと不向きかもしれませんが、作りはしっかりしていますので安定性は抜群！高さも3段階で調整が効きますので、タイピングが非常に快適になりました。
5,So the boss decided to "treat" us with new computers of course the keyboards were the cheap of the cheap and painful wrists developed. I thought I could wait for 6 months for OT to come and "assess" or sort it out. these worked a treat no more pain and completely adjustable. good price too!!
5,TBH I expected to be disappointed with this as my old keyboard is big and heavy (but I love it). Instructions say to affix the riser parallel to the top of the keyboard on the back. As the top of my keyboard is curved and because it's a heavy beast the law of physics told me I should put it lower down and dead centre. I did this and it's brilliant. Supports the keyboard well and doesn't move when I hammer the keys. Very impressed!
5,I can’t  use my magic keyboard flat it really hurts my wrists and is the wrong position for someone trained to type on a typewriter.  I looked on Amazon and thought I would give this a try. It arrived earlier than expected and I am totally thrilled with it.  It really works and is non slip too. Thank you for a great piece of kit.
5,Using with an Apple magic keyboard and it fits well.
5,Did exactly what I needed it to do making working more comfortable. Highly recommended with the 3 settings likely to suit a wide variety of people.
5,I love how easy this product was to fit and how well it works. It gives me great flexibility in the angle I have my keyboard. It is well built and the accompanying instructions were easy to follow. Highly recommend.
5,Good product but overpriced.
5,サイズも角度もぴったりで私は気にいっています。
5,私的にはバッチリでしたが、斜めのキーボードタッチ角度が嫌な人もいるので、賛否両論あると思います。
4,magic keyboardにて使用しています。同製品は床面が机に密着するような性質があるため、非常に使いづらい点がありました。この商品を使用することで、タイピング等が非常に快適になりました。
5,I was a little worried when this item arrived because it is about half the length of my standard sized keyboard and I worried that it would tip up when I used the number pad or was holding down the shift button.My concerns were needless it fits in place and holds the keyboard steady even with my heavy hands and sausage fingers.  I found that the smaller of the two leg options held the keyboard at a comfortable height and stopped the reflected glare from the overhead in the office.Recommended!
3,The product is good for what it's purpose is but is very overpriced
5,Great product.
4,なんでこんなに平らな設計にしたんだろう、開発者は使い込んでないのだろうか？…というキーボードを職場で宛がわれたので貼り付けてみました。高さがちょうど良くなって、だいぶ快適になりました。ベストなのは、キーボードの上辺一杯に貼り付けるのが良いのですが、どういう設計か無駄な盛り上がりが仕立ててあるので、底板の2/3ぐらいの所にしか付けられませんでした。少しカドの方を強く押すと安定性に欠けます。まあ、根本的にキーボードの設計がクソって事なんですけど。キーボードがなだらかすぎて不満なんだけどコレが使いたいとか、使わざるを得ないという場合にはすげー重宝する。
3,PC付属のキーボードの足部分が経年劣化で分解してしまったので，傾斜を付けるために購入しました。商品は2種類の足のどちらか一方を選択することで2段階の傾斜角が選択できるようになっています。また，これらの足のどちらも使用せず格納した状態にすると，最小の傾斜角を選択できる本体形状になっています。全体的に単純な構造をしており，材質もプラスティックで，アルミのような金属ではありません。私の感覚では1000円位の商品価値に感じられます。
3,ロジクール アドバンスド ワイヤレスキーボード      の角度が浅くてなんともキータッチしにくいので、当商品を試してみました。うん、2段目（Medium）にすると、なかなか打ちやすいですね。これで、キータッチミスも軽減できそうです。とは言え、こんな単純な構造にもかかわらず、単体のキーボードが買えるくらいの価格設定はちょっと残念。この価格ならば、高さ調整はもっと小刻みにできるようにしてほしいと思います。
5,Easy to use. Doesn't take up space. Makes huge difference to using the keyboard comfortably.
5,I have purchased several of these as I have setup a retro room with commodore computers. They are on shelves but when laid flat they just do not show off their potential. I got these and placed them under my Commodore 64 etc at the highest setting and now you get a great view of the machine at an angle. Brilliant!
5,長時間の作業が楽になった
5,Far better than a flat keyboard and wrist ache
5,It's brilliant and works as advertised giving keyboard the perfect angle to type in comfort. Well made and can be folded away when not in use. A really useful inexpesive and effective addition. Is invisible but could possibly be made in other colours to match keyboards.
5,2段目の高さにして使ってます。USBケーブルが脱着できるタイプのキーボードだと中心寄りの場所に貼り付ける事になる場合が多いと思います。台パンした時にキーボードに何回か物理攻撃をしてしまいましたが、割れたりする事なくピンピンしてます。頑丈。
3,Ziel war es eine Tastatur so zu erhöhen dass eine Tischsteckdose darunter verbleiben kann. Das geht mit diesem Teil nicht bzw nur bedingt da es in allen Abmessungen viel zu klein ist und somit nicht den Darstellungen auf den Fotos entspricht. Vielleicht hätte ich besser hinschauen müssen... Preis erscheint demnach etwas zu hoch.
5,Absolutely brilliant wish I had bought one years ago. Delivery excellent.
5,何回も張りなおせる割には、しっかりしており安定してキーボードが打ちやすくなりました。
5,Easy to install and very versatile. Bought 2 one for keyboard and laptop.
5,Great value for money and worked a treat 👍🏻
4,高さ調節は三段階で良いと思います。
5,I bought it to raise my keychron k3 keyboard. It’s now much easier to type. I set it up to the lowest height and it’s enough. The other levels are quite high and don’t if anyone even needs them but happy with my purchase.
5,Perfect. As described. Works brilliantly
4,Happy with this device easy to fit 3 adjustment positions good for the price.
5,So simple to attach completely reusable because it doesn't use adhesive great range of height / tilt options. So pleased this does exactly what I wanted.
5,Brilliant little piece of kit love it.  Really strong & positions well.  So easy to use once on forget it. Perfect for avoiding bad necks.
5,Easy to add to the keyboard and works as should
5,So much more comfortable using the keyboard and sturdy to boot!
1,I bought this as it had really good reviews. What a mistake as the pads wouldnt stick properly as the keyboard would slip as I was typing. Don’t waste your money on these
1,接地面グリップとなるはずのグレーのゴムの部品が使用2週間で6個のうち4個外れて消失。高い買い物になってしまった。
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               期待せずに買いましたが、非常に良いです！安くて、取り付けも簡単、高さ調整も三段階で可能です。ロジクールのキーボードに付けて半年程度経ちましたが、今の所、何も問題なく使えています。
4,コンパクトでほとんどのキーボードに取り付け可能なのではないかと思います。取り付けたパーツ自体は滑り止め効いて良い感じですが、角度によってキーボード下側に当初から付いてある滑り止め用ゴムの接地が甘くなる様ですが、まあここは工夫次第ですかね。概ね満足できる製品です！
4,StayHomeよりも早く在宅が始まり、モニタとの距離が近すぎるなということで、PCデスクにさらにPCデスクを加えて距離を取ると、ブラインドタッチのできない私にはキーボードとモニタの目線移動が多くなったので、少しキーボードを傾けるために導入しました。キーボードは東プレのR2TL-JP4-BKで、望むような改善効果は得られました。このキーボードの足はプラのため、滑りやすかったのですが、このスタンドの足はきちんとストッパーの役目を果たしています。その面でも良かったと思います。星１つ減らしているのは、キーボードとの接着テープの耐久性など安定性が不明なので、とご理解願います。なお、ノートPCなどにはもう少し昇降性のある方が使いやすいかと思い、妻には別のもの(Nulaxy)をプレゼントしてます。第２波など、長期化に備えて、色々と環境構築が大変ですが、少しでも参考になればと思います。また、座高など体格差の影響もあると思いますので、自己責任でご判断願います。
5,Very handy computer keyboard stand tilts keyboard to three different angles makes it easier to see and comfortable to use great idea!
4,Práctico y sencillo.
5,Like the title 👍🏾
4,magic keyboardに使っています。人によると思いますが、私は一番低い高さを少しつけるのがベストフィットでした。調節できるのはいいですね。安定感もあります。　テレワークで大活躍です！
5,Great value easy to attach to my Apple Keyboard simple to use
5,とても使いやすいです。安定感もあり、キーボードがガタっとなることもないです！滑り止めもついていたし、装着も楽で良かったです。
5,I was worried that it might be a bit short for logitech mx keys but it works perfectly. It could be a bit cheaper for what it is however.
5,いいよ耐久性安定性良し高さも3段階調整できるから良しBluetooth キーボードにつけて使っています
3,appleのmagic keybordに貼り付けて使用しています。貼り付けて足を出さないで使用するくらいがちょうどいいです。二段階目の角度だとかなりきつい傾斜になります。逆にいうと、ちょうどいい角度調整はできないのでもう少し薄い作りにして、角度調整が柔軟にできるようになると最高だと思いました。貼り付けた際の安定感や粘着力はいい感じです。ガタつくこともありませんでした。
5,This product worked well and I would have no problem with recommending it to others
5,fixed to my Apple keyboard easily with stickers provided.  Offers 3 different heights - so much better for my wrist support
5,Great as my keyboard at work did not rise enough for me
5,Excellent product. Not much else to say really. It does the job. Makes it easy for me to use my keyboard.
5,Expensive but product is good
1,Great little gadget however does not stayed stuck to keyboard and pops off even when slightly touched. Can’t fault the item itself however the glue or sticker used is not strong enough and is frustrating. If you learn too hard on it or move it around the desk it flicks off.
5,Loved this. Too uncomfortable for my wrists using keyboard almost flat and tgis is perfect esp as it has 3 height settings!
3,3段階に高さを調整できるのはいいが、そんな急な角度付ける人いないだろうと言うレベルなので1番ゆるい角度で使っています。そんな機能無しでもっと安価なものがあればよかった。あと粘着シールが結構弱い。
5,keychonのキーボードの高さが足りなく追加。高さがちょうど良くなり良かったです。
5,Excellent well made and offers different hight options
1,This item came at 4 30 pm and return started at 6 15 pm  It is over priced for what came and was to small to fit my keyboard. My advice is to steer clear despite the 5 stars
5,Easy to attach and the fact in can be removed and re attached if required is great
5,Very simple but effective idea and really easy to attach to the keyboard.
5,It holds the keyboard up and everything else goes on the screen
5,This does what is says.  Nice size and does the job well.  Very pleased.
5,Es un poco caro pero cumple con su función perfectamente.
2,It is basic and very expensive for just a piece of plastic as I thought there were more to it but wouldn't buy it waste of good money as I will put it down as a loss do not waste your money on cheap plastic.
5,Exactly what it says - brilliant fit
5,Easy to use and exactly what I wanted.
5,Just what I needed
5,Used for my Mac keyboard. Fitted perfectly.
5,Very easy to setup and use
2,Product looks a bit short for a standard keyboard but it is sturdy when installed with no 'wobble. Adjustment heights all good as well. On some keyboards the unit will install over the keyboard batter compartment but instructions state that it can be removed and res=installed easily
5,ロジクールのK360というワイヤレスキーボードに付けています。上部に電池入れがあるのでやや中央よりに取り付けましたが、タイピングをしていてガタガタしたことはありません。本体の長さに比べて短く見えますが、左右の端のキーを強く押し込んでも、不思議と全く浮くこともありません。このキーボードは背面が僅かに湾曲しているのですが、曲面に沿ってぴったりと接着してくれています。カバンに入れて持ち運ぶこともありますが、引っ掛かって出し入れしづらいと感じることはありません。付属品に設置面のラバーの予備が入っているので、長く使えそうです。
5,Worked just as hoped and was easy to attach
5,Great item and easy to use.
5,自宅のPC環境をノートPCからデスクトップに変えたことで、ワイヤレスキーボードを導入しての購入です。これまで、ノートPCを角度をつけて使用していたことで、すっかりと角度ありのタイピングに慣れてしまい、デスクトップ環境でもこれを再現できないかと考えていたところ、この商品を発見しました。届いて早速ワイヤレスキーボードに設置しましたが、やはり良いですね。角度があることでとてもキーボードが打ちやすくなりました。設置方法もとても簡単で、安定性が高くとても満足しています。ちなみに、購入するとストッパーのラバーが3つ入っており、万が一ストッパーがなくなっても安心という点も満足度が高まっている一因です。安心して購入して大丈夫だと思います。
5,持ち運びが多いので、どうしてもPC本体に貼りたい為、貼り付け型のキーボードスタンドを探しました。こちらはキーボード用ですがイチかバチかで15.6インチのWindowsのノートに貼りました。重さは1.78kgです。使い始めてから一週間ですが、今の所かなり使いやすく、満足しています。一番下の高さでも、ゴム足が付いてるので滑りにくいと思います。僕のような考えの人の役に立てば幸いです。
3,会社支給のキーボードが薄いため、角度を付けるために購入しました。粘着のゲルのようなシールで貼りますがわりとしっかりくっつきますし、剥がすのも容易なので支給品にも使えます。ただ滑り止めのゴムが効かないので使用中に滑ったりします。滑り止めのシートなどを合わせて使用することをお勧めします。
1,neat little product though pricey. Would probably be ok on a narrow keyboard but was not stable on a full-width keyboard with numeric pad
5,ThinkPad自体はBoyataに乗せてちょっと高めにし、手前にトラックポイントキーボードを置く際に使っています。一番高い設定で角度もいい感じです。家用と会社用と2つ買いました。
5,Nifty little deviceworks well.
5,macbook proに装着して、さらに快適操作出来るようになりました。
5,Great product!
5,na
2,耐久性に問題あり。一か月ぐらいで剥がれてダメになりました。
5,高さがあるので、前かがみにならず、姿勢が良くなった。できれば、幅左右3㎝づつでも長いと、更に安定性が増す、と思う。
2,Not worth the money. Not effective
1,It’s too high and can’t be lowered
5,minimale pratico
1,100均一で十分。値段ほどの価値はない。
2,高さを2段階にできるが、1段階まで使用するとキーボードが安定しない
1,とりあえず買ってつけてみた。値段ほど価値無し。なんか他のもので十分代用できる。お勧めしない。
1,This will not stay on my keyboard and collapses every 15 minutes or so - very poor considering the price!
5,I was frustrated because the magic keyboard hurt my wrists but with this attachment I am much more comfortable
5,Product is good but it is very expensive like to get one more for my other keyboard but due to the price I cancel my plan
5,Exactly what I needed to make my apple magic keyboard great. Perfect angles easy to install.
5,I've ordered 4 of these so far in about 6 months. I'm at the computer all day so I frequently change out my keyboards to mix up my keyboarding experience. I bought one of these for each keyboard & love it! I think you can detach & re-use but because they're less than $30 I just bought one for each keyboard to save the hassle of taking it off & putting it back on.I would definitely recommend it.
4,I would give it 5 stars if cost was lower
5,Very sturdy and comfortable. I needed a stand for my apple keyboard and this product really helps me to type comfortably. It also helps me to type for a long time without hurting my wrists.
1,I bought these for my office keyboard. It’s of no use to me as the sticky part is not that sticky. It’s keeps falling off and makes the keyboard unstable. I would t recommend this at all.
5,I wish I could bought it earlier :)
5,Didn’t want a bulky ugly stand for the new MX keys so this fit the profile perfectly
5,Bought for slim keyboard and works great.
5,I will be ordering another for my office.  I ordered this for my home computer but it really makes a difference so I will be reordering.
5,I love this stand.  It's great - I have it set at the second level and it works very well.
5,Easy to use and robustly made
4,would appreciate more if i don't have to stick the stand on my keyboard
2,I've had the product for a very long time and very disappointed.  Almost immediately I noticed that the grip adhering to the keyboard wasn't tight. I thought I'd hold on and think over time it would improve with more usage and more pressure from pushing down on the keyboard.  Nope... All too often the keyboard collapses. Very frustrating. I gave it a chance but after too much failure I'm purchasing a new keyboard stand tonight.  Unless you want to actually glue the stand to your keyboard or computer it won't be worth it. Very disappointed.
5,Found the flat surface of my new iMac Keyboard difficult to 'speed type'. With the addition of the Stand... typing is again comfortable.
2,Falls off keyboard constantly does not tilt keyboard the way I wanted it to expected something a bit better quality and function for price
5,This was a really elegant solution to keyboard ergonomics!
1,the height adjustments as advertised does not work very disappointed
5,very good for night time use
5,Elevates keyboard well there are two choices for angle/height. I would buy this product again.
5,The gadget you didn’t know you needed.  Great product.
5,I need my keyboard at an angle and this works perfectly.
5,easy to put on nice and sturdy
5,A little over priced but it’s convenient and practical.
5,Perfect solution found. Apple keyboard too flat for me (touch typing since 1968!). Easy to attach.
5,Ergonomic and sturdy
4,I like the 3 levels of heights you can choose from how light and portable it is. It does not slipped and very sturdy.
5,Excellent
3,The stand itself is fine. Although after the first day it would come off my laptop because the adhesive does not hold. After a few tries and re-applying it I gave up and used alien tape to do the job - that worked.
5,I bought a cheap Bluetooth keyboard which was flat.  I have been using pads of paper and books to make to incline.  This product has saved me a lot of hassle.  For anyone who has bought a flat keyboard this product is a must.
5,Basically the lowest angle is enough.
