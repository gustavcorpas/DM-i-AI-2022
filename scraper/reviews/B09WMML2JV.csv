4,it’s over al a very good remote but to me there is one downside it has a blinking yellow light that starts to blink randomlyfrom what i know it doesn’t go off without taking out the batteries
5,I thought my television was not working and almost bought another one.  Then someone suggested just getting a remote so I could have full function again and boy am I glad!This works!All functions on this remote match the original device.
4,I really like the remote. The only thing that bothers me is the center button wobbles but it still registers the pressing of the button. But it works great other wise.
3,Some functions do not work and the battery cover falls off because it doesn’t fit correctly.I guess that you get what you pay for.
5,Product is what I needed.
5,Paired instantly more responsive than the stock remote and $10 cheaper than the "Official" replacement. For me the best part is it doesnt have  the useless (for me) playstation vue button.It's a remote and it works. Cant ask for more
5,Does exactly as advertised at a reasonable price. Programs easily. Recommended.
3,Received in good time.  Easy to set up. The up directional button "ring" is not always responsive.
3,The remote works except the center button is not always responsive. Usually turning the tv off and on will restore function.
2,Buttons get stuck and voice takes a min to work
2,Very cheaply made and feels like it. Tried 4 times to get it to Pair with my Toshiba Firetv with no luck.

1,Remote stopped working within a couple of days despite changing batteries multiple times
1,second one 0-2
