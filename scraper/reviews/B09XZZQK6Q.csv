4,TL; DR: Low latency 2.4ghz and bluetooth jack of all trades but sound quality and comfort are mediocre at best out of the box. Swap the pads for Brainwavz Ovals and apply an EQ to make it usable.Full Review:I'll start by saying that I am an audiophile and I do not intend to use these to replace my wired headphones I just need a versatile wireless solution for work.If you are shopping for a headset to use with Windows you should already know that Windows' bluetooth implementation is hot garbage and you need something with a dongle to avoid headaches. This headset provides both bluetooth connectivity and a 2.4Ghz usb c dongle. The dongle comes out at a right angle so if your usb c is in the middle of a bunch of other ports it may cover them.I will compare the Barracuda X against the Epos/Sennheiser 661 which is 3x the price across a number of categories. If you aren't familiar Epos is Sennheiser's "pro" brand and the 661 is their flagship business headphone. My wired reference is the Modhouse Argon Mk3 run through a Topping E30 and Magni Heresy.Latency: Barracuda XAverage latency added vs wired dac/amp setup:Barracuda X (dongle): +35msEpos 661 (dongle): +145msThe difference is night and day. From the data of seen online gaming headsets add 10-80ms of latency over 2.4Ghz dongles. This might not be for you if you are super into e-sports but it's about normal. The Epos dongle is just a pre-paired bluetooth adapter. Bluetooth headsets range from 75-250 depending on A LOT of factors so I didn't bother testing the non-dongle bluetooth latency of either. Connected to a phone for either calls or watching videos they are both acceptable but the latency in windows alone is enough for the X to win over the Epos for zoom calls.Dual Connectivity: Barracuda XWhile not offering simultaneous audio this headset can switch between the dongle and your bluetooth device with a triple click of the power button. It will auto-switch to bluetooth for calls which can be annoying but is probably a good thing. Overall it works great. I can swap to my phone connection to watch youtube during my lunch without any hassle of re-pairing or reconnecting when I am back at my desk. The Epos also offers this but the switching mechanism is not half as convenient.Mic/call control Quality: Tie (sortof)The Epos does a great job of cancelling out background noise but overall sounds worse than the Barracuda X. If you have a quiet environment the X will suit you better and vice-versa with the Epos. The X can also pick up some keyboard noise so either use RTX voice or don't use clicky mechanical switches. Both can be muted easily and discreetly without sending noise through the microphone. Both also offer good on-headset volume control.Comfort: Tie (sortof)Both have too much clamping force for my large XL-ski-helmet-sized head but can be stretched out pretty easily as they both have metal cores to their headbands. The Barracuda X weighs significantly less although material quality is obviously lower. The stock cloth pads are somehow both uncomfortable and sweaty despite being cloth. Swap them for Brainwavz oval pads and they become the most comfortable headset i've ever worn due to the low weight. You will forget you are wearing them.Sound Quality: Epos 661The Epos is tuned well and pretty flat in stark contrast to the bloated bass and missing mids of the X. Good news is the X can be EQ'd in the app to sound meh instead of just being garbage and the EQ holds across connections. The bass is terrible with the stock cloth pads which is why they probably boost it way up by default. With the pads swapped to brainwavz oval protein leather pads ($20) the seal is much better and the bass gets tighter. Soundstage and imaging are better on the X somehow but still not great (or even good really). Forget about the Virtual 7.1 it's garbage.That's all really. It's honestly a very impressive feature set for the price and I cannot state enough how light these things are. With better earpads they are crazy comfortable very easy to wear all day although I did need to bend the (metal) headband a bit to reduce clamping pressure on my watermelon of a head. Sound quality is bad but can be EQ'd to the point that they aren't jarringly atrocious to listen to. Good mic quality and the dual connectivity that is reliable easy to use and low latency make these a 10/10 value for work use. If you are in a loud environment look elsewhere as the mic picks up a bit of background noise and there is minimal isolation and no ANC. They also look fine no one is going to see they small razer logo on the side of the earcups over zoom.
4,I had a wired headset provided for work but they were "on ear" and while they didn't hurt while wearing them at the end of the day I noticed it was bothering me especially wearing them all day/week long. So I went looking for wired headsets that were over ear (but still let me hear ambient sounds) let me switch between 2 computers allowed people to hear me clearly and had decent battery life. This lead me down the rabbit hole of advertisers claims and trying to pick the best ones from all the "free reviews" and "false reviews"...I had used a Razer mouse before and it was well built and worked. So this checked the box for "known brand name" quality and then it's off to the features offered. Even though these were expensive they were very reasonable compaired to other offerings I saw if it delivered on what it promised.The long advertised battery life was a plus the ability to have ambient noise allowed in (this actually works well not as good as if you were not wearing them but good enough) not needing a boom mike (since I work from home I am able to eat/drink/smoke and not having to move a microphone is a big plus) and able to use it on 2 computers by clicking a button on the headset (I wish it also came with a Bluetooth dongle but they are inexpensive here on Amazon). I also like that I can pair it with my Amazon Echo and listen to music after work!After using them for a bit here is what I have found...#1 Battery Life - I have not been able to get 40 hrs out of these now I am not just listening but activly talking on these while in use but I am only getting mid-20hrs out of a full charge.#2 Sound Quality (incoming/outgoing) - The sound of music and voices are great. The quality of my voice to others I have not had anyone complain of not/having trouble hearing me. I have asked coworkers how I sound and they said fine. I believe that having a mic boom would give better quality but its usable and the plus of not having something in front of your face is great!#3 Features/Buttons - The ability for these headsets to remember my last settings after power off/on is great (specifically the ambient noise). It took a bit to remember where the controls were once I started using it but was second nature after a short while. The Active Noise Cancelation workd fine in my house with noise from fans a/c and the like. Anything constant was taken care of by this but occasional or sharp noises were not but I will not be using this so I don't care. I dislike the mute button as you don't get a voice prompt (unike everything else) but I usually use the mute function in the software (Teams Slack Google) I am working with like I previously did so its fine.#4 Software - On my work PC where I am not logged in as an administrator it installed the headphone driver and works without issue but I dont really have any control over the headset other than volume on the PC (which I use the volume wheel on the headset anyway). On my personal computer I went ahead and installed the Synapse software and its bloated I really dont need but you have to install it to update the software (slow and not intuitive) and to see the battery life indicator. This is probably my biggest complaint for these headsets is there is no easy/quick way to see the battery life left and you cannot use the headset while its plugged in and charging!#5 Case - Its well designed has places for the cables and the 2.4g adapter that hold them securely. It also protects the headsets well. But if your like me and use them at home they will go straight to the closet. I only see these as useful for people who take their headsets while traveling.If the battery life falls below 20hrs I am sending them back if it stays above this I will keep and am happy with them.
5,There are two things that I didn't see mentioned in the product description that are good to know:-When powered on it maintains an active Bluetooth connection even when using 2.4-Like a lot of Razer's revenge Bluetooth audio devices this has a low-latency gaming mode. Discovered this in the user manual.I'll start off by saying that getting this device it's initial update was a huge hassle but things have been smooth sailing since. Just try to follow the updater's directions as precisely as possible it should work.The build quality is the weakest point as the exterior is primarily plastic. This is overshadowed by comfort however and the cushions feel soft and light.If you're looking for audio fidelity I really hope you know you're in the wrong place. While I wouldn't say the fidelity is bad I wouldn't say that's where these excel. Instead features and function are what these do best.The directional audio is done very well while the audio modes (ANC and Ambient) do what they say very well. I have 5 cats that tend to get into nonsense and the ambient mode has allowed me to pay them proper attention while gaming. On the off chance I can zone in the ANC completely cuts out fan noises and even most of whatever my partner is watching. Switching is simple and the headphones tell you what you just switched to. I almost wish I could completely skip ANC off since I never use it.The most surprising thing about these is how perfectly they fit my lifestyle. I don't always want to be at my desk to game so I stream to my phone (bonus points for using Razer Kishi). The fact that I can just double tap the mode button and I'm now listening to my phone is awesome. No need to wait for pairing and I've yet to have any connection issues. Mix in the gaming mode and suddenly these are the only headphones I use period.Tl;dr: these headphones are all about the features so make sure that's what is driving your choice before buying these. The features are extremely good while the audio and build quality can feel middling.
5,Honestly I think it’s underrated it’s perfect for gaming and as earphones for music it’s amazing too with the detachable mic I can take it out and not feel like weird they are super light weight and not hard to manage! I own the razer  kitty and razer kraken and through they are built more sturdy with metal they are heavier. I’m a small person with a small head and these are absolutely perfect! I think it’s a huge plus the way I can connect it to my phone and for it being an all in one the 100 are totally worth it! The noise cancelling isin’t as the AirPods Pro but it’s still amazing  they are made of plastic maybe some components being of metal would be good if your earphones tend to scratch these are not it!If you are buying similar to these make sure it’s the 2022 edition barracuda the 2021 does NOT have Bluetooth :(
5,after my 3rd logitech headset going kaput I wanted to try another headset and stick to the "gaming" aspect as I do enjoy the faux-surround. giving razer a shot again I do not regret this purchase.i use "movie" mode for games and it sounds very good. spatial awareness is precise and I feel the THX spatial sound is a bit more "exact" and specific with its environmental sounds compared to using the DTS Headphone X: 2.0 which I find to be a good thing for what I play (Bf4 Bf1 R6 Battlefront 2).I have never had an issue with razer synapse in the past so all the gripe people have with it I do not understand since I have had no issues with with my other razer peripherals. synapse gives lots of customization to make your sound profile fit what you like. bass boost ANC mic adjustments and EQ are just a few things.battery life has been great. better than logitechs (12hrs is such crap). charging is fast as well - it was at 76% when I had first received the headset and charging took less than 15 mins.the mic is standard - nothing special - it's enough to let the team person etc hear you and know what you are saying but that's it. it is nothing to drive home about.comfort is great - i havent had to take them off once during game sessions and they fit snug which i really enjoy. they dont feel like theyll fall off.the build quality is so-so - being that the headset is primarily plastic it does give it a cheap look and feel but a heavier headset is not the smartest thing if you want to be comfortable in them at least for me anyways. the band is at least metal when adjusting so hooray for that.the switch button between Bluetooth and 2.4ghz is awesome. i use it all the time to play mobile games and my pc games. i really enjoy that i can use this headset with nearly everything i own without having to switch headsets constantly. super convenient.the carrying case is awesome! super nice and travel friendly. really like how that is included.all in all this headset albeit i do feel the price should be maybe 50 or so dollars less is worth the investment. for me it's worth it as i can swap between mobile and PC without changing headsets and answer calls of course. the sound is great and very spacious. even if the headset may feel cheap when using them you will think otherwise. if you need a new headset i do recommend these for both gaming and casual use.
5,Excelente artículo materiales de buena calidad elegante muy liviano excelente sonido batería de larga duración es posible conectarlo de forma inalámbrica por Bluetooth o por receptor USB nativo o por Cable de 35 mm que viene incluido (y de muy buena calidad) así que cuando te quedes sin batería y no puedas cargarlo puedes seguir usándolo con el cable. Puedes conectarlo al PC Smartphone consola de videojuegos televisor o algún equipo de audio y maravillosamente puedes alternar entre la conexión por Bluetooth o receptor USB presionando 3 veces un botón eso te permite contestar el teléfono mientras estás usando el PC. Tiene cancelación pasiva de ruido muy básica en los auriculares el micrófono si tiene cancelación activa de ruido. Sería perfecto si tuviera cancelación activa de ruido en los auriculares supongo que esto hará aumentar el precio. Lo recomiendo 100%.
4,It took me almost three hours searching through all options of headphones for gaming. Turns out these are also a good set of media headphones since the microphone can be disconnected. The mic is clear and good even though I connect and disconnect it often and if you don’t want to be heard it also has a mute button to switch between game chat to silent playing. The soft pads make long consumption sessions enjoyable unlike leather cushions where the ears get hot and the pressure makes wearing for long periods of time almost intolerable. The fast wireless receiver makes gaming and media consumption through a laptop/computer seem almost wired-like. The extra for me is the option of having Bluetooth; not only does it have Bluetooth but it comes with the Razer Audio app. The app allows to customize equalization to the user’s preference and the changes are saved for the next time the headphones are connected. This is a good gaming headset that also doubles as a good set of wireless headphones for travel (probably not unless you’re on a plane because they do not have noise cancellation)There are a few things that would make these a bit better headset:1. A Razer Audio app for pc for continuity EQ wise and to also monitor battery life while gaming/media streaming.2. If noise cancellation would be  an option I would appreciate an extra set of closed ear pads to change from comfortable gaming sessions to air travel noise isolated silent media streaming trips.For the price there is nothing as versatile as this headset.
5,I use these for my PS4 which is literally effortless to connect; you just plug the USB dongle adapter into the front USB port. I use it for my computer that is so old it doesn't even have Bluetooth same process as the PS4; just plug it into the USB port.  I have had Schultz and Beats but razer is a different breed of comfort and quality. Not only sound quality but physical material quality. Very comfortable and very cheap compared to the $300 Beats. I recommend these over any Beats.
4,Great headset very comfortable to wear. The ability to quickly swap between the 2.4 wireless and bluetooth connection is handy allowing connection to 2 devices at once.Biggest and only drawback is that the mute button on the back of the left ear cup is RIGHT where I grab the set with my thumb. I have muted myself multiple times inadvertently while adjusting the set or putting them on.
5,I've had this headset for only a couple of months now and honestly one of the best purchases I've made when it came to my audio preference. Listening to music and podcasts on these is an absolute blast. The sound quality for gaming has not once let me down. I can't quite remember if these do have noise cancelation but if they do I'm sure it's stupendous. They just work great all around. Sometimes there is a audio glitch there they don't connect right but I learned that's more a user error on my part rather then from that actual headset. :]
4,All around it's a great headset; the noise cancellation and transparency mode are great and the battery life is amazing and the short time to charge is even better. The sound quality could see some improvement however it is still good enough for the price point. It's of great build quality and seems very durable (only have had them for about two weeks so far).Now on to the flaws. They're honestly not that important but more just quality of use critiques. When you join a voice call while having noise canceling or transparency mode on (on PC) it drastically lowers the volume and puts some sort of filter over all of your audio- not just the voice call. Occasionally when switching between Bluetooth and the high speed wireless for PC it won't reconnect to the PC until you turn off the headset and turn it back on or sometimes just switching between noice cancelling etc. the final critique I have is about how when wearing them for extended periods of time the headset starts to squeeze your head and where the headset rests around your ear can get pretty sore.Edit: a firmware update has fixed the connectivity issues completely
3,If you buy it and you are using a mac don't buy it if you are planning to use the dongle thank's for the god that guided me to buy the 2022 version which has Bluetooth I'm using it for mac using Bluetooth for the dongle it is working and stopping working randomly and the OS act weird like just stopped working there is no software also to control it I tried the razer software Synapse 2 and it is useless and causes more issues so to control it I have to connect it to my phone use their app on Android.Also another thing I tried the 2.4 wireless dongle on my phone and it is working fine so I'm sure it will be a problem for every mac user properly or actually it will be a problem since there synapse 3 is not available for mac.The sound is good quality is good I'm satisfied otherwise I don't recommend it for mac users though.I mean I know the macOS is the worst OS and no one uses it for gaming I bought this headset for daily use and to be free from wires in meetings and these kinds of things.
5,A wireless headset at this price? It's truly amazing! First off its extremely comfortable and easy to use without the wires. It does have its flaws with the microphone quality but overall its amazing.
5,The Razer Barracuda has a great design quality and looks better than the X-version in my opinion. The physical form factor of the headset is compact and sturdy.The headset is actually ready to go immediately after unboxing after connecting the included USB-C transmitter that is included.Gaming experience was positive without noticeable sound lag. Microphone quality is above average. Battery life is slightly less than the Barrecuda X model but was long enough and practical. The integrated Beamforming microphone technology seems like promising little feature that's unique to this headset as well as the Barrecuda pro.Sound quality wise the bass is quite deep and low but is not exaggerated. The brighter levels are balanced and are not spiky. Tuning and playing with the EQ settings of course is optional to get the preferred sound for your liking. The overall sound quality delivered by the characteristic 50mm drivers was good.Pairing and connecting to dual devices is easy. It can connect to a high-speed 2.4GHz connection and a Bluetooth device at once. Answering calls whiles gaming with ease and without having to totally disrupt your game.Aux is supported. But there’s no ANC. The memory foam ear cushions are comfortable to use especially for long periods of gaming. I prefer them over the leather ones that comes with the Pro version.Its lightweight and quite comfortable with no detachable microphone boom. But its slightly heavier than the Barracuda X which is extremely Lightweight (300g vs 250g for the X-version). This in my opinion makes the X-version slightly more ergonomic (and comfortable) with just 250g of weight.In short this Razer Barracuda gaming headset has an overall good quality hardware design with various capabilities and impressive sound and microphone quality. However I would have preferred a standard 50hrs battery life for this model too as well as a carrying case.
5,Works perfectly on a Xbox all u need is a Bluetooth transmitter make sure it compatible with Xbox series s and x then get Dolby Access and it makes it so much better. The noise canceling works amazing better then noses and the sound quality is unbelievable
5,Amazing compatibility use the C adapter for ps5 Bluetooth for phone and aux for PC. Decent charge but not longer than 4 hours maybe. Sound could be a little louder but is clear for footsteps in games.
4,BAD
3,I love the fit feel and long battery life.  I LOVE the lack of a boom microphone and how easy the headset is to use (although it has intermittent initial connection issues).  The headset has a rattle.  After doing some research I found this is a common problem with these head sets.  I had to make a choice... keep the headset that has no boom mic long battery life or go back to a wired headset or another brand with a boom mic.  I chose to live with the rattle to keep my face free of a boom mic.  The sound quality is very good... maybe not quite what a wired headset is but close enough for gaming and video watching.  If I were a music aficionado I would look elsewhere.  But for online needs the convenience and long battery out weigh the con of the rattle when you shake your head.  Like so many Razer products... close to perfect and overpriced... always a flaw with the good stuff.
3,My Corsair HS70 Pros broke and I thought I give these a try. I watch reviews which the mic sounded ok so I gave em a chance. I thought the sound quality was pretty good. If using on a PC you get full control of the headset via Synapse but no amount of adjustments made the mic sound good to teammates on discord. I was described as being in a trashcan down the hall with no warmth or depth and tinny.Clamping force on my melon felt good and the headset is nice and light. I prefer the cloth like earpads over the leatherette ones which is why I went with the mid-grade set. Cables are premium and build quality felt good overall. Unfortunately the mic issue was enough to return these.
4,The audio quality is amazing and there are plenty of audio options but the built in mic isn’t much to like. The ear cups can be a little uncomfortable for anyone with bigger ear’s
4,I bought this specifically for mobile gaming and so far its been great. I do have a larger head and it fits comfortable enough to play extended lengths. The ear cushions go around the ear and do not sit on your ear. I do prefer astro a40s style of adjustment though.The headset feels somewhat cheap considering it's mostly if not completely plastic so be careful stretching/flexing it.
5,So far very comfortable. Charged easily and connected to usb c dongle without issue. Good fit to my ears. Cannot seem to use them while charging but not really an issue there. Don't really know about the mic yet.
3,The sound quality from the speakers is great after some tweaks but it only connects to pc with synapse access to change settings when using the usb c dongle which is awkward shaped and will definitely block other ports. Bluetooth connection works but you loose all the synapse customizations. Battery life was good the weight is ok for extended use but the mic quality is bad all around. Even with tweaking settings in synapse the mic quality is very bad even when completed to a $20 headset. Discord was only picking up every other word at best and sounded very muffled/distant when it did pick up. Noise cancellation worked pretty well for both the ambient noises around me and not picking up ambient sounds on the mic again when it picked up anything at all. Overall for a $250 headset expectations were much higher and this thing was all around disappointing.

5,It’s a great headset noise cancellation could be better but it still does the job correctly
5,Love this headset. Comes with a neat case. Great sound overall. The battery is actually really good lasts a few days before I need to charge it again
3,Pros: Product is great! Tested with Microsoft TeamDiscord and other ingame voice chat and it worked perfectly!Cons: Lately Amazon shipping has been very disappointing. They promised to compensate me for my previous returned product that came super late but they went back on their word then when they dropped off of my barracuda pro it says delivered but its not. Eventually found it at some corner 😤 like how?! 3 stars!
3,Bought these for my wife and myself. I sent mine back because of the lack of mic monitoring.Pros - Pretty decent sound very comfortable lots of connectivity options. Awesome battery life.Cons - no mic monitoring and the razer software isn't great
5,If you are looking for a headset for music/gaming/conference/mobile Barracuda Pro is perfect. It's definitely not perfect in each area but it's the only all-in-one headset on the market.The mic quality is totally acceptable for daily meetings and gaming (don't know why the mic quality sounds so bad in some reviews). It's so nice to get rid of the Bluetooth hands-free quality audio while using the microphone. Finally say goodbye to my sony XM4.
5,Best headset I’ve ever owned really opened my eyes to wireless so convenient for gaming if I have to step away
