5,I bought this drone for my 12 year old kid and he loves it its very esay to fly he loves it!!I recomend the Drone!!
5,great product will buy more for christmas
5,Fits in the palm of your hand.  Easy to work.  Comes with 2 rechargeable batteries for drone you'll need 3AAA batteries for the controller.  Fun lights  and comes with a screw driver and extra propellers.  Sturdy ran it into the wall and still works as intended.
5,Kids loved the bright lights to be able to see and fly the drone at night. This drone has great maneuverability and quite precise landing ability once you get the knack of it! (Thus far no broken propellers but it comes with spares just in case).
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Nice drone for kids to start one.  My almost 6 year old was very excited when he saw it.Comes with a battery for the drone but you’ll need batteries for the remote.Seems nice overall.  Don’t crash at high speeds and youll be fine I think.  They give you extra parts too for the fan just incase.
4,Drones can be fun but you must start as a beginner with a space go care this one the Bezgar hq 051 is a mini drone beginners friend
5,This small drone is so much fun to use. You can do cool stunts with it you push one of the buttons and the drone will do a whole flip from any side it also has different speed modes and does go pretty fast it has lights that u can switch on or off and is pretty easy to learn to fly. I recommend this for anyone starting to get into drones.
5,This drone is an excellent gift idea for kids as it is not only it is easy to control with its simple remote but the drone also lights up with LED lights and has three different speeds to choose from. It comes with two batteries a charger and some small replacement parts a bonus! The drone itself is small and lightweight but feels well-made. I recommend only flying it indoors to si it doesn't get lost outside as it is very light. It is a fun interactive toy for kids to enjoy and would make a wonderful gift! Five stars!
5,This is a very very cool mini drone. It is pretty durable too and looks like it was built to last. Very easy to understand for someone who is not too tech savy
5,I got this for my son. He's been using one of those "hands free" drones that respond to your hands' proximity. It's fun but now with this drone he has more control and can do more things with it. It has great handling once you get a feel for the controls. It's fun doing the flips with it. Definitely a great starter drone!
5,This is wonderful for children to begin to learn about drones. It is fun and interactive with the remote that requires 3 triple A batteries. The drone includes a rechargeable battery with a spare. Included are a few extra replacement parts in case of breakage. Fun indoors or out.
5,This tiny drone is a lot of fun for kids and adults indoor easy to control and relatively robust. Once you fix the drift with the controller it stays in perfect stationary flight. From there you can use either headless or directional control mode holding the speed toggle for 3 seconds. From there you can play for around 5 minutes with each battery (which is okay accounting the size and weight of the batteries). I crashed landed several time without any problem but it is so tiny and light that probably won't survive someone stepping on it. For $36 on sale is a deal.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This mini drone has simple intuitive controls attractive lighting and really solid beginner performance. Press a button and the drone launches into the air. There are flip functions speed adjustments and other helpful features on this low-cost offering and it includes a pair of batteries so you can connect the spare when you've run out of juice after about 6-7 minutes. The body is a little more durable than other softer-shell entry drones and I trust that this BEZGAR model will last for quite some time.Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go check to see if my battery has finished recharging so I can chase my girls around the house. So much fun!
5,Comes with 2 batteries and a charger.  Very stable and can do flips.  My son loves flying it around the house.  It has bright LED lights that are especially fun to fly in a dark room.
5,This is an awesome gift for kids my son started enjoying from day1He was able unpack well and easily started playing.I am happy to share this review this drone built with great quality.This is my son first drone for age group like 10 to 12 years kids this will be a awesome gift.

The remote has the settings for whether you want the lights on or off. If you move the joystick left the drone goes right and vice versa. I'm not sure if that's normal? Otherwise it's freaking awesome. I got it for my son's 6th birthday since he has been asking for a drone. This was advertised as good for younger children and/or beginners and it was right. He has crashed it about 100x so far so obviously pretty durable as well lol. He is so happy with it.

Lol But we did find it. Decided to play with it in the house. It is surprisingly easy to control. I mean after a couple of minutes.
5,I love the vibrant colors easy to use great for beginners
5,Easy to control for younger kids and has nice bright led lights on it.  Also nice that it includes 2nd battery.  Good for first drone experience.
