3,Battery defective had to buy replacement batteries to make it work.
2,This scanner was in good condition as delivered. I was able to connect the scanner to my laptop via Bluetooth however I could never get the scanner to actually work. I first tried the as-delivered configuration using Notepad to display the scanned barcode no dice. I then tried downloading and using 123Scan to configure the scanner but 123Scan would not recognize this scanner (firmware issue I think). I then tried using the 'reset to defaults' configuration sequence from the manual I downloaded (not included with the scanner) and I still couldn't get it to work.This might be a good value for companies that already have this model of scanner and have experience working with and configuring them but if you're looking for a quick turn-key solution and don't have a lot of time to spend trying to learn how to configure it then don't buy this one. You'll be trading off your time for the $ savings. Again probably a great deal for people who already have experience with this model and/or configuring barcode scanners in general.

1,Both of the barcode scanners I received from this seller cannot be used by me. Its full model number is DS6878-SR20117WR. After reaching out to Zebra Technologies for support on this product I was informed this model of the DS6878-SR barcode scanner is a special model specific to Walmart which could only ever be used for Walmart locations. None of this information is present on the Amazon product page for this item. Don't buy this product.
3,These scanners were just what I was looking for at a great price. Unfortunatley couldn't give the highest rating because one of the two was defective on arival and would not charge. However the on-line return and replacement was quite simple with the replacement on the way the next day.From the one that did work I was able to confirm that these are the same professional quality scanners we have come to expect from Motorola/Symbol. It last the full day  (about 300 scans) on a charge wakes immediatley and has a fast response time from trigger to read to input.One upgrade on these from our older wireless Symbol scanners is that the cradles are powered by the USB and do not require a seperate power supply.If your need is not time critical and allows for a possible defective unit - these renewed scanners are a great value.
2,Could not get 123scan software to update or configure these scanner.Called Zebra tech support and when they checked the serial numbers I learn that thesescanner came from walmart stores and have custom firmware that cannot be updated or changed to standard firmware.
5,Absolutely the best scanner. Does not necessarily come configured for Bluetooth. Get the manual from zebra and the 123Scan utility (not required but easier) for configuration.123Scan lets you save a configuration and load it on multiple scanners.I tried some ‘china’ scanners if you are using this for any business reason go for it. The others are finicky and slow but unless you’ve used this one you don’t realize it.Bought another one.
5,These are awesome scanners. I have bought more than once for my business needs.
5,The Best scanner i ever used. I work at shipping place taking 100 or more packages a day in all sort of forms. This scanner can read em all! Wet or faded! In case the scanner failed to read. Contact the seler for a help. I m glad i did. Now mine reads 100% of timesThank you
5,The product came in great working condition everything we packed with care. Very happy with the purchase.
5,N/A
1,I purchased two of these and had to return both.  They had custom firmware for a company on them and they can not be changed or updated making them virtually useless
5,Está como nuevo justo lo que necesitaba!Ya tenía uno de laMisma marca pero alambicó y funciona mejor!!
5,It works on 1D2D no problem. The reset are trash.
5,Great product.
5,Works very well. Just what I was looking for.
1,Lo compre y no lo use x meses . Cuando empece a usarlo algunos codigos de barra no los leia y de golpe ya no funciona mas. ni prende las luces de carga ni nada
1,Doesn't work. Needed a 2D barcode scanner for inventory. Tried using the reset codes on the included card but it still doesn't register with the computer. The scanner is too old to receive updates.
1,Product came damaged wouldnt order ever again broken
1,Be aware ⚠️⚠️ the product came used
1,Didn’t work?!
1,This scanner was mass renewed by some 3rd party that they originally purchase from a big retail store. According to Symbol or Zebra this scanner was customized for the retail store and other users will face difficulties in resetting to factory default or using std procedure to reset the scanner. I have 4 scanners that already went bad and can't be used. I even talk to Zebra Tech Support. fyi Zebra owns Symbol scanner now. Good when it works. Otherwise a useless scanner.
5,Excelente producto para aque que quiere un lector de código
1,I did not recieved the first order the second order I recieved they were not renewed they were highly used.
1,Two scanners one named Motorola one named Symbol. Look the same. Proper procedure used to set up scanners for keyboard attachment to load serial numbers from barcodes. One works some of the time after continually having to "reset" the scanner. The second has worked only "one time" and then will not "reset" depsite following proper set up procedure. It's an ornament. Never again.
