5,This Wi-Fi adapter couldn't have been easier to setup and use.  The box is really straightforward - when you open it up you discover the Wi-Fi unit itself and a USB 3.0 cable (with a USB 3.0 Micro connector on the unit similar to portable hard disks and an A connector on the other end).  When you plug the adapter in to your PC it appears as a small removable storage drive with the driver available - a really user friendly touch given that if you're installing a network adapter you likely don't have an Internet connection to download drivers!The device wasn't automatically installed by my Windows 10 PC but once I ran the driver installer it immediately started right up without me even needing to reboot or make any configuration changes.  I disabled my onboard Wi-Fi adapter and switched over to the new one and things worked exactly as expected.I ran a speed test comparing my ThinkPad P1 Gen 2's internal Intel WiFi 6 AX200 adapter to this TP-Link in a marginal coverage area and I was blown away by how much the transfer speeds improved.  I consistently receive about 200Mbps over 5Ghz networks with the internal antenna on the laptop;  with the TP-Link adapter I was able to achieve 290Mbps an improvement of almost 50%.  Speeds were much higher and much more comparable closer to the router of course - but if you've got a desktop on the fringe of coverage the large antennas on this unit could make all the difference for you.About my only complaint is that there's no mounting hole on the back of the adapter's case - a little recessed screw hole would have been nice for wall mounting the receiver.  Nothing a little 3M VHB adhesive tape can't fix though!USB Wi-Fi adapters aren't particularly exciting but this is a really high quality one that achieves excellent performance from a trustworthy brand.  Highly recommended.
5,Bought this since my gaming PC is far from the router and I did not want to run an ethernet cable after grandma tripping (like how..)Comcast gave me a new router that I configured to throw out WiFi 6 (802.11AX). My old AC adapter was getting maybe 60 down at most with ping 50+ and sometimes way higher making game time miserable.The new adapter using the AX spectrum is showing significantly better ping. I'm seeing 18-30 ping (steady no large jumps!) with download speeds around 180000 mbs (yes that much of an upgrade). Upload increased from 25 to 58 mbs which I figure is more reasonable.The old AC adapter was a large dual antenna one (maybe two years old at most) so it was of higher quality. This new adapter is worth the investment if you are gaming and need something to reliably go through several walls in your home and don't want to run cables. To count it's going through 7 of mine currently.Make sure your router is WiFi 6 capable or you'll be better off buying a cheaper adapter! I cannot stress this enough. An old router using WiFi 5 will not bring you any performance increase by using this adapter. Both ends must be compatible or you're not going to have a good time.You can go into settings and turn on multi user mimo. I noticed a considerable increase using that mostly on upload though. Again turn it on in the router settings first!Overall super happy this is working out for me. I hope this review helps you!
5,My internet speed is going from 300 to 600. To get ready I upgraded from an older surfboard to the S33 and my EERO Pro (wi-fi 5) to the EERO Pro 6E. After the upgrade my Surface Book 2 was usually connecting at 150-250 down. Sadly my upgrade made no difference. Desperate I order the TP Link adapter.It is now connecting the the EERO at 1200 so I'm pleased.  I connected it directly to a 3.0 USB port on the laptop so I don't know if it would work connected to my MS Hub 2.0.When you plug in the adapter it appears as a new disk drive. That's where the setup tool you need to run can be found.  After running the setup I did a couple of other things.1) Disabled the built-in wi-fi of the laptop. That forces windows to use the TP Link.2) Configured the TP Link adapter with VHT 2.4G mode=DISABLE so it wouldn't connect at 2.4G speeds which is often does.3) Configured USB Switch Mode=USB Mode 3 since my ports are all 3.1.My EERO router is in a closet about 40 feet away.My laptop is stored in an enclosed cabinet but I put the TP Link module on top of the cabinet and aimed it at the EERO.I'm not sure if my EERO PRO 6E supports MU MIMO so I left that disabled. I figured I had 1200 not going to mess around anymore.
5,This is an excellent WIFI adapter providing High Speed on my 5Ghz band home network. Our 2012 desktop PC on Windows 10 would internally only support the 2Ghz band. We were getting about 50 Mbps downloads on the 2Ghz band while getting about 270 Mbps on our newer PC on the 5Ghz band. This older PC is now matching the ~ 270Mbps on the 5Ghz band. Easy install. Plug it in and the PC picks it up (as WIFI 2 on our system). Use the blue USB port if you have one for best results. Turn off WIFI 1 (again our system) and turn on WIFI 2 enter system key (password) and it takes off. Note these speeds are great from my point of view. The device has higher capability we do not need (or pay our provider for more).
5,Where my office is the WiFi signal strength is mediocre at best.  For years I had been limping along with the built-in WiFi adapter in my laptop.  I tried one of the little USB adapters with only a tiny bump in reception.  I got fed up one day and bought this one.  I wish I would have bought it a long time ago.  I now have FULL BARS using this.  The product never goes down and my internet is seamless.  If you have poor WiFi reception and are looking for a quality product look no further.
5,Revised 2nd review:  I bought 2 of these for 2 computers. 1st one was great. 2nd one has non-functional USB cable. The unit is fine cable doesn't work.tested both units with the one good cable - neither works with the bad cable. Call support. I can send it all back to them or pay more & they willsend new unit. ***** So no thx. I am buying replace cable myself (costs between $3 & $7). If that doesn't work and it should I will return through Amazon. The unit itself works fine. Cheap cable problem & utterly useless support IMHO.First review:  I have a 50Mbs internet connection. I was getting 10- 18 Mbs on my old Dell laptop in a dead zone at home and virtual.world was crashing repeatedly.I plugged this auto setup. Disabled the Dell WIFI enabled this little gem gave network password to connect.BINGO instantly 40Mbs. I just bought another one to try with a Linux box. Could not be happier.
5,This is my 2nd purchase of this TP-Link USB WiFi.  1st one was for my office at work which ended up being AMAZING.  This time I needed it for my home PC due to the fact my current home went "all wireless" and no longer had a LAN line to plug into.  Main router to the house is on the 2nd floor above me and on the opposite corner so my on-board WiFi was only catching 5Mbps MAX.  TP-Link to the rescue!!As you can see in the screen shot upon installing the drivers from the provided CD-ROM (I NEVER build a PC RIG without an optical drive lol!) I was literally up and running at 300+Mbps downloads and 200+ uploads in less than a few minutes after just plugging the antenna into my USB 3.0 port.  And frankly is MORE than enough speed for my current needs!And since this is just a simple USB Antenna I can always pack it up and bring with me if I travel!!  Definitely worth it!
5,I have several desktop PCs.  2 are wired with ethernet but one an MSI i7 that's a couple years old is not near a network cable and doesn't have built-in wifi.  Instead of going through the trouble of wiring to it I thought I'd try this USB wifi adapter.  I plugged it in and it worked right away.  It came with a CD rom with a driver but obviously Windows 10 didn't need it.  It's about 50 feet from the Spectrum modem and through a cinder block wall.  5gHz gets a full strong signal and video file downloads and transfers are every bit as quick as the i7's that are wired.
5,Make sure you rate this as helpful so other people can see this and not waste their money.I tested this wifi adapter for the last 2 hours after about 2 months of steady use this and many other TP-Link adapters have the same issue; They spike to 2000+ ping every few seconds I've done a bit of research tried different drivers but the T3U and the T4U seem to have the same problem I was wondering why ever since I switched to WIFI Ive been having connection issues even though speed tests seemed fine. Most games you wont even notice it because its only for a second or two then it goes back to normal.
5,I was skeptical if this WiFi-6 capable version of the already more than serviceable AC1300 would have any improvement especially given my range from my router but I'm seeing speeds of 350Mbps Up / 260 Mbps Down over the AX connection verses the 170Mbps Down / 80Mbps Up on AC connected to the same laptop via Dell Dock.  Very happy with shelling out a big extra for this future-proof adapter.
5,Thank you to a previous review I did the following:1) Updating the driver is confusing. When you first install it the default driver is from 2109. It comes with a CD to install a newer driver from April 2020. Searching for the latest driver via Windows Update says you have the latest already installed even if you have the 2019 version.If you are looking to download the latest driver off the TP-Link website you are given 2 options. V1.8 (which is what the latest one is according to the label on the bottom) and V1. V1.8 will take you to a page where there are no drivers to download just the manual. If you want to download the latest driver you have to select V1. This will also work for V1.8 device.2) In the devices properties in the Advanced tab > Wireless Mode you may need to switch the Value from Auto to a specific value like IEEE 802.11a/n/ac to achieve full speed.As he stated you may need to tweak it a bit but after downloading the latest driver and changing the Wireless Mode it works like a champ.I had purchased another brand and it consistently disconnected.  I'm so glad that I purchased this.  It will definitely allow me to get more use out of a 7 year old laptop.
5,Hello everyone. First off this is an awesome adapter. Very good reception and throughput. I have noticed people having issues with this thing so let me clear something up if I may. First make sure to pull the plastic off the wifi antennas. That will effect your reception. Second make sure you get the correct driver for the card. Google search up the driver and it should be the first hit. Third and very important: if you want the best throughput for 5 ghz pull up your device manager in windows and go to properties and go to the advanced tab and go to the very bottom and choose the IEEE 802.11ac wireless mode for your 5 ghz network reception and it work so much better. By default it is on auto and it will not use 5 ghz normally. It default to 2.4 hence the issues people are having with 5ghz. If you know how to use and the proper settings this can be a very awesome adapter. It got like 20 or more networks at my house and the older single antenna model I had only got 13 or less.
4,Didn't help much but I'm not really faulting the device.  I have Buckeye Cable here in Toledo with their WiFi box nine feet away and I have interrupted zoom meetings and slow internet even with 100mps.  My laptop does the same thing so I fault my provider more.  I will rate this again when I cut Buckeye loose.
5,After connecting it to my desk top and running a speed test. then running the same test  with the same location with my iPhone 7 I measured a two times increase in speed. I am very satisfied.
5,Top tier product.  Receives a reliable strong 5Ghz connection in a room where normally it would be insistently flaky and low strength even plugged into USB 2.0
4,I had the single antenna version of this product and as strong as that one was this one definitely felt better. But it was still not helping to solve my gaming issues. So if you just stream and browse the internet this might be for you. But being an avid gamer. Just get an Ethernet cord
5,If you can't fit a pcie card in your machine this is a great alternative
5,The TP-Link USB WiFi Adapter provides outstanding wifi connectivity.  After purchasing one unit I was so favorably impressed that I purchased addition units for all of the computers in our home.  Easy to install and works flawlessly.  Haven't have any connection issues at all.  Paired with our TP-Link router.
5,Good for my use. Strong signal. Didn't cost a fotune.
4,I feel like every review I give is tempered with "for the price it's good" but this one has a few peculiar things that I felt like mentioning before anyone else jumps in.This was about $25 when I purchased it which is actually great for any modern USB wifi adapter. I don't have a particularly arduous trek to get to my Modem/Gateway but it's just far enough away to where a long ethernet cable would be absolutely obnoxious and a pain to avoid stepping on in my living room (where many a fat-footed friend tread on the weekends). I have a powerline ethernet adapter but in my paranoia I would prefer not to hook up my game development PC to a power outlet in my house with iffy electrical wiring. A solid jolt through one goes right into my NIC and there isn't much stopping it from doing so. Enter my solution to use this thing!Since I do more uploading to the internet and some light content downloading this will do just fine and I'm positive outperforms my abysmal DSL internet speeds. Before setting up I grabbed the device driver which is standard on anything like this but then something else confused me beyond belief as I installed this. I've used adapters in some capacity as far back as 2006 so this isn't my first rodeo concerning wifi adapters. I have NEVER seen one that for some reason registers as a removable storage device in Windows. At first I thought it was the USB hub I had it plugged into being weird so I have it directly connected to a USB 3.1 port on the back of my MOBO. I don't think it's of utmost concern but just struck me as really weird that it did that after the driver install. Not sure if this is part of the MIMO standard that it implements (a little fuzzy on some of the new stuff) but it just came off as weird.Not bad for the money beats using smoke signals? The registering as a storage device is weird but I have minimal issues with disconnection on the device end so no worries there.
5,I'm using this product for my work and my grandson uses it for gaming. It works wonderfully. I recommend this to all. It's a great product!!!
5,Matched with my WiFi6 router speeds are fantastic and stable...But!I had a lot of trouble getting this device to work at work. Installed correctly but couldn't connect to any networks. This isn't made very obvious by TP-Link but the TX20U MUST be plugged into a USB 3.0 port. Not a 2.0 or a 3.1 but specifically a USB 3.0 port. As soon as I did this it installed and connected flawlessly.
3,I was having speed problems and decided to go wireless to try to get faster speeds.  I purchased this TP-Link because I have purchased their network devices in the past and was always happy.  No matter what setting I tried in the system I could not get this to wake out of sleep and if it did it took around 10 minutes.  So I could never leave my work and go to sleep I always had to shut down to get it to boot on startup. Then on top of it all I could only get a max of 150m out of the device.I eventually hardwired with CAT7 and got the high speeds I needed.  I can't say anything bad about TP-Link and the other USB Net devices I have used have the same problems.  It's a good wireless just not fast enough for me and too much of a PITA to have to turn off my box.
5,Went well and works well but you need to realize you have to use a CD to put in the drive.
5,3x my internet speeds with no disconnecting issues. Worth the upgrade from WIFI 4 to WIFI 6.
4,Good signal in back bedroom
5,This item was able to hook up quickly and worked well with all electronic devices
4,I  have the single antenna TP-Link and it has been a life saver more times than I can count. I needed another external wifi adapter for an older business desktop with no built-in wifi. I decided to order this newer model instead. It’s a little more expensive but only by a negligible few dollars. It connects easily and works instantly as it is 100% plug and play. The only thing is despite the newer wifi protocol larger processing unit and dual-antennas compared to single this gets about the same signal strength as my old single antenna TP-Link. I don’t regret the purchase but would have saved my money and went with the cheaper and more convenient single antenna. It has similar speed and connects directly to the PC. It doesn’t require being placed in a safe spot like this adapter. Aside from that no other complaints and this adapter works well otherwise.
3,I bought two USB wifi adapters after I could no longer install a PCI-E wifi adapter in my PC. One of them was $65 and this one at $25. I was impressed with the performance of this adapter as it had the same speeds as the far more expensive one. That changed when I had to download a game.I noticed that the signal would drop while downloading then pick back up then drop again. Over and over. It would get the job done but those drops were annoying especially when trying to talk to friends online.This would be perfect for general use so long as you're not doing prolonged downloads of large files/games. I did end up returning this and keeping the more expensive adapter as that one did not drop at all while downloading. This adapter does work well just don't push it too hard.
5,i like it
5,What Can I say best bang for the buck ever!  My speeds is now 5x faster than before.
4,Easy to install works great about 50 feet away in another room
5,Install plug and play with windows 11 64bit. Good speed and good signal.
5,It’s very good and durable the WiFi signal is the best I have good ping and never lag
5,Very good
5,This Wi-Fi adapter was easy to install on my Windows 10 computer.  Just plugged it in and installed the driver.  It's light and compact and I like that the antenna is separate from the USB end so I can position it on my desk.I was worried it might be difficult to use because I am using it at a hotel that has pop-up Wi-Fi login requirements.  It was easy.  As soon as the driver was installed and I selected it as my network adapter the hotel's pop-up login launched into a browser window and it worked fine after I entered my credentials.The speed of the adapter seems fine but I have honestly not tested it to see how fast it is.  I'm guessing it's way faster than my download speed offered to me at the hotel.Three minor things none of which detract from my review:1.  The USB cable that plugs into the device has one of those odd wide Micro B ends.  Just remember that if you lose it it's not a standard USB cable on both ends or even the common B-end like you find on printers.  It's the kind of Micro B port like you find on portable 2.5" drives.  The other end of the cable is a standard USB A plug.2.  You need to be able to download the installer off the product support page.  I had to do it off of another Wi-Fi computer and transfer it with a thumb drive because the computer I am using this on only has a wired adapter.  Don't get yourself in a chicken and egg scenario. You do need the driver so your computer will see it as a network adapter.3.  It does require a 3.0 port for power.
5,Easy to install and updated my data speed by 4-5x over the old antenna.
5,Good signal even far from thr router!
5,Woks well and has excellent range for home use. Supports very fast internet speeds. Havent had an issue with it yet. For Windows devices it's practically plug-&-play.
5,So simple and effective. The Wi-Fi board in my Dell PC is close to the floor making it difficult to receive a distant Wi-Fi router signal. Adding this antenna to an open USB connector and then placing the antenna on the top of my desk greatly increased the RSL in/out of the PC. Easily solved what would have been a difficult problem.
5,After reading many negative reviews I decided to try this anyway because some people that write bad reviews just have other problems unrelated to the product.It worked immediately after plugging it in to Windows 10 but only connected at 2.4GHz at first.  I use the same SSID for both bands so the device can choose which band to use.  I did see nearby 5GHz access points so 5GHz was functional.  I checked the advanced properties and didn't see a way to force 2.4/5 GHz operation.  At this point I took the CD that came with it and tossed it aside and then download the latest driver on https://www.tp-link.com/us/.  There are two Win 10 drivers listed with the newest driver nearest the top of the list.  The driver installed with no problems and the adapter connected to 5Ghz just fine after updating.My only real complaint is that the adapter base is not weighted enough.  The USB cord is very nice heavy gauge wire and unless you tweak it just right the adapter will tip in whatever direction the cord pulls it.  I'm tempted to glue a magnet to the bottom or try to add weight somehow but I don't want to interfere with the WiFi signals.  Some of that blue adhesive putty you use to hang posters or secure knickknacks to your shelves would work to keep it secure too.The speed was many many times better than it was with my previous adapter which was a tplink n300  I went from about 20mbps to 330mbps.  It claims to support 867mbps on 5GHz but that is probably only under ideal conditions and very short range.  The number of nearby networks also increased which tells me the range is much better than it was with the little dongle type adapter.Overall for the price this is a great adapter.  I would buy it again.Oh and it doesn't claim to support Linux although that doesn't always mean a product won't work on Linux either now or in the future.  I didn't have a chance to test it with Linux yet so I can't say for sure.
5,easy to install  very fast.
5,Upgrade from an older TP-Link Extender to the AC1300 and this device tripled my wireless internet speed!.Would suggest to to anyone! Who knows in another month or so I may even upgrade to the better 1900 or better model!AAA+
5,Was easy to use and set up. Great reception!
5,Works just as good as higher priced adapters.
5,Works perfectly
5,Work well with WiFI 6 (Ubiquiti Wifi wireless router). Done! Note: must have USB3.1 or 3.0 port to take advantage of speed.
5,The absolute maximum transfer rate for my Asus router (2015) had never been reached until now. Not even with a laptop in the same room as the router. But THIS thing is pulling a steady SOLID 866Mbps which is the max. I've never seen it before when looking in the windows adapter status and it's connected to my office computer which is through two rooms a right turn into the hallway down another 20 foot hallway a left turn into the office and the desktop is on the far wall. I have it plugged into a USB 3.1 port (a PCI card that I upgraded) but it was doing the same at 3.0. I was having wifi issues and bought this to replace the current wifi adapter which was very similar but bounced back and forth from 450-700ish no matter how I positioned the antennas. My wifi issue was on the cable company's side after all but I kept this one anyway. Transferring from PC to PC in the house is laughably fast. I wonder when I upgrade the router to wifi 6 if it will hang with that one as well we'll see. I wanted to make sure I got one with MIMO which creates a direct line from the adapter to the router because in 2015 MIMO routers were 40% more. But I've finally got my desktop server solid and steady and as fast as it can be. That's always the goal isn't it? Getting the most out of our tech gear - actually that goes for almost everything in life. Don't search too much longer just make sure you have a USB 3.0 slot open - I don't think 2.0 goes up to 866Mbps which would make a bottleneck. I'm very happy with it. For $20ish it's a no brainier. Comes with a CD I think but I didn't need it. Plugged it's in waited for Windows to make the ding dong noise and selected by ssid. A couple times my ssid didn't show up and I simply rebooted - but that could have been a bunch of things. Enjoy! D
5,I got this for my daughter who plays FF XIV.  We got Starlink and she was faced with continual disconnects.  We also have a DSL line that was real laggy but more reliable as far as disconnects go.  So we got this as a second WiFi connection and used Speedify in redundant bonding mode to bond the Starlink and DSL line together.  It works really good because she gets the speed from Starlink but since it is in redundant mode the connection is maintained and the disconnects stopped.  The overall performance also increased and since the signal goes through a wall the high-gain antennae definitely help with that.
5,Very good
4,it seam to be a good budget wi-fi adapter plug and play for the most part
5,Works great for Windows 10.  Eliminated some hiccups in streaming compared to my older setup particularly with Stadia. It was more of a challenge to find a working solution in Ubuntu as this does not seem to be natively supported for many Linux setups it was possible though.
5,Following a move to a big and old house I have spent the past 2 weeks tearing my hair out as I have tried dongles wi-fi extenders and a similar appearing network adapter with two antennae to no avail. One device worked well for a few days then mysteriously died unable to achieve the strength of the 10 dollar dongle.Even 60 ft and two half walls (old school plaster/lath walls)  away the internet page swaps snap. Installation was truly plug and play (not quite as I am using the drivers installed from the CD Rom) with no fussing over finding the magic setting set that gets it done. Even the local infinity hot spot is able to deliver a reasonable streaming experience whereas before I needed just the right conditions to latch on and hold the connection.This was PC mags bang for the buck pick and unless you have really high speed needs the AC1300 specs were plenty. With the local provider I pulled in 60D/12U in my remote location which is almost as good as next to the router. The weaker hot spot signal was about 1/2 that.This truly made my day as I contemplated having to run a very long LAN cable from the other end of the house or split the incoming signal and use a second router and given it's a rental home neither option was attractive. I'll update if I run into troubles later but for now happy as a clam.
3,My old WiFi adapter begin to die out after about 4 years. It kept dropping connection (tested on 3 different pc). This product should not be getting a 5 star rating here is why:1. There should be no reason to install additional drivers. It should work with Windows Drivers already provided. My old WiFi adapter worked perfectly.2. Does not provide the advertised speed. I have 500 mbps upload and download speed through Fios Frontier this only reaches about half those speed on my fast gaming desktop pc through speedtest.net. Not a deal breaker since that's still way more bandwidth then I need for gaming. But my Iphone 12 and and my Laptop with built in WiFi does reach those full speed using the same speed test. Was unable to tested on my roommates PC because he did not want to install the drivers for this product.3. Bad configuration. My Old WiFi adapter automatically configured it self to run at 5ghz by simply plugging it in and connecting to my WiFi. This thing defaults to 2.4ghz . So not only do you have to install the drivers now you have to go to your adapter setting and configure it so it runs at 5ghz.Overall it works with great connection but installing process is way more complicated then it needs to be. Should just be a simple plug in connect to WiFi and your good to go.
4,Good signal.
5,Tested packet loss and signal integrity and found amazing speeds and consistency over wifi 6 5ghz in a room 3 stories above the router. (Townhome) One lost packet out of 100000 and 600mpbs up and down and I couldnt ask for better.
4,El adaptador es fácil de configurar y la señal del router se recibe sin interferencia.
5,I had 5G dropouts to 2.4G and a loss of connection altogether.  It was constant with another mini WiFi adapter.  Suitable adapter but that was frustrating.  Thought it was my laptop.  But this bad boy showed it was the old adapter because this TP-Link has had zero dropouts or losses of 5G.  Not to mention the significant increase in speed (~85 Mbps to ~180+ Mbps) or should I say allows the connection to do what it was supposed to do all along.  Very satisfied.  Highly recommend this high-gain WiFi adapter.
4,Like a lot of the reviews posted here I was having trouble with randomly disconnecting all the time. DO NOT USE THE DRIVERS FROM THE CD OR THE TPLINK WEBSITE JUST PLUG IT IN AND LET WINDOWS HANDLE THE DRIVERS. Since then it has been stable. Had to uninstall the tp-link drivers -> unplug from pc-> restart -> plug back in -> problem solved. minus 1 start for it being a hassle to figure out but has been good since.
5,grate and strong and my son love it he don't have issues since we purchased
5,It fit and works great
5,I am really impressed by this little thing. I got it because I couldn't yet use an ethernet cable in my new home. I eventually got the cable but upon doing speedtests (my Wi-Fi speeds vs LAN connected speeds) this thing is just as fast as my wired connection. So I haven't even plugged in the ethernet cable to my PC yet. I'm downloading games playing online and watching 4k YouTube videos without any pause buffering. It works really well.All I had to do for setup is plug it into a USB port worked perfectly. No drivers or additional software required. No hassle whatsoever. Again I am very impressed and I'll be buying another when/if this one breaks down.I am using a Windows 11 system with 5G Fiber internet.
5,Speed test went from 50mbps to 195mbps.Not to sure about what that means but it's a whole lot faster now.
4,I thought this would be a good purchase but have noticed something a little odd.  Ever so often the green light will flash off and then on again.  Also when I'm connected to my 5 ghz signal I sometimes will get connected but with a message that there is no internet and it switches over to the 2.6 ghz signal.It's loosing the connection to my Wi-Fi signal.  It's fast so it doesn't seem to be effecting anything I'm doing.  But I'm concerned that this will continue to happen and only get worse.  I'm not sure if I'm going to keep using it or maybe get a better device.
5,I have this on my desktop office PC that I moved into a new home office space.  I have a high end router but things really slowed down.  Now it's faster than ever.  Very happy with the speed increase exceeded my expectations.  I have done speed tests over 350mbs.
4,I bought this today to try it out on my desktop. When I plugged it in it was working and was able to connect to 5GHz network. Once I installed and updated the driver from their website the connection stopped working. I am able to connect to 2.5 just fine just not the 5ghz. Im talking to customer support on their site now and they are very slow to respond. Just a headache all around.Edit: It took a little bit but customer support was able to help me out. Had to change the channel on my router and it's working perfectly.
3,I bought this with the intent to stream my computer screen to a TV. This did not work. We tried every possible troubleshoot we could before I found out that Miracast technology is a thing. This doesn't have it. So I will admit user lack of knowledge. But now that I know this should be made obvious on the store page. 3 stars for poor store page info.The product itself came in a nice box and appeared to be undamaged. I was able to successfully connect to Wifi and even noticed MORE networks than with other wifi I've used. (so I assume the range is good)Cannot provide more details.If I were you I'd look for something with Miracast technology. Do yourself a favor for if you ever want to stream to a TV or another device.
3,I bought it for a room which is a bit far from the router and had poor wifi signal. It did help to strengthen the signal but the fact that a driver has to be installed is a major disadvantage for me since I use it with multiple machines and sometimes with guests devices
5,Up and running wirelessly in less than 10 minutes....excellent signal strength. I am an IT Technician and set this up in my own home.
4,After some experimentation this does work on Linux. Reception is great.(Bus 003 Device 002: ID 2357:0115 TP-Link 802.11ac NIC -- Search rtl88x2bu on Github)
5,We have been using for a few months now it’s pretty good and no issues with WiFi signals.
5,I used this when I was staying at someone's summer house which was huge and about 3-400 feet away from the router with two walls and open space in between. Without the adapter it would be very slow and drop out every 5 minutes or so. With the adapter it hardly ever dropped out and the speed increased at least 2 fold.
5,Our laptop had a big problem getting a wifi signal in a storage room.  It took almost no effort to install this and suddenly the wifi problem was solved.
5,My desktop computer's Ethernet card stopped working. This is a great replacement.I did need to install the driver that came with it. (Adapter was not plug n play.)Used USB 3.1 port and am getting max speed that I pay for.
3,My recommendation for long-range wifi:Buy a cheap range extender and a cheaper wireless receiver. For me it ended up being $15-20 more than this but the difference is massive.Worked from home for a few months and I'm a bit of a gamer so I used this plenty. I live in a small house(1000sqft) I keep this in my upstairs office and while it generally works there's been numerous times I've been kicked off of Teams calls and game servers due to the inconsistency of the WiFi. I saw how big this thing was figuring the giant antennas would help but it performs no more consistently than the tiniest receivers I've used. The router I used is the latest Verizon FiOS deafult Gigabit router.
4,The wifi signal is strong and was very easy to install.
4,I was almost read to return this after I was getting dismal speeds however it turned out it was not happy being plugged into USB 3.2 ports on a new desktop build I completely recently - despite USB should be backward compatible. I was getting 12-14mbps downloads while my laptop and phone in the same room were getting 180mbps. Updated drivers restarted etc no dice. I was even getting significantly faster speeds (60mbps) by plugging the desktop straight into an ancient Netgear N-wireless range extender I use for my raspberry pi's.Anyways I decided to try different USB ports and when I tried a regular USB 3.0 port the antenna immediately began working as expected.
5,Boosted wifi signal 100% over dongal
5,It's so cool that your mama can do it.
5,Works great. Plug and play my HP
5,This product works awesome. Very much recommend it. I was about to call my ISP and request higher more expensive service option. Saved me hundreds if not thousands of dollars not to mention frustration. Needed a better consistent connection for online exam for my job. No headache installation like those wifi routers or extenders.
5,Product is as advertised and picks up wifi better than expected.  Most importantly it turned my direct connect old pc into a nice wifi and direct connect PC.  I can use wifi now to connect to the internet. I expected this to be expensive and difficult.  It was so simple and affordable...very reasonable. Not one thing I  didn't like.
3,I have an cable Ethernet internet and this wireless one. Because the cable has lower speed - 100 Mb -  so I prefer to use this one. When connected it has a speed about 250 Mb. But the computer keeps switch back to the cable ethernet because the wireless signal is off. I disable the cable ethernet card in order to stop the computer switching from wireless to cable ethernet. As the result my computer has not internet connection sometimes. Now I know for sure that this wireless internet adapter is not good.
5,Easy to set up and made a huge difference to my computer's internet access.
5,So far working as described. Didn't need to use the included installation CD. Plugged it in and boom I had internet. WiFi signal is great. Wish I thought of getting this sooner.
4,The device works as soon as connected. Was detected by Windows 10 without trouble. The led light seems to blink all the time (apparently due to data processing) and shows AC speed connection to my router.Few days later I decided to install de TP-Link driver (thinking will have better performance and to check if have the WakeOnLan option). Didn't use the CD (usually old versions) so I downloaded from TP-Link's site and installed. Installation was a bit longer than usual. As soon as installed enter to my WiFi. Led light stop blinking and turn steady on. It connected but after few moments Windows 10 reports "no internet" seconds later yes and this repeated many times. I restarted computer. Same issue. When connected checks speed and it connects at N speed (slower). Nothing else to configure in driver so the behavior was unacceptable so I wen to Control Panel> Programs> Uninstall Programs and uninstalled TP-Link driver. No need to reboot. As soon as driver was removed Windows 10's driver works and connects at AC speed steady connection but led blinks like maniac :)  I prefer  performance and reliability instead of turn led steady on. Good adapter. Replaced a PCI WiFi adapter that have the antennas behind CPU and signal was mostly blocked.
3,If you're looking for something to strengthen your signal when camping I recommend this. I had a weak signal due to distance but this made the signal much stronger. I also got a second cable for it that was much longer and closed the distance with a USB extension cable to carry the wifi signal to the back of the RV which is enclosed in metal and where the signal doesn't reach. But NOW it does!! I can watch Netflix I can Skype video call and I can game on Steam all without any more data or signal struggle or loss than I usually get sitting right on top of a router. I struck lucky gold on this one there's lots of wifi adapters to pick from but I think you'll be happy with this one if you're on a budget like me but still want something that WORKS WELL!It just stopped working on me. Out of the blue. Luckily I have ONE WEEK LEFT of eligibility to return it. I'm disgusted.I tried restarting my laptop and it worked again just as suddenly. None of this makes sense to me. I'm just glad it still works and next time it suddenly stops working for like NO REASON out of NOWHERE I'll try restarting my laptop again. I was going to try reinstalling the drivers but they weren't even there to be found. I just hope the same trick works next time.
3,Frankly I almost returned this device.  When first installed it worked with good speeds.... but only intermittently.  Data would flow for about five seconds and then totally stop only to resume a couple seconds later.  Wash rinse and repeat.  OK for web surfing but totally unusable for anything real time like remote desktop applications (like mine).I found the exact same behavior on two different fully up to date Windows 10 desktops.  Windows said the currently installed driver (from Microsoft) was the best one.The device came with a driver CD so I tried installing the driver from the CD and to my surprise it actually worked.  Now I get good speed with solid continuous data.  So if you experience issues try running the CD to install the Realtek drivers before you give up.As a side note the included USB 3 cable is very thick and stiff.... so stiff that it can overwhelm the relatively light device with its two tall and heavy antennae and it can fall over.  I ended up Velcroing it to the top of my CPU tower to keep it upright.  It works with a regular (ie. thinner) micro USB cable but the speed is lower.
4,I initially had trouble getting full Internet speeds on my desktop (it was stuck on half the speed when running speed tests) but when the adapter was tested on my laptop I had no issues.I noticed my laptop was fully updated to the latest version of Windows 10 and my desktop was not. Once I updated my desktop's Windows 10 I was able to get full speeds.Two reasons for 4 stars1) Updating the driver is confusing. When you first install it the default driver is from 2109. It comes with a CD to install a newer driver from April 2020.  Searching for the latest driver via Windows Update says you have the latest already installed even if you have the 2019 version.If you are looking to download the latest driver off the TP-Link website you are given 2 options. V1.8 (which is what the latest one is according to the label on the bottom) and V1.  V1.8 will take you to a page where there are no drivers to download just the manual.  If you want to download the latest driver you have to select V1. This will also work for V1.8 device.2) In the devices properties in the Advanced tab > Wireless Mode you may need to switch the Value from Auto to a specific value like IEEE 802.11a/n/ac to achieve full speed.
5,This thing boosted my WiFi speed 2 to 3 times more than what I was using before. I was hitting about 40 Meg and now I'm hitting about 90ish on 2G. On 5G I'm hitting about 400ish. Whether I'm running 2G or 5G it works amazing. I bought two of these for my PC and my wife's PC and have had amazing results.  My wife's mother also purchased one and it boosted WiFi speeds on her PC. I'm not getting any kickbacks or payments for this review it's just my honest opinion.
3,I ordered this TP Link Archer T4U Plus USB 3.0 Wifi adapter for my home desktop PC.  The item shipped very quickly and it came packed with an installation CD-ROM.  I downloaded the newest drivers from the official TP Link website.  Installation of the adapter was very simple.  Plus one end of the included USB3.0 cord into the adapter and the other end gets plugged into a free USB 3.0 port on the computer.The problem with this adapter is the sudden "pause" during any upload.  This can be visualized during a broadband speed test (e.g. using Ookla Speedtest.net).  The download speed was fine it was as fast as the download speed when my desktop PC was connected to the TP Link router via ethernet cable.  However during any upload the test would pause (or freeze) for a few seconds.  The indicator light on the adapter would change for blinking fast to glowing steady.  I attempted to re-install the drivers and attempted using the default Windows 10 drivers.  Nothing help to resolve this issue.I then switched to a different TP Link USB 3.0 Wifi adapter and I had no problems with either upload or download speeds.  I strongly believe this is a problem with the drivers created by TP Link as I encountered the same exact problem when I used this USB Wifi adapter on a different PC running on a different network.Let this be a word of caution for anyone looking to purchase this USB Wifi adapter.
5,I bought this specifically for an annual live stream event.  The past two years I’ve had interference issues just from the extensive number of cell phones present.  Last year I had to use my iPad as a hotspot.  This year I put this little guy on a short poll with a line of sight view to the APs.  I got the best speeds I’ve ever seen and the live stream was a success!
5,Third time the charm and it all happened in just one week!(thanks to a fast Amazon deliveries) Started on Monday w/ T5E and I've had BT but not Wi-Fi returned then ordered T4E as ppl suggested and still a 'dud' was getting very frustrated wasting so much time reinstalling drivers and trying to make it work for nothing so I returned it again and 2 days later today(Saturday) I've gotten the T4U Plus. It took only 10 minutes: plugged it in installed drivers and Voilà: my desktop has now 866/866 (Mbps) 'receive/transmit' 5GHz WPA3-Personal Wi-Fi 5. My router(AX3000 Wi-Fi 6 Archer AX55) is downstairs and my PC is right above on first floor I'm using USB3.0 plug - to summarize: I'm a happy camper now.
4,This Wi-Fi adapter works well for my laptop. It was easy to install and the connection was fine. It didn't quite hit the advertised speeds but it was still sufficient for gaming. Didn't lag or anything. The Wi-Fi adapter has a cord and some length so you can place it down on a table or something when using it. Much better than having a giant antenna sticking out of your USB port.
4,I installed this downstairs with my Wi-Fi router upstairs and it works fine right through the floor.
5,My pc is built in a small tower and to save space I used a traditional external wifi adapter dongle.My cat started stealing the dongle.He would wait for me to be absorbed by the screen to run in bite the transmitter/receiver rip it out of the USB slot and thunder through the house with his trophy.He pulled it during a time that actually caused an issue beyond reloading something and I ordered this.It came in I plugged it in and hung it up high on the wall. Setup was fast the speeds are better than the dongle. Best part the cat has no interest in my computer and can no longer be the gate keeper of the internet.
5,This product was very easy too install and tripled my wifi speed from 85 to 266 mbps. I just updated my router and knew how fast it was but was using an older wifi adapter. The TP-Link adapter took me up close to the router speed. Very happy with my purchase!
3,I bought this in November and I'm having to buy a new one 8 months later. I think the cord is the issue but it just keeps going in and out. Before it started going out randomly it worked great. My internet speeds were fine. I just wish it lasted longer.
5,Since i work from home my desk is in the spare bedroom which I refer to as a dead zone. Cell phones cannot get a wifi signal and the wifi connection for laptops are almost non-existent.My laptop is a  I7 Dell inspiron with windows 10.After reading reviews this may not be compatible with Linux which does not bother me.The internal laptop card would read .5 to 3mbs a second and I realized since my work is mostly cloud based I found that even though I hit save multiple times I kept losing my work. Due to a poor connection.I first thought bigger is always better so I went with a different brand  wifi USB adapter that was AC1750 it connected at 1300mbs but the adapter would get extremely hot and it would  cause my router to crash causing complete internet loss for  everyone in the house. I thought it was an issue with my router so over the course of a two week period i changed my router 3 times. I even tried it on my friends AT&T network and it crashed his router as well. So I returned it and Got the TP-Link AC1300.The AC1300 transfers at 630mbs from the dead zone and it does not overload the rest of my equipment.  It has been reliable thus far. I do not have any regrets about buying this.I will update my review in 6 months.If you are on the fence about getting this vs another one avoid the headache and just get this.
5,works ass advertised
5,I had an older computer with a LAN port no wireless. I got new internet (left Hughesnet) from AT&T fiber optic but my speed tests were less than 100Mb/s with 300Mb/s service. After going wireless with this device my speeds now come in at 250 + download 220 + upload. What a great device.
5,The USB flash drive sized unit was dropping signal for no apparent reason.  This unit works great.  The mother-inlaw is happy.
5,Does exactly what it says it does. No complaints from me.
5,Works well as a Laptop WiFi the signal was very good.Easy setup no issues.
5,speeded up my signal 1500x
2,I got this as I had a Micro ATX Board and my TP Link WiFi 6 AX3000 would not fit. Long story short it kept failing. I work in IT and I set the Windows to be performance and not to disable this device to save power and the USB HUB. It would leave me on meetings on Teams and disconnect. I got myself a new ATX board and slapped that AX3000 and I have had no issue since then. This AC1300 worked well when it would stay on but dang it was not reliable. I got about 500 Mbps on my 1Gbps line. The AX3000 get me 700 Mbps constantly. I ended up donating this to the Thrift store near me. If you want the good stuff pay for the Wifi 6 AX3000 or above. As technology advances each day
4,Occasionally needs to be restarted from the control panel.
4,1st one I received was garbage it didn’t work properly or stay connected they resent me another one and its actually fairly good gets the downloads it says it does.
5,I bought this product because I have Gigabit internet speed but my WIFI card is only capable of connecting at half that speed (less depending on which network band it decides to use).  I've purchased USB WIFI adapters in the past and found that they worked fine when they stayed connected but the connection was unreliable.I found this item and read nothing but good reviews (save for the complaining about the drivers being on a CD).  I disabled my built-in WIFI card connected the adapter to one of my USB 3.0 ports and installed the drivers using the provided CD.  I have not had any connection issues and the adapter constantly connects on the 5 GHz band.  Both my speed tests and various downloads have increased by at least 4X since using this adapter I've had no connection issues and the internet even connects immediately after I wake the computer from sleep mode; that didn't always happen with my built-in WIFI card.Overall I have been very happy with this item and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a faster internet connection but would prefer a less expensive and quicker alternative to purchasing and installing a new WIFI card.
3,Pros:Works out of the box with Windows 10FastExcellent rangeBasically everything you'd want out of a WiFi adapter.Cons:Cable is is short.When the adapter is due to be reset network speeds fall to a crawl less than 100 kilobytes/sec which while that's barely fine for browsing the web isn't fast enough for much else.Simple solution is to just disconnect the cable from the antenna wait a few seconds and plug it back in. Works fantastic after that. I've had to do that twice in the short time I've owned it (delivered on April 5th it's the 21st now as I'm writing this).Moral of the story is you get what you pay for. Pay for something cheap you're going to get something cheap.
4,This worked great on a desk top that was not close enough for a Cat5 connection. gets grood signal and doesn't cut out.
5,Need to download the driver from TP-link first then uninstall the original Wifi adaptor integrated with the laptop then reboot.
5,I have been using powerline ethernet for a few years now since the wifi signal in my computer’s room is pretty bad.  Lately I’ve been having connectivity problems with that setup. My download speeds were only a fraction of what our internet plan pays for among constant disconnects that would interrupt gaming sessions with friends.  So I decided it was time to try something else.  I bought this wifi adapter in hopes that its antennas would be strong enough to reach the signal.  This little adapter has exceeded my expectations.  For the first time in years I got download speeds that are in line with the plan we pay for!  I was shocked.  Connection has been stable and fast.  I am very impressed with its ability to grab the wifi signal.  For now I’m a very happy camper.  If there are any major issues I run in to I will update this review.
5,Great Value for the money.  My office is on a different floor than my router so  I considered buying a range extender but don't need to now.The TP-Link WiFi Adapter works great!  Just plugged it in installed the driver and joined my network.  I like the 3 foot USB 3.0 cable for optimal placement of the antenna base.  It's fast enough to meet my everyday needs and has been very reliable over the first 45 days I've had it.
3,I’m a tech savvy guy. Install was a snap and worked well at first. Then died completely after 3 weeks of light use. Just showed an exclamation mark in device manager.After 4 hours of resetting my network in windows 10 and rolling back windows updates. I was able to finally get it working again using the latest driver from their website.Not sure if it breaking was the fault of Microsoft or TP Link. But either way not the most fun way to spend a weekend.
5,My internet speed was wildly erratic - ranged from 5 Mbps to 240 Mbps download despite a 300 Mbps plan with my internet provider. After much trouble shooting I figured I needed a new wifi card given my laptop was 4 years old. This product works like a charm - speeds consistently  above 300 Mbps.
5,The only thing I disliked about it was having to put in an install Disc.. who does that anymore? These guys apparently. But that's like the most minor thing ever.I had to buy a wifi adapter because like a good I didn't think to have my computer built with any wifi in it. Which hasn't been a problem as I've usually always been able to hard connect to the router.But I moved to a new place where I didn't think they'd appreciate me running 200ft of Cat6 cable up and down the stairs to the router.But this works good! I can still play my games and stream all my content. Is it a little slower than if I was just plugged into the router? Of course. But it's still pretty fast.
2,Surely it cant be that difficult to create a reliable USB wifi product.  At first it was great but after about 6 weeks it started dropping its connection and tricking windows into thinking my laptop does not have a wireless connection available.  Locks up windows and the only thing that fixes the issue is to unplug from USB and plug back in.  This almost always fixes the issue but why?  Out of time to return to Amazon but i will definitely be shopping for something else.  Reinstalling drivers to see if that helps...
5,Install was a matter of seconds hardest part was getting the USB to line up with the port on the back of the computer and that was no fault of the product.  I have my PC attached to my TV so there is a lot of interference for Wi-Fi in that area.  The signal is strong and clear using 5.0 Ghz from a repeater upstairs and getting 60 mbps download speeds on a plan that promises 50.  11 mbps upload is stronger than ever too.  So far I've not experienced any signal drops or other issues
5,Ever since I started working remotely I had an ethernet cable going from my office through the dinning room and up a hutch where the modem sits. About 25 feet.  I've been meaning to buy one of these for a long time for that reason. When our internet went down I had to go into the office to do some work. Fortunately it was on a Friday afternoon. I decided it was time so if that ever happens again I can use my cell phone as a wifi hot spot assuming that will work. This unit has been working wonderfully ever since I downloaded the driver and began using it and it's fast. Very happy so far. It's been a couple of months and I've had no troubles.
5,Works great after finding the newest driver/firmware on the TP-Link website which is common with this manufacturer. Works great as a USB passthrough to VM.
5,I had been using a Netgear “stick” style adapter (seen in photo) for some time but recently started having an issue where every 30 minutes or so it would lose connectivity and drop my internet. I can’t comment on whether this new unit does that as I only set it up a few minutes ago but I can say for certain it’s significantly faster. Ping dropped from 11 to 9ms download speed is up from 8mbps to 58mpbs and upload went from 30 to 41. Granted these numbers are still very poor compared to ethernet but I’m a good distance from the router in a standalone office building with 3 or 4 walls in between.Great unit for the price if ethernet is not an option.
4,The device no matter which wire I used constantly drops out and randomly disconnects for a few seconds. While generally this doesn't make it unusable it happens often enough to be annoying when talking to friends online or attempting to stream something. There is a way to fix this completely uninstall the drivers that they provide via the CD and just let the Microsoft drivers install themselves. This fixed the issue and now it works perfectly fine.
5,This device doubled my internet speed. It is as fast as being connected with an ethernet cable.
5,Must use a USB 3 port for the best speed. I am getting about a 450/350 (ISP max 500/500) internet connection speed from my computer using this device. No problems so far.
5,I highly recommend this wireless adapter for your computer if you're looking for some good network speed this Wi-Fi adapter I highly recommend. Good speed reliability it just works. It may not be as good as a wired connection but it is pretty close.
3,it appears to work only in mild internet uploading/download. no problem util a larger video file was being transferred and It was dead. I like the brand but expecting better quality.
5,Works much better than my previous wireless adapter. The signal is very strong and the computer is about 10 meters away from the main router! Works better beyond my expectations. And the price is so much lower compared to the local price of even worse products... Totally recommended!
5,Just plug it in and IT WORKS. No frustration whatsoever.  Good item.
3,Ordinary antenna.  Does what it's supposed to do; does it well.
2,Was looking to get something quick since we were in the process of a move so opted for a dongle over a wifi card. We were very happy with this initially getting 700+ mbps download speeds when connected to our wifi network. However after a couple days it just stopped working. It may have even damaged one of our USB ports.Tried reinstalling drivers downloading the drivers from the website different USB ports restarting the router hotspotting from the phones different PCs - it just doesn't work. It will pick up the networks but will just say that it is unable to connect to any of them despite putting in the network password in 100% correctly.I like TP link but I think I just got a dud.
5,Got mom a great mini pc. The drawback was the wifi card inside. Instead of buying a better internal wifi card i opted for this. Instant no buffering. She can britbox like it was a britoff.
5,My office space is in a room with mediocre wifi reception. When I got my new desktop a year ago the builtin wireless card wasn't up to the task. Many are not of high quality and show their true colors when faced with a situation like mine.So I bought this TP link USB wifi adapter and have gotten much better reception. I have had it for almost a year and it's  doing just fine. No issues whatsoever.
5,I had an ethernet connection to my desktop in our  office running under the house and something happened that I lost the connection. Tried everything but could not get it back. Thought that I would try an inexpensive alternative. WIFI card in my desktop is extremely weak and slow. Got this and am getting just as fast of speeds as I was with the ethernet from about 30 feet away from router. Could not be happy (didn't have to crawl under house to find the problem). Will also be getting one for the laptop in our guest room. Started to go through the setup process when it just connected by itself. AAA+
5,No installing other than plugging it into a USB Type A port. Works great. Has a blinking green led to let you know its working.I am getting 54M down out of my AT&T 50M wifi. 12M up. Love it. I get coverage anywhere in my two story house.
5,Easy to install and works great. Before my wifi keeps dropping and I'm in the next room to the router.  But now installed it hasn't dropped (been a week of using it).
5,Starting working after plugging it in but kept dropping the signal from time to time. Works like a charm after downloading the drivers from the TP-Link website however which was very easy to navigate.
5,My desktop PC has a really poor built-in wifi signal. I've tried several of these extender things and they never  work. This is the first one that has ever worked and it works incredibly well! Super easy to install too.
4,I do like the product and it is better then some other wireless adapters. But the advertised speeds are definitely not met. Set up was easy but installing new drivers were a pain as the newest driver cant even be downloaded from their website.. speeds are about half of what they advertise if not worse on 5GHz I would get about 220 down. Which isnt bad but with etharnet I would be able to 600 sometimes 900 on a good day. But for wireless it gets the job done.
5,Works better than other ones I've had but can still drop off when I  close my door to my room.
1,Updated review:For anyone who cares about network performance this adapter refuses to function at USB3.0 speeds despite claiming support in the specs. When you plug it in no matter which port you put it into Windows notifies you that it is in fact not operating at USB 3.0 speeds. I've looked it up in reviews and tp-link's own support forum's posts and it appears that they advertise it at USB3 but that functionality has been disabled at some point possibly in the device's firmware. The company refuses to admit this and actually blames consumers or makes excuses for why you don't need the extra speed from USB3.As a result while I find the connection to be very stable it can never approach the speeds advertised (AC1300 speeds). It will establish a fairly fast Wifi link but USB2 maxes out at 480mbps so your throughput will always be at (or in my case much lower than) 480mbps. At first glance the adapter seems great which I imagine is where all of the positive reviews come from. If you've been suffering with a cheap N adapter for years this thing probably seems amazing. Look closer however and you'll realize that you do not get what you were promised.I tossed this tp-link adapter aside grabbed an extra AC1900 router that I had lying around put DDWRT on said router set it up as a wireless bridge and now I'm getting much faster links and significantly faster data throughput on my computer that I've plugged into it. Speeds actually matter when you are running a NAS and the tp-link didn't cut it.I also recently purchased a tp-link gigabit switch which overheats and bugs out on a regular basis. It's essentially garbage and often slows down to below 100mbps. I swapped it out with a cheap Netgear gigabit switch and now have rock-solid gigabit speeds. I guess my point is that I'll never ever purchase another tp-link product. I've been massively disappointed with everything that I've ever purchased from them. I recommend that anyone reading this avoid them and go with a more reputable brand. The most frustrating part is that they aren't even cheaper than the other brands. The two switches cost the same amount (about $20).Original review:Thus far this is the most reliable network adapter I've found. I've tried numerous usb and even pcie adapters and they all would eventually start dropping connections. I would have to reconnect to my wifi every day or so to keep them working.This adapter is very fast (nevermind) and it has not yet had a single connectivity issue. The drivers for Windows 7 installed automatically and have been rock solid. It was a little pricey but worth it.
5,I bought a refurb unit which looks perfect but arrived in a plain brown box with no manual or docs of any kind. It was easy to set up using the tether app and has worked pretty flawlessly for weeks since I installed it. The TP-Link is on the floor beneath me and the router is on the floor below it and I'm getting good wi-fi signal strength and good speed test results - about 130mb/sec .
5,I have an HP desktop  two monitors and printer I use for work here at home every day. I went thru several wifi dongles (my WAP is physically like 20 feet from my system) that kept dropping the signal (sometimes at very inopportune times) I own other TP-Link products and have always felt they gave great value vs cost. Decided to try this antenna model out and am glad I did. It has solved the dropouts the second it was installed. Very happy with this purchase.
2,Bought this January 2022 it stopped working on August 2022. Died out of nowhere watching a YouTube video. It gets decent range but not the best. It has a horrible habit of disconnecting/turning itself off for absolutely no reason at the worse of times maybe mine was defective. TP-Link has let me down the past few products I’ve bought quality has gone down a lot. Go for this if you’re on a budget and don’t mind wifi drops out of nowhere. I’m going to pay a bit more and go back to Netgear Nighthawk.
5,My older computer needed a WIFI upgrade.  This worked great.
4,I replaced the smaller dongle for this. It make internet. Probably not the best for high speed or gaming as I did not see much of an improvement but that may be tech issues on my side My pc says it’s not plugged into 3.0 but it is. For your a gamer or building a pc just get a card and be done with it.
5,After my Wifi adapter in my laptop went bad I bought this one. Plug and play excellent reception and speed.Couldn't be happier
5,Was having difficulty getting reception to my desktop because my router needed to be in the living room. Two walls in between about 30 feet. All other adapters had reduced speed and range. Plugged this guy in and got full reception and speed.
5,After considering my options I opted to try this device to boost my wifi connection. And it sure turbo-boosted it. My router is in the closet of our second floor and I work downstairs. My connection is on another wall and is about 20-25 feet from my work area. Network mesh is too expensive the extender I bought was useless as it dropped almost 50%. But this just killed it!I work from home and my work involves VPN connection to different company sites and servers and most of the time has to download\upload huge data files. I was satisfied to get a 90-180 Mbps before but this adapter gives me 280-385 Mbps! It is just awesome.It did mess up my wireless mouse as both were connected to a hub but I moved the USBs of mouse and keyboard to separate USB ports and all now work seamlessly.
4,Works fine the light just stays on no activity winky mode that could be improved on.
5,My workstation is the farthest possible place in my house away from our router.Before: I was getting unstable connections and at the best of times could maybe get ~50Mbps down if I used 5Gz which would frequently drop. 2.4Gz was stable but my down was in the teen digits.After: I have high signal strength AND magnitudes better up and down speeds (download and upload). Both down and up now in the 200s. I can see wifi networks entire STREETS away.Before buying this adapter I bought a budget one from techkey (different company). Didn't integrate with windows and had to download sketchy driver from dropbox... yikes. Had to use separate application to setup wifi instead of windows default wifi icon. Needless to say it didn't work well.This worked out of the box windows (running 10) automatically adds adapter as drop down menu option from the default wifi icon. Haven't even downloaded drivers yet and this product is working perfectly. Very impressed and happy with this purchase.
3,This a great product for quick if you have a computer that does not have blue tooth or a wireless card. The problem I had with it was when you turn off the computer and turn it back on you have to unplug and re-plug the USB cable because the connection is lost when shut down the computer. If you have a dedicated USB port that does not lose power it would be fine I do not.
5,We had to get a new modem/router and our older Win7 PC's card would not find the signal.  After installing the drivers from the enclosed CD I simply plugged the adapter into a USB slot and our home signal was immediately found with the strongest signal we've had on that PC.  Great price fast fast delivery and works perfectly what more could we want?
5,I have a fast desktop PC (Windows 10) that I use for work and games.  It has a Qualcomm card that supports 2.4 GHz only and whose antennas are at the back of the PC under the desk.  That card got only 80 Mbps down/66 Mbps up even though I have 1 GB Google Fiber so I wired my room for ethernet (800/900 Mbps+ both ways).  I needed to move my office to a room with no ethernet so I bought this.  Easy setup and compared to the old bard (80/66 Mbps 15ms ping) I am getting 175/229 Mbps with 5ms ping.  That's a big enough improvement that I can safely move my home office.Also the unit looks nice and being able to position it on my desk instead of sticking out of the front of the PC is great.
5,This has worked surprisingly well for a Windows 10 PC that's actually pretty far from our wireless router (and separated by a few walls).  No installation or connection issues to report.
5,The wi-fi antenna inside of my PC could barely pick up our wi-fi signal. This thing picks it up full strength! Easy to install fast love it.
4,These work great. Just plug and go in Windows 10.
5,This adapter provides reliable wifi and looks cool.
5,Not one dropped signal since I installed it.  Lot better then what I had.  I Recommend this 100%
5,I have an older PC and when I moved I didn't have good way to run an ethernet cable so I purchased this product.  Super easy to use.  I just plugged it in an extra USB port and walla!  It just works.  Range and speed seems pretty good.  I'm not too techie so I haven't run benchmarks etc.  Not sure if it's great for online multi-player gaming but for regular video and Internet seems great.
5,Works great & easy install/hook-up!!
2,Lo compre porque mi portátil solo tenia 2.4 la 5gh la detecta se conecta pero tiene muchos problemas de latencia en una conexión sincrónica hay mucha intermitencia videoconferencias y demas no es muy estable la conexión no se si a lo mejor tenga que ver que mi portátil no tiene usb3. Habría que probarlo con un equipo que si lo tenga a ver si esto influye. Pero la verdad hasta el momento muy decepcionante lo utilizo solo para descargas de archivos grandes.
5,Updated PC motherboard with weaksauce Intel 2.5GHz only. Runs out of USB 2 and USB 3 ports - I leave it in one of the faster 3 ports and it getting strong signal to the router without drops for son's gaming.
5,I have a old imac and a modern Wi-Fi so I wasn’t getting the good speed with this it gains more than 100 mbps down load and 5-10 upload more than without it. And there’s less ping With a great improvement. It only works after downloading the software I was about to return it before I read the Manuel’s page that shows
4,The price is great and it works very well. I was satisfied with this purchase.  If you can't use wired or an Ethernet Powerline Adapter then I can endorse this little wifi guy!
2,Just like previous outboard wifi adapters I've owned this one works great...until it stops working great. Took about five months before connectivity issues started up. I'm now having to reset it or force Windows to realize something is wrong with it to force it to reset. It's becoming an almost daily ritual. Eventually it'll become too bothersome to use and I'll have to replace it with another one. I'm convinced these are designed to fail.
5,I received the product a week ago I loved the design compact and with antennas the signal range is perfect in both 2.4 and 5 GHz plug an play and you can download the latest software on the Tp link page I have not had disconnection problems in windows 10 it works 100% I recommend it.
5,Excellent to add 5G wifi connection to my old Dell Latitude.
5,Had to restart my computer a couple of times. Boosted wifi signal 5x or more.
5,Works great faster than my built mother board wi-fi network adapter (2.4 ghz) it’s connected at 5.0 ghz
5,TP-Link USB WiFi Adapter AC1300Mbps Dual Band 5dBi High Gain Antenna 2.4GHz/ 5GHzI wasn't getting sufficient download speed using the "button" and the single articulated arm antennae stuck in a USB port. This antennae quadruples my download speed is attractive and because of the USB cable I can plug it into a rear USB port instead of having an antennae using one of my valuable front ports. Very happy.
5,My Dell desktop's built-in WiFi was so slow.  I installed this product into an available USB 3.0 disabled the Dell's built-in and zoom!
5,So far so good.The range is decent. Router is located downstairs about 40 ft from my computer and I get a "good" signal.The speed is also decent. I lose almost half of my proformance @ 5G vs directly plugged in but still have enough to game. So all and all a good buy for the price... I'll update if need be.
5,I am using this device on a desktop computer after the LAN card failed. I just plugged it in connected to my WiFi and was back in business. Only took a few minutes.
5,Had about 40 Mbs download speed before now I’m getting 150 Mbs great product that was easy to install and is well worth the money
3,I couldn't get the driver to install from the CD. I'm running Windows 8.1 which is listed as compatible. I needed it to install because the computer I purchased it for can't go online without it installed. I'm returning it in hope of finding one that will install the driver from the CD.
4,I was using a similar model designed for Win XP.  It started intermittently dropping out on my Win 10 machine so I decided to upgrade.  This model's installation is much easier and the resulting signal is consistently 6dB better than the old model.  I've run it for about 6 weeks now with no dropouts at all; it's very reliable.  A worthwhile purchase.
5,My PC was only getting 3 out of 5 bars on wifi. After adding this and setting it on top of my pc I was getting full bars again. This is likely too big for a laptop but is a great addition for a desktop PC. You can use the high db gain antennas to point directionally towards your wifi access point.  I would buy again.
5,I had to relocate my modem which left my computer without a connection this basically made my computer connect wirelessly without having to do anything but install the driver.
5,Works perfectly. Allows for a very strong wifi signal
5,I would recommend purchasing another USB 3.0 3 foot USB cord extension to reach further.
5,our landlord is too lazy to fix our ethernet cable in one of the rooms where I game so I had to buy this to not end up buying a 200ft cable to the main router it works super well and I rarely deal with any lag whatsoever
1,It is a product with a very poor quality.. I have a tplink mesh system in my house that works perfectly fine. That is why I was encouraged to buy this system with antennas that promise but do not deliver.First the positives:1. It is small and has a USB 3.0 cableNothing else.The negative:1. Shipping took 3 days too slow and delayed even with prime speed.2. The range is no better than my intel 9560ac adapter. If I test with the adapter right next to the laptop (MSI 9sc) the test speeds are exactly the same.This leads me to conclude either that the antennas of this device are simply bad and low power or that the internal antenna of my laptop is incredibly good. I vote for the first theory!3. A CD comes in the box. 2021: Seriously Tplink?4. It does not work well in 2 USB 3.1 ports of the 4 USB 3.1 ports that my laptop has. and all are in perfect condition I connect my wireless mamba mouse or my RGB keyboard usb 3.1 and they all work perfectly well in those ports. But this adapter is NOT. It is disconnected over and over again of course with the included cable. It is frustrating and very badly tested.5. It only has more signal if you extend it with the included cable in search of direct contact between the antennas and the router. But it completely gets in the way of your house. The idea was to put it next to my pc. but as I explained it does not increase the signal at all. The same 180 mb in speedtest and fast. So you have an extended cable in the way.6. The price. It shouldn't cost more than 15 USD. It does not offer anything different than single antenna adapters. False advertising? perhaps. But my experience has been disastrous.I hope my honest review will serve you I paid 29.99USD for this product that does not offer anything of what is in the description it does not have more scope it is not easy to use and it is extremely unstable. I think there are better products in amazon please avoid this Archer T4U product
5,works with windows 11
5,As you can see on the before and after photos my internet speed has improved considerably! I have my gaming setup in a bedroom that's on a hall away from the WiFi Router and I thought that was the reason why I wasn't getting much speed before but now I know it was because of the WiFi receiver I was using previously. This product is a gem! 100% recommended!
5,I use a laptop for work at home and was just at the edge of good wifi reception/fast data speeds where I use it.  I bought one of these and plugged it in and bam!  1-2 bars to 5 and full speed internet.  The reception range is double of my laptops built in wifi and data speed is also faster.  A cheap problem solver!
5,Had a wifi issue with a mini pc and this worked beyond my expectations
4,It was a bit of a struggle to set this up as I needed a stable connection to get the drivers downloaded. I couldn't use the CD provided as I don't have a CD drive either.Once I figured how to get it working it was great once it maintained the connection. However I noticed that the signal is constantly dropping very randomly.Part of it is because of the line not connecting to the adaptor correctly.But now even when I made sure it was securely attached it's still kind of dropping.Will contact customer support to see if I can resolve the issue.Fingers crossed.
5,This products works great. It definitely increase downloads speed for an older laptop and desktop that were getting about 32 Mbps download speed. When I plugged this USB Wi-Fi adapter I gets between 190.98 Mbps to 214.44 Mbps. Upload speed hovers around 21.50 Mbps. Pretty much I am getting roughly what I pay the ISP for.  I am satisfied with this product. The wiring can be a little inconvenient if you plan to travel with this or move around the house. This USB Wi-Fi adapter is best used for a desktop setup where you don't plan to move the computer often.  One advantage of the USB wire is it gives the user flexibility  on where they want to place the adapter to get the best signal.
5,Excellent product.
5,Plug and play basically. It comes with a disk to install the drivers you need and BOOM instant wifi. After looking at the pictures carefully i saw the cable is pretty short only long enough to reach from the tower on the floor to the top or your desk. So I bought a USB 3.0 extension cable with male and female ends. Gave me 6 more feet to place the device close to where the signal is coming from and works much better.Keep in mind my wifi source is far away and why I had to do this. For a normal person accessing their wifi from their own house or apartment the included cable should work fine. If not well now you know you can get an extension cable instead of trying to move your whole desktop PC :)
5,Works great but gave me the sheeeets for 2 days trying to troubleshoot then I connected it to the laptop USB directly instead of a USB hub then it worked great.
5,A huge upgrade from the "Techkey" adapter I had before as you can see in the speed test results..These tests are from the exact spot and network.So far it's totally worth it will come back if something happens
5,Make sure you use the latest drivers for this specific model on the TP-link website and you will have ZERO problems.  This reaches the full wireless speed advertised.Good quality and USB 3.0 cable length.  A green LED stays lit to confirm the WIFI connection.Recommended for painless WIFI on any PC or laptop.
5,Used this to get a stronger 5Ghz WiFi signal from my router as the antenna built into my laptop is woefully inadequate.  Helped a lot; speeds are improved 2x-3x.
5,The 5g band of this router is faster than the powerline adapter I was using before and is comparable to wired ethernet on my network.  The range is also excellent --a cheap wifi adapter I tried before buying this one was out of range. Could not be happier or wish for more.
5,works like a charm love this little guy o issue and good signal
5,works great. fast. easy to install. picks up my router from the other end of my house with no signal loss.
5,Older desktop with TP-Link installed inside tower went out. Got this followed the directions that came for Windows install worked first time out! 5 bars excellent reception across the condo in my office in back corner. NO ISSUES with distance. This kept me from buying a new tower so for $30 it was well worth it. I read all the reviews and this one seemed the best option in my opinion. Netgear is a great product but I was worried that there would be issues since I already had TP Link. The new software disabled the old TP-Link and set this up with no issues. Just be sure to click on the wireless icon and provide your security key (password for internet)...works perfect!
3,It is not better than my laptop internal antenna and I bought it because I need it an upgrade. Then I tried it on my gaming computer thinking that maybe the usb port was the choke point but same issue. I got 480mb with my desktop internal antenna and 240mb with this one.
5,The effects are like night and day.
5,Not exactly plug and play but easy enough.  I had to download the driver (a disk was included but I prefer the manufacturers website). Once the driver was installed windows10 recognized it immediately and there was nothing else to do except enjoy.  I ran a speed test before and after. My download speed was in the mid 40's and is now 170.  My upload was in the upper 40's and is now 280! My service only offers 300Mbps and it is upstairs at the other end of the house.  I am more than pleased.
5,Easy to install and plenty fast works great for me!
2,Here's the thing: I can run a speed test at virtually any time and I'll get the results I'm expecting (200 down 10 up) then watch as pictures load like I'm on dial-up moments later. This thing is also fully useless for games online at this point -- my main game is Rocket League and there are so many lag spikes/latency variations that it becomes unplayable.I've reset my router tried disabling or disconnecting other devices tried moving the thing to different locations (which itself is difficult given that the cord is maybe 3 ft long) made sure all drivers are up to date -- nothing has helped.Installation was easy though I guess so there's at least one positive.
5,My WiFi speed went from 30 to 700 and now I can stream music and video.
5,I liked how easy it was to setup and that worked really well
5,Works Very Well
4,I purchased this adapter because the TP-Link T2U + unit that I bought here a year or so earlier was always dropping a connection with my Asus router that was only about 30 feet away in a wood frame house. While this is not a challenging implementation it has fixed most of the connection problems.  Clearly better. for only about $10-14 more.
5,I was having an issue with my old adapter that it would disconnect when I downloaded large files... that issue is no more with this device. It can just handle it!
5,Very good for price!!
5,My desktop had a built in Wifi antenna but I would consistently obtain really slow download/upload speeds - not exceeding 10 mbps. But with this antenna my speeds were able to climb substantially into the 100's - I have high speed internet package. Great product - simple plug and play!
4,Couldn't ask for an easier install experience or better performance that's for sure. The only issue I discovered is the device side USB connection is very loose such that it is prone to drop off the OS if "fiddled with" or moved to a certain position. I had to order a 15' USB A to B extension cable to put it where I want it without losing that consistent connectivity.
3,This was my answer to my wifi issue. However upon installing it it only gave me roughly 250mbps when I have 1000mbps. So unfortunately I have to return it. I was trying to avoid having to run a cable in the room but it is what it is
5,Have not needed to use yet but it's very ready and looks easy to install.
1,I installed this adapter on a PC with Windows 10. Installation was easy and successful. I checked device manager and it was "working properly". I did a speed test before installing the adapter and I was at 50 mbps on average. My actually speed if I'm next to my router is 250 mbps. That's why I bought this "long range" adapter to "boost" my signal when I'm in another room. After installing the Archer T4U Plus my speed was a whopping 50 mbps. I contacted support at tp-link and chatted with an agent. His response to me was basically "If you can connect then it works. It's just a WiFi adapter. It's not meant to boost your internet speed." I told him well that's not what's on the box or on your ads. Images depict default adapters vs the Archer T4U plus on the box. It's obvious that there is no difference in signal coverage. It's not boosted or extended. It's not better than my existing WiFi adapter that came with my laptop. I ran tests for about 6 hours. Installed the drivers that came on the disc multiple times. Went to website and downloaded the latest drivers from there and installed those drivers multiple times. Disabled antivirus. Installed as admin. I did all the basics. I ran speed tests over and over to make sure my conclusion was not a fluke. The device is a fluke.
5,I have an older computer with internal wifi. It seemed to be getting slower and slower. Purchased this adaptor and my speeds went from sometimes below 10 to averages in the 90's. I no longer swear at my computer for being too slow! Purchased another for my other computer and it went from 40's to 90's.
5,easy to install but I wish the USB cord were longer.  As it is fixed I can't swap it out for a longer cord to allow me to place it on top of my computer cabinet.
5,Good
5,They work great for outdoor activities.. Gives you a boost of range for a laptop.. I got 2 for different areas of my yard.
5,Very good and strong signal
3,This adapter did not end up working for me. I bought it to improve the wifi gain on my laptop but it still didn’t receive the signal from our router one floor up and maybe 15 linear feet away. I ended up purchasing and using MOCA adapters instead since our house is fully wired with coaxial cable. So my issue isn’t necessarily with the product itself it just did not work at all for me to improve wifi reception for my laptop.I should mention that I tried this product AFTER upgrading from the standard Spectrum issued router to a better TP Link router in my house.A good thing about this adapter is that it did allow my HP laptop to use the 5 ghz band coming from the router once it was in range. My laptop’s internal  receiver only can use the 2.5 ghz band. So if distance is not the issue this might allow your laptop to use the faster wifi band.
5,Easy to install and it was a huge improvement over the little USB wifi adapter that came with the computer. My download speed went from 18 mbps to 178 mbps on this system while the computer with the direct connection runs at 223 mbps.
5,Quick install and works well
5,I'm getting strong WiFi signal from my neighbor's house across the cul de sac. I'm getting moderate WiFi from the gas station behind their house. I don't even know how it's possible but here we are. This adapter rules. Not a single disruption or issue inside my house even with the router several rooms over.
5,first time writing a review on amazon. this is the real deal. it has full bar signal from first to 2nd floor and the speed is 90% compared to wired. at this price point this might be the best wifi router ever.
4,Cable is too short and is a speciaity cable. Great otherwise
4,Well it works when it wants to. But the wire that connects it to your pc is kind of poorly made and doesn’t fit snug. So it sometimes disconnects which causes it to stop.
5,Need to get online and pickup the latest drivers but definitely helps the connections.
3,Not as strong for gaming it’s ok to surf the web but not recommend for gaming had a cheap usb one and it works the same
3,This product does what it is supposed to do and does it okay.  It allows me to game and download games and such but at random times it decides to restart itself constantly.  When downloading a game for the most part does well and then other times it will randomly disconnect and reconnect after 5 minutes of the device restarting itself.  When playing games I will randomly have lag spikes where pings goes from less than a hundred to over 600 on a whim.  This adapter is not entirely bad and will work well for most people but if you are using a VPN download a lot of games or using this for several hours a day on end for gaming and lots of streaming this device is not for you.  I will be returning ASAP and going with the NETGEAR - Nighthawk AC1900 for better stability during long gaming sessions and large downloads.
5,Me resolvio el problema de no poder conecta mi laptop al internet. Muy bueno
5,It delivers easy to install and I can game on it so I guess it’s good for anything else.
4,It works good but on startup it might take a few seconds to establish wifi connection compare to pcie wifi card
5,Very simple  to set up
5,easy to install works great
5,This was hooked up to an old desktop that was using a very small WiFi dongle behind the PC and under the desk.  This brought the connection up onto the desk and it worked extremely well!  My 16-year old was able to install it and now has a very smooth WiFi connection on her desktop pc.
5,i literally pulled it out of the box installed on my pc plugged in the dvd driver disc and was up and running. shipping was quick price was right and now i got a wifi old model desktop
4,Nice for the price
1,What should have been a simple plug and use turned into hours of trying to figure out why I get wifi but no internet from this router when the one I had previously (and reverted to) was connecting fine. After many workarounds that failed I tried uninstalling the driver for a fresh start this caused the installation file on the  usb to no longer show up rendering this device absolutely useless with no ability to even install itself anymore. Save some cash and keep looking because this product ain't it at all...
5,One word Awesome
3,Easy to install. Poor physical characteristics- the cable from the antenna set is bulky and there isn't enough weight in the base to hold it down if the cable is pulling on it a bit.Doesn't connect to 5GHz as easily as it should. I bought it to replace my onboard 2.4GHz only on a Dell. The AP is 10 feet away and is a Wifi6 capable device. I still defaulted to 2.4 GHz. Instead I'll use it as part of a testing bundle for wifi where band is forced.
4,ease to install just plug and play with great speed very happy will drop speed only if I have more than 2 windows open
5,I bought for one of my clients who was able to set it up easily.
5,Easy - works as advertised - no issues
5,Good
5,Just plugged it in and it worked perfectly. Before I wa getteing 3 bars and now a full 5 bars!
5,
5,Plugged this as a replacement for an old Archer T2U adapter into a Windows 10 desktop and wow the speed difference is immense!Old adapter: 2.4ghz 20mbps speed 5ghz 15mbps speedNew adapter: 2.4ghz 40mbps speed 5ghz 140(!!!) mbps speedThe only thing to note is that this adapter does not use a USB extension but uses a USB 3 to micro-usb cable. This means that you cannot plug this adapter directly into a laptop but must use a cable to connect them. It's fine for me since this means my PC can be under the desk and the adapter can sit on the desk where it gets a clear signal.
5,easy too use. works well too.
5,Love the one simple idea of the product before anything else you plug it in and it works no additional or specific drivers are needed. The reason that is important and applicable is; when you have no installation access or rights to a system and just want to utilize the product without creating issues this works great.
1,What you should know is that this device does not perform better than modern day built-in wifi. It also has unsigned drivers. These drivers will only install on Windows 10 with an override and will not install on macOS Big Sur or later. The fact that they are not signed drivers makes me suspect this driver software is no longer being updated. On windows the built-in wifi must be manually disabled to benefit from this device.All that said I did find that my 10 year old PC benefited from the Archer T4U Plus. My PC came with a built-in motherboard wifi with no external antenna. Connecting theT4U Plus increased my download speeds from ~5MB/s to ~45MB/s. This improvement is still not as good as 5 year old MacBook built-in wifi which gets ~75MB/s from the same location.I would have given this product 1-star because of its poor software driver support and mediocre performance. But I gave it 2-stars because it is affordable and in my unique situation it did improve my PC network performance.Update: We'll after a few days of using this my upload/download speeds dropped to below 0.5MB/s! This is worse than the performance of the old built-in wifi. Of course after disabling/enabling the T4U my performance went up but I'm not about to regularly restart my network only after I figure out its struggling. I will be returning this device for a refund. I also am downgrading to 1-star. My apologies to anyone who bought this based upon my 'works with old windows PC' evaluation from a few days ago.
5,Best WIFI signal I've ever had!
4,easy installed and work out great.
5,Fast looks awesome (think Darth Vader bunny ears). Connects at full AC Wi-Fi speeds via USB 3.0 connection and it's affordable with a decent chipset - what more can you ask for?
5,I have a 10 year old HP laptop with an early i5 processor and the original Intel Centrino Wireless N-1000 inboard card.  It reached download speeds of 10 to 25 Mbps.  An Apple computer in this same home reached download speeds of 180 Mbps.  With this device I now get 180 Mbps.  Well worth the $30.I disabled the Intel card with Device Manager ran the autostart with the supplied CD plugged in the USB logged into the network and was up and running immediately.
2,Moved into a not-ideal rental situation with the only cable access for the modem across the room (could not relocate the coax "outlet") from the only obvious place to put my PC. Tried the antenna and WFH was impossible... Low reception with frequent cut-outs even after adjusting the routers WiFi bands. I wound up throwing this in a box in the closet and running an Ethernet cable (with additional cost of cable protectors to cover the distance).
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Human hair or eye lash from amazon warehouse very disgusting not sanitary.
5,gets great signal compared to my smaller usb wifi. yet to see how durable it is.
4,the wifi signal is significantly better than my previous 150 mbps usb dongle
5,Gives great consistent signal picks up wifi better than most high end devices plug and play setup.  Everything you want from a network adapter.
5,Desktop is in our basement.  This doubled the desktop speed from 150 to 300.  WiFi is 310 in the upstairs room with the router.  WOW!  What a great difference and well worth the cost.
5,my wife's PC had an old N Wi-Fi card and it could only do 50mbps at best.  plug and play this right in and boosted that to 250mbps in about a minute of work.  Solid performance!
4,The hardware was recognized by Win 10 and I have had a solid connection since installing.
5,Product allowed me to use my computer in my shop on my acreage.
5,Not only did i get great range i got a more stable connection on when i had two bars vs normal adapters.
5,I had to set up Grandma's computer in a bedroom at the wrong end of the house. I could not see a USB chicklet doing the job as my Iphone has trouble there. This made the job plug and play. Totally recommended.
5,Nice unit immediatly recognized by Windows 10. Works perfect great strength.
5,Hooked it up to a desk top computer in a room that does not have ethernet. Very easy to install.
5,I was just looking for an adapter and a connection not necessarily an improvement on speed. Same speeds as the last adapter someone broke so I'm satisfied. If all you need is a wifi/internet connection with a little extra range and flexibility beyond a USB stick this is it. You may have to restart your router for 5g networks to show up.
4,Very good. Would be better if it was better about reconnecting after a restart. Good signal good speed very easy to set up.
5,Excellent product. I have a couple of old inexpensive HP laptops running windows 10. The signal from my router must go through 3 walls to reach these computers. It was slow and unreliable.  I bought this adapter plugged the hardware into a USB 3 port and WOW! I now have a very fast reliable  connection. I used windows plug and play and didn't bother installing the drivers from the CD or web site.  Highly recommended. I won't install the drivers unless I have problems or free time on my hands.
5,I was surprised at how well this device works. With Fiber internet I am easily getting speeds up to 400.
5,Never had a problem connecting to WiFi before with my 3 yr old Asus laptop through Comcast/Xfinity but when I switched to CenturyLinks gigabyte service laptop wifi would sync with router but would disconnect after 5 seconds.  Rather than buy a new wifi signal extender at much higher price I bought this WiFi Adapter at 1/3 the price and it connects and stays connected for the 2.4 GHz or faster 5 GHz frequencies.  Now getting 400 - 600 mbps over wifi.
5,Easy install very good signal and speed.
5,Good stuff works fine. thank you Received on time
5,Once this wifi adapter was taken out of the box it work instantly. It didn't ask you to download software. So far it has great speed and has been working ever since. I would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a network adapter.
5,I bought this for my desktop computer that sits in an enclosed cabinet. The included extension cord allowed me to have the antenna on top of the desk which greatly improved speeds.I had previously used a tiny USB wifi dongle which had poor speeds.This usb wifi adapter gets roughly 150mb down and 50 up on my mesh wifi network.Very pleased with the results! Highly recommend.
5,Simple easy to use connection feels solid.
5,Purchased this WIFI adapter for a new computer build.  It was as easy as plugging it into the USB port and it was up and running.  Like that it has both the 2.4 & 5 GHz band options.  This computer runs a file backup to the Cloud and it's nice to be able to set it at the higher rate 5 GHz band.  Really like the product and plan to purchase another for a different computer.
2,Original Review: At first I was skeptical of this thing until I realized that I didn't set it up right so make sure you are setting it up right! I got the dual antenna version and it's just amazing. I use it for gaming and work. I have less lag issues and low ping in video games now compared to before. And overall my connection is much more consistent (i've been using it for about 7 hours now) and i'd say my connection speed has went up by about 50% so there's a noticeable difference! Ill update my review after a month to see if it holds up.2nd Day Update: Worked great the first day. Second day different results. Its great when it works. However starting early into second day usage it periodically stops working out of no where. When it first did this I thought it was broken. The green light didn't come on. And it randomly started working again 30 mins later. It has done this about 3 times now all within a day.
5,It is easy to install and has a stable WiFi connection.
5,Needed to extend my range for my computer while doing a home remodel project. Works great with no data lost.
5,Relieable connection at very good speeds
2,If you have a Mac you should steer clear of this device.  It works...occasionally. And the 5GHz AC connection is definitely faster than your onboard 2.4Ghz Wii.  However:1. It drops connections randomly and unceremoniously2. It sometimes becomes totally nonresponsive requiring a reboot3. The driver/wireless utility software is ludicrously primitive. Basically all you can do with it is select a network - and even that is problematic. On startup and sometimes at random it prompts you for a PIN code or PBC activation even after you directly select a network...whether or not you have a preferred network.To this last point: the driver on the TP-Link website is in *beta*...for OSX Catalina!  Which at the time of this writing  isn't even the most recent MacOS version (Big Sur) - for which obviously  there is no driver at all.  The last update to this beta driver was July 2020 and there are no indications that a stable Catalina or Big Sur driver is even on the way.Dubious hardware flakey software phantom support. Might want to take a hard pass on this one.
2,I had hoped/planned to use this to replace the weak WiFi chip on my Mac desktop - but the "best" drivers are beta versions for 3 or 4 Mac OS versions ago.  (10.15 vs 12.3 is current).  Yuck... the Mac world isn't WIndows we don't use the same operating systems for 10 years.I'll probably keep it for plugging into my Surface tablet for RV campground purposes we'll see.
5,It picks up my WiFi very well even though this is in the basement and my router is on the first floor.  Highly recommended
5,Bought this one when I accidentally snapped off my older model. If you've had any TP link devices before then the drivers you need are already installed. Wifi signal is excellent with almost 0 dropouts. For the price you really can't find a better wireless adapter outside of PCie. The only thing I would change is possibly a way to mount it to the PC or wall. Otherwise 5*. Extremely satisfied.
5,Installation was very fast and very easy.  WiFi speed test was excellent.  Very satisfied.
3,Super easy setup but not able to set preferred wifi band.
5,My mom lives in an assisted living facility converted from a 1940's 3-story school building and the signal to her apartment was quite weak but this resolved all of those issues.
5,My pc does not have a wifi card in it as prefer to hardwire my connection but i am currently renting a room and coukld not hardwire so i bought this (after trying some others that failed me) since i am a pc gamer i need a good strong connection. I have not had that first issue with it at all. very pleased
5,Increased signal a great amount. Went from 1-2 bars signal without to full signal with it.
5,excelent product
5,This works as it should and didn't have to update the driver worked right out of the box. Plain and simple to get wifi to your desktop or latop.
2,This adapter works great when it's working but it routinely loses its connection as it ages. In fact many times I've noticed after it loses its connection it doesn't list any WiFi transmitters in the area even though there are at least 10 or so that are normally listed as options to choose from. Unfortunately I've missed the return window so I'm stuck with it.
5,Works much better than the range extender I was using. Weak signal at my RV park.
5,I need to more powerful antenna for “my” wireless access point. This easily reaches the 5G network. For Big Sur you will need besides an Amazon USB adapter is the right driver. It’s tricky but it will only take a few minutes to get it working once you get the driver from GitHub. Easy to find via google.
1,It worked fine for a couple of weeks. Since then it constantly disconnects from Wi-Fi disconnects and reconnects from my PC on its own. When it does work I pull 1/3 speed that I should be getting and do get with other adapters that were tested. Same results with it on another PC. Tried updating drivers uninstall/reinstall etc. This is the 2nd TP link product in a row I’ve had major issues with.
1,HiI have McAfee Total protection installed on my laptop (Windows 11). When I tried to install the driver from USB adapter Antivirus blocked it saying a dangerous file containing a virus. Even download of the driver didn't work from tp-link site because of virus threat. As per TP-link support I have to uninstall/disable the antivirus to download the driver. This is not an expected workaround from reputed company.
5,I used to use Power Line products. Until I moved and all the plugs in the house are occupied. Setup a WIFI6 MESH network for the new place. Replaced a wired connection for one computer and improved their web surfing experience. Though I think this is due to a crappy router that I replaced. Either way reliable signal from the 2nd story works fine for a desktop PC on a WiFi6 network.
3,Did not work on basement computer.
5,I tried a couple different range extenders that plug into the wall before trying this.  They barely did anything to improve the signal and many times the signal was worse than just going to the router.This TP-Link adapter is a MASSIVE improvement over my laptop's network adapter.  The signal is so much better.  Wish I had just gotten one of these in the first place.
5,Make sure you install the driver from the website. 5GHz is so fast it’s hard to believe it’s not wired cat5. I was really surprised. This is set at a good distance and through multiple floors in my case. My router is on the 1st floor and this is on the 3rd floor in the home office. Can’t recommend enough.
2,This is definitely the best adapter I've had definitely worth the price and greatly improves the signal to the dead zone in my house.1 month later: the adapter is great when it works. it constantly overheats and freezes my pcs ability to connect to wifi without a reboot.
5,It's all good!
5,We recently upgraded our wifi service and added mesh. An old HP computer that had no wifi radio was a problem. We used this device made sure the a/c/n setting were selected in the device manager properties and got excellent results. Easy to install easy to use. One small drawback is the driver comes on a CD but as I understand it you can also download the driver online.
5,Looking for a great adapter….this the one!!! Small and efficient and easy to install! I couldn’t plug my business computer directly into the router so I was advised to get this one and it has been great!!
5,This was easy to set up and so far I have no issues with signal loss.  I haven't tested the range or speeds significantly but 2 rooms away probably (approximately 30-40 feet) no issues with the connection.  This is primarily used in the same room as the router on a desktop in order to prevent running a cable across the room.
5,Does what it promises
5,Stopped my WIFI drop out problem. Not once since installing two months ago. Up and running in les than a minute.
5,It does what it needs to do.
5,I have this upstairs and on the opposite side of my house as my router. No connectivity issues and I'm able to game with no noticable lag.
5,Went from 5MBS to 45MBS on my bldg WiFi... Works great for longer range USB WiFi.
5,Game changer!! Best wifi adapter I have ever purchased. My speeds went from 30 to 120
5,Got this to replace an aging wifi adapter in a desktop. It's exactly what I'd hoped for: I plugged it in and it began working immediately (although I went to the website and downloaded the current driver just to be safe). It's fast and where my old adapter got one or two bars of wifi signal this gets five. Exactly what I'd hoped for when I ordered it.
2,I was very disappointed to learn from experience that this adapter simply does not hold a candle to a cheaper PCIe WiFi card. The only purpose I can conceive for this device is if someone is a very casual user of the internet like email and basic webpages and they didn't have the confidence to install a PCIe card and did not care enough to have their PC taken to a repair shop or Best Buy to have someone install one. This can manage to stream video and load webpages but does not stand up to a battery of traffic.
2,the cable connection is intermittent
5,I am by no means a computer geek. My smart TV's were getting OK reception from my router so rather than mess with my router system I just tried to enhance my reception to my Windows 10 computer and Voila..it flys now. I plugged in the USB inserted the disc and done. Could not be happier. 5 stars all the way!
5,easy to install and worked just fine
2,On Ubuntu 22 it does not even show up.Their response to inquiries on the internet amounts to "go fish".5Ghz wifi inferior compared to old PCIe card.This is budget-level quality.
5,Easy to connect easy to link and works great.
5,I just plugged it into my desktop running Windows 10 and it was detected within seconds. Entered my WiFi password and it connected immediately with a very strong signal and speed.
5,Thank you for great customer service. I had to return the other one I ordered and tried this model and brand instead. So far it's been working out great and is much more efficient than ones I've had in the past.
5,Easy setup seems to work well for gaming although the games being played are not computer/streaming intensive.
5,Working windows 10 Tower. I just plugged in this little beauty and went into settings clicked on this device icon and BAM... Killer fast internet with a full scale signal. WAY BETTER than the Linksys unit I have been using.This is a must have if you are dealing with trying to get a signal across from one end of the house to another.
5,Very easy set up.  Great improvement over older dated internal network card I had installed for years.  Would recommend!
5,Works Great @ 5GHZ MBPS2.4GHZ  Issue 50-75 MBPS75 Feet From Arris Cable-Router with Xfinity ServiceMy Service 200 MBPS TP-Link 225-240 @ 5GHZ  MBPS YAHOO !!!!!
5,Works for what I needed it for
3,It seems to max out at 100 download 10 upload. It also gets worse signal than my one antenna piece that came with my motherboard. Was hoping this would bet better but it simply is not.
5,TP-Link USB WiFi Adapter plug a play for windows 10-64. you can't go wrong with this adapter super fast WIFI for my Dell desktop. Make sure you plug into a 3.0 usb.
5,Bought it for my wife who does almost nothing technical.  I gave her the  unopened box.A short time later she emailed me via  that wireless port that it was installed!That was about a month ago.To date she is happy as could be with it.
5,Prompt delivery and was as advertised.
2,Did not expect device to be completely unusable on Linux. After reading about it I guess virtually all TP link products are in the same boat. Other than that speeds are mediocre i'm about 30 ft from my router upstairs. Works well for a period of time and then seems to just not work well in random intervals? Either way I wouldn't recommend this product. There are better alternatives for the same amount or less.
3,It works well just cuts out sometimes and loses connection
5,I purchased this to replace an earlier TP link that I used for years. It has exceeded expectations. Although it is extra work to carry this around with the computer it provides a consistently strong signal. This is essential for my online teaching and for Zoom calls.
5,Easy to install. 250 mbps at 50ft. No dropouts yet.
5,If you can read you can set this up in no time!! VERY easy to install setup and use.
5,I love this little wifi adapter!! I had bought a cheap 1 on eBay & it was sooo slow!! This tp-link is very fast!!
5,I had less to 10mbps signal in my lower level.  I bought this adapter to see if it would help.  WOW I now get over 190mbps speed!  Highly recommended for weak signal or low speed areas of your house.
5,Product is easy to set up and works well.
5,I love that a 3-year-old can install it! I love that it works so well! I love it!
5,Simple ease of use
5,It was amazingly easy to install. It has a decently long cord. To hook it up to my Wi-Fi and have it compatible with my computer was easy. Honestly it works really well across my whole house. I've never had connectivity problems with this.
5,It was needed to make one computer able to reliably connect
5,Quick link to the website and easy to use
5,The product came on time and is working OK.
1,This thing was awesome for about 48 hours.  Now it just sits with its pretty green light on and no longer detects my house wifi.
3,Proprietary cable is too inflexible. The device goes where it wants to. It's not delivering much better signal then the cheap transponder style wifi my desktop came with. Not a fan of the need for their software. Wish it worked with the native windows stuff.I ended up going wired and I use other products from this company and they are great.Maybe it's a personal set up thing but I would not recommend this.
5,I really like this product I was able to move my desk top away from the modem and not loose speed or quality
4,Info manual is useless. Easy to find better directions from other users on web or Amazon reviews.
5,When I first got it I made the mistake of plugging it into a USB extension cable. That didn't work. As soon as I plugged it in directly it fired right up and has been working perfectly ever since. (Windows 10)
1,I really wanted to use a brand that was well established and was hoping for the T4U AC1300 plus would be above the rest for its price range but it wasn't even better than a off brand name Nineplus with instructions written in broken English. The max speed I got from my distance was 240s Mbps but with the Nineplus adapter I would able to get 330s Mbps at the same distance. I didn't want to use a brand that isn't trusted. In fact I have the feeling that nineplus has a hidden malware in their driver given that all my wifi options disappeaed at one point. I decided to still use TP link just because of peace of mind.Also you will have to go into the adapter settings to change the default setting to wireless and enable AC settings for TP link.Update: getting +/-330Mbps now with a little adapter placement and setting adjustment.Update months later.This thing definitely has a malware or virus in it...I don't download anything onto the computer I use this with...This was the only thing. I started having freezes and my computer started having either fake screens displayed or goes to safe mode..
5,New refurb pc and didn't have a wifi adapter. Grabbed this ..it's a slam dunk ..windows 10 ..2 secs out of the box ..usb port in and 10 secs later it's running ..nothing to install. Fantastic pc ..buy it
1,Everything seemed fine the day of installation!but on day 5 the problems began with the driver of this crap and it caused my pc to shut down forcibly!after the first blackout it was already impossible for the tp-link adapter to save the passwords of the wifi networks that means that I had to re-enter the passwords of the networks every time I wanted to navigate and without forgetting the problem of "blue screen of death" which happened in a period of every 2 hours the solution was simple throw this garbage in the trash and go back to the LAN cable!
3,I like it because it give really high signal when the WiFi drops to 2 and then it goes into 5 but I dislike it because it is wired
5,Perfect
5,We had a PC that was not seeing our new network. Plugged this in ran setup from the CD. PC now sees the network. This process adds a second WiFi connection (WF2) but that's fine. Worth the money to solve the problem.
2,As some of the other reviews have already said this adapter is very inconsistent. It goes in and out all the time. I have the eero 6 pro mesh router and this is maybe 10 feet away in the next room over from the base router. But it constantly drops off the network and I have to hard reset the device in order for it to work again. Not sure if it is a flow or the device or I just got a defective unit but I do not recommend.
5,I dig me some plug n play. Plug it in it goes to work. Didn't have to install a damn thing. Great little unit. I didnt have to install any drivers. I love that.
1,The only thing that I need to say I like black men kissing in the shower ( ͡°з ͡°)
5,I got this for our PC which does not have Wi-Fi. Our modem is in the next room and we don't have any issues with connectivity. It was easy to set up even without much tech experience. Would recommend!
5,Inexpensive works great and easy to set up.
5,Was super easy to install just plugged it in and I haven't had any issues since.
5,This tiny antenna is very powerful. I was sick of my poor internet connection until I realized that the problem was the built-in antenna from my laptop. I bought this device installed it and all of my internet problems were GONE. Definitely recommended!
2,Stopped working after ~6 months. No lights turn on tested USB ports and everything.
5,More powerful than a sith lord
5,the computer that i purchased on amazon has no external antenna and the metal casing cuts down the wifi range I got this one and it increased the wifi range exponentially! I love it!
5,Installed this on a tower PC that provided less than 100Mbps on its internal wireless adapter.  Connected the AC1300 to a USB 2.0 port and am experiencing over 200 Mbps on Spectrum with my TP-Link AC-1900 Gigabit router.
5,This works natively without a driver for OS installations. As soon as I plugged it in during the Windows install it found networks. No need to install a separate driver. Plug and play and forget.
4,It doesn't work in a Kali Linux machine!
2,On my Windows 10 laptop this works perfectly as a plug and play device. It boots up and connects as effortlessly as my internal card does. On the other hand the drivers from the manufacturer just do not work correctly on Windows 7. Tried this on my dad's older desktop. There's a miniport conflict that behaves weirdly. Randomly it will work a small percentage of the time on boot up at least until it loses connection. Then it just quits. Which is disappointing because we got it specifically so my dad's PC could connect to 5.4GHz networks. So probably steer clear if you use Windows 7 still. Works great if you use Windows 10 you don't even need the included driver disc for it to work.
5,Great value easy to install.
5,Contento con el producto ya que funciona súper bien. Los drivers venían en un CD recomiendo que venga de forma automática al momento de conectarlos.
5,This is a larger set up than previously used but it has way faster speed. Downloads are a breeze. My service here is sketchy at best and this is like having a new provider and upgrade to my modem/router. No problem setting up no issues.
1,It connects & reconnects which makes useless. Tried on different computers and it kept happening. Avoid.
1,This product worked as expected for a week or so and then BSOD's. It took me a while to figure it out... because why would it be a simple wifi adapter...Well now not returnable to Amazon and TP-Link is telling me I have to pay to ship it back to them. What?I expected more and I will not use these products again in my home - IT consulting Business - or recommend them to my clients.This is from TP-Link Chat:"Thanks for raising your concern to us regarding the shipping fee.I could understand your frustration but I’m afraid we are not able to go against our RMA policy to waive the shipping fee.The shipping fee is mainly the courier fee being charged by the shipping company. If you are looking to avoid this fee we recommend the Standard shipping option wherein you just need to ship the defective unit to us first and you could control the cost by choosing your shipping providerPlease kindly review here for more details of RMA shipping methods and our RMA policy"RMA policy... Make it right. you are a business.
4,Seems to have good reception.  Easy to use.
5,I could only stream 480p with my older network card but I replaced it with this and now I’m back to 1440p @60fps. So I’m happy :)
5,Liked the fact that it was super easy to install and it does the job for connecting to the internet super fast! Very pleased with the product so far!!
4,This was very simple to use and it has a great signal!
5,Installed on an old Phenom II X4 setup with USB 2 ports only.Runs beautifully... nearing 200Mbps on a 5Ghz signal one floor and a few rooms away
5,A lot better than the internal mini pci e desktop Wi-Fi. Before I would get around 250Mbps at around 2-3 bars. Now with this wireless usb 3.0 adapter I get 583Mbls at 5 bars!
5,Nice plug and play WiFi upgrade for a Windows PC. For having the same specs this device has proven to be more reliable and marginally faster in speed tests than the motherboard WiFi
5,Even better reception than my wifi repeater
5,Was working fine no complaints then I upgraded to MacOS 11 "Big Sur."  Support site shows that the driver was requested by several people in NOVEMBER 2020 but as of January 7 2021 no updated driver.
5,Everything works as expected plugged in the adaptor to my USB 3 port and everything works great. The signal strength is excellent (through 1 wall) and haven't experienced any issue after months of using it.
2,This WiFi Adapter lasted for about nine months and then it simply died.  Worked well while it functioned but one day it quit without warning.
1,I have purchased this adapter on July 18. It has not been even two months but it just died yesterday. No signal no nothing.
5,I used this to get better wifi on my desktop when I moved my wifi router to a more central location in the house to better serve everyone else in the house using it.
2,First thing when I bought this at the end of April 2021 the website didn't even have the digital drivers available to assist with its install not sure if they've remedied that or not.  Secondly after 5 months this thing no longer works. As I'm writing this it is losing and regaining power constantly causing my computer to chime the 'New USB device' sound and causing the internet to drop constantly.  After 5 months it is now a paperweight.  Don't waste your money.
2,The product says it works with Linux. Well it does but you better know how to program the drivers. It is not for a novice. There are no easy drivers for linux. Do not buy it for any linux program.
1,Installed to software and connected the device. It saw my routers but popped up a dialog screen that told me it was incompatible with my system. My router is a dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) and a lot of chinese devices will not work with anything other that 2.4GHz. I have bought several security camera that have the same problem and set up a system in that band just for them. It wouldn't work for what I wanted it for connecting via WiFi for internet in another room.
5,Installed in less than a minute and easily reaches advertised speeds.  I have this on the 3rd floor and the router is on the 2nd and it works perfect.
1,Tested multiple times and connection was consistently slower than not having the unit attached at all.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             No WiFi? Plug this in and BOOM. Wifi at your command. Fast too. None of that slow junk. Good product.
1,SUCKS!  ONLY "247mbps" slow as hell my laptop is on wifi and it gets to "526mbps" i got the TP-LINK because I thought it would be more secure then the built-in network adapter. I have buyer's remorse.
5,Plugged it in and was online in minutes!
5,Greatly improved wifi reception for desktop in a part of the house with horrible coverage. Huge improvement over the tiny USB dongle type wireless NIC.
5,Plugged it in and immediately saw my home network on Windows 10. I love it when things work perfectly and immediately.
3,To be fair (and why I rated it 3) was I have not had a chance to contact their tech people. I do not know if the problem is with this tech or my computer.
5,Satisfied
2,I have had these bought 2 a little over a month and they started messing up after a couple of weeks.  Both computers have to run the WiFi troubleshooting process repeatedly every day now.
5,Very easy to setup. Just plug it into USB port. Works great like all the other TP-Link products I've purchased.
1,It gets 220-250gbs on 3 different systems!  The existing 802.11AC adapters are getting 300-380mbs.  This is a POS.  I am just going to throw it into the trash.
5,I am in a basement apartment and router is on 3rd floor. Get a great signal set on 5G
5,I plugged it in and somehow with my wifi I get faster internet with this compared to my ethernet cable
5,Big improvement works better than expected. Well worth the investment.
5,TP-Link USB WiFi Adapter improved my WiFi signal only the cable connector is to short but it work fine for me
5,Cured my sons internet dropping out and much faster speed! This has great range and works flawlessly!
5,Installed driver from supplied CD plugged in and it worked perfectly.Rick solid connection very fast.
1,I bought this product hoping it would provide my computer with faster wifi internet speeds and a more consistent internet experience for streaming meetings...  Let's just say that this device is entirely unimpressive.  I tried multiple USB outlets 2.0 and 3.0 moving the antenna's around to find the best signal and installing a more recent driver directly from the website.  The consistent speeds I was finding would be in the 30 to 40mb/s range.  Very rarely I would hit spikes about 100 mb/s but never could be sustained.  It would disconnect and reconnect randomly and at times lagged at speeds under 5 mb/s.  I have a brand new wifi router that works great for all of my other devices and a 400 mb/s internet service(I have actually measured it) The real kicker is my old ac600 wifi adapter is 3+ years old only a single antenna and gets speeds consistently around 100mb/s.All this to say look elsewhere if you want a reliable wifi adapter this is not worth your time or money.
5,this item is very easy to use just lug it u and it shows avalible networks i am very satasfied with my urchase
5,Works great on my second computer in the living room.
5,5
5,Love it. Allowed me to use my old computer on wi fi
1,It made my internet have better ping but it made me lag a lot either way.
5,Perfect for my pc that doesn’t have WiFi.
1,See review title. Worked well for approximately 30 days (return window of course) then began constantly disconnecting. Isolated it to a short in the USB-A cable. Junk do not recommend purchasing.
5,Signal was much better than my old adapter works great no complaints
5,worked well for my needs
1,This device reaches up to ~500 MB at good times but constantly just disconnects over and over again softly or just barely lowers the connection down for you have issues with connecting to games. Total rubbish.
2,There is really bad packet loss 2hen playing video games
5,So happy with this product.  Works well and easy to install
5,Fácil de usar
5,Easy set up. Bought this to replace old 2g adapter. 5g up and running in 5min on windows 10 desktop.
3,It was fine when it worked but I was doing some gaming and it would randomly drop the wifi signal
1,This cheap thing only lasted me about a month until it started cutting out my internet.
1,The device just keeps cutting off and windows plays the jingle when something gets disconnected ive checked the connection multiple times now and still connceted properly. very disappointed with this product
5,EASY! Took 30 seconds to install! SIMPLE Plug and Play! NO software needed! VERY FAST! Windows 10 recognized immediately! A+
5,Used this to replace a smaller usb wifi adapter. Antennas provide MUCH better connection at the edge of my wifi signal.
5,Small and powerful. Easy installation and fixed internet connectivity problems on older desktop.
5,The installation is easy and and works like a butter.
2,The driver is on a CD.  CDs are obsolete.  It should be on a USB device.  Useless if you don't have a CD Rom.
1,Every time when I'm lagging out I have to unplug this thing and plug it back in. For some odd reason that has been helping me out temporarily. WIFI Speed overall is not good either. It keep disconnecting me (even though it says I'm connected) from games and calls and enough is enough now. Nothing has improved after many trouble shootings so I would recommend to find something else.
1,This worked great for a few hours and then completely died. I had to throw it out because no computer could use it after that.
1,This wireless product did not work right for me and I don't think I got what I paid for. It seems defective and I would not recommend anyone else buy this.
5,Fast wifi adapter.  Almost as fast as wired connection in my house
5,This product works great for larger areas. No problems so far.
5,plugged in and it gives great signal strength. kids game through these things.
2,I plugged this thing in installed the driver and it works as expected. But every hour or so it just completely shuts itself off for no reason and only starts working again if I unplug it and plug it back in. I'm quite tech savvy and have definitely tried all of the usual things one would try to fix this including changing the device's power options installing new drivers etc.Tech support did not provide a viable solution to this error.
5,Works as described.  Would buy again.
2,The connection will randomly cut out for zero reason.
5,Solid signal.  Twice as fast as my old usb WiFi device. Highly recommended.
5,Fast shipping. Works really well. Recommend.
1,Second purchase of a TP-Link Wireless Adaptor and the second time it fails in around one month.  Do not purchase!
1,TP-Link shouldn't be selling this as mac compatible.  No drivers from tplink for any mac os after 10.15 even if you go to their site. To Amazon's credit the listing does indicate most of the mac versions it works with but most people won't be using those older OSes anymore. So if you have a mac look elsewhere. Shame as it seems like a nice easy-to-use wifi gain antenna.
5,Work’s well
1,Poor driver support. I can't get this to work in Windows 11.
2,It was easy to install but the connection was bad. So I decide to return the item.
5,Installed the software quickly and plugged it in and it works.  Simple simple.
5,Excellent
1,Running on a Windows 10 PC this adapter will connect to Wifi and pick up signal just fine and max out my internet connection. However every few minutes it will just disconnect itself from the internet and then take 10 seconds to get back on. This makes a lot of activites tedious or straight up impossible to do like a livestream. It is possible it didn't like interacting with my mesh wifi so be warned if you have one of those.
5,Great love it
1,Terrible signal. The internal wifi adapter worked better. Trashed!
1,It just died randomly.
5,It works great
5,Easy to set up and use
1,Works great when it works... Not working all a sudden in 2 months...
1,Piece of junk. Constantly disconnects from my computer. Not to the internet but to the computer. Tried changing USB ports and wire still without fail goes off on me every single day multiple times a day. When it’s connected it worked great but that doesn’t matter when you need Constant signal.
1,I could not get my Archer T4U Plus pass the 90% installation. I tried their own CD that was included and drivers from their own website and it still could not install.  I spent over 2 hours with 3 different support agents and could not get anywhere with the last agent putting me on "hold" for well over 20 minutes with my patience finally boiling telling them I'm starting my return.  At that point the agent said they could send a ticket or call me.  STAY AWAY!  This is a very common problem with TP-Link on installation and you have to fiddle with many different settings to get it to work.
1,The reviews that say is does not work consistantly are correct. It has major issues staying connected. I do not reccomend this product.
1,My laptop and my phone gets better speed stability and connection. The 5GHz they claim to have disappoints me greatly. It's so weak even when the access point is right next to me. The adapter often switches over to the 2.4GHz network when it struggles to connect. Even then it's still so slow.I switched to USB 2.0 and USB 3.0. No avail. Made sure I had the right drivers and everything. I'm just very disappointed.If you want something for your desktop I recommend just getting a powerful PCI-e Wi-Fi adapter that can connect to the access point well.I was going to refund this but I don't have the time to bother.
1,Plugged in to USB port. Nada.
1,I got this adapter for the sole purpose of reducing my ping when playing PC games and it's actually worse than using the adapter in my laptop. Even on speed tests my laptop has better latency and is about 4 times faster than this TP Link adapter. The speed tests with this adapter are also wildly inconsistent. I might get 200mbps+ on one test then barely 50mpbs on another.Will be returning ASAP to find another adapter. Don't even waste your time or money.
1,As the title says it disconnects randomly even though I installed the driver. The light is constant green yet I end up disconnection regardless. The adapter does provide slightly more range yet the strength it gives is poor.
5,Perfect plug and play
5,Fácil de instalar
1,The item is false advertising. Once I got the package I was downloading a software which it stated was compatible with windows 11. However their were no drivers for that software even though it stated on the title for windows 11. I would like a refund.
5,Strait up plug and play with windows 10
5,Great product
1,this thing worked great for 48 hours after that it dropped off the network (could see thrm but not connect) and could not connect again.  I unplugged it a few times to try to reset and now won't even power up or be detected by system. overheated or fried itself after use?  either way its going back and I'll get something reliable
5,Cool
1,Very laggy!
5,Works perfect
5,Easy to install and great speed!
5,Works as expected.  Very happy.
1,First the installer caused a BSOD. After install using this thing i went from 30mbps to .04Tried troubleshooting but i just couldn't get any better speeds. Not sure if mine was defective.
1,For a brief moment the device worked fairly well; until it decided to start disconnecting every 30-60 minutes. I've attempted every trick imaginable from disabling selective USB sleep to uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers a few dozen times (both with the manufacturer's setup program and manually) and even testing every available 802.11 protocol on the device. No other wifi enabled devices in the house have connection issues so its incredibly clear the issue lies in this adapter. The frustration I've experienced with this stupid little wifi dongle is crazy don't purchase it.
1,This is not a plug and play device. This device requires you take all sorts of special steps. I hate technology that makes you jump through so many online hoops and other such garbage to make it work. If I could give this device no stars like it deserves I so TOTALLY WOULD!I love new software but I never like being slave to someones app to keep a device working. There are better network management solutions out there compared to this hot mess. I brought two of these devices and had to throw them both into the garbage. Without jumping through insane hoops this device is just so much garbage!
5,Great Product works wonderful !!!
1,I got this and was actually happy with the speeds provided by it however the issue lies within the product disconnects after moments of use save your money and by a product that actually functions.
5,Works perfect
5,Good signal
1,I got this because I wanted to improve my wifi signal strength over the built in wifi in my MacBook Pro.  It requires the installation of a driver which hung me up in several different ways having to do with security settings.  I eventually had to go into the terminal program to complete an uninstall before retrying the installation.  (Nothing about any of that in the instructions.)  Once installed the unit works fine with two old routers but NOT with my newest DECO X20 which is from the SAME company!  Whether it is a driver problem or a hardware problem I don't know.  Wasted a LOT of time with the installation(s) and with an unproductive chat with tp-link technical support.
1,This piece of crap reset some thing about my Internet protocols to the point where simple Google search results don’t show up anymore and instead of spending my weekend relaxing or doing literally anything else my barely text savvy self needs to now figure out how the hell I can restore functionality to my computer after I installed the drivers from this product’s website.0/10 interacting with this company and its product line has put me in a worse spot than I was before I spent the money.Windows 10 tech savvy enough to have built my own rig but I’m definitely not a networking person. Shouldn’t have to be to install a plug and play wifi adapter.
5,Good
1,TP-Link Archer T4U Plus will only work with Mac 32 bit operating systems. The current driver - version 1.8 - will not work with Catalina 10.15.7 and above - 64 bit OS. Really a shame. TP-Link suggests Archer T3U T2U and T2U Nano mini USB adapters will work with 64 bit Mac OS - but I can not confirm it. These three suggested units do not have full sized gain antenna arrays - They look just like a mini-dongle. Must return this purchase. It is the year 2021. We all operate in 64 bit.
1,Got this so I can be in the garden while I work. To my surprise it does not support current Mac versions!!! Do not get if you have a mac!
1,i've had to reinstall the drivers several times for some reason the drivers break causing the blue screen of death but after re installing the drivers it will work for a week or so then starts to fail i have seen lots of problems with other drives and windows 10 and i'm sure it's the fault of microsoft I HOPE it's time to pick a linux OS microsoft has become to intrusive
1,Works great! Every 5-10 minutes it disconnects and immediately reconnects. I am right next to the router. This thing is a piece of garbage
1,We bought this b/c we thought we had a weak signal. The installation instructions are unclear there's no way to tell if it works. When you try to enquire about it they try to up-sell you on more expensive stuff. tres bogus
1,This Wi-Fi adapter doesn’t work at all. It will detect available networks but will not connect to any networks. I tried uninstalling and re installing the drivers nothing. Waste of money!
1,The quality of the plastic is very weak one of the antennas broke when I tried to turn it I do not recommend this product
1,The description above claims "fully supports macs" but that turns out not to be true. There is currently no support for MacOS 10.15 and they have different drivers for different versions of the OS. Meaning that with every new OS update you might lose support (no drivers available) or have to go through the hassle of downloading new drivers (without a functioning wireless adapter!). The TP-LINK website has this in small print at the bottom of the product page "To ensure compatibility you may need to update the adapter’s drivers after an OS update." (If the drivers are even available for your version of the OS... which they're not).
1,I was told that this would be backwards compatible with windows 11 and that is not true. I am getting about 1/3 of my speeds which is a joke because I am about 15 ft from the router.
1,I took delivery of this device in early December '21. It worked fine as long as it worked. Last week it stopped working for no reason. 3.5 months of service.
1,Not sure why all the good reviews.  This antenna was a BEAR to get working.  The TP-link was so useless I had to try and get support from online forums.  Once it was up and running it died just 6 days after the end of Amazon's 30 day return policy.  Of course.  Now I have to toss it in a garbage can and start over.  You can be sure that I will not be purchasing another TP-Link product as a replacement based on their lack of support.
1,As many others I found my self teleworking in my basement.My wifi connection is not terribly bad but could be better.Tested this antenna 10 times against my 7-year-old laptop's wifi (one then the other and repeat. 10 times each).Av. download speed 23% faster but 121% more erratic (standard deviation of average signal)Av. upload speed 38% SLOWER than my laptop.I tested with Microsoft Teams and connection was clearly worse than with the laptop's wifi.Sorry no. It is not what the description claims to be.
1,Plugged this in to multiple different inputs on my laptop and placed the device in various areas in an effort to improve the signal and/or speed of home wifi. This device provided no improvement over the onboard network card
1,The first one I purchased had a short in the wiring out of the box. Amazon quickly replaced it. The second one lasted for 8 months. It works very well but its not a quality long term product.
4,We are on T-Mobile Home Internet as we have no fiber connection available to us. T-Mobile is much faster however that the local telephone company’s DSL service.  I tested the internet speed using the internal WiFi receiver on the PC using Ookla Speedtest.The PC’s internal WiFi tested at:41.9 Mbps download:6.07 Mbps upload.I then went on to test the TP-Link AX1800 which installed in an interesting manner. When plugging the device into the USB input of my Windows 11 box the device is recognized by Windows as a drive and then installs its driver automatically. Pretty slick.After making sure I was connected to the internet using the TP-Link WiFi I fired up Ookla and tested.The TP-Link achieved:84.54 Mbps download (Double the download speed of the internal WiFi receiver.)6.63 Mbps upload.I am impressed and happy with the performance of the TP-Link AX1800. It achieves significantly faster download speeds while its upload speed is as fast as my direct wired connection.This device could benefit from a magnetic base to hold it in place once set up. I installed a similar WiFi receiver on my wife’s PC and it has a slick magnetic base. I will find some Velcro tape to hold it down onto of my little PC box.Overall the TP-Link AX1800 is a good upgrade from those who must rely on a WiFi connection where a hardwire ethernet connect is not possible. This device is a bit pricey however. There are cheaper products out there. I do feel that this WiFi receiver is however a fair deal given its ease of installation and fast connect speed.
2,Driver disk would not install the product.Support was condescending and ineffective.Try a different brand.
2,The WiFi Adapter constantly loses connection and needs to be reset to work again. Shopping for a replacement.
1,DOA - no lights no activity! Returned for credit.
1,It drops connection frequently on my windows 10. Once it happens I have to disconnect it from the USB port and re-plug it. Annoying!
2,For some reason the connection completely drops and has to reconnect when visiting certain websites (like Fedex.com). No idea why. I put in my old card and it works perfectly.
1,This thing crashed my Windows computer.  I don't think I am going to be able to salvage my stuff that is on it.  Wish I could give it a -10.
1,Signal cuts in and out. Don't recommend.
1,This seemed like a winner at first. Much faster internet speeds. For a while in the first day.But later in the day I'm getting speeds that are slower than what I got without it!I can't possible recommend this product.I bought a 25-foot ethernet cable: at least I can depend on that to work though it will be PITA.
1,Won’t work on a macbook constant timeouts.just figuring out its not my laptop but the device
5,The router is on the 2nd floor. I'm still running the good-old Apple AirPort extreme. I have a home office on the first floor and I don't have wired ethernet through the house. The office is like a black WiFi hole practically no WiFi signal gets there. For now I was running an AC network adapter but you know how slow it is through power lines with all the noise and distortion from home appliances. I was very disappointed with the internet speed and performance which was below 40 Mbps I decided to try this adapter because it has a dual high-gain antenna and supposedly gets a better signal. First I plugged it in my Mac to compare how well it will perform vs built-in Apple WiFi which supports 5Ghz as well. I can say it easily reaches 400Mbps which is the same. Then I went to install it on my office machine across the hall from here. Swapping to that dual antenna gave a very nice performance boost. It's now around 150Mbps (up from about 40!). It's about 25 feet from the router and there are at least three walls in between. So I'd say this new WiFi adapter really helps to get better signals in areas where your WiFi is weak. It still shows low WiFi signal level but it's stable and it's the best speed so far that I was able to get in my office. Also future proof of my office network connection when I finally say goodbye to my old Apple router and give in to the new WiFi6 protocol my office PC will be ready to rip benefits of this upgrade right away! This is worth $50 in my book.*** TL;DR ***Yes I would recommend this WiFi6 adapter. I've been using TP-Link network hardware for a long time now and it always performs very well. This WiFi6 adapter is not an exception. It has high-gain antennas delivering excellent signal strength. It's easy to set up and configure allows a stable and fast connection even in the farthest corners of my house supports the newest WiFi6 standard with WPA3 encryption and is 100% future-proof! Solid 5 stars no complaints.+++ Pros +++1) High-gain antennas.2) Excellent signal strength.3) Easy to set up and configure4) Supports the newest WiFi6 standard.5) Supports WPA3 encryption6) 100% future-proof!--- Cons ---1) USB cable is too short and too stiff.
1,Loses connectivity. I watch it turn on and off frequently. Im going to try and return it. It may be defective. I'll edit my post when I do this and see.When it was connected I didn't see much lag. I would not recommend this for FPS gamers.
1,If you are planning to buy this for the MacOS BigSur there is no driver support at all for over a year now. Purchased in hope that the manufacturer will provide the driver for the OS that is out for more than a year now.  Returning the adapter.
1,Meets expectations. It just works. I did not need to install any drivers. I just plugged it in to my usb3 port and set in up under windows 10. I am using the latest version of windows 10. I am using the 5GHz mode. I am about 25 feet from my router through 1 wall.  My internet is 30 down / 4 up and I get the full speed.  Hope this info helps.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               No me llego completo el paquete no lo compren no esta llegando bien los paquetes
1,While it is certainly my fault for purchasing this without first verifying that it was supported in Linux I don't think I should have to do that with a basic network adapter. I didn't verify and figured it would just work...but I was wrong.
2,Wifi Disconnects consistently when downloading and not as fast
1,Tested with and also without the driver this device provided no benefit whatsoever.  Internal wifi worked better.  Will be returned.
1,With this adapter it made my internet twice as slow as it was before i was better off playing games and doing work with out it because the lag and slowness of this adapter was unbearable.
1,Not as big as it looks in the picture this thing is small but not a deal breaker but it took forever for them to ship it and they could have caused an overdraft in my bank account im glad the funds were there and if they didnt have them in stock we shouldnt be allowed to purchase it take it down
1,Never worked tried a new cable as some have mentioned to no avail. The Chinese software CD is a real piece of trash however the Chinese characters tell you all you really need to know regarding the quality.
1,The newest version of macOS supported by this adapter is macOS 10.14 (Mojave) which was released in 2018. It doesn't work with mac10.15 (Catalina) from 2019 nor macOS 11 (Big Sur) from 2020. And as Apple no longer supports or provides security updates for Mojave it's not smart to be running that version anymore. Which makes this adapter effectively useless on Macs. Disappointing.
2,Not for windows 10 as it describes wouldnt load up
1,The title of the AC1300 is listed as AC1300mbps but read the description. I received it too late and realized it’s max speed is 867mbps. So the title clearly suggests a much higher speed by adding the mbps to the end of the title. Smh. There are way cheaper products for The same or better speeds so don’t fall for the tricky title. Super sneaky stuff right there.
1,After months of use this pile of garbage continues to go out when it decides it wants to as well as consistently giving me a hard time connecting to the 5ghz network. Spend your money elsewhere.
1,From the same spot in the house on the 5ghz network it delivers 50-75% less speed than my phone and ipad on the same network. Extremely disappointing since it promised much higher speeds and it only 15ft from the router.
1,Had this adapter working on an older Macbook.  Incompatible with the last two major versions of Mac OS.  Stay away.
1,I get lag spikes while gaming and it happens extremely often.  This doesn't happen with the network adapter that came with my pc so it's 100% from this product.  Definitely returning this is unacceptable for a product that's marketed to be used for gaming.
1,constant disconnectslow internet speeds 90% of the timeand have to keep unplugging and repluging it in
5,Installer executable is built into the storage of the USB adapter itself. This means you do not need a pre-existing internet connection to download the installer.Post-install connection to my local wireless network was as simple as using the dedicated wireless adapter on my machine: enable Wi-Fi select the network input password.Upload/download speeds are identical to the dedicated wireless adapter. Compact form-factor will also make this ideal for travel!
2,Speed just isn't there
5,The TP-linik AX1800 WiFi 6 USB adapter is a welcome improvement in terms of both speed and signal reception compared to using my laptop's built in WiFi card.The AX1800 is a simple device that makes it easy to add a network interface to any computer with a USB port. The cable has a little flag that mentions using a USB3.0 port is recommended. The USB cable is included and has a length of just over 3 feet (1 meter).To use the adapter you just need to plug it into your computer and then access the adapter as though it were a USB thumb drive in order to access the drivers you need to install. I really like that I didn't have to download any drivers or use a CD to install them. This method of having them loaded onto the adapter itself is super convenient.Once drivers were installed I just connected the new WiFi interface to my PC and off I went. The performance gains are massive. I have crappy internet service so I can't share any numbers with you that are going to make your jaw drop. But the adapter is much more sensitive to a weak and less than stellar WiFi signal than my laptop's onboard WiFi card is.The adapter itself is compact and looks pretty cool. It has a blue LED that lights up and stays on while its connected to a network.At the current retail price of $49.99 I think its a good value.
5,If you have a system without built in WiFi or a WiFi adapter with poor signal quality or older technology this is the adapter for you. The Archer AX1800 (Archer TX20U Plus) has a dual band high gain antenna and supports WiFi 6. This connects via USB with an included cable and doesn't require a separate power adapter. The quality of connections was excellent with the high gain antenna and the WiFi 6 allowed for much faster speeds.
5,Got this for my son who needed a new wifi dongle. This is limited by his computer but other than those things it's been working pretty well. He's using a refurbished workstation. We also had an issue with some Netgear software from his old dongle that made this one drop wifi. Once he uninstalled that software his wifi issues stabilized. He hasn't had any additional issues and it's behaving as expected now.
5,This matches my other wifi6 speeds I'm getting from a wifi card. Connection is solid (though it's sitting pretty close to the router). Cool to see wifi improving so much don't feel like every single device needs to be hardwired anymore.
5,If you need a wireless adapter for a PC this is a great option!I saw a 20% increase in speed over my old adapter! I was surprised to see any increase since I just assumed this was the best I can get from my ISP but the adapter was to blame.Setup was quick and easy.  As soon as I plugged it in it acted as a drive and the setup file was on there.  In about a minute my computer asked me to restart and when it did I was already connected.  No fuss no extra software - just an easy setup.I love that I am able to get a faster connection to an upstairs computer that can't be hardwired (apartment so drilling holes to run wires is a no go).Another great piece of network hardware from TP-LINK!
5,With WiFi - just like with cellular and other types of radio signals - the stronger your signal the better.  Stronger signal means faster page loads cleaner downloads and overall better experiences.  This USB adapter not only provides a high speed connection (up to 574 mbps on 2.4ghz 1201 mbps on 5ghz when used with a USB 3.0 connection) but also helps you get a better signal - between the receiver itself being attached to a long cable / so you can position it where you need for signal purposes you also get two long 5dBi antennas that help you get a better signal both sending and receiving.The device itself is unremarkable - it is nice that you get a detachable cord so you can either replace it or add an extension if you need a longer distance - overall it’s small and easy to keep out of the way but with the aforementioned strong antennas.  It was plug and play for me with Windows 11 and I was up and running in minutes.  And that’s what I expect from TP-Link another great networking product.  So if you need a stronger/faster WiFi signal on one of your computers look no further!
5,On an older computer that is further away from the router we were getting speeds around 2 to 3 Mbps. We pay for 400 Mbps. After plugging this WiFi adapter in nothing happened! After unplugging and re-plugging the adapter Windows gave me a pop-up as if I had just connected a storage device. The adapter has the driver files stored on it! After installing the drivers we were up and running. Speed test time! After the install of this adapter we were now getting between 295 and 300 Mbps on the 2.4Ghz band. Very nice!I can easily recommend this WiFi adapter as an easy upgrade. And if your system supports it you can even take advantage of new WiFi 6 technology for the fastest speeds on less congested bands!
5,My old adapter died recently figured I would use that as a reason to upgrade to a wifi6 device. The drivers are on the device it shows up as a mass storage device when plugged in. Run the installer from it and it will set itself up. After a reboot I was back online. Signal is better with this device since my previous one didn't have external antennas. Great connection speed and low latency no issues at all. Uses a usb3 micro b cable so if you need a longer one they are easy to come by.
5,My desktop was being laggy on the internet and I've tried EVERYTHING but a new internet card. I previously had a cat 5 cable running from my router from across the house and the cords still in perfect shape so I suspect it was my internet card on the computer and grabbed this tp link wireless thing. I plugged it in and ran it's driver and really quickly my computer showed a "Wi-Fi 2" option and said TP Link on that so I chose that option and now my internet is running much more smoothly! I think it's silly that a wireless thing is running better than a cat 5 cable connection but it absolutely is! I have gigabit internet and this thing gets the internet to my computer at the same speeds as the cable did which is really good! Very happy with this! It's smaller too so doesn't take up much space.
5,I am running on a WiFi 5 network so I cannot comment on if this adapter will do everything it promises but on my older WiFi this is an astonishingly stable WiFi link. For lack of a better term it "feels" like being attached by a wire in that there are no weird latency issues etc. and the speed is absolutely pinned at the maximum my access point can support. It also has great range.It's maybe a bit of overkill for most usage and for a less than cutting edge WiFi network but I am very happy to have it.
1,If you barely touch this thing it disconnects signal quality is slightly better than a dongle but it completely cuts out if you touch it.
5,My desktop upstairs usually gets 2-4 bars it fluctuates. My wifi speed without an adapter is the first image and the second image is with the adapter with the improved signal. It works fantastic and is definitely worth the money.the images alone tell the story
1,This product randomly fails constantly. It isn't reliable enough to function as your primary connection device.
5,The Intel WiFi adapter on our kids Acer all-in-one PC has been extremely slow for some reason. I think the Intel hardware failed.  So I plugged in this TP-Link USB WiFi adapter and now we get blazing fast speed.  Now it’s 90Mbps instead of 5Mbps.What I especially like is how small this is and how it is powered by USB so no external power adapter is needed yet it transfers at industrial strength speeds.  It is easy to hide behind the computer as shown in this picture.The only minor downside is that it is so lightweight there is nothing to keep it from sliding around or flipping upside down when the USB cables are nudged a little bit.
1,Doesn't work on latest Macs - contrary to what they advertise.
1,Could not install. CD was bent. Emailed to ask for the driver file they sent had a virus attached!
1,Doesn’t help download speed at all still getting 1 MBs
5,I have a very old desktop computer I built that had a wireless chip built in.  The old computer is still great other than not working well with newer wifi networks.  This was a cheap and effective way to bring new life with Wifi 6 to that old desktop.  Works well with the Eero routers we have in the house.  Highly recommended!
1,Poor Linux support. It’s 2020 tp link is a wealthy company don’t make me compile my own drivers. Work to get them in the kernel or at least provide a repository.
1,put in the USB and it would not boot up and download software.  kept beeping and rejected the adapter.  returned it.
1,Stopped functioning in a week
1,The title says it all the adapter stopped receiving power after 2-3 months.
4,The reception in the office was a little weak but after connecting was able to keep a solid conection. Would have given 5 stars if the initial setup was a bit more simple.
1,As of 2/17/2021 it still does not support MacOS 11.1
5,No need for drivers CD w/ Windows 10 - it's simply plug & play.Immediately got the maximum wireless speed my system allows (200 Mbps). Other devices gave me about only 20-30% of that. Highly recommended!
5,Purchased to improve WIFI reception on desktop. So far working as advertised. Thank You.
5,I have my GPU vertically mounted so a PCIE wifi adapter wasn't an option for me. I've tried other USB wifi adapters and they were all awful to be honest. I took a risk on this one because it looked much beefier than others and with the two antennas I thought it would help. First off I love how the USB is long and the adapter itself isn't stuck to the physical PC; I can keep it tucked away behind the PC case. In addition the unit itself feels very solid and I don't think it would break anytime soon. With Gigabit Fios on Wifi I reach around 500 download and 300 upload which is INSANE compared to other things I've tried. HIGHLY recommend I wouldn't even consider anything other this as it might even be better than some PCIE cards.
5,Works well. Got a cheap desktop just for work Remote work. It didn’t come with WiFi connection. Tried a tiny usb WiFi adapter but it was shotty and connection kept dropping. Got this for $6 more and haven’t had any connection issues for remote work once.
1,Bad
5,Does what it claims. More sensitive than the receiver it replaced.
5,Used on an older PC with USB 2.0 and what an amazing difference it made to the signal! Boosted the signal and speed from 3mbps to nearly 100! Worth every penny.
2,While it was fast when working the device doesn't work for gaming at all since it disconnects every hour or so and you'll be kicked out of your game.I've seen some software fixes but none worked for me and it's really not worth it since there are so many options out there. Go with one of them.
5,The wifi card on my laptop stopped working just out of warranty.  Rather than crack it open this seemed like a cheap and quick option to get away from an ethernet cord.  I read many of the reviews and anticipated some driver issues but much to my surprise I plugged it in and was logged in to my network in less than half a minute.  The range and signal strength are far better than the built-in card.  Couldn't be happier with it.
5,My sister has tried adding a wireless USB to her desktop years ago and the computer could not see the USB device.  But we have been having wired internet issues so I figured this would be a good backup.  So it was time to give it another try.  It installed easily and was getting 270 Mbps on the 5G network from about 10 ft away for the router.  The wired powerline adapter was getting 170 Mbps.  So yea.
5,I really write a review but here I must!!!My office is far from a router and would get only 100mbs out of my Gigabyte plan in a good day with so many different antennas.With this I get 400+ down and 350+ up. Really happy! Especially for this price.P.S Sorry for broken English
1,Very impressed with this adapter. Plug and play and pretty fast. No complaints.Update: find a better network adapter!!! This thing works great at first then becomes intermittent. Really gets annoying while gaming. Buy something else probably have better luck with tinfoil.
5,This adapter is awesome.  I replaced a cheap adapter that overheated all the time with this one.  The speeds are as good as my ISP can provide around 450 Mbps and my wireless router is downstairs in a separate room.
5,My laptop only supports 2G WIFI with this I can connect to the 5G network which improved my bandwidth 4 times. Very satisfied with this purchase!
2,The description on this item is misleading. It is for USB 3.0 only. It will not work with USB 2.0 because USB 2.0 cannot provide any power to run the device. Power can only be provided from a USB 3.0 port.
5,Works great for my purposes.  Easy to install.  Recommend.
5,This was a replacement for my wireless that was working intermittently and new one works great.
5,Download speed increased 8x.
5,It increases signal strenght from wifi.
5,Its great
5,No problems definitely buy this item for all your online and streaming needs
5,Set up quick and easy to connect my desktop computer to the internet.
2,I needed a little stronger wifi signal so I bought this product.  It is no better than a USB wifi receiver with no antennas.  The 2.4G signal was identical to a cheaper  product.  I still could not get a lock on the 5G signal.  I had really hoped for a great improvement in strength and it wouldn't maintain a connection on 5G.  My other unit is old so I will keep this unit. I did not see any noticeable improvement in signal strength.  Disappointed.  If you have weak wifi this unit will probably not help very much if at all.  Install was great connection was fast just didn't deliver the performance I wanted/needed.
5,I remember the days when you had to manually make devises talk to each other. PNP is really PNP now. Love it.
5,She moved into a nursing home that had wi-fi and her computer did not.It worked without install anything. Plug and play. HOWEVER installing the software did boost the performance to what I expected. Before I installed it was a little choppy/slow.Recommenced if you need wifi on a PC/laptop without it.
5,Plug in and go. It works great on my old Lenovo m82 desktop pc.
5,Effortless connection and use: once you plug it into a USB3 port and type in your wifi password it's up and running. The distance was very good to a separate shop from the router in the house.
5,although it did 'plug-and-play' right out of the box the TP-Link drivers added some device functionality and tuning over the stock Microsoft W10 drivers... Happy with the purchase  JPS I don't game so I don't care and would not know if there is any improved functionality for gaming...
3,Used on my old computer that only supports 2.4ghz. The 5ghz wifi this adapter provides gives a great speed but it would randomly drops connection and automatically reconnect again. This usually happens when I was watching a show (with 2hr duration) online and it would suddenly pauses the show and resume after a period of time still can browse internet but the video is just paused there from loading. This does worse than my 2.4ghz old adapter that came with my computer although a bit slower on browsing internet.
5,The speed is absolutely the same as a wire to the computer I'm seeing 179 down / 10 up with Cox just like when wired ping was 9. Full bars antennas work well through multiple walls and maybe 20+ feet of travel. Install was a touch weird. One USB port started to work then failed to work tried uninstalling but it hung up tried everything and no dice until...switched to a different port...bingo perfection and stable. So you may have to fiddle around a bit but if you get the performance I got you will be happy.
1,Only picked up 2g networks was slow and disconnected a lot
5,My computer is only a few years old but the WIFI adapter that came with it cannot handle the higher bandwidth. I was initially looking for an internal card but then realized that I ran out of slot to install.This adapter was easy to install like plug the USB cable in. Downloaded and installed the latest driver. Initially it connected to the wifi router successfully but no internet. Then everything worked when the computer was rebooted.My only complaint is that it took a second or two to load the driver each time the computer was rebooted. No biggie.
5,No more disconnections or chronic sign ins. Works well. I wish the antenna cord was longer for mounting at a distance.
5,Downloaded thr drivers online. Firered right up. Has been stable and strong so far
4,Got 300Mbps+ wi-fi speed on my 300Mbps service right out of the box (30ft away in open room)A month later I noticed the most I could muster was 40-50 Mbps regardless of antenna(s) position.Took the advice of reviewer Norm L. and changed wireless mode value from Auto to IEEE 802.11a/n/ac.Instantly gave me the 300Mbps speed again. Your results may vary.Windows 10:- Settings- Network & Internet- Wi-Fi- Scroll down to "Change Adapter Options"- Right click on your "TP-Link Wireless Adapter"- Properties- Configure- Advanced- Choose Wireless Mode under Property- Change value from Auto to IEEE 802.11a/n/acCan't say how long this will work but I'll monitor it regularly when I boot up.We need good software that will tell you where the slow down is for internet speed. Too many variables.Usually it's my isp (Mediacom) which has terrible service.Also located my router further away from the entertainment center to minimize 2.4Ghz interference and put it up higher on a shelf (cord hiding along molding). Getting better reception in the rest of the house.Hopefully TP-Link will offer further advice as time goes on.
5,great product!
4,Imagine my surprise when all I had to do to get this adapter working was plug it into an open USB 3.0 port in an up and running PC and when connecting to the router type in the security code per the instructions on the screen. Took no more than a minute. Imagine my greater surprise when I found it was connecting and downloading about 75% faster than the wi-fi adapter that originally came installed inside the computer. Am counting on the reputation of TP-Link for long term reliability.
5,We have two internet services.  Cable at 600mb on the other side of the house and phone company at 300mb right next to the PC.With the phone company router next to the PC getting the 300+mb was not an issue.  But the phone company wi-fi to the PC seldom hit more than 250mb although it was just 6 inches from the PC.The cable wi-fi signal 600mb (from the other side of the house) never reached more than 351mb on the PC.Since the only thing I had not upgraded was the existing TP-Link adapter on the PC I purchased this new TP-Link Archer TX20U Plus.  When I first installed it which was super easy my download speeds from both internets were actually significantly 'slower' than with the old TP-Link adapter.I was irritated and ready to send it back.  Then I did two things.  1. I went to TP Link's website and got the latest driver with a time step of this June 2022.  2. I plugged the new adapter into the exact same USB PORT the old one came out instead of a different one like I did when I first installed it.Made all of the difference.  I'm now picking up 550+ mb WIFI from the cable company router on the other side of the house.  There are at least 'three' walls between that router and this PC so that pretty good.Recommendation:If you buy this adapter.  1) Make sure to go to the TP Link website for the latest driver.  2) Try different USB ports on your PC and then check the download speed.Update: Early in the AM when most folks are asleep I did another speed test with this new TX20U Plus wireless adapter.  I actually achieved more than 600mb download speed wirelessly.  The router on the 'other' side of the house even when connected with an ethernet produced only about 650mb.  So the wifi  strength reception is amazing.
5,Works perfectly .I have an office that is a good way from our main houseand this thing gives me speeds like im standing next to the router. Super impressed.I have been very impressed with the TP Link brand!Everything I buy from them has been really good.I am in the communications fieldand recommend them all the time
5,Needed to get a better wifi signal to a room up a flight of stairs and across the hall from the router. The first antenna I bought was okay - it got a signal but the speeds were 5-10mbps. Using this I'm easily getting 140 mbps download / 30 upload mbps. Massive improvement! Very worth it.
5,I got very fast speeds between my garage and my home got at least a hundred megabytes per second transfer speed which is great
5,I bought it to use on my old PC whose wireless function died. It gives me internet access at a decent speed. I use it for research and email. I never tried it for gaming.
5,Only installed a few days ago but so far perfect.  I am using this on an older desktop computer to replace the internal wifi card.  Plug and play TP-Link recognized the wifi networks and picked up the 5ghz wifi network my old antenna didn't register.  Receiving almost 60 mbps through USB 3.0 connection.
5,This wireless adapter works great!It was easy to set up on my Windows 10 PC. And has improved was signal strength from the Wi-Fi box out in the front room to my bedroom towards the back of the house.
5,Just as the title says works better then the single version
5,easy install... good speed...
5,Significant increase in download speed compared to the built-in wifi in my work laptop (see before and after pics). My max internet connection speed is 150 up/10 down.The laptop does not have a usb 3.0 socket only usb 2.0. Therefore I connected the usb adapter to a usb 3.0 socket on my Dell usb dock which connects to the laptop via usb-c thunderbolt. This setup worked out great.
5,After I installed I say a drastic improvement for the internet speed.
5,Works like a charm. Use it for my laptop in a room that my router seems to have extreme difficulty reached. Connected this better than plug and play and it works. You will need cd access or you will have to download the driver online. Which if you're blinking out like I was well that wouldn't have worked.
4,After installing the latest drivers I managed to get the speeds im paying for. But the connection is choppy and im not far from the router. It slows down a lot or completely cuts out.Edit: so I messed around a bit with it. Turns out changing a setting under device manager>network adapters>tp link> and right clicking on it and selecting properties. Make sure under the power management the check mark is not selected for allowing the computer to turn it off to save power that seemed to fix the cutting  out.
4,This works surprisingly well with one small change. When I first got it and plugged it in it was working but my download speed topped out at around 30 mbs. That's okay and good enough for what I'm using it for but some larger downloads would take quite a while at that speed. I bought a longer cable in hopes that placing it closer to the access point would speed things up. As soon as I plugged the new cable in I was getting speeds of 170mbs with it being in the exact same spot as before.If you do get this antenna do yourself a favour and buy a better cable it will make a world of difference.
5,I was using a D-Link adapter and only got 35Mbps for download speed. I upgraded to this and now I'm getting 190Mbps (We have the 200Mbps Internet Package) and I am extremely happy with this!
5,It’s performing well for me. My only concern is long term reliability and I hate the slow process of warranty claims. Tp link website shows 2 year warranty for this product hoping I won’t need to use it but it’s good to have it.
5,This WiFi adapter is a good value and works well for my purposes. The instructions and packaging are very good. The cord is long enough for most applications I believe.
5,Very easy to use and very small making it easy to put on desk
5,Easy to setup and works good
5,Even with my limited tech savy I was able to install easily.  Seems to work beautifully and I was able to install the connect to the internet and add it to my desktop to check on any problems.
5,i have been buying for my work desktop several usb wifi adapters only this is fast enough! hopefully it lasts cause the last ones only lasted for 6 months.i have a dead spot as my room is all the way down the basement only this worked for me!
5,It really works as said (maybe better) the USB cable could be a little longer....highly recommended....!...
5,Bought this to replace another companies defective unit.After a few weeks this is working great on W10I hope it continues!
5,This was exactly what I needed. The built-in wifi adapter on my Dell tower has never yielded a strong connection (topping out at ~30Mpbs down). Though my wifi hub is only 3 feet away even the Anewkodi USB wifi adapter I tried did not help (aside from perhaps 5 Mbps improvement.This TP-Link adapter has increased our throughput by almost 100Mbps which is even better than I'd hoped. Fantastic!
5,I had this downstairs and the house already has horrible reception for WiFi. It worked like a charm!
5,Windows found the 5G password. Download 400 MB/Seconds I will take it.  Play with the antenna placement you never know.  I just plugged it in to a USB 3.0 Port.  Easy!!!
5,immediately boosted my wifi to 5ghz. very fast very quick installation. an absolute god send.
5,I purchased this after looking alternatives more expensive models and makes twice the price but thought Id  take a cahance on this sleek looking cheaper alternative knowing I could return it if it didnt do the job. My router is on the level above in the kitchen / Condo and I work in the garage below. Comapred to the previous usb wifi stick this is just amazing giving a full solid 200 mps. Performance and looks 10/10. Also love the fact its on its own base plate with and rather than having stuck into a usb port directly I can place it anywhere due to the generous supplied cable. You simply can not go wrong with this plug and play cost effective item.. Best I have used and great low ping  1ms for gaming despite being in the garage..
5,works well and easy to install.  no more wifi issues for me.
5,The cable was a little too short to reach my laptop and I ordered a longer(USB 3.0 Cable - A-Male to Micro-B - 6 Feet)and I also tried using a(6.6FT AINOPE USB 3.0 Extension Cable Type A Male to Female Extension Cord)from Amazon and both cables worked.A standard USB 2.0 extension cable did not work.The Archer T4U Plus AC1300 worked like a charm and I am very happy with it.Customer service helped me with the problem and answered my questions via e-mail in 1 day.  I would definitely any TP product again.
5,It was so easy to plug this into my USB port on my older pc that didn’t have a 5G wifi capability. My speed test went from 23mbps to 290mbps! Well worth the small price tag!
5,Works great and has a nice long cord to put it up high. Since I am sharing a router with family next door it works great for long distance wifi. I always buy TP Link! My previous TP Link adapter lasted several years until I bought this one which is even better.
5,We do an annual event at the Oregon dunes. The WiFi in the motel where we stay does not penetrate into the rooms. It's great outside but you lose signal inside. I installed the TP-Link USB WiFi Adapter driver on my laptop and hung the external antenna with a suction cup hook on the window. Bingo! I got 5G 800 Mbps internet service the highest available from the motel router. A longer cable would be nice but it got the job done.
5,It is super simple to install plug and play. I don’t have my computer far from the router so I couldn’t tell you how much range it has but it works well for me.
5,Great for gaming
5,Are you kidding me?!!!  Look at the photo and you'll see how much better my connection is.  I swear the wireless router is in the next room and it's a good one but the old USB wifi stick was just old and tired.  This is satisfying
5,easy to install and works great.  much easier than than installing cables all over the house.
1,No me sirve
5,Does exactly as it is supposed to do.  Very happy with my purchase.
4,We wanted to use our desk computer in the bedroom to not clutter our livingroom but needed an added boost to get online. This works wonderfully!
5,Easy to install and nit expensive. Works great
5,Replaced one that broke when it hit the floor. This one seems to be a step up from the one I broke.
5,While the portable antenna might be a hassle it is a great product! Using this antenna I saw a 95mbps increase in download speed and a 358mbps increase in upload speed. Great product make sure the antennas are pointing towards the router for a better boost!
5,Solved my son's wifi problems.  Windows 10 it was plug and play.
5,We have a desktop in the office that isn't even close to a network jack. Put this in place and works fine no issues. Don't even think I needed to install drivers.
5,Excellent adapter. The wifi signal on speed test went from before 33 Mbps to 220 in download mode and from before 14 Mbps to 314 Mbps in upload mode. Easy to install product. Great manufacturer. The router in my Verizon internet is also from Tp-Link and has gone beyond expectations.
5,Unpacked the box plugged it in computer recognized ran the cd started using it. Works great for my stand alone desktop in the family room. Very happy
5,It also feels very well made. I installed it on my Windows 10 machine and I occasionally game on it. It took a minute for it to install and to connect to wifi but once connected I had no problems. I just flipped the antennas in opposite directions for the wavelength difference to get the best possible signal and performance. I'm using USB 2 and I'm sure it would work just as well or better on USB 3.1.
5,
5,Plugged it in and was able to connect to Wi-Fi.This adapter give you the option to connect to Wi-Fi on a pc or laptop
5,This adapter made a HUGE difference from the built-in adapter in my laptop.
5,Easy setup and the speeds are as advertised. No issues with usb 3.0 as others have stated just know what plugs your motherboard supports.Funny side note box says Free 1m extension cord inside. This cord is 100% required as the connecting end into the adapter is a proprietary connector. So without them giving us this free gift the adapter we paid for is useless. So kind of them. A free gift should be an included 3M adhesive strip for wall mounting the adapter.
5,This inexpensive and very fast USB3 adapter gives a desktop (or laptop) computer nearly gigabit speeds with no cables (and the associated time and cost to pull Ethernet through finished walls in a home). The two external antennas give great reception. Worth every penny!!
5,It’s just plug and play no annoying driver setup or anything I just plugged it in and it was ready to connect to the internet. Speeds are also about right for a Wi-Fi connection
5,I was worried about this device from the bad reviews i was reading here but i ended up buying it anyway. All i needed to do is just plug it it and it worked i didnt need any cd or to download anything and its super fast
5,Works better than expected
5,I have tried several other 5ghz USB Wi-Fi adapters most of them only get 4/5 bars for signal strength to my modem which is on another floor and a couple of rooms away. I have a 100 MB internet connection and usually get between 60 to 80 megabits per second with other Wi-Fi adapters. I got 98 with this one and a full five bar signal strength. For only a couple dollars more than the no name brand adapters that often lie about their specs this is worth it for the performance and reliability. Highly recommended 10/10.
5,It works really good I had problem with my laptop wifi this solved the problem.
5,Pros: Easy to install literally plug and play  Longer connecting cable than most other products very thick and well made.
5,Easy to setup works as expected. A nice boost to signal strength over the built in laptop antenna.
5,It is easy to install the CD works for me
4,Box states 'free 1 meter USB cable extension' implying theres a M-to-F USB cable in the package - but there is not. Other then that works great. Drivers auto installed.
5,I use this on a desktop. My router is 45 ft away. I have a 1 GIG connection and with this USB dongle I am pulling down stable speeds of 700 MBS.
5,It took a little bit of finagling to get the Wi-Fi to work (I am not a computer expert) but once I figured it out it worked perfectly for extending my Wi-Fi signal.
5,Eazy to install I'm very happy I bought this item.
1,light came on but nothing after that doesn't detect at all not a good product
5,Había comprado una USB marca genérica para usarla con red 5GHz ya que la tarjeta integrada en mi LapTop solamente soporta redes 2.4GHz y me duró poco mas de 6 meses. Intenté con ésta  de TP-Link que leí como recomendada y hasta el momento (1 semana) me ha funcionado sin problemas. Tiene muy buen alcance 5GHz con sus 2 antenas y me dá la velocidad máxima contratada ~200MB/s. Solamente un poco mas grande de lo que creía. Mi laptop con Windows la detectó en automático sin requerir ninguna instalación de drivers ni el CD que viene incluido. El tema fue con mi Linux Ubuntu no la cargó en automático y en el CD no viene el driver para Linux intenté con el de la página oficial de TP-Link que tampoco funcionó parece que es para kernel viejos. Buscando en Github encontré el driver que me funcionó "/cilynx/rtl88x2bu" ahí mismo te dan las instrucciones de instalación y ya funcionó correctamente. Ahora esperemos que me dure mas que los 6 meses de la otra.
5,My daughter's laptop had poor connectivity to my TP-Link AX20 router at her desk. She complained that Valorant would sometimes not load properly or hang in the middle of playing. Speedtest reported 21 mbps down and 4 mbps up with the laptop's wifi adapter.Once I plugged in the T4U Plus installed the driver and disabled the laptop wifi Speedtest reported 150 mbps down and 145 mbps up.It's a little inconvenient to have a cabled adapter beside the laptop but it's worth it for the performance gain. Wish there was a cradle that could be attached to the back of the screen to put the adapter in.Bought a second one at the sale price.
5,I have a desktop computer that came with a weak WiFi card and was not close to the router to be plugged in by ethernet. I bought this in hopes of boosting the signal. My internet plan is up to 300 mbps but I was only getting 20-40 with the installed WiFi card. Within about 5 minutes of plugging this item into a USB 3.0 port (not 2.0) downloading the latest driver from the website it was working. I now consistently get 280-300 mbps and I have about 3 walls and a floor between my computer and my router (though the router is quite good). Well worth the price for consistent speed! I have used it for about a week and wish I had bought this months ago (I was NOT given this item for free and did NOT receive any promotion - just an honest review).
5,There's not much to say here. I used this adapter as a stopgap solution for remote working when the on-board Ethernet card on my PC started having intermittent issues. It installed in a flash without any issues without the need of a driver in Win10 and provided me with excellent performance to the extent of making me think of keeping it in the system permanently. We will see how that goes so far so good.Just make sure it gets adequate power from the USB port. Obviously a USB3 port is recommended.One thing I did not understand was the absence of a USB cable... I thought it was supposed to come with one?
5,1)Plug the device in.2)Go to the provided website address in the included literature and download latest driver.3) Install and enjoy.It should be that easy. No tech qualifications required whatsoever.If there's one thing I can gripe about it's the cables thickness. It could've been thinner. As it's rather bulky for such a lightweight device. Although not a deal breaker for the price.
5,I had a top model D-Link adapter a few years back and it had a common frequently disconnecting issue. So I decided to try TP-Link and hope that it will work better.  This TP-Link adapter is easy to install and works flawlessly.  I am happy about this purchase because of the quality and reasonable price.
5,Very pleased with the usb option much easier than installing a network card. My computer currently sits furthest from the router but no issues with D/U speed or signal strength. The external antenna definitely a plus compared to a network card's antenna hidden behind your computer.
5,I have been using dual bank Linksys AE300 N900  for years. The performance was satisfactory with 90% signal strength across one wall for all my work. I do no gaming. Downloading ISO in particular Linux distros for fun would fail intermittently. Afters switching over to this wireless adapter  I downloaded 2 large distros with no failures.
5,My on-board wifi chip was giving me problems wouldn't connect to the 5G band anymore so I purchased this thing.  Faster than my old chip ever was.  Very pleased.  Only thing missing is bluetooth which you'll have to buy separately  if you need it.
5,get a great signal  transfer  speeds over 30MBPS  connection speed over  585mbps  passing through 4 walls  about 60 feet from router  . worth the money . has not dropped a signal in over 7 days my old adaptor would cut out every few days  this is super stable
5,Used for my PC since I dont really have the space for a wifi chip and it's been working extremely well. Small and easy to put away if I need to move around. Quick to set up. And no real issues. Only complaint is that the wire that connects into it is a little sensitive so it may lose connection if moving too much. Outside of that. Speed is great and doesnt cut out much at all. I use it mainly for gaming and dont run into issues with lag spikes or anything.
5,Bought this for our detached Garage as the built in PC wifi was not that great.  This adaptor gives us a solid connection.  Not sure how it would be for gaming as this was just for general internet in Garage.
5,I had to buy a CD reader to use with my computer so totally ridiculous they don't have an online install utility I searched for it extensively and tried using their generic one which failed.  Otherwise once I installed the driver from CD it worked well.
5,Je suis très satisfait de cet article la réception est nettement améliorée il suffit d'installer le logiciel et choisir le wi-fi 2 chercher ton routeur et inscrire ton mot de passe à nouveau (c'est une nouvelle carte réseau)
5,Great product and gave my Max a new lease of life. Only problem is having to follow the complicated process to allow kernel extensions on the Mac. Great signal strength - from not usable to 20mbps downloads!
5,Very easy to install and gives my older laptop the ability to connect to 5g bought a second one for my desktop. I would recommend this product.
5,Works great for movies etc.It does have some lag. Not sure if I'd use it for gaming.
5,so much faster!connection stable for hours!!good quality usb 3.0 extension cable
5,This replaced a previous dongle that was moving info from the router at a snail's pace. By comparison this adapter brings in the signal at 5 to 10 times the speed of the old one. Very pleased !!
5,For my laptop windows 10 working .In bedroom the Intel wifi ac3168 only 50-90mbs Tp-link can get 150-230mbs.
5,Easy to set up; plug it in and it worked; added better signal for my laptop
5,It provides extended range of wifi for my laptop. Good value!
5,Conectas y listo ya tienes Wifi en tu PC de escritorio
5,Good reception.
5,Good quality
5,Increase my laptop from 2nd floor from 65Mbps to 150Mbps. Would buy again.
5,Reçu hier. Livraison en un jour. Installation super simple. Prise en main rapide et mise en service immédiate. Très bon achat.
5,works fine
5,very fast on 5G
5,Very strong signal. Easy to install with a dedicated disc.
5,great product very easy install
5,very easy to install and great signal!
5,Muy útil
5,Works great
5,Works great on my old desktop in my office that’s on the second floor of our house and a ways from the router
5,easy to install works great
5,Great!
5,Hasta ahora es el mejor adaptador USB wifi que e utilizado. Excelente recpcion de señales 5G y sin latencia notable el cual sufría en juegos en linea con un adaptador wifi usb 2.4Ghz. (en lugares fuera de mi casa que claro- en casa uso red cableada ethernet.)
5,Compré este artículo porque mi lap no detectaba las redes 5GHz. Y la verdad es que desde que instalé lo que el fabricante pide a funcionado de maravilla. Se siente de buena calidad  :)
5,Hata ahora solo un dia me ha presentado irregularidades  pero creo que solo fue por saturacion muy buena señal ... la recomiendo
5,Bought to replace my PC Wi-Fi adapter that failed. This was easy to install & connect. Works great happy with purchase :)
4,works great really like it  never will i do 5 star reviews but this is great either way and works as it should just be aware of one thing even tho its rated for 1300 mbps does not mean its going to connect at that speed your router has to be able to do that speed as well and it will only max at 5ghz connection on the other side as well your incoming speeds also have to be such that you will get actual top speeds here to
