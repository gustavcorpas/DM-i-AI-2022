5,Has came in handy quite a few times. Love the settings I usually use on 2 but all are great depending on the setting or situation you are using for. Not overly loud but personally for me I love the sound of fans so you may think differently!? It is a small fan and def not going to produce a lot of noise anyway. It kicks out Much stronger than one would think. You can feel it across the room (depending on how big of a room lol but still packs a punch) I brought camping and it saved my a$$ lol .. now for the confusion on the whole “there is a light  there is NO light” topic!!! First off anyone saying there is NOT clearly can not read or is just too stupid to want to read! There is not a designated button for the blue lamp to activate. You must be on either 12 or 3 fan setting and you must hold the ‘ON’ button in for Aprox 3 sec! There is also the white light after you hit the 3rd fan option. No you can not have the blue & white going at same time. To achieve the white  cycle through the regular fan cycles past the 3rd and for the blue  simply hold ‘ON’ in for few seconds on either 12 or 3 fan speed setting! Yesss I wrote it twice because I am tired of ignorant people writing reviews when they have no idea what they are talking about! You can run the fan while plugged in which is always a plus and depending on which fan speed you have the rechargeable batt last quite a few hours! Definitely most of the night if not into the morning.  but will die after long conservative use. The Good thing is it charges back up fairly quick or just plug it in while you need it if it is dead. I love the blue light as it is a definite little bonus! For the price it is great.
4,It did it's job perfect size little fan for my desk which i used daily leaving out in the dessert i needed one at all times. It was good until it lasted purchased it on Apr-2021 and just a couple days ago(Aug-2022) it died on me. tried to work with it change battery charging it a full 24-hours before giving up on it but no luck it was good/fun till it lasted :( now i need a new one or i'll melt in my desk lol. if your okay with only last a bit more then a year it's a good product.
4,The fan is what I expected but I thought it had more. I bought a fan very similar to Walmart looks almost the same but was solid black. It had a base that allowed it to swivel up. This looked so similar I thought it did too.  I would recommend buying one with a base that swivels thus if you want to point the fan at your face rather than your hands find something to put it on for elevation or tilt it back against something or put something under the front part of the stand and risk it falling over backward. Oh the batter life is good but wish it was a tad longer (like my Walmart fan)
5,This is the third portable fan I've purchased.  It's the best so far.  Blows a strong breeze.  Has a removable Li battery that charges fast.  Since it's removable it's possible to buy a second battery and extend the usage.  Portable fans are a necessity during summer time blackouts.  It's also bottom heavy so it doesn't tip easily.  The other portable fans I bought were awkward.
4,Mine didn’t work at all unless it’s plugged into the wall period. Given up on trying to charge a device that wouldn’t hold a charge. However works perfectly well while plugged in.
5,I like this portable fan; it does a good job cooling you off and it doesn’t collapse or knock I to my glasses.
5,I bought a pink fan and a black fan for my husband and myself for a trip to Africa. His black one put off so much more air than the pink one. Both looked the same so I’m not sure why.
4,The fan is a good size to take traveling it doesn’t vibrate and not super loud. I like the white noise sound. I use it plugged in all night because the charge doesn’t last all night. So if you want something to use where you don’t have an outlet nearby you may want to look elsewhere. It also doesn’t tilt. A feature I wanted but my fault for not realizing it.
4,Cute little fan pretty powerful.. but it doesn't tilt. That's the only problem I have it.
5,I'm a visiting nurse had one of these in my work bag for about two years getting banged around and generally abused. Use it every day and it's still ticking. Lasts a long time on a charge even on high. Puts out a lot of air for a little guy. Buying another for my small bathroom at home.
5,I like the fan as it is small but it puts out a lot of air.
5,These are great little fans I have a bunch of them. I have one on the kitchen table downstairs where I watch tv in my bowling bag and a couple of spares in case they break which I will add none have. I have seen reviews where people say they aren’t powerful enough that’s crazy I have yet to even have the need to use the highest speed !
4,Perfect size for my desk. Pretty powerful for such a small fan.
5,For a small portable fan this works well. Nice low noise level for those that need a little white noise to help sleep at night when away. Glad I purchased it.
4,The fan is very quiet and has multiple speeds.  It is quite powerful for such a small fan.I did have a small problem with the USB charging port but the customer service was great and they remedied the situation very quickly.
4,Bought for a small portable porch fan and it works perfectly and battery last long enough time. Only problem is despite following instructions the blue light never worked.
5,Love this little fan.  Easy to carry around and very quiet
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 In Sept 2019 I decided to take a road trip out west and converted my Honda Fit into a tiny camper van. Knowing how hot it can get and how humid sleeping in a car can be I knew I had to get a portable fan with decent battery life that would give me some air circulation for a solid six hours as I tend to sleep hot.Specifications:Weight:221 grams light enough to shove into a backpack (though the buttons are easily depressed so it might turn on while being packed up or moved around). As it's so lightweight it's easy to knock over especially in a travelling environment I wish it came with some sort of hook or loop so it could be tied to something to try to stabilize it. The base has two small rubber pads that will keep it from sliding around a desk but won't keep it upright if you bump it.Size:3.5 inches wide by 5.5 inches tall by 1.5 inches deep. It's small enough to slide into a pocket yet large enough to provide a good amount of air flow even with it's small size.Battery:Battery life is approx 6 hours when run on low 4 hours on medium and 2-3 hours on high. Charge time seems to vary depending on what you're charging it with (external battery took about 4 hours to charge wall charger was about 2). The battery used is a generic and replaceable rechargeable 18650 cell which is pretty common in portable rechargeable devices. It uses a microUSB port to charge so you can use your cell phone charger or any generic microUSB cable to charge it. It apparently can run off an external battery on low settings with a dead internal battery but either doesn't charge or very very slowly charges if you keep the fan running while charging.Performance:This little fan can move a surprising volume of air. On it's lowest setting airflow speed is the equivalent to approx 4 mph. Medium 7 mph and on high a nice breeze of around 10 mph. The fan on medium is about as loud as a computer fan that is running hot so it's not silent by any means but I prefer a bit of white noise when I sleep. We have actually used this multiple times to stoke our campfire when wood was a bit wet and hard to light it was very valuable in that moment.Reliability/Longevity:As I've only used this for a couple weeks during my trip I can't speak to the quality of the components used to build it. A frequent issue seen in inexpensive fans is the bearings in the motor going bad. I have knocked this fan around quite a bit crushed it a couple times in my backpack when I dropped it on the ground and knocked it over numerous times. I have yet to hear any imbalance in the fan as of yet but I will update this review if I do.Final Thoughts:If you're looking for a small portable fan that is easily recharged and won't cost you much this is a fantastic investment. I was quite surprised how much air this fan could move when I first turned it on and realized the lowest setting was plenty for me to fall asleep to. Small enough to throw in a purse or backpack yet powerful enough to help cool you down during a 90 degree day I must recommend it if you're looking for an inexpensive portable fan.
4,Very cute and well made portable fan also lights up which is very neat. Great price.
5,I love it and cool me down. The speeds are perfect for me.
5,This is the 3rd fan of this type I’ve bought & I think they’re wonderful. The charge lasts for at least 5 hours - possibly longer I was using it when I was sleeping & couldn’t recall  when I put it on. This was on the lowest setting. I’ve never used setting 3 as I’ve found 1 or 2 to provide enough air for me. It takes a while to charge but that’s because they last such a long time when in use so it’s a great trade-off imo.  Charges using an ordinary USB cable so super convenient no special charger to keep track of. Lightweight & small enough to pack in carry-on or even a handbag. I didn’t find it noisy when sleeping or watching TV. Superb value for money. Perfect for camping for a desk or for sleeping. Really love them will probably purchase again I’m so impressed. My first one has lasted well over a year (maybe 2 I can’t remember) & is still working perfectly & it’s still got the same amount of charge in the battery (unlike my apple products whose batteries seem to die 18 months in)!  I’m a genuine customer and received no compensation for my review
5,The fan is super quiet and works great
5,Works great not noisy very easy to charge. And I use at work so always somewhere to charge if I have to.
5,Easy to charge and still working flawlessly after 3 years!
5,Wishing the base was a bit wider for standing alone but does have powerful fan
5,Love this portable fan. I take it on all my business travel. It helps cool my sleeping space and it’s great for white noise. The purple lighting is just bright enough to see if I need to wake up at night. I purchased for my friends too.
3,A quick review of 3 small travel fans.1. SmartDevil Small Personal USB Desk Fan3 Speeds2. Honeywell HTF090B Turbo on the Go Personal Fan3. The Efluky 3 Speeds Mini Desk Fan Rechargeable Battery Operated FanThe SmartDevil wins in my opinion because it is the most powerful and yet the smallest. It has 3 speeds and for its size has more power than expected. It is shockingly good for its size. Dimensions: 4.7x4.7x1.7. The only negative is the cord is not detachable and 3.9 feet with a USB plug There is no battery power. One other thing. If you use an USB adapter to plug it into a wall socket make sure it is a decent one that delivers enough watts. I used a cheap one and the fan didn’t work. I grabbed an iPhone square and it worked fine.The Efluky fell short in the power department. Just didn’t have enough airflow. It does have 3 speeds it lights up and it has a rechargeable battery. The battery must be installed for corded use. Negative was the lack of airflow and it wasn’t adjustable. 1.4"D x 4.9"W x 5.6"HThe Honeywell really disappointed because I have larger version of this fan and was hoping this smaller version would have similar power to size ratio. Unfortunately it had weak airflow and only has 1 speed. It can run on 4 AA batteries. Was also the largest or bulkiest at 4.7 x 2.3 x 6.4 inches and just overall was a disappointment.
4,I live in an older home with a small bathroom and no vent. This fan is perfect for this space and I don’t have to worry with a cord. I can move it about and it circulates the air so I stay cool when getting ready for the day. It’s also great for sleeping. I put it on my nightstand. It’s very quiet and I get a great nights sleep.
5,Use for sleeping at night
5,I took this little fan on vacation where we had little to no electricity and I LOVED this little fan. When you turn the light on it's so pretty. Would definitely recommend
4,This fan is powerful for its size. Charge does not hold long when the fan is on the highest setting. The charging cable is not long enough in my opinion. The fan itself stays in a stationary position.
4,I like how discreet the fan is but still pretty powerful I really use it to create air flow up the front of my shorts which works great as I can hold it with my knees while working. Highly recommend.
4,Love the fact that this is rechargable and compact.  My only improvement would be to have it tilt so it could be more upward while sitting at a desk.  Other than that it's a great little fan.
5,I use this fan at work.  It's small but string.  It will cool you down quickly.  I'm not sure about battery life.  I usually plug it into a computer or use a portable battery charger.  I tried using it without any of that and It wouldn't start by itself.  Maybe battery is on backwards.  But needless to say I'm fine with how I use it and it's an awsome little fan.
5,I love that this little fam is easy to carry! The noise level is perfect even for church and office meetings. It’s small enough to carry in my bag and easy to recharge! The battery life idle perfect for me because it’s rechargeable!!! Awesome gift for those experiencing hot flashes!!!
5,I keep this beside my bed as I get hot at night. It is perfect! Very quiet. Very powerful I generally keep at lowest speed! I keep it plugged in so haven’t tested charge time. Highly recommended
5,Charge lasts a good amount of time. I use it at work at my desk and it helps cool me off and keep healthy air flow. Place on paper pad to avoid rattling on surfaces. I don't use the light feature but it's a cool feature to have if you're out at night and want to turn some heads with your fancy lighted portable fan.
5,Where has this been all my life?  I never write amazon reviews but I was so impressed with this product that I just had to make an exception...I am a chef/manager so half of my time is spent in a hot kitchen and the other is spent in an almost equally hot office.  I was looking for a USB fan that could give a little respite and I absolutely hit the jackpot with this one!Where do I begin?  On its lowest setting this fan provides a gentle breeze from almost 2 feet away.  It is quieter than most computer fans.  Second setting is something similar to the highest cool setting on the most powerful hairdryer you've ever owned.  A shade louder but completely unobtrusive and still easily felt from 2-2 1/2 feet away.  The third setting is more powerful than some regular fans that I have owned and still pretty quiet at that.It is charged via USB and it uses the same lithium ion battery that is found is most e-cigarette vape mods.  In a pinch you could take the battery out of your vape and use it to power this fan.  Plugged into a USB charger/port it charges whatever battery is inside it.  So if for whatever reason... if you wanted you could conceivably stealth charge your vape battery.  Plugged into a USB port the fan also works without any battery installed at all.  You can also take this battery and put it in your vape battery charger if you have one and charge it that way.A fourth click on the "on" button turns off the fan and activates an LED light on the side.  It isn't as bright as the one on most smart phones these days but I could see it being useful in certain situations.At any power setting if you hold down the "on" button for 4 seconds an LED illuminates the blades in the center of the fan.  It is a cool looking effect though I wouldn't personally use it unless it was plugged in as it would just put additional drain on the battery.Finally it is a nice compact size.  That is perhaps is the most impressive part especially considering how much power it has!  I have included a picture of it in my hand.  Admittedly my hands are a little on the large side but it would still slip easily into a laptop case or perhaps a purse.  It is only about an inch and a half thick.If you're looking for a small USB/battery powered fan you should get one!  It's FANtastic! :)
4,It only works while it connected now
4,This need to be charged often
5,I used the  fan when  i have a  local power outage especially at night.
4,Got this fan was going to return it because the fan is not angle able order another model and it could angel but it was not chargeable where this one you can charge it or run it on cord it's super quiet good air flow and I'm not sweltering at the counter.  3 speed levels never had to use med or fast it moves air well. Very pleased.
5,I bought this little fan because it's "cruise approved." It's great! It kicks out an amazing amount of air. It was nice to have a light on it too. I used it so I wouldn't wake my roomie in the middle of the night.Since I've been home I take it with me to work in the garden. The battery lasts a surprisingly long time. I only charged it once on my 7-day cruise and I used it every night.  I even bought my dad one for Father's Day and he loves it too. There is just a little bit of noise to it but not bad at all. Sounds like any other fan you'd buy. Great product!
5,Sometimes too strong on the lowest setting. I put it farther away and seems better. Perfect for my office.
5,Good speed cool lights great for the office or even bathroom.
5,All in all this fan is amazing! Really my only complain is that the capability to recharge that fan isn't possible by just plugging the USB into a standard block and then into the wall. It must have the battery as well. I'm not sure if I'm explaining this well enough to understand what I im talking about.
3,I loved my fan but to charge it became impossible since the charging unit that the cord plugs into dropped out leaving no other way to charge and no way to put a regular battery or anything like that into it. It lasted for almost two months. When I went to return it I missed the return date by the few days. Loved it but sadly it was poorly made.
4,I use this fan at my desk at work and my only criticism is it is not position adjustable. It is however strong enough and gets the job done
4,Doesn't swivelI put battery in and it didn't charge so it has to be used plug in with its USB cord. I'm disappointed
4,I wish the low medium settings were a bit quieter personally. The battery can be swapped which is great since that's my only real complaint. A minor complaint on that note and more so since I go everywhere with at least one power bank.Unlike other portable mini fans this one does have a separate OFF button so you can quickly shut it off without cycling through each speed.  Also unlike other portable mini fans this one doesn't have a handle or a hook so you would have to hold it while walking or traveling or example. Despite that it's very powerful for its size and is also pretty durable.
5,OK you have the backup generator to power the fridge and a small window AC unit when a hurricane kills the utility power.  Since it is NOT advised to use any generator when raining you will have to or should wait until the big blow passes before you can power up these two "necessities" and wait until utility power is restored.  Could be minutes or more likely MANY MANY HOURS to restore power.  Candles and flashlights will let you see the flood of sweat running down your forehead for the lack of any AC or other fan while you patiently wait for relief to get your generator up and running.  This did happen several years ago with hurricane Matthew and I was sweltering until I could safely get my generator running.  The folded paper fan was a constant chore but HAD to have moving air in the still Florida summer.  SO with this hurricane season I was skeptical about this 15 dollar fan providing any relief by moving some air....  I ordered my first fan to check it out and after testing airflow and runtime I was amazed at the performance of this fan both with very quiet airflow and long battery life.  Using an 18650  battery (NONE of this AA or AAA battery CRAP) provided just under two hours at high speed and my low speed test today provided 7 hours of a gentle breeze enuf to keep your cool while waiting to get the generator running when needed. (did not test medium speed).  I scurried back on Amazon and ordered a SECOND fan.  The first fan was to keep MY cool and in trying to be totally prepared the second fan will be used for generator cool down if/when an oil change may be required (and ME TOO).  The two hour runtime on high should be long enuf to let the gen cool to a workable temperature during an oil change in hopefully 10 to 15 minutes and resume the fridge and window AC operation on generator power.  The supplied battery seems of good quality with my smart charger indicating over 2000 mA of battery capacity after charging.  Having a few spare charged 18650's in reserve will provide moving air until you can fire up your generator.  I TOTALLY RECOMMEND this fan to help you keep your cool when all other power is unavailable....
5,Love this mini portable fan! Perfect for indoors or travel and has a flashlight and a LED light built in.  I've tried all three speeds and the air flow capability is great for me.  The fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery and a USB cable is a plus.  Very pleased with the purchase.
5,This little fan is so cute for my work desk! comes with battery and a charger! has 3 different settings and any setting is very pleasant!
5,I took this fan on a 7 day cruise and it was perfect .Fit awesome on the carnival mardi gra bed side table stand
5,Thisbfan sis uper powerful and easy to transport. Will be getting a couple more.
4,Awesome fan but I think I got a faulty one because it will not hold a charge once you unplug from charger. So I have to keep it plugged it in order for it to work. Works great at least.
3,Returning fan it's not as good as the ones that's half the price nor is it adjustable to make it higher or lower. Bought this fan for air to blow on my dog on while she lays on the bed air blows maybe 2 feet but can't adjust it to make air blow a little higher...paying double for a battery I won't use...I can get to of the other fans...
5,This fan puts out a great gust of air at level 3.  I bought it for an upcoming cruise and my 14 year old son wanted it for his computer desk so I ordered another. I love the blue light (why I ordered this one) and it is quick to cool me when I am hot even with the ceiling fan. We both are happy with this fan.
5,Love this little fan! We can't plug in fans at work so I have it sitting on my desktop for when I get a little hot at work. I use it maybe an hour each day and have only charged it once in the month I have had it.
5,The battery that it uses is proprietary but surprisingly I've had it for over 3 years now and it is still working great. It still holds a charge for several hours and if you want you can even have it plugged in and continue to use it. I would recommend.
5,Love love LOVE this little fan! It's just perfect for a little fan to put in front of me if I just need some extra cooling. I think the 3 speeds are great and I like that it actually has an off button as opposed to just hitting the on button multiple times to turn off. There's a light too but I don't need that. Battery life is pretty great not very noisy either. Easy to carry around. I came to my review section just so I could rave about this!
5,Wasn’t expecting it to blow my contacts dry. It’s powerful for a little fan. Definitely recommend
5,This turned out to be a favorite for me since I hate stagnant air! I've used it desk top piano top and night stand top for sleeping!I can keep it on slow speed so it doesn't disturb anyone around me! I'll have it running all night and charge it usb in the morning! It seems pretty durable since I already dropped it from my desk to a wooden floor! (I wouldn't recommend doing that since it is a plastic housing!) But especially for the price and since it's summer here in Phoenix I have a use for it as long as it keeps working for me! And it's extremely portable!
5,This efluky 3 Speeds Mini Desk Fan works great for power outages or if you need to extra air for you or your pet. I have a couple that I keep charged up in case of a power outage for my fur babies.
5,Great
5,Used on a cruise and it was perfect the speeds are nice
5,I actually got this for my boyfriend to use during bowling tournaments. He mostly uses it to dry his hand or glue his fingers if they open up. Very small and compact which is what he was looking for. Noise is minimal.
5,My fan just died. I’ve used it less than three hours.
5,I have bought other cheap fans and they don't compare to this one. For the size it blows a lot of air. Battery life is good too
5,Everyone at my work is jealous
5,This fan packs a punch! It's a handy portable fan that lasts for quite a while.It's no big square fan but for the size it's great.Pros:- Portable- 24 hour battery life (if on the entire time)- Quick charge I say it took about 1.5 hours to charge)Could be considered cons:- It's tiny (kind of what you sign up for though imo)- Press the power off button to turn off..... You may think that's a stupid comment (it kind of is) BUT I didn't notice there was a power off button until my fan died after I thought I turned it off... LOL
5,I have tried many small fans and this one seems to work the best. I recommend getting a name brand 18650 battery from another side like illumn. Illumn sell legit batteries you can't get batteries on Amazon so the only ones here are fakes and scams. Get 2 Sanyo 18650s or any Efest or KeepPower 18650 from illumn. Great fan!
5,This fan works well for the following:Air travel (lasted 6 hours on a flight)Mass transit in summerLong bus ridesAmusement parksDesk fanDrying small items in a hotel roomHelps to sleep at night in hotel roomCooling off after a workoutUse while sitting on the beachCamping fanWe have 3 fans and all are excellent products.
5,I use the 18650 batteries already with my flashlights so this is a no brainer I can bring an extra battery and run on high then change out batteries because it does run the battery down on high. On medium there is plenty of air for a warm day and will run a long time so you don't need an extra battery. I plug this fan into usb and run on my desk so you don't use battery power but this fan is so small you can bring it anywhere and has amazing power when it's hot !
5,I bought this because I’m always on the go  with a baby and a 5 year old. Plus my family likes to get together often especially in the summer. The 3 speeds are amazing and aren’t too noisy. It’s compact enough that I can put it in a side pocket in the diaper bag. I’ve only had it a couple days so far but I enjoyed it so much I bought two more for my mom and brother who get hot easily.
5,Fan is lightweight and holds battery life all night with full charge.
5,I don't know what TOOK me so long to buy this fan! OH MY GOD!  I've read about taking this fan on a cruise and couldn't understand WHY and now I KNOW why! I haven't gone on my cruise yet but I'm taking it to be sure! Right now I'm using it at home in my bedroom but it is WONDERFUL AND IT'S SO QUIET! It's true that it's SO compact! I wasn't expecting it to be SO small yet SO POWERFUL! I have it plugged into my clock via the USB and inserted the round battery that was included with the fan. You will not regret this purchase!! If you hit the switch 4 times it becomes a flashlight too! When you have the fan in the off position the "green" light serves as a night light. When your fan is "on" the light is "red."
5,The sound is wonderful
5,Loved how you can choose whether or not to use the blue and/or white light on the fan.  I've had other fans that I've had to put duct tape over the light because the light shines right in my eyes while trying to sleep.  But on this fan I can turn the lights off while running the fan.  One minor problem...since the fan is narrow from front to back it tends to be a bit tippy but its not a big problem.
5,This little fan is great. It has a lot of cooling power for such a small fan. I love that it is rechargeable so it can be used anywhere. I keep it with me all the time. It holds its charge for hours even with constant use at max speed. Definitely recommended.
3,It's a great little fan quiet lots of air movement for the size love the white or blue light.  However since the first time I charged it up it won't work if not plugged in!  That kind of defeats the purpose I bought it for.  Great for areas where you have a USB spot to plug it in but that's not what I needed it for.  If you can keep it plugged in it's terrific.
5,I use this in my truck to circulate air when sitting on my job when get to keep mr cooled i put away nad use my portable cooler it it gets to the point my cooler doesn’t keep me cool i use this along side of the cooler to put out more volume of air.
4,Great fan only wish that it would be able to tilt up and down.
5,I REALLY like this fan. I got it to help cool me off when my HOT FLASHES come at work. I have it on my desk and Boy does it work. I recommended it to one of my coworkers and she really likes hers also.I like that I can still use it while it's charging and that it has a light on the side. This was a great purchase.
5,i love this little fan it is a very good fan!!! i work from home at my desk 9-5 monday thru friday while im on zoom or a phone call they cannot hear it witch is great being that my office is away from my ac it helps sooo much more! i also take it with me while my son and i walk its perfect for hot days to cool down i bought one and month later bought 3 more!! being they are very convenient and portable literally take it any were you go!! soo if ur wondering if you should buy reading the reveiws thinking they are paid reviews while im not paid and this is the best fan ive had in years!!!!
4,The fan is just like you'd expect from the description and I like it hence the four stars. I was looking for something affordable to cool me down during the summer that had multiple settings wasn't going to be too loud and could fit in the corner of my desk so fortunately I found this little guy. To be honest though the portability/cordless option of this particular fan was the real selling point for me.Since the great points of this fan have already been listed out by other reviewers and the description page here are a few of my trivial gripes:The cord is only 3 feet and comes only with a USB-end so you'd have to plug it into your laptop or buy/use some other wall-adapter. One full charge takes 5 hours and if you're like me its a bit of an annoyance to have to plug something into your laptop/computer for five straight hours just because your outlets don't have USB ports. Besides I like to move around the house when studying so it's a minor annoyance to keep having to re-position the cord. As for the sound I don't really have a problem with it because I'd rather listen to something as ambient noise than roast in my tight bedroom. Really though Mode 1 is fairly easy to ignore. Mode 2 though gets significantly louder which may be enough to break focus on whatever you're doing. Lastly there really isn't a difference between Mode 2 and Mode 3. I hear no difference in sound or an imperceptible one which gets me to my last gripe. It seems the last two modes are exactly the same in intensity so I don't see why there are three modes at all.One note what I realized after getting the fan is that I didn't consider the angle at which the air is shot there is simply no way to adjust the angle. If this feature was included in this fan it would have been amazing! Instead if I want to direct the fan elsewhere I'd have to stack books or some knickknack. Personally I think a great product is one that's standalone and doesn't require any other purchase to function. This fan does meet that but there's also a lot of areas to improve upon.All in all would I still buy it? Affordable effective and portable(!?). Yeah probably.
3,I was expecting the battery to last on a full charge for longer. I keep it on the lowest setting and it does not last more than a couple of hours and takes a long time to charge again. Little disappointed with that aspect however it is quiet and small
3,Each time I turn it on it goes off and it is fully charged; so I have to keep turning it back on sometimes it will run for awhile but then it goes back to shutting off on its own. I am not sure if it has something to do with the battery 🤔 I will be returning it. I must say though with all of that it is very quiet and easy to carry around with you.
5,This little fan packs a powerful blast of cool air. The batterywill last for at least 8 hour of continue non stop use. I love it.
3,I ordered this little fan and it looks very cool and runs quiet. The problem is that the battery would not charge. I left it plugged several hours but it would only run plugged into the outlet. Then I let it charge overnight but same...  as soon as I unplugged it it stopped working. I returned it but will give it one more try. Ordering another one today because I'd like to have it on my patio to keep away mosquitos when we are out enjoying the sun or a meal. Fingers crossed the next one works and I will edit this review.
5,Seems to be good quality unlike others I've tried. Battery lasts all night on low speed and noise level is low. Liked it so much I bought a second one to keep at the kitchen sink. Blue LED is a neat feature.
5,Super little travel fan! Powerful! So glad I got it
5,My nephew doesn't have a/c amd he says it blows from quite a distance.  (He also has another fan a box fan in his room)
5,This is a very powerful fan for its size. The only issue I have with the fan is that it does not sit flat it leans forward a little bit.
5,This little fan has multiple applications for me; cooling me in hot temperatures (in an easy chair or in my office or nighttime in bed) or in the speeding of drying wet hand or bath towels on the towel bar to name a few applications.  These fans are quiet enough to sleep with and quiet enough to carry on a conversation while in the living room.  I have several of these fans so one is ready if another needs charging.  One charge will last 6-8 hours on low speed which I select most of the time.
5,I'm using it by my desktop computer. I am amazed at how powerful  it is. It keeps me cool. The best thing is that it is battery operated so when we have a power failure it still works.
5,I love this little fan!! Bought it over a year ago and carry it everywhere. Retreats ball parks and I use it around the house all the time. The battery life is very good and it really puts out the air. I recommend this fan
5,This heat at work is so bad and this little fan is a life saver. I love it.
5,I bought this to use at work. I work in a restaurant and I have to go back and forth from the counter to the kitchen. This little fan is pretty powerful for how small it it and cools me down with in minutes of standing in front of it. The battery only lasted about 4 hours on high but I'm able to plug it in where I have it at so not a big deal for me. Would definitely buy again.
5,My husband's hands get sweaty when he bowls.  Wet fingers/thumb affect his bowling.  He can hold this in his hand while waiting to bowl.  It's quiet.  It's also a perfect size for his hand.
5,I love this fan! I actually have 2 of them. I have one on my desk at work and one at home. It has 3 speeds and I rarely need to turn it up past the first speed when it’s on my desk bc I put it in front of me just below my computer monitor. It is a quiet fan to use at work if you are curious about the noise. I work in an open office with cubicles where you can hear people chew their food from over the wall (thank goodness for earplugs!) and others can’t hear the fan when it’s on low. On high it’s not much louder either though. The battery life is amazing. When I’m a little warm in bed at night I put it on my nightstand & it lasts all night on a single charge. You can also plug it in to charge & it still works while charging. My fan at home has been to a lot of places with me including out to dinner and the grocery store. I live in Southern Arizona so saying it gets warm here is an understatement. If I’m hot at dinner I just put it on the table in front of me & it’s hardly noticeable bc it’s so small and slim. In the grocery store I can sit it on top of my stuff in the cart in front of me. You just have to be careful carrying it around in a purse or bag bc you can accidentally push the buttons and turn it on. I got my first fan about 6 months ago then ordered my 2nd one plus one for my sister as well. I did a lot of research by the way before making my purchase & I am incredibly happy with my decision. I have coworkers who bought different fans from Amazon & we all agree mine is better - quieter 3 speeds rechargeable small & portable long lasting battery life. It’s right up there with the love I have for my Shark robo vacuum lol! No regrets! By the way they have good customer service too. One of the fans I ordered didn’t work when I got it & I returned it with no problem.
5,I got this little mini fan for my desk at work and it works amazing!!!!! The three speeds help control how cool I am and is very powerful.It’s very strong when it comes to accidentally dropping it no scratches and still work amazingly!!!
5,Great fan. I use it at my desk at work. I don’t have to charge it often and it charges quickly.
5,Looking forward to using on my next inside cabin cruise.
5,Although I thought this fan would be bigger than what it was it’s very powerful and portable!
3,This fan is so cute.  The colors are lovely the LED works and is a pretty purple and it has a working flashlight.  I will say I didn't know I would not be able to charge it with the USB and then use it unplugged.  But thats my fault for not reading up on it. Also it says the battery is rechargeable but not where you can get the charger.  The battery is purple with no markings so I have no idea what would charge it
5,I took this on a trip. I needed the air flow and a little white noise. This fit the bill. Great price for this. I can not rate the battery since I kept it plugged into a usb outlet near the bed the whole trip.
5,Cools pretty good for a small fan. Great for traveling.
5,The media could not be loaded.
3,Very small not a very big wind footprint.  Mostly had it plugged in so not sure on battery life.  It is ok for a cubicle but not sure on an actual office
4,The fan is nice and cute however I don't like where the light is placed. I don't know what I was expecting with the light but it's not going to be beneficial for me. Another thing I didn't like was how hard it is to plug in the charger. I'm not sure of the battery life since there wasn't an indicator of when it's done charging so I kinda just wing it. I don't see it lasting long for me due to the USB port.
5,I charge this fan up and get over 8 hours on it on the 2nd setting. Working as a cashier with a mask on it blows cool air right through the mask giving me a much needed cooling experience. Plus it has a light on it!!!!
3,My battery won't charge. Other than that I love it
5,What a pleasant surprise that such a small fan can be so powerful! It actually blows cold air. The first speed is pretty strong and quiet so I use that at night. I'll use either the low or medium speed when I'm at my desk and both are strong enough to blow my hair. I took away one star for noise because it does get louder with increased speed which I would expect but it would be nice if the higher speeds were a bit softer. That being said it does not work with the battery alone; it needs to be charged with the enclosed USB cable. Once that has been drained it needs to be charged again; the battery will not sustain it. It's summer now and I haven't lost power since I bought it but if I do I know I'll be thrilled that I have it (unless the power loss lasts longer than the charge then I'm out of luck. LOL. I don't know how long it would take to charge in the car). I didn't rate battery life since it does not run on the battery alone and I don't know if the enclosed battery will need replacing. I absolutely recommend this fan.This is an update. I've used the fan for a few weeks now and  have discovered that the battery holds a charge for a long time. In other words the battery does not drain when the fan in not in use.
5,Just what I wanted.  Easy to use puts out just the right amount of a breeze and looks great!
5,This is a great little fan that keeps a charge due to a pretty good battery! I mainly use the first setting out of three speeds which is so much more quiet than other mini fans I have owned.
3,Battery life doesn't last as advertised even when fully charged.
4,So much quieter than my current room fan!  Also love that it is rechargeable and portable and I can charge my phone off of it.  I just got it today so I haven't tested the longevity yet but it charged pretty quickly.  It could have used a little kickstand so that it could be angled but I would definitely recommend it.UPDATE:  The more I use this the more I love it!  Depending on what I'm doing I either leave it plugged in my laptop or run it off the battery.  I have not timed how long the battery lasts as I usually fall asleep.  It's very quiet and even on the lowest speed it moves a lot of air.  My other fan was disturbing to others when I had a Zoom call; this one isn't even noticed.  Ladies it is also great for those of us experiencing our personal Heat Surges.  It goes where I go.
5,The battery lasts for about 5 hours so it's not too bad but it would be nice if it lasted longer you got to let it charge for a couple of hours to get to full charge but the air that comes from it is really really nice and it helps keep you cool
5,Excelente producto lo llevé a mi viaje a cuba y la verdad no pensé duraría tanto la batería y el aire que echa es bien aceptable Gracias Amazon
5,I bought this for bowling to keep cool. I’ve used it 3 times so far on one charge. The noise is low so if you want it for a sleep aid it might not help. I would 100% buy this again.
5,This little fan has so much power and is great for me
5,Surprisingly powerful for such a little fan . Charging time from drained to full isn’t to bad . Love that it’s USB  and the extra little features are nice as well. I mostly have it on low and it really does feel like a little air conditioner on you . Glad I gave it a chance . Won’t be disappointed
5,Love this fan this fan has been to Puerto Rico and Cancun with me it’s a little powerhouse I’m a seasoned woman who experiences hot 🥵 flashes at night and this fan is awesome very quiet and the breeze is AMAZING!!!
5,Love this little fan. Love everything about it.Have three. It’s small portable and pushes out lots of air. You won’t be disappointed.
5,Took this on my norwegian dawn cruise I absolutely loved having this as I always sleep with a fan at home. This thing had me sleeping like a loud snoring baby
5,Better than sliced bread!  Moves a lot of air and stays charged for a long time!
5,I highly recommend this for anyone who works in an office and is ALWAYS hot like me.  It's quiet and keeps my temperature down. It's day one so I can't say how well the battery life is but I plugged it in my computer so it won't die on me.
5,This fan is so good. Love it.
5,I bought this fan for my desk at work. It's great! You can charge it by USB or plug it into an electrical outlet with an adapter. It's quiet and puts off the right amount of air. I only seem to need the lowest setting. The light is a nice addition also.
5,I absolutely love this fan! I bought this in October 2018 so almost 4 years ago and it's still going strong. It's my work fan and I just leave it plugged into the USB. It has 3 speeds and it's honestly not that noisy for a fan. Highly recommend!!
5,Powerful little fan. Great for the office. Very quiet.
4,The battery life is short and doesn’t last long at all
5,Perfect for what I needed it for
5,Small but perfect for what we needed.
5,I got this little fan for work. It is quiet but powerful. I am going to get another to use at home.
5,Great quality it is rechargeable.
5,This is the best little fan ever. It's perfect at work in an office not loud at all. Even took it tent camping worked great for night time sweats. 😃
5,I liked this fan for my personal needs. Has a rechargeable battery and even when I’ve dropped it several times!!!
5,So far it’s a  good little fan It puts out a good air flow. I’m actually impressed.As far as battery life I’m not disappointed.
5,I've been buying these little fans for more than 5 years now and these are still the best ones I've come across.  Beware other brands sell similar (identical?) looking fans BUT the efluky version puts out far more air than the others.  Notably the Opolar version of these puts out about 1/3rd as much air despite looking identical.  I've bought a lot of Opolar fans and like them but their version of this little fan is a disappointment.My original 2 efluky fans are still going strong despite being used pretty heavily.  They've been all around the world kept me cool after hurricanes in cheap hotels in nice hotels in planes in the hangar and at theme parks.The only downside I can come up with is they're not meant to be cleaned.  I've not found a way to pop the grill off to clean the blades but I've just used compressed air and it's good enough.
5,I love this fan! I've been using this on my nightstand when I wake up with a hot flash or night sweats and on my make-up table after I dry my hair. It's really compact in size but gives a good amount of air.  When I have it at arms length away on my nightstand pointing at my face at the lowest setting not only can I feel plenty of air but it's quiet enough not to wake my husband. You can definitely hear it but it doesn't keep me awake either. If you keep pushing the button you'll increase the air flow and even get to the flashlight mode for the little light bulb on the side of the fan.  This will be great for tent camping or traveling when hotel air systems are not always the best.  The USB cord is convenient too I like being able to plug it into my iPhone charger but I could also charge it in my car for tent camping or a day in the hot sun at the beach. There's an charging indicator light which comes on when you turn it on (red once used a bit) and green when it's fully charged.  I don't run it all night I just turn it on to cool me down during a hot flash episode.  I haven't had to use it at a setting higher than the lowest one at night so it's pretty effective.  I might buy one for my office too.  For other ladies with hot flashes and night sweats I'd also recommend Cool Jams Night gowns (quick dry so good for travel hand washing too) The WoneNice Mini USB Bladeless Fan Chargeable (IPhone sized USB rechargeable fan you can keep in your purse and comes in cute colors).  I wouldn't recommend DreamFit Quilted Tencel Degree 6 sheet set. It feels nice stays on an adjustable bed really well but the flat sheet is doubled and is too warm for me.
5,Best portable fan I've ever used.  I have extra 18650 batteries.  Works for hours on one charge.  Strong wind for how small it is.  Done with the big ones that take D batteries.
3,I should have paid attention to the details. This fan does not swivel up and down. Its one solid fan. Also I really wanted a fan that had the USB already connected since that's the first thing that messed up on my last fan.I haven't taken it to work and used it yet. I may not have a problem with it.  I will update with my likes and dislikes once I check it out.
5,Lasts a good 8+ hours and blows really well.  Provides good relief for such a small fan.
5,Good all around
5,Strong little fan. Battery life is decent. Dropped several times in the 2+ years I've owned it. Still works fine. A decent battery life. Makes noise but not overwhelming.  The one I have still works but I lost the battery cover somehow on my last trip. I've taken it with me on many trips with no problems.
4,The fan puts out a lot of air and is pretty quiet the reason I'm giving it four stars instead of 5 is because:- after using it I've learned the on/off buttons are really sensitive and I've had it turn on in my backpack and be dead when I take it out- There is no battery indicator to let you know your about to run out of juice- when plugged into USB the fan can either run or charge you can't charge it while using it.don't let me my problems deter you from getting this fan if you need a portable fan or your worried about one not being powerful enough then I recommend getting this fanPro's- Powerful: I rarely go past the first level because it pushes a lot of air- Quiet: we aren't talking whisper quiet but low hum quiet- USB chargeableCons- Can't charge and use at the same time- no built-in in stand to tilt it or hang it- buttons are sensitive can turn on when in a backpack or suitcase. I reccomend keeping the battery separate until your ready to useLast note: I can not tell you how long it last I've had it last 8-10 between charges I've had it last 4 hours. the disparity is probably due to it turning on in my backpack and draining itself.
5,The fan worked wonderfully. Used the fan at night and recharged during the day.  Worked perfectly!
4,This little fan is great. It has multiple speeds and can run on a battery and charge the battery while plugged in. However you do not NEED to use a battery. I travel with the fan and I don't bother with the battery since you aren't supposed to keep lithium batteries in your luggage. It even has a built in flashlight! As a fan it has three speeds starting with the slowest which is nice. It is reasonably quiet moreso than most small fans I have tried and it is very light. That may be the only problem - it is so light that it might walk a bit if the power cord doesn't have enough slack the surface it is on is slick or if the fan is on high. I guess it would be nice if you could aim it up or down a bit but I have never found that to be an insurmountable problem.EDIT: 18 months later the fan has broken. Actually the fan is fine and it works with a charged battery however it no longer works when plugged into a USB cord. It can neither charge nor run without a battery. The problem is that the female USB socket got bent out of shape and/or pulled away from the circuit board. I might still be able to repair it but I'll probably just buy another one. It is cheap and quiet and light and I took it on more than a dozen trips so it was banged around a bit.
5,I have now purchased 3 of these one for my work desk and 2 for my home desks. I works well and is quite so it doesn't effect my phone calls
5,Bought this to take on an upcoming cruise.  Wanted something small and quiet.  This is just right!  Flat and will fit great in a suitcase or my carry on. Nice breeze on even low speed and didn't sound very loud at all on the high speed in a quiet house.
4,My only complaint is the battery doesn't last as long as I hoped. Probably an hour or so. But you can use it while it's recharging so if you had a portable charger you could still technically use this as a portable while still charging it. I mean it's a cheap fan.. they aren't going to put a top of the line battery into it. I would absolutely purchase again
5,Nice little fan and price was right. I wanted a small little desk fan to use to have beside my computer while I do telehealth video with clients. This was helpful when the temps got a little too warm. Battery life good and noise level not loud but you can hear it thru the mic. No big deal tho. It’s subtle and not near my microphone. I do recommend this buy if you want something small and does the job.
5,*Update*Over 3 years later and I still use this fan. I have one at the office and one by my bed that I use for home/travel. I have given several of these away as gifts and each was loved.The box still holds up and I sent instructions to them on how I cut the box to make it work and they did and loved it.I cut the main hole with a flap so that it is closed when the fan is in the box for travel but when the fan is removed I place it in the slot and it's held upright. I reinforced the flap with tape so that it remains sturdy and doesn't tear. I cut a hole on each side that lines up with the fan's charging port: one hole for when the fan is in stored in the box and one hole for when it is in the slot. This allows for the usb cable to be connected to the fan in either position to be charging.The fan has been wonderful for travel as it puts out a whole lot more air than you think. I've used in the backseat of cars without a back vent; in lines at amusement parks in the summer; at work in the office; on a cruise (where the airflow in the room was very stuffy) and countless nights at hotels on night stands.It's very highly recommended.---So much better than I expected. I've only had it for a little while but used it on a two day camp. The three speed options are great. I used a large USB power bank to let it run overnight. I don't know how long it would have ran on the charge. Just a note when it's plugged in the highest speed is slightly reduced compared to running off battery.I used the box to cut a hold to use as a stand as it has a narrow base as I use this for my tent and wanted to ensure it doesn't get knocked over.
5,The noise level was very low. Battery life is good for several hours and the portability is excellent.
3,Kept it for a few weeks then it started making some funny noises so I returned it.
4,Died after 3+ years. Not too shabby for a $6 purchase.
5,Great outside here in Florida where it’s hot and humid this fan keeps me and my dog nice and cool. So quiet and the battery lasts for 10-12  hrs
3,I loved this fan for the cruise that I went on but now it no longer works.  The battery will not keep a charge.  I want to replace it but not sure if it is worth it.
5,Lasted about 1 hour from the battery power.
4,Moves a ton of air without a lot of noise.  3 speed settings make it a nice way to cool off.  Battery lasts a little over an hour on high when not plugged in.  Wish the fan could rotate upwards while sitting on my desk but I bought it because it had a rechargeable battery pack so I got what I needed.
5,This little thing blows lots of air for being so tiny. I use it at work and it’s ultra quiet.
5,For a little fan it really packs a punch!!  I wanted to purchase a small portable fan that would keep me cool both in and out of the house.  Lately I have been spending a lot of my time out by the pool reading and writing.  The weather is just awful very hot and humid.  When I came across this fan I thought it would be perfect to keep me cool when I sit outside and it does a great job. I can at least sit outside without having to go in after 10 minutes.  It is also very stylish and the colors match my bistro set as well.The fan comes with a rechargeable battery that can hold a charge for several hours with continuous use.  It does not take long to charge it back up either within 30 minutes it is fully recharged.  There are 3 speeds 1 is the lowest 2 is medium and 3 is the highest.  Even when I use it at the lowest setting it does keep me cool.  When I sit outside in the heat I at least feel comfortable with this fan blowing on me. For plastic blades I am impressed.  The fan’s motor is not too loud I can still hear the waterfall over the noise and be able to hold a phone conversation as well.Very happy with this purchase and will be purchasing a few more for the pool area.  I first wanted to get one just too see if it would work well.  This is a fan that I would recommend to anyone that is interested in purchasing it.  Works great!
5,I like everything
5,For something so small it produces a big breeze!!
5,i have tried alot of fans for work and this is definitely the best one so far. I would buy it again in a heart beat.  I am a nurse and it gets very hot in some of the facilities I work in. I would not survive without a fan and i have had many but this one is perfect. The airflow is amazing. its strong and u can feel it great. i love the size because i can throw it in my work bag and put it on the medcart while im working or on the desk while im charting its very portable. It is very easy to charge and the battery life is pretty good as well. i dont have much use for the light on the side but its a pretty cool feature as well. I recommend this fan 110%
5,Holy crap this little thing is powerful!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  It's light weight holds a charge for a good 8 hours and doesn't make a ton of noise.  Loudest on hit's highest setting obviously but still pretty quiet in my opinion.  Worth every cent.  :)
2,This little fan was great - quiet portable worked well... but in less that 2 months the USB port on the fan broke so it can't be charged or plugged in anymore at all. The fan was used almost daily so needed to be charged almost daily but we're not rough with our electronics. I was shocked by how quickly this componant wore out.
5,This fan is a strong little one!! It does what it is suppose to do no disappointment!! Battery life not that long but a portable battery pack will fix the problem! I love it!!!
5,I liked the color. Easy to charge operate and serves the purpose I purchased it for. When on high the battery does run out a lil faster but has enough power to cool me off in a hot setting.
5,I use this fan mostly everywhere. I take it to work. On hi my cowork get cold!!!
2,The product itself is great. HOWEVER... definitely either got a used product or the Quality Check person left a lot of dust and LONG HAIR strands wrapped on the fan blade. I have a fade definitely not my own hair. I tested it out and initially thought "Wow this picks up a lot of dust already" on closer inspection... there was not only dust but hair stuck inside of the blade. One of the sealing rings that goes into the back of the motor is also off causing it to make a slight rattle sound. It did come repackage and with a QC sticker on it which makes me think they just slapped this back together for appearances but I don't know how they missed this.
5,I have two of these at work. I work in several different areas throughout the week so I keep one on each side of the establishment
5,I bought for work . And I love it. Fully charged it works about 7 hours.And it's pretty powerful.
5,This is my 3rd one love this fan/brand. Worth getting!
5,This fan has been a life-saver for me! I purchased my first one 2 1/2 years ago. I'm super hot-natured so I use this fan year-round. It's perfect for my office because it's small enough to set on my desk without having to rearrange everything else on my desk. It's also extremely quiet so it doesn't bother my co-workers. People who come in my office don't even know it's on! This is a small fan but it pushes out A LOT of air even on the lowest setting! I had to replace mine this week but it was totally my fault. When I plugged the cord into the fan to charge it I accidentally bent the little metal piece that the cord plugs into inside the fan. I've plugged it in hundreds of times over the past 2 1/2 years with no problem whatsoever. I was just in a hurry this time and wasn't paying attention. I probably could have fixed it but instead of doing it carefully I jammed a large screwdriver down into it to try to straighten the metal piece but that only made it worse. Yes I cried. I ordered a new one within an hour of breaking it. I'm happy to say that even after all this time the new one I received is exactly like my old one. I hate when products are changed (not always for the better). Finally you can't beat the price! I would have paid so much more to replace mine but I'm thrilled that I didn't have to. You won't regret buying this fan!
5,**UPDATE AT END**I bought this portable fan under the impression that I could take it with me after charging the battery. I plugged it into the computer and it worked immediately. I left it charging over night but when I disconnected it from the charging cord it did not work. No reaction whatsoever. Not even the little red light that means it needs to be charged. I gave it an extra star because when it was connected to the computer it worked good on all three speeds and the light was pretty cool too.  Sure wish it worked as "portable" - will be returning it to look for other options.**update:  was immediately contacted by seller’s customer service after posting initial review. They offered to send me a new fan and it was received within a couple of days. This one works!! It had a bit of a charge right out of the box and after charging it overnight I took it to the bowling alley did league night (initial intended use) and we kept it on medium the entire duration of league night and it worked great. In fact we lowered it to slowest setting after a while. It kept the air circulating throughout the evening which helped to keep our area cool. The light-up fan blades was cute too :). I am going to use it over the weekend without re-charging it to see how long it will go on one charge. I’m thoroughly impressed with the customer service of this seller and happy with the product!!
5,I purchased this fan after a colleague blasted me with some air from her (same) fan. I'm a nurse and am on my feet for about 85% of my shift. I have hot flashes which are exacerbated by tons of caffeine consumed and the fast-paced activity of my job. I place my fan on a portable workstation on wheels so that I can get relief when the hot flashes strike which is often (15+/shift). This fan is extremely powerful and has 3 speeds but the best part about the product is that it has a RE-CHARGABLE BATTERY. Sometimes I just plug the fan and USB cord into my workstation and keep the fan going all day long. Previously I was using a battery-operated fan from another manufacturer and was replacing (2) D batteries every week---and that fan had only one speed with so-so velocity. This fan is so terrific that it's small and quiet enough to be inconspicuous (I ordered black) but powerful enough to feel the air flow while standing 3 ft away. I love it. I purchased this fan based on a colleague's fan and another colleague just purchased one based on mine!
5,Air flow greatPortable definitelyNoise level decentBattery life could be better 🔋  🪫
5,I have an office that doesn't get a lot of throughput where the air conditioning is concerned. This office is consistently five degrees hotter than the outer office whose occupants like to keep the thermostat at a toasty (read: ungodly hot) temperature of 74 and 75 degrees even in the summer.Because I run hot as a general rule this can be really uncomfortable. I had a USB-driven fan that I purchased about a year ago and when it died? OMG! After checking local retailers to see if I could get something similar that day I found nothing so I hopped on over to Amazon because I knew if I was going to have to wait? Amazon would be my fastest option. It did not disappoint. I found this fan and purchased it and boy am I glad I did!It charges quickly and because it has a battery in it it's portable so I can bring it with me. I've only used it on its first two settings which have been more than good enough. It is small enough to put in the leg pocket of my cargo scrub pants and I can pull it out in places that I'm going to need it (like the cafeteria at lunch or anywhere that has a table to set it on).If you are wondering if you should purchase this fan? I'd say go for it!Thanks fluky for an awesome little fan! It beats the one that died hands down!
5,Awesome little fan. My husband had bought me  one some months ago for my desk at home.Got this one when I was looking for a small fan to bring to work. All the ladies (of a certain age) at work want one also. It’s cute easy to carry and has a lot of power. A win!
5,This portable fan is great for travel. It’s very lightweight and shoots off a power air I found it very refreshing when I had to travel to very hot states plus I like a fan in the background when I travel in hotels. Well worth it. Now my kids all want one.!
5,I really like the fan. It’s not noisy at all. I keep it in my purse for emergencies Bc it gets really hot at times.😎👍🏾
4,Nice fan. Good power. I wish it would tilt on its base. The battery fully charged has not lasted more than 2- 2 1/2 hours on any speed. 9 hours on the lowest speed? Not a snow ball’s chance in hell.
5,I like that you can charge the battery for this fan and the size.  It has minimal noise with it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                           Me gusta mucho! Es muy práctico ventila muy bien hecha mucho aire! lo uso para mis manicuras!💅
5,Great product works very well super powerful and blows a lot of air.
5,These are incredible! I over heat easily so I'm always wanting a fan of some sort. Before I bought two of my own my son let me borrow his fan to take to an event knowing i would be boiling and begging for a fan. This fan not only kept me cool the batteries lasted longer than I expected. Its got multiple speeds high medium and low and and cool little flashlight on one end.  I also took along a power pack I had which powered the fan once the batteries were exhausted. I had everyone at the event asking me where I got my fan from! These fans are incredible I love them highly recommended.
5,I love this fan! Blows mighty for such a tiny thing!
4,Very quiet and effective. However the fan has to be recharged every day after running during the night.
5,So I am a tech at an insurance company and everyone is currently WFH.  I was removing hardware from someone's desk and came across this fan.  I powered it on and the force nearly blew me out the 3 story window.  Maybe I'm exaggerating but you'll be BLOWN AWAY (haha!) by the power of this little unit.It has one of those e-cig batteries and charged via USB.  Inital charge took about 2 hours and at work I leave mine on and plugged in except when I leave.  If you're looking for something portable with amazing airflow it's worth the extra few bucks compared to a classic pocket fan.I wish they made this model with a string handle to encourage portability.
5,My husband is always cold and this is a nice portable fan for my desk and my bedside
5,compact quiet and works great!
5,I've had this product for about a week or two an am pretty impressed with it. I've accidentally dropped it a few times on a wood floor and it didn't break. It's rechargeable and doesn't need to be plugged in all the time. The battery life is what you'd expect from something this small but if the battery runs out you can still use it by plugging it in and it charges while its running. The wind generated by this thing is actually fairly impressive for such a small fan. You can liken the height of it to a galaxy s8 note and the width of 2/3rds of an galaxy s8 note. There are indeed 3 speeds/modes as advertised and the 4th mode is a side light which is a nice bonus. You cycle the nodes by pressing the bottommost button. There's a dedicated off button which is at the top left (in the picture) btw. I'd say it's a pretty good fan for the price. As for uses... I used it as fan to cool myself while gaming a fan to dry my cat after a bath (just point fan at cat while he's in his carrier) and I also used it to help push hot air out of my ps4 and pc once or twice. So a pretty smart purchase for myself!
5,I use this fan at my sewing machine at work it has made a difference my work Does have ac but we have older women who get cold very easy .when the temperature outside was in the 90 it got a little warm and I sew faster than others and I need air to circulate . This does the trick like someone else said run it on the low speed for the charge to last at least 8 hrs .I just take it home and charge everyday I'm good to go the next day
5,I absolutely love this fan!  I bought the exact one a few years ago and to use in the summer during travel baseball games but started taking it to hotels with me when I travel. The battery lasts for around 5 hours and I can recharge it via any USB or using my RavPower portable charger.  I'm someone who needs the fan noise and air circulation to sleep and let me tell you this little thing is the great for both!  Very powerful and very compact!  The little blue light is a perfect nightlight but I had a hard time finding out how to turn it on.  Once the fan is turned on hold down the "on" button for about 5 seconds and on comes the light.  Thank you to another reviewer for that little hidden trick.  I will probably buy a few more for next summer as there is always a fight for my fan.  Don't be afraid to order this product.  You won't be disappointed.
5,I love this fan. When you increase the speed it gets a little noisy but not too loud that I need to shut the door. I love the lights and the rechargeable battery.
5,I love the portability of this little gem! It has a big fan cooling power and can go everywhere even if you don’t have an outlet as long as it is charged up! It was a lifesaver on a trip!!
5,OMG this is an amazing product! ESPECIALLY for the heat intolerant person or the poor woman experiencing horrible hot flashes. Not only is it a cute fan but it's different settings and options (including the lil "flashlight" that a teeny bit of light emits from) and super cool looking night light effect inside the fan blade area make this fan outperform and look way better than all the other competition! It's sturdy and well designed portable as can be!! I have an "easy charge" gadget so I can plug in anytime the rechargeable battery runs low. I have been having severe hot flashes after being taken off my hormone replacement bc I have other medical issues that made me high risk for stroke. I was going to be flying to GA in September and dreaded the thoughts of the humidity heat hot flashes and the stuffy airplane! Well I pulled this baby out of my purse for every hot flash and it was awesome. Everyone who saw it wanted to see it better and know more about it bc it's that awesome. It REALLY puts out a lot of wind on the high setting. The lowest setting is super quiet and the middle setting is pretty quiet as well. But the high setting was my fave!! LOL...not so loud to disturb others. Sadly It fell out of my overloaded purse along with a book btwn Dallas/Ft Worth and LAX! I will be purchasing another one for sure.
5,Powerful little fan does the job! No complaints over here =>
5,I have yet to use this item but intend to use it for the hospital during labor and delivery.1st impression - decent size - decent weight - easy to use - the air strength seems pretty amazing ( my hubby agrees ) - it has a little flashlight 🔦 option on the side which i thought was cute.  Very simple to use.I don’t know about battery life as of right now but I’m hoping it doesn’t disappoint .If it doesn’t  then this thing is PERFECT!
5,I would definitely recommend buying this little fan. It is super cute it's small but dnt let that fool you it is powerful. It's a tiny bit noisy but still worth it nothing to extreme. I dnt really worry about the battery life since I have it plugged into my dest top but if I dnt then the battery life isnt the greatest 3 hours tops.
5,I like everything about this fan.
4,Did the job. Kept a small area cool enough
4,So the first one I purchased I was confused.  I was sure that I should be able to charge this using the USB cord then can take it where I wanted.  However the battery I guess didn't hold a charge.  It would not work if it wasn't plugged in.  Well what's the point then?  I was able to get a replacement quickly and sent back the defective one.  So far so good.  I charge the battery and then I can unplug it and take it where I go.One of the things I love about this is that it is quiet enough and small enough to take to meetings with me.  Does not really distract others.  I can even move it around to cool off others while being discrete.  It has three speeds and are easy to change with the push of a button.
5,It’s very convenient and powerful for a tiny fan. Great buy!
5,I was a little nervous with some of the negative reviews but I absolutely love it! For as small as it is it is a little powerhouse!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This was the best mini fan perfect for me
4,I am really impressed with how much air this little fan can move and how quiet it is while doing it.It most definitely runs while being plugged in to charge (with the battery installed).  However mine will not run on the battery alone (faulty battery maybe?).  It must be plugged in at all times to work which sort of defeats the purpose for a "portable" personal fan.I'm a little concerned about the battery being Li Ion and having a problem with overheating but am assuming since the fan doesn't run on the battery that it's not taking a charge at all.I'll probably still use it but only when I'm awake.
5,Completely surprised me when I first turned this fan on. I wasn't expecting too much of just a simple USB fan and it went well above my expectations. The airflow is just right that even here in the Arizona heat its a life saver literally while still maintaining enough battery to not cut out right away. I had to buy a 2nd one as soon as I got my first after my grandmother kept trying to steal mine.As a side note the speed of the fan caps out at medium when plugged into USB. Even if you switch it over to high it wont go any faster. The moment you unplug it the speed jumps right up to max however. Most likely to maintain a balance of incoming power to usage so it doesn't cut off and restart repeatedly while plugged in. Don't let this dissuade you however as Ive never really needed it more than medium on a day to day basis. I think the only time I put it on max was when it hit 104 degrees recently.
5,I need a fan on to sleep so when I travel a lot of times the room doesn't have a fan. This works very well for the size with just the right amount of noise.  It has a battery and can be charged and used with power cable it comes with. It fits easily in my luggage so I always have room for it. I liked it so much I bought another to keep in my office at work.
5,I had this for barely a week and its pretty good. I have a 18650 charger that I used to charge the battery that it came with. Got a good amount of life out of the fan. Its a fun little fan. Good for a desk or a car or other something like that. Charged it a few times using the battery charger I have and it seems to be holding up.  I have been able to power the fan using the usb cable alone (without battery) although it seemed to not be as powerful. I do have a old 18650 battery (trustfire) that i got from some chinese website it has a chip in it and doesnt fit. I also have other samsung(?) batteries I used for a "smokmod" that fit and are the same size batteries that came with this product.
5,I originally ordered these fan for a cruise well thanks to Covid that vacation was sadly canceled.  So I had this fan and no use for it.  Fast Forward to Hurricane Isaias and we lost power its the middle of the summer in the north east with humidity and heat I remembered I had this fan and BOY was it a life saver!  I ran it for at least 6 hours on the lowest setting just on the battery power and it provided enough relief to where I can get some sleep and not feel too hot!  After 6 hours of running on battery power the fan did not loose any power behind the output.I would recommend this fan to keep for emergencies as well as for travel.
5,This fan is tiny but mighty!!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Just got mine and it works great!!
5,My husband bought this for me to put next to my bed when the overhead fan just isn't enough.  Ever since I was medically forced to get a full hysterectomy at 29 years old I've been suffering from intense hot flashes.I also travel out of town often for medical treatments and mentioned that a portable fan would be nice when we have to stay in a hotel.I was so excited when my husband surprised me with the perfect fan.It seems durable it's really quiet and has three fan speeds. I love that it comes with a rechargeable battery so I can use it anywhere. The fan came with charging cable which happens to be the same one I use to charge my phone.  I already have to pack quite a bit even if it's just overnight.  Not having to worry about packing a different charger for my fan is totally worth it to me.I would and will recommend purchasing this compact but not weak portable fan.
5,I am in love with this fan. Although I don't use the night light and flash light features they are nice to have. I use this thing anywhere and everywhere. I don't leave my house without it and the times I have left without it I've missed it.One place I use it in a lot is the kitchen. They say "if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen". Well I'm glad that now I don't have to get out. Believe it or not. This thing is powerful enough so much so. I use it while on my eliptical instead of the one that came with the actual exercise machine. In other words this fan runs circles on the one from my eliptical. (Get it? Circles?)When I first bought this fan I wasn't too convinced because you get what you pay for but I have to say the price is well worth it.On the lowest setting I can get a good 5 to 6 hours on a single charge. I get 2 to 3 hours on the highest setting. If it runs out of juice I just plug it in and keep using it while it charges.I hope my review was helpful. Go ahead give this one a shot I don't think you'll be disspleased.
3,It doesn’t last long on the charge and it’s hard to place it where the wind blows at you.
5,This is my second purchase of this marvelous little fan. I have one at my bedside which keeps my face cool at night. The other I carry when I travel or go out to an outdoor restaurant. There are three fan levels - for such a relatively small device its amazing how cool it keeps me. It also has a flashlight which has been useful in unfamiliar hotel overnights. The lithium battery holds a charge for constant use of approx 6 to 7 hours on the lowest setting. I thoroughly recommend it - my original bought three years ago works perfectly.
5,I'm a CCU nurse and I run around all day for 12 hours. I take this with me everywhere. There is no noise and the battery life lasts. Even if it didn't I could just plug in the USB port charger when I'm on break. This is a must and it just looks pretty awesome around you. When I first opened it and put the rechargeable battery in it lasted without me doing anything. There are 3 settings to cater to your daily sweating ratio! Get this you need it.
5,Noise level good
4,This fan was originally purchased for my mom  22 months ago; she used it every night on her nightstand on battery and then I would charge it during the day.Last month the USB port started loosening up and then the charging lamp did not light and the battery did not charge.It was a ozone smell coming off so it.It lasted just beyond the warranty. For less than $20 this was a reliable fan for a year and a half of constant service.I bought a replacement.
5,I use this thing at work constantly. I’m always running around and it is the only thing that keeps me cool. It’s amazing. Like AMAZING. I brought it with me to travel during the summer (I sweat constantly) and although people were initially making fun of me I was definitely the one laughing when my friends looked like wet dogs and I didn’t. the plus side is it’s pretty quiet as well.The battery on high lasts probably around 4 hours or so and super easy to recharge. It also works while plugged in. I’ve had this for about 6 months now and I take it EVERYWHERE. Obsessed.
5,I needed some fans for when I'm working or hanging out in the back of my van.  It gets hot back there even with the all the windows open.  I didn't want to hook up anything else to the vehicle battery and this van was the perfect solution.  The speeds are all useful.  The flashlight is somewhat useful.  I don't need the disco light because my van already has some good disco lighting but who knows.  When the mood strikes I may find use for the disco light.  I love that the battery is rechargeable and that the fan can operate while charging and even operate hooked up to USB without the battery in it.  Noise level is good.  Battery life is good.
5,I really love it. I am esthetician and I use to cool down the wax
5,Carry some type of clear water sprayer; the combination of clear mist on your face with the fan held close really increases comfort if you're in a parked car under a shady tree and you don't want to waste gas on using the car's air conditioner... sometimes delivery drivers or gig drivers might park while waiting for new customers works for me... having a portable charger also helps just in case...
5,I bought this in June 2019. The summers are getting hotter where I live as they are in probably most the the world and I thought this would be good for saving on AC costs when I wanted more of a breeze in some parts of the house. I wasn’t expecting much despite positive Amazon reviews but this fan has exceeded my expectations. It’s powerful given its size battery life is still great it charges just fine and it always works beautifully. The fan is on most of the time when I’m awake during hot days so it is very heavily used but it still works perfectly.Words can’t describe how happy I am with this fan and I’d not hesitate to buy another if mine breaks.
5,Best purchase this year! Went to an outdoor wedding in an open field with no shade last weekend and this fan was the hit of the wedding... everyone was coming over to get some air... I was the genius who brought the fan! 3 speeds is very nice and 3 is pretty powerful. I brought it to a cookout yesterday and everyone loved passing it around cooling off the babies and themselves everyone wants one now. Direct quote from my best friend as we are sitting poolside right now complaining about the heat "this fan is everything I need to get one for me and my Mom!" The battery life is good it lasted almost all day/night both days. I have a portable charging bank for my phone that works with it as well if I had needed it. I do wish it used regular batteries as well as chargeable so I could bring extra batteries and use it all day and night. And although it does stand up straight on a flat surface some kind of stand allowing it to tilt would make it 100% perfect. All in all a great little fan.
5,This fan is awesome!  Three speed settings and internal & external LED light.  Fan creates a lot of breeze for it's small size the top speed really blows!  Way more airflow than those circular mini metal fans you can buy quieter too.  The other day I set it on low and began timing it.  After 3 hours I turned it up to the medium speed and let it run for another 30 minutes before I gave up.  Have no doubt it would have run for at least another hour or more.  Little light tells you it's operating and glows red then turns green when fully charged.  An interesting feature it top speed is not available when plugged into a USB port.  I'm guessing it's because it needs the juice to operate and charge simultaneously.  I'm going to be someplace warm where power is not always readily available so this should get me through the warm nights.
5,Amazingly effective.The little fan shoots a good stream of air even on low.I like that it has an off button so you don’t have to click through 4 settings to turn it off.I don’t know why they put an LED flashlight in the side which turns on when you click past the 3rd fan setting. An odd add to a portable fan but oh well.Hold the On button in for 3 seconds on any fan speed and a blue LED lights up the fan interior. I really like this it’s pretty but also it reminds me that the fan is on - on the low setting I can’t hear it I forget and leave it on.The only negative I find is that the fan does not tilt or swivel; one can only change its angle by changing the surface it sits on.
5,Does what i need and rechargeable is the most important thing.
2,This fan makes a nice quiet breeze on the low setting.  However after working for about 3 hours it quit!  Sending for replacement.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy to turn on and off and it really does cool you down if your running around.
5,I take this man with me when I travel because some hotel rooms are so very hot and this does a great job at moving air around the room
4,Made last heatwave more comfortable. Fell from desk and the buttons came off but it was an easy fix.
4,Once in a while you find a product that works as advertised and has potential as well. I think the Efluky fan is very good! Efluky has made a lightweight well balanced fan that gives you a multi-speed fan led mini-flashlight and a cool dark mode LED effect on the blades.  Can it be improved? Sure for non techies out there It should come with a 3000 mAh battery like Samsung or Panasonic in order to last as we need it to. Also the on switch can be activated when put into a pack or luggage so you must take the battery out to prevent this which causes wear on the door clip.  Efluky please change the type of switch to lockout or supply us with a slice of plastic so we can block battery voltage during travel.  Finally a little slip bag would protect the fan when packing it along...I would pay more for those improvements the product is that good.....
5,This fan is wonderful! I actually bought 3 of them. My kids and I carry them with us anytime we go somewhere and think it may be too hot. The fact that they have 3 speeds is great but the lower the speed the longer it will last.
5,Just love this little fan. Great value
5,This tiny fan is surprisingly powerful! Works as described.
5,My wife and I live in a 2 bedroom apartment. It only came with a window air conditioner unit. One of them. For the entire place. I bought this fan for my wife so she could take it with here and put it where it will help the most without having to depend on having an outlet nearby. It surprised me when she said she liked it so much she could see herself bringing it with on the bus to keep cool when she leaves home.
4,It's a bit on the noisy side but great charing via usb. Able to go at least 4 hours on a charge haven't used it till it died yet. The only thing I wish it did was to be able to direct the fan in different positions.
5,I go to lots of Dr.’s appointment as I have MS. On my last infusion for MS. A nurse brought out this fan to cool me down. All her friends there bought one I ordered mine while I was getting my treatment. It’s just fabulous. MS patient’s  feel 3 time’s the heat more then regular people my doctor told me. So this little fan goes with me all the time now. Air conditioning is not always cool enough in the doctors when your waiting and this is great. You can charge your battery into your car or phone charger to charge it. It’s well worth the money. Love it.
5,I LOVE THIS FAN!!!  I was in Michaels store paying for something at the register and I told the lady that was ringing me up that I was hot and she showed me this fan she had right there and she told me this thing saves my life.  I am 60 and still get hot flashes all the time.  I ordered two of these and was going to give one to a friend but I loved it so much I keep one on my desk at work and I have one at home and sometimes I take it in my purse with me.  It runs long on the charge and you just charge it like you do your cell phone.  No batteries to buy.  I can't praise this little fan enough.  It is really powerful too....has three speeds!  If you are considering it...you'd be crazy not to go for it.  Anyone who runs hot or has to suffer with hot flashes.  I may order another one or two myself.  Great price too!!!  Love it!!
5,Okay so I work at a hospital in South Louisiana. We just went through Hurricane Ida and of course only had emergency power. We plugged this little fan in an emergency outlet and when i tell you I got cold I'm not lieing. this phone put out some AIR. Def recommend having one of these around at all times!
4,I have this in my cube at work.  My little area seems to be hotter than everyone else's for some reason so I have this on a shelf and plugged into my laptop.  The thermometer in my space reads 77 but this is enough on low speed to cool to down so that it feels more like 70.  It is pretty powerful for such a little fan.  I had to replace a corded oscillating desk fan which was much bigger and this one puts out just as much air on low speed.  Plugged into the laptop it never runs out of power and I have it running for about 9 hours each day.  So unfortunately I can't attest to its battery life.  It's very light weight and pretty small so it's easily portable and the blue light is pretty cool.  I accidentally discovered that it has a flashlight on the right side near the bottom which could come in handy in situations where you lose electricity or use outdoors in the dark.
5,I love this fan.  Even though we have AC I like to have a flow of air over me when I sleep. Right now i have it plugged in to a USB port and is on my nightstand by my bed. Gives out a lot of air good quality product.  Small enough to fit in suitcase for travel.  I am going to buy another one.
5,All was great things that I needed and things that I wanted to get for myself thank you
4,I used this little fan as my bedside noise machine and fan for three years until the battery finally stopped taking/holding a charge. For the price of a lithium battery I can actually buy another one of these fans which is exactly what I'm going to do.
4,Works well overall but wish it was designed so it could be tilted or angled.  Since it isn't you have to make sure it's placed at exactly the height you want it otherwise the breeze it produces won't hit you.  Also at the highest speed it's pretty noisy.  But I like that it has a shut off button so I don't have to push the other button 3 times to turn it off.
5,This fan although quite small and compact packs quite a punch! There is quite a bit of power in this little fan! In an enclosed room indoors I can feel the breeze generated by the fan (on the highest setting) from 5 feet away. I tend to keep this fan on my desk while I work and study and I place it on my nightstand when I sleep for an extra little breeze. This is a wonderful fan for you if you want a little breeze in a stagnant room without the industrial sound of a box fan.We intend to use this in our tent while camping as well. I will update the review accordingly for outdoor application.
5,I bought this for my desk because I overheat like no one's business. A lot of the reivews here said that the  fan was pretty powerful and they are correct! The three settings are good the first one doesn't do a lot (but its the first) but 2 and 3 are surprisingly powerful for such a small thing. The batteries are the same as my husband uses in his vape so i have plenty of backups and a charger! But it does run off the cable even without the battery which is great in case of an oops. This is definitely worth the price in my opinion.8/13/2018 EDIT: This fan was amazing for the North American heatwave. It helped keep me cool at night (I sleep with a CPAP mask and it can be a lil warm sometimes) and sometimes when you just need a boost of cool air here it is! I even bought a couple more for my friends and the quality is pretty consistent! All four fans bought have been equally powerful and none of them have suddenly broken or stopped working.
5,Works great at my desk for work. I can even take it to outdoor events. It get really hot out this way in the summer
5,It's small but powerful. Doesn't take up a lot of space on my desk it's quiet and is great at moving air.
4,As the title goes I love these fans!  They are surprisingly strong for such a small fan.  I have personally bought 3 so far (One for myself one for my son and one as a gift).  My sisters and mom all bought one as well after trying mine out.The fan seems to work for quite awhile before needing a charge of any sort which is great!  My son thinks that the blue light option is the coolest thing ever (this does NOT have to be on all the time only turns on when you hold the button for a few seconds).The only negative that I have found so far is that the charging port on the fan itself seems to get "loose" somehow and so it CAN make charging a bit tricky - have to find that perfect spot for the connection to stay active.Even with that issue I would buy more if and when I need to in the future.
5,Impressed! Works great even at low speed. I’ll carry it around w me in the house my desk the kitchen and in my bedroom. At first I had it on my dresser but at LOW it was still a little too much air on my face (about 5 ft-see photo). Then I moved it on my vanity (about 9 ft.) while I watch tv on my bed  and at LOW or MD is just right that’s how efficient (see photo). The little blue night light is kinda neat too. I have a big Honeywell right next to it that I’ve turned off cuz this works better! WTF?! Highly recommend! :) Hope this helps someone
1,Hi thereI don’t write reviews. Was shopping on Amazon and this popped up and decided to write one. It doesn’t work unless plugged in. I’ve tried to move the chargeable battery all different ways and nothing. It does work if I keep it plugged in. I do use it when I’m sitting in the living room but that is not why I bought it. I never tried to return it or let the seller know.Have a great day!
4,Now this is a pretty dang good product especially for its prize! I was searching for a portable fan because of the weather (90-100 degrees this summer). I also use a laptop most of the day with a USB monitor attached to it; the monitor makes the computer heat up faster than usual. So I thought it might be great to have a small fan on my desk to help with the weather and laptop situation. I saw other similar products on Amazon but the light on this one caught my attention. I was blown away the first time I used this. (Did you notice the pun?) For a portable product it is pretty powerful. It definitely gets the job done. The only slight complaint I have is its stability when using it at speed 3; it tends to tumble over. The unit's base is plastic which makes it slippery. Combine that with the product being lightweight and powerful it becomes a disadvantage. However it doesn't take away from it being a little wonder. Go buy it!
5,This fan purrs along… and works fabulously.
2,Battery doesn't last very long. Maybe 2 hours on high 3 hours on medium and 4 on low speed. Dont even try turning on the light. Must have it plugged in to a power source or else it's pretty useless.
5,It is small but powerful. Quiet with more fan speeds than my old fan.
2,Bought this fan to dry manicured nails quickly.  After fully charged only had about half an hour of life. I would return but missed the return window.
3,The fan worked great the first month then it started to get intermittent. Some times it would not start until I tapped it gently on the desk. Most of the time I would put it on low. It would just stop running after a few minutes. I then would up the speed and drop it back to low. It would then run on low. If it wasn't for this it would be a great personal fan.
5,I like it and I use it for my hot flashes
4,When I installed the battery I noticed that both ends of the battery were completely flat - neither end had the nipple that you commonly find on the positive end of a battery.  Nevertheless one end was marked positive and I installed the battery accordingly then began trying to charge it with the provided cable.  After 12 hours or so I attempted to use the fan on battery power and it wouldn't even turn on.  I flipped the battery around and tried charging it that way for another 12 hours with the same result.  The fan worked fine while connected to power with the USB cable though.  I threw away the battery that came with the fan and replaced it with another rechargeable battery I had laying around then charged it and now it works fine.
2,This fan only last a couple weeks then we couldn’t get it to function anymore.
5,Love it
4,Disappointing. I purchased this fan for a camping trip. I needed something I could charge through a USB not have to rely on one to power it! I have been trying to charge the battery for a little over 24 hours now and it will not accept the charge. The little light that claims it is charging comes on but it is still as dead as the day I got it (2 days ago). The fan itself seems to work but it clearly will not serve the purpose I needed it to serve and it won't be worth the money to return it.8/17-I am impressed with this company's customer service! Once the found out I had a problem with my original order (quite certain now it was the battery) they quickly sent me a replacement fan that works perfectly! Really like this fan now that I have a good one.
4,The blade looks purple in picture a little disappointed.
4,This is the 2nd fan of this kind which I have purchased. The first one purchased last year is who knows where. So I needed a replacement.The first fan arrived as is pictured in the Amazon advertisement/description; black & white body with blue blades as shown in Amazon product images.The second fan just arrived today is in the image I have uploaded. It has a black & white body with blades that are not blue. The blades are colorless & translucent/slightly frosted.Of course it still functions as it should & well as the first fan which I can no longer find. But the blades are not as indicated in the image for the B&W body. Additionally the "built in blue light" as it is described on the website is actually a white light.
5,I travel a lot for work and love it.  I stay in hotels (Doubletrees Marriotts) where the air conditioner and heater are controlled by the hotel.  its either heat or air.  Well the weather does not go by those rules and I have had many sleepless nights laying in bed calling asking for a fan only to be told that they do not have anymore  I am a flight attendant and spend at least 2 nights a week in a hotel. (usually 4 nights) and this fan has made my nights so much better.  I use a ceiling fan at home and my husband says that he can not blink when we get up because of the fan.  Last night I used this fan on the night stand and my husband said he slept well and did not even know that I had it on.  First words out of his mouth was you have to order another one of those one for your flight bag and one for home.  Ordering now.
3,Battery life is worthless.  Need to use a cloud charger to keep it going any longer than 1 hour or have plugged in entire time. Would be better off advertised as a mini fan and not a portable battery operated one. Would not buy again.
5,I have now purchased two of these because I love them so much!! They last for several hours on a full charge very low noise and highly portable. Highly recommended!
5,Of all the things I have ordered from Amazon over the years this is one of my favorites.  I am currently blessed with hot flashes.  I saw this little fan and thought "why not?"I am SO glad I bought this.  In fact I liked it so much I bought a second one.  I keep one on my desk at work and keep one at home.  The fan charges through a USB cable so I can plug it in to a phone charger or computer.  And it keeps a charge for about a week.  So when I feel a hot flash coming on I just turn it on and I instantly feel better.  I wouldn't think a little fan could make that much difference but it does.  In fact my co-workers ask to borrow it when they start to overheat.The fan is quiet and puts out a lot of air for something so small and powered by a battery.  It's not going to cool a whole room but it will cool you down quickly when you need it.
4,Just a little back story I work in a office and have my own cubical. This fan is well worth the price and even more! For how small of a fan it is it puts out a lot of air. I keep it plugged in and running almost all day. When plugged in the setting for 2 and 3 are the same. If unplugged on power 3 it puts out a significant amount of air. The only downside to this is when it is unplugged it seems to run out of battery rather quickly. If you are looking for something that will be constantly plugged in and still put out good amout of air this is the fan for you!
5,Bought this for work as I work as a homemaker I take care of elderly lady and she likes to have her house pretty warm so I needed a fan for down time when she naps this is perfect. Its silent so it dieant wake her up. Perfect size so I can just put it in my purse and take it with me. Takes no space. And the first speed is all I need any higher would be too much. Love the flashlight add on glwould be good for powerouts. Also for me the battery life would last about 8 hrs if charged completely.
5,I am working 12 hour shifts next to a loading dock in Texas. So it is Very Hot and stuffy in my location. I do not have an available power outlet so I went looking for a rechargeable fan. This fan is absolutely amazing! I keep it on the lowest setting to get the most out of it battery life but it is more than enough! It blows on my torso and when I took the temperature there it reads 89.6°F! So perfect! And it is small enough that I just put it in my lunch box to carry it back and forth.
5,Cheap little fan that pushes a good amount of air. Love the blue LED feature and the side light good for camping trips. Battery is useful but doesn't last more than an hour on full speed. Even then the lowest speed is enough for me. This is great for a small office desk/cubicle.
5,I purchased this fan after our company initiated a safety ban on all fans that plug directly into an electric outlet.  Our office building is old and has been added on to numerous times leaving the HVAC less than adequate for cooling and heating properly. I also work with alot of females who like me always seem to be hot-hot-hot! It did not take long before there were many complaints of 'we want our fans back!' Corporate did eventually allow fans that are battery operated or plugged into our laptops via a USB port. I purchased this fan and have been completely satisfied.  I have ordered several more for co-workers who saw me enjoying the cool breeze of the efluky mini fan and requested them. The fan does it's job the battery life is good and it does not over drain my computer battery when I use the USB jack to power the fan/charge the battery. I am happy with my purchase.
1,When it works it is great. This same fan has had various different names - all identical. I’ve owned several. All have died or fail to hold a charge (so always need to be plugged in) very soon. The USB cord won’t fit flush into the charging port on the fan itself so the inner metal piece that the cord fits into will also start to bend inside. Powerful and great…when it works but not worth it. (Just back from a 7 day trip. Died a few days into it so always needed to be charging to work).
5,I bought this for my kid when they had to start e-learning since their room is always on the warm side. It doesn't take up much space on their desk and being cordless is easy to move. There's no pivot on the fan so you have to move it to change the direction. I don't know how precisely long the battery lasts but if it's connected to a USB charger every couple of hours it easily makes it through the day. It's light but feels durable or at least my kid hasn't broken it yet which says something.
5,Love this fan.  Bought this as an extra little fan to put in the kitchen while I'm cooking to cool it off a little.  Great battery life (about 8 hours on high).  Love that it uses an 18650 battery.  You can charge the battery right in the fan (I use a separate charger because it's a little faster but either way battery life is great.)  Has a cool little flashlight on the side that would work for an emergency in a pinch.  Would recommend!
4,Great fan but as other reviews said battery will not work
2,Purchased this as a gift and it was broken after only a few days use. It is delicate and easily knocked over. I would not get this again.
4,Love how quiet it is but charge life is short.  But love this fan.
5,Bought and have used this primarily in a tent outdoors during the summer months. Provided a very nice breeze of air aiding in comfort and ability to sleep under the effects of the “blazing sun.”It is compact and has 3 settings (low med high) the choosing of which will determine the battery’s longevity. It’s only “died” once during prolonged use on the high setting otherwise it’s been used more intermittently on the lower two settings which still provide a very nice breeze especially given the size of the fan. Depending on outlet strength it takes about 1-3 hours to recharge fully which is signaled by a light change from red to green on the fan.Overall it is a very convenient and useful fan and for the price an absolute bargain.
5,This little fan really puts out a lot of air.  I usually keep it on the lowest setting and it cools me off quickly.  I bought it to take on a cruise next year but have been using it a lot at home.  I have it next to my chair in the evening and just pick it up and point at me if I'm having a hot flash.  Also keep it on my nightstand pointing toward my face and it works great.  Very quiet on lowest setting.  Does not bother me at all at night.  Battery lasts overnight plus.  Easy to charge with the included charger.  The charger opening is the same as my android phone so can charge almost anywhere if you forget your fan charger.
5,The air conditioner at our office had Frozen up on 95 Degree Days with a hundred degree heat index and no matter what you did there was no way to cool off. Everybody had fans but their batteries were dying and I pull out this little puppy and plug it right into my computer? I was sitting pretty my entire shift. And even on the highest setting they're not lying about that whisper quiet. I work at a call center so you don't want to have a big loud noise in the background when you're trying to talk to your customer. Everybody is super jealous of me LOL. Now as far as durability seems to work pretty well I've been using it for a couple weeks now we shall see. Runs a pretty good time on the battery charge but for the most part I just plug it into the computer just in case it dies and I don't catch it.
4,It would almost seem like a fluke that this fan is so great. It has excellent power you can feel it from a good 4 or 5 feet away. The blue is distracting and pleasant and although I haven't found a use for it yet the LED is nifty.My complaints:A flat base leads to creative office solutions when I'm at work. I wish this fan had a swing base that it can attach to.A place to hook it at the top and bottom with a Dring would definitely make this a camping staple.Lastly and mind you have a poor perception of time the battery life doesn't quite make it to 8 hours. If it made 8hours on high this would be the best thing since sliced bread.If all these things were incorporated in this product I'd pay $30 or more for it.
4,This little fan packs a punch but at the highest setting is a bit noisy. I wish it had a hook attached that would allow me to angle it or suspend it for more versatile hands-free use. But its base is wide enough and pretty sturdy given its size.Once fully charged  battery life is good.I would definitely recommend it as a useful product that does exactly what it's made to do.
5,This fan is my 2nd. My first was black and after all these years is still going strong.Everything is perfect with 3 speeds and a small light that you could use as an emergency flashlight.I recommended this to my daughter and she bought one a couple of weeks ago.Great fan for a decent price.
5,We liked this fan so much we bought a second one. It moves a lot of air and is very quiet. It runs a good long time on a charge and recharging is easy to do. No wasting batteries. I highly recommend this.
5,This is my third fan that I've bought for family and traveling. These fans are great and still working perfectly with a lot of use. They are quiet for flying and the battery life is better than expected. I recommend buying extra batteries because recharge takes some time.
4,I do like the fan a lot very powerful quiet and small.. but the battery life sucks on it. Only used like 3 x’s each (I bought 3 of them for my dogs) and the battery just keeps getting weaker and weaker. The fan I ur self it awesome on the side note maybe invest in a good rechargeable battery?
1,I purchased this fan 34 days ago the return policy is 30 days. And today it wont run without the power cable pulled back adding pressure. It also doesnt hold any charge. Theres no way to contact the seller and no way to get a replacement. I'd go with a different brand there are lots of other models the same out there. This ones battery and cable are particularly bad.
2,Poor directional airflow
5,Nice power battery life is short on high but of course it is given how strong this little fan is. Low and medium are no joke either. This is a nice little fan for a good price. I use it when I camp...ok I glamp. I have a nice size power pack that can recharge my devices or if left plugged in can run this fan overnight for a couple of nights in a row and still have enough to charge my phone speaker and other devices. I don't know what I did without it. It is an awesome little fan. It doesn't take much power to recharge the fan batteries.
5,I have not tested this yet. I bought it to travel with....for the money it seems well made and quite powerful. Will be interested to see about battery life?
5,I use this on a cruise because it is always hot at night.  It's a great little fan.  I removed the battery because sometimes the cruise line will take these kinds up and just powered it using the USB cord.  It worked great.  Not too loud and moved air well.  Without the battery it is so light it will scoot itself back and move around on any speed other than low but low is plenty to move the air.  After returning home I put the battery back in and it stays put just fine.  I recommend it!
5,Fan blows air like other fans twice size. Small but not too small to get a personal cooling affect from the breeze. Air flow noticable difference among the 3 speeds. One thing  I will suggest  is that you be very  gentle when connecting and disconneting the cable. If your rough or force it in with too much pressure you might mess up possibly damange the charging port. But the fan runs great. Just say my $20 is well please. I'm very please with the amount air produce  among 3 speeds for such a small fans. I needed something portable to help cool my body off during this upcoming summer heat. I can take anywhere along as the battery charge. Please be warned this is a small fan. It was designed as a desk fan or personal self cool fan. It was not designed to cool down a stuffy or hot room. This is not a room fan. I rate 5 for the seller and 5 for the product review.
4,I rarely do reviews but I have purchased 4 of these wonderful little fans and the only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that one of them won't work on the battery alone it never charged.  Otherwise for a woman of a certain age this little puppy has saved me from many hot flashes. At night when I wake up I just turn it on and go back to sleep at dinner with friends I just put it beside me and POW instant relief. It makes very little noise you could even take it to  restaurant. This is the best $12.00 you will ever spend. Handy small easy to transport and it charges on your computer while keeping you cool! Buy one for yoursef and gift it to your friends they will love you more than they already do!
5,I highly recommend this 3 speed fan to anyone that gets hot at work and needs a quick cool down. I like that it has different wind speeds the battery last long at lease as long as I need it to anyway it has a handy dandy flash light feature as well. The only one problem I have with the fan is that it isn’t capable to bend. I stand above the fan at work and the only way to get the fan to hit my face is to lean it back on something and that don’t always help. But w works plugged up or just on battery so it can be mobile.
5,I am a server and I keep this fan at work for my co workers and i when it gets really busy and we need a flow of cold air. It works really well for how little it is. I work a max of 5 hour shifts a day and it lasts the whole time unless it’s on level 3 then it usually dies towards the end of my shift. My coworkers all love it as do I.
1,Absolutely loved this fan!  It was powerful could sit on my desk or fit in my purse.  It lasted about a month during which time I only had to recharge it twice.  But then one day when it was turned on sitting on the desk it just stopped!  I plugged it in and awhile later it indicated it was charged but it would not turn back on.  Very disappointed that the life of this was so short!
5,I bought this to use at the server station where I work as a waitress in a fast-paced Florida cafe. I chose it based on the reviews and because it’s cordless/rechargeable. It’s fan-tastic! Durable lightweight quiet and produces a surprisingly powerful airflow. It’s designed to be used up close - at a desk or anywhere you’re stationary and need a breeze. I turn it on and off at short intervals when I’m entering an order or am momentarily idle and need to cool off but can’t duck into the walk-in fridge lol. In this manner the battery lasts through two or three 6-hour shifts before needing a recharge. Recharged quickly (less than an hour). It could be run plugged in too of course. I throw it in my purse and it has held up well being lugged back and forth. I would purchase again and recommend this fan.
4,This is a great little fan.  And actually it isn't as small as I expected.  It's the perfect size.  Living in Hawaii I do a lot of dining alfresco or in open air establishments.  This little fan comes in handy on those non-breezy days.  You can definitely feel the air blowing.  The blue light if you choose to turn it on is super cool looking too but I expect causes the battery to drain faster.  The only negatives: the fan does not tilt.  That would be super cool if it did.  Without that tilt ability you have to place the fan on top of something in order for it to be parallel with your face.  The other thing I have to comment on is the battery life.  You'll have to charge it after every use.
4,This little fan packs a big punch. It has 3 levels. At its lowest it still manages to keep you cool. It comes with a USB cable for charging. Perfect for a desk or to travel with. I used it on my most recent cruise and it kept me cool throughout the night. However on levels two and three the battery does waste pretty fast. I noticed on level one the fan can stay on 8 hours or more. But when put higher it only lasted about 3 or 4 hours. It’s still a great little fan though and for the price a good grab.
5,Great little fan! Really moves the air and cools! I have one in the kitchen by the sink one on my bedside table and one at work on my desk! Great white noise and wonderful at cooling the air! Great to bring to the beach and camping too!
5,This is a great fan. I took it on a cruise that a friend and I went on because I like the air moving.My friend liked it so much I bought her one too for our next trip. It charges very quick luckily we had an extension cord that went over to our night stand between our beds so I could if I kept it plugged in. it is quiet but I do like the slight amount of noise it makes for the White noise I need. It really puts out a lot of wind so I didn't even have it on the highest setting.
5,Love these little fans. This is the 2nd one I've bought this year. And I had 3 of them a couple years back. Good output of air love the 3 speeds love the bright little light when you need to find something in the dark and they're not too noisy. Battery lasts a good while after charging several hours. They're cute about 5" tall and work great. What else could you ask for?
5,Loved this in our cabin on a cruise
3,Pros: Product works as intended bring a cool breeze when I get hot flashes. Also it's pretty quiet.Cons: Battery life is terrible and battery doesn't seem to hold a charge for long when off the usb charger. For example I charged the fan until the green indicator came up to let me know it was fully charge. I removed the fan from the charger and set it down. I tried using it again after a few days and it appeared to be dead. It had been off the whole time. Also when fully charged the battery only lasts about an hour.
5,While this is a sweet little fan and powerful it has flaws. The battery compartment cover is flaky & I have to use tape to keep it in place or it falls off. The charge port is also flaky so charging via USB is unreliable. Using the fan WITH the USB plugged in is unreliable. While plugged in with USB the  fan will shut down for no reason as if it's not getting power. Which also means it's not charging. I have to remove the battery and charge it by other means if I want to use it at my desk at work all day. I am unable to rate the battery life because it is inconsistent.
5,I used this on the beach and camping at night. So it worked on a very hot day in the sun and a very humid and moist nights. It’s very quiet and powerful. Long battery life. The lil flashlight was a great bonus! Great product!
3,This is a useful fan but it's not without it's flaws.1) It does indeed put out a good amount of air despite it's small size2) I like the different levels of air output3) the light on the side (kind of a mini flashlight) is a bit of an odd feature for a fan but it's actually useful if you need it.4) Flaw #1 - realize that is uses a USB charger so it can run out of juice and leave you without a fan when u need it most. I did not downgrade for this because the seller clearly shows this in the product description I am just pointing it out. Personally I would prefer this just use normal batteries instead.5) Flaw #2 - the on/off button is very sensitive. I wanted to use this on a recent travel trip and had it in my backpack until I needed it. Little did I know that the button was apparently pressed when my backpack was in storage and that ran down the charge. This happened multiple times and I'm not sure how to overcome this issue? How do you take the fan along in your bag without anything ever touching the on/off button on the front of the fan?
4,I have used this fan numerous times still working recharges nicely though not sure about the lighting. Know it has lighting but I don't use it.The higher the speed the more noise it makes but at a low setting set just few feet away gives nice light breeze.
5,We use these at home during the summer months when it's warm. Pop it on my desk and have it on the lowest setting and it makes a big difference and I'm someone who runs a bit hot in the first place. You can run it off the battery of course or just plug it in to your USB port and run it as long as you want.We also use these on our sailboat as it can get a bit stuffy down below. Running them on the lowest setting will last the entire night. Higher fan speeds kill the battery faster but sometimes you need the power.All in all a great little fan for a reasonable price.
5,I love this fan. I’m 49 going on 50 and I know this is going to be my best friend to deal with hot flashes and sweats! I like that it uses the same type charger jack as my nook so it’s easy to just plug in and I don’t have so many cords out. The light on the side is a cute addition and might come in handy if I ever take it camping. The only down side is that it is so powerful on the highest setting that it blows itself across the desk surface if I don’t prop it with something heavy. Putting it on a rubber mouse pad surface would probably stop that too.
5,Very convenient and it is quiet. I use the LED light as a night light. I only received it yesterday so not sure how long a charge lasts. I like that it has 3 fan speeds. Only con is I'd like to be able to adjust the fan downwards.
4,Edit:  While I do love it this is the 3rd one that has stopped working.  I got 2 months out of the 1st two but this last one won’t charge.I can't say enough good things about this fan.  Very powerful but very quiet.  I love that it's rechargeable and is really quiet.  Wherever I go I get asked about it lol  It's quiet enough to take to the movies with me!
2,The nightlight is only a small bulb on one side  and cannot actually be used while the fan is on.. its either the fan or the light.  I feel as if i couldve gotten a hand held from a dollar store thats pretty eqivilant to this one.
5,I've had this for a few months now mostly to hold while standing in long lines at outdoor events in the summer or even standing room only at concerts where the mass of bodies create too much body heat and makes one too hot. I've also used it while shopping by propping it up in my cart and it makes long ugly tasks so much more manageable. I've clocked it that it lasts ~6 hours on the lowest setting ~4 hours on medium and less that 2 hours on the highest. But honestly the lowest setting is powerful enough. Many people who've seen me with it want one of their own. I intend to get a few as Christmas gifts this year bc it's so inexpensive and they last. I highly recommend investing in one. I might even get another one for me just because!
5,I bought this to take on a cruise with us and now I use it whenever we travel anywhere! I have to have a fan blowing air around at night otherwise I just cannot sleep and this little fan packs a good little punch. It's quiet and powerful and I love it! A great buy!
1,I could maybe get this thing to work once.  Then the battery died.  Then it didn't seem to want to charge properly.  Then it fell off the table and broke into pieces.  Wasted money.
4,I've been using it simply connected to my computer since that is where I am a majority of my days. Therefore I don't have any comments on the battery or durability yet.Just noting for reviewers that it does blow in just one direction. There is a very very very minor difference between fan level 2 and 3. I would say that it is not very loud either so that's nice. It's a very quiet hum and easily ignored while working at least for me. Noticeable if you're easily distracted I think.Haven't had a need for the light on it so no comment on that.Otherwise it's been serving its purpose.
5,I needed something small quiet and powerful for days at work when I was covering phones.  There is a small room with 4 people and 4 computers and too much hot air :).After much research I chose eflunky Mini USB 3 speed fan.It was perfect!  So quiet and it creates a surprising powerful breeze!  I was the talk of the office everyone was so jealous!  After 2 days I found out that others were stealing it from each other to use while I was out.A week later I actually bought a second one for my friend at the office.  She loves hers too.I am so happy with this fan.  It is quiet super powerful and pretty cute!Why are you still reading?  Just buy it!
5,Use this for camping and around the house.  Great little fan.  I never use it past the low setting and it will run most of the night with the supplied 2200 mAh battery.  I replaced the stock battery with a 3250 mAh battery which gives it about 3 more hrs of runtime on low.  You can also run it off of a portable USB charger which allows it to run even longer.
5,I saw this on a Pinterest board for "Items to buy for a cruise" and since I'm always hot anyway I knew this fan wouldn't go to waste.  While one the cruise I got so many questions about the fan and people who said they would be ordering one.  It puts out so much air and the charge lasts a long time.  It is lightweight and charges quickly.  It doesn't make much noise.  I even took it to a meeting one evening because I knew I'd be in a room where they hadn't had the a/c on for a while.  It was passed around the table and used by all.  It is small enough that it fits in my purse (a larger tote) and I take it everywhere I go now.  If I could give this item SIX STARS I sure would!!!
5,I bought two of these and I love them so much. This little fan is powerful. Three speeds and a night light too. I use a fan at bedside for noise to sleep with. It’s not overly loud it can be plugged in with usb or rechargeable battery. Both work great. I travel with this as well as its compact and easy to pack.  Only wish it would pivot. I have another one that pivots but isn’t strong enough to keep my feeling cool at night I can’t say enough good things about this fan.
5,This is a superb little desk fan. On the lower setting it still pushes lots of air without being intrusive.The blue light is a bit of a gimmick and I'm not sure why I'd ever need a flashlight on a fan but it does the job it is supposed to very well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great little fanworks very well.I use it daily with no issues.
5,I bought this fan for foreign travel where I often stay in housing or study in libraries that are not air conditioned. This is a nice stylish compact fan that is small enough and tough enough for travel in my checked luggage. I carry it in a padded plastic box that was made for carrying fishing tackle. For being so small the fan has plenty of wind power. It consists of the fan a USB cord (that’s how it charges) and the battery. On the side of the box were clearly written operating instructions. You can run the fan with or without the battery if it is plugged into a USB.  I removed the little plastic covers from the feet so now it doesn't move around on my desk. Exactly what I was looking for.Many thanks to the previous reviewers who accurately described this product and its features. That was a great help in my decision making process.
5,When I first opened this fan I said “it’s tiny! What is this gonna do for me!? Awe man...” Then I turned it on. I was very very surprised at the fans speed and cooling effect. I bought it for work and have not stopped showing it off and how good it works. I love that I can recharge it. It’s small bad light and fits in my work bag perfectly. I’m super glad I found it!
5,This has been one of the best amazon purchases I have ever made. I bought this before a month long backpacking trip through Europe and it has gone above an beyond my expectations. It is very powerful for its size has three settings all of which are great. It has a rechargeable batter and is able to be used while charging. Battery life on average is about 4-5 hours if used nonstop but charges very quickly. It’s also very durable as it was put in a backpack unprotected our whole trip. We have since taken this to Disney world where it again was a great little fan.
5,This portable fan has exceeded All my expectations after factoring in the price. Very portable efficient does the job on a larger scale. The only thing better than this fan is two of them so I bought another. You should too! Thanks.
3,Need to recharge it quite often. Comparing it to another brand that I bought same time with same battery capacity. So I know it shouldn’t be normal.
5,I’m the type of person who is very picky about my sleeping conditions. I need some white noise and I need some moving air (and about ten thousand pillows). As I was traveling I decided I needed a fan to tag along with me.This little fan fit easily in my carry on and passed TSA with no issue. (Just make sure that the battery is not installed in the fan for the trip.)For such a little fan it pumped out a great bit of airflow and provided me with just enough white noise that I was completely comfortable in a different bed.
3,This is cute if you are just sitting in one area the output is ok but I've had better. One plus is it's noisy like some others.
1,I bought this mini fan for my mother a seasoned nurse to put on her medication cart. She complained to me about the torture of her "personal Summers" plus wearing masks/PPE due to covid. I'm in CA she's in NY. So I send her this top rated fan. She was super excited about how cute it was!.....first week she was off work did't use it.  Second week she used it 2-3x no issue. Weeks 3 4 passed I didn't ask her about the fan. Now 3 days AFTER the return window closes she casually mentions in conversation "by the way that fan you sent isn't working honey". She had my tech savvy Dad troubleshoot (ok maybe tech savvy is a stretch but he can use an iPhone and browse Ytube for product tutorials/reviews lol). Still it didn't work unless plugged into USB. They tried everything flipped the battery & charged again just in case that was the issue (a few other ppl noted they couldn't tell the +/- sides clearly).***Sigh. All that is to say it sucks to send your hard working nurse mother a faulty product. She cares for Covid patients everyday and I just wanted to make her a bit more comfortable. I picked it because of the # of positive product reviews and USB/rechargeable battery feature that made it super portable for her. Perhaps I just got a dud but why should I have to gamble when buying a highly recommended product? Total waste of $ and no wI have t buy a new fan from NOT this company.
5,Charge last a long time.
5,Very surprised at this fan I got it for our vacation we are taking in July and was so surprised to see how much air really comes from the fan I didn't use it very long but loved the thing when I first used it
3,We lose power from time to time due to storms.  One of my big complaints is no moving air.  I got this little fan for that.  It would be quiet but on low setting the whole frame rattles and makes a lot of noise.  Medium and high I don't get that noise.  Med/High the noise is comparable to a computer fan.  The rechargeable battery is decent.  It lasts a few hours when i've used it.  I would not recommend this for use all day/daily.  Good for an emergency backup.Pros: It's small battery life is okayCons: Noise cheaply constructed
4,I like it! Very quiet yet powerful. Convenient that I can plug it directly into my computer. The only thing I wish is that you could “tilt” it. Based on my position at my desk it blows straight into my eyes causing some mad dry eye :x but I can confirm I’m at least not sweating! :)
5,This little fan is amazing! Very lightweight & portable. Great battery life. A client was shocked that all the cool air was coming from that little fan!
5,Para ser tan pequeño tiene muy buena potencia
5,This fan is exactly what I was looking for. I use it inside the side mesh pocket of a travel backpack for my bird. It provides good controlled air circulation for him on warm days when I take him hiking. The battery lasts  a long time and I haven’t had any issues with recharging it yet.
4,I purchased this fan for keep on my office desk. I live in the desert and walking in from 110 degree weather it can take a while to cool off even with the a.c. I use this to cool off my head face and upper body simply by placing in from of me on my desk. I love the simplicity of it and it really has some power. I rarely use any other power setting usually only use 1 of 3 in power. I like that i simply plug it in to my desktop usb port and it always has power to cool me off. the battery life if great i usually get about 3.5 to 4 hours on a charge using on the first power setting.
5,I love the efluky fans!  I had two one pink and one blue.  They work so well!  I never have to put them on anything but the first setting.  I love the fact that I can recharge them and they don't have to be plugged in to work beautifully.  Anyhow they work so well - after several years - I bought TWO MORE!!  I take them to meetings and one will cool several people.  There is a fan that you have to fill with water every 20 minutes that is pushed on tv as "good as air conditioning".  It's NOT.  I bought one - horrible.  These small efluky fans are power houses and work so much better than anything else.  Thank you for making them!!!
5,we had three power outages in less than a month so i knew i needed to get a fan i could depend on. on the low setting it worked for 8 hours!! the only problem is that it takes over 5 hours to (re)charge the battery. that could pose a problem say during a hurricane when power could be out for days or weeks; eg the portable power packs i have could never keep up with the demands of this battery.  although i’ll keep this one i need to scour amazon for similar fans that recharge quickly or come with a few batteries that hold their charge.  suggestions are welcome :))
2,In all honestly this fan works wonderfully--but only while it's charging/plugged in.It just will NOT charge. I kept it plugged in overnight and by morning the red charging light was still there. If I keep it plugged in it'll work just fine; as soon as I unplug it it shuts off. Weird thing is while I have it plugged in and turned on the light changes from red to green if I pop the battery out AND will still keep spinning. I just don't get it.All in all the first setting is enough to keep me cool and is quiet enough to not be bothered by it but it's definitely annoying that it only works while plugged in. I bought it with the intention to use wherever I please but unfortunately I can only use it when I'm near an outlet.
5,Got for tent camping in Arizona and it works well for what I bought it for but when not camping have it on my desk at home and used it quite a bit during the summer there too. Very quiet.Love using portable devices with 18650 batteries and at the desk I take the battery out and run it directly through USB. A lot of power are in these batteries and they need respect I always charge them in a dedicated charger. I just don't trust devices that are not primary designed to charge so always use dedicated chargers.
5,I bought this to use on a cruise ship it packs a punch for such a small fan. I could feel it from across the room. Works great.
5,This is my second one because I love them that much! We first saw friends with one when we were at a sweltering outdoor wedding and purchased one shortly after. Besides using it daily in my makeup routine (setting spray takes forever to dry!) we’ve used it indoors outdoors for ourselves and for our toddler. The blades are fully encased so baby can tote it around without too much concern. It’s surprisingly powerful and has great battery life. There’s like no reason to not buy it.
4,I had one I used on camping trips and worked well enough to buy a second one.  It moves a good amount of air for its size and lasts as long as advertised on a charge.  The second one was not perfect but Amazon and the seller made it right asap.  I did add a guard to the button area so it was not so easy to bump the button on or off.  That is all I would change.
2,The fan is nice and quiet but only lasts on a charged battery at low speeds for 7 minutes. What a waste of money!!!
5,I bought this fan as a noise maker for my children when we travel.  It is not super loud but it does create pleasant ambient noise.  It also moves a fair amount of air.  Can be run via battery wall cord or usb into a computer (or other usb power device).  Perfect size to pack.  It works so well for what I intended it for I bought one for myself as well.  Only drawback is the fan and night light do not work at the same time.  It does have a blue led light that will work w/ the fan running but it is not the "night light" and is not very bright.  All in all it is exactly what I was looking for.
1,Update to previous review..I purchased a new USB power cable & the item now works as fully intended.The fact that I had to purchase an additional item that was in the details of purchase as 'included' forces me to retain my 1 star review.  So if you purchase this add a cable in order to have the item function as described in the item details..__________________________________Previous Review of item as delivered..If you're purchasing this fan over others you may have looked at because you see the slight color of blue illuminated.  DON'T.. there is no blue light.  The product has a light on the side that can only be used when the fan is off and even that is not blue.If you touch the fan or hold the fan something happens to the speeds & it sounds like it's dying.I sat this on my desk & it came to life;  It began to take off across my desk & had it not been for the cord attached would have thrown itself into the garbage where I feel it actually belongs.The only good thing is it provides entertainment via the devices attempts to explore my desk while it's on & I feel the only way I can stop it from trying to jump off my desk is to place either a skid pad or velcro underneath it..  ....But I didn't purchase this for entertainment I need it for it's supposed cooling abilities the only thing it cools based on its awkward position is my chest.I got a better fan at one of those super cheap stores that adjusted its base didn't move around on it's own & held one heck of a charge..  It was so great someone stole it right off my desk..
4,I was surprised by this. All the reviews were from people who were gifted the item so I was expecting this to be awful. I purchased it for a weekend camping trip. The initial use before charging on level 3 lasted 43 mins before dying.  I charged it and it lasted 1hr48 mins on level 3. Charged it again and it lasted about 3 hours or so on levels 1 and 2.I definitely liked having this. It didn't just blow around hot air either. My partner's aunt is sickly and I spent a lot of the weekend holding it over her. She really liked it. I'm pretty impressed. Let's see how long it lasts.I paid for this with my own money.
5,My work desk is in one of the warmer areas of the building. This cuts the heat so well. It's got a powerful little motor but is pretty quiet. The battery survives about 2 8-hr work days. Plus it's a pretty turquoise color!Update: It's been about 10 months and this little fan is still fantastic. I've only rarely needed to turn it up to high because even it's low is pretty powerful. Battery life is still strong and it shows no scars despite being dropped/knocked over repeatedly from various heights (I have cats)  and moved several times.  Definitely a great purchase. Would buy again.
4,This fan is perfect for tent camping.  It's portable and gives off a good strong wind speed.  Nice that it is rechargeable.  Would be nice if it had a hook on it for hanging locations.
5,I use this at work and it does what's expected.  I haven't used battery power except to show others how cool it is.  I really like the blue light by the fan.  Doesn't do anything but looks cool.  Level 1 (of 3) and I can't hear it but it blows just enough air to keep me cool in an office that's usually on the warmer side.Good value and works like it says.  I would recommend.
5,Charges fast and perfect small size to fit in purse
5,Quiet. Good battery life. Nice little fan.
5,Love this fan. We bought for our tent because our real vacation was canceled due to covid I will use in my home office as a white noise. Doesn’t take too long to charge has a powerful wind. Good value. Charged it in our hybrid intermittently for our 10 day camping trip and it was phenomenal. Didn’t last all night but we didn’t need it to.
5,Excellent
4,I really am happy with how much air this fan can move. I really wish the batter life was longer or if they sold a battery kit so I could have additional batteries and a charger.
5,I use this at work and it's great.  Not loud.  Battery doesn't last to long  but I plug it into my power bank and it works great. Would recommend and purchase again.
3,Writing this review after using a co-workers fan for 5 months and finally ordering one for my self because we are now working the same shift. Fan works great more than enough air flow. However when the fan is on max speed it vibrates on desk and moves around. Also if you run the fan all day even though it is connected to a power source it drains the battery making it not portable. So as long as you don't plan on using it on battery power after using it while plugged in its a great fan. As stated above I'm buying one after using co-works for months so basically this fan has been running for 5 months straight with no issue other than needing to be plugged into power source...
5,Very powerful fan. There are 3 settings. 123 and I can only keep it on 1 or I will freeze. Fan comes with a USB cord and I plug it up to my computer word desk. Tell battery seems to die fast. So small I carry it in my pocket to and from work. Also came in very hand on a beach trip. We bought a portable battery charger and ran it all day at the beach. If it's ever "missing" my husband is using it in his workshop. Also has a pretty bright light on the side that can be turned on and off
2,Even after a full charge I am lucky to get 3 hrs from this fan- that’s ridiculous !Three speeds / first two are a joke - last one on high is pretty good-Took it to Florida where my family always leaves temp on a scolding 78.. put fan next  to my face - and it always was totally depleted within 2-3 hrs at most — that’s just plan absurd when it’s fully chargedKeep it plugged in and it’s not half bad as a desk or super mini fan —Fit in my brief case on the plane —Prob will keep it for many years and continue to get pissed by the super super poor nutty battery the companies chinced out on
4,I like that it's compact and blows quietly.
3,First the good stuff. This little fan is pretty powerful and if you wanted to use on a desk or such it would be great. However I bought two of these because they were linked in article for top cruise gear and for that purpose they didn't work well at all. They are small which means when sat on the side table they are below the level of the bed. They are pretty quiet which means they don't block out any other noise. The battery doesn't last all night in fact I'd say it only lasted about half the night. If you are looking for a small fan for a cruise keep looking if you're looking for a fan for your desk this will be a good one.
4,Good little fan pretty quiet on low speed which is all I need. I place it by the lower vent in my locker as sort of an "exhaust" to circulate air and dry my clothes. Charge seems to last around 6 hours on low. Then plug it into my workstation to charge overnight and do it all over again.I would love to find a way to hang it directly from the louvers I think it would move more air through the locker. Right now I have to place it on the floor about an inch back so I can close the locker door.
5,I bought this fan several months ago and let me tell you..................I love it.  I seriously rarely go a night without having that fan on even when it is in the forties now with winter coming.  I am so happy it is so portable.  I even bought my mom one and she uses it all the time.  She walks around the house holding hers!  Especially great for when you feel like you are boiling due to "the change"!  If this one stops working let me tell you I would order another one immediately.The only con to it is that the battery does not last all night.  I just keep mine plugged in all the time.
5,I liked that I can charge this anywhere there is a USB port so I can recharge it in my car if I need to.  I bought this to take to bowling and it fits well in my bowling bag.  It has 3 power levels and gives out a great amount of air on all 3 levels.  Noise is minimal so it doesn't bother anyone.  So this works really well for what I bought it for.
5,I bought this fan to take to school & plug into my computer's USB port.  As a woman of a certain age who's returned to college I find that I get a bit warmer than the other students.  A female instructor of a similar age suggested I get one of these fans.  I didn't even know these existed but wow - what a lifesaver.  Small enough that I can stick it in my backpack and take it from class to class.  Just powerful enough to take the edge off of that uncomfortable facial/neck warmth from hot flashes.  I can't speak to the durability of the battery because I haven't used it without the cord but for my purposes it's great.
5,I wanted to wait a bit before I left a review for this product since I initially bought this as a replacement for a different compact fan from another seller. I have nothing but good things to say about this fan. I just have it at my desk at work but it does its job very well.I have run this thing for at least 9 hours a day 5 days a week continuously since March which is a testament to how well this holds up. I've even convinced a handful of co-workers to get the exact same one for their desks.There isn't much else to say - this is simply a quality small fan for personal use. I didn't get a discount or any incentive to write this - I just wanted to leave some good feedback for a good product.
3,So I bought this for work. I do a lot of walking and sometimes running. Helps out when I do get the Chan to sit in front of it. Reason for the low stars. Had this less than a week and after use 2 the battery stopped working. Only way to use fan is with battery out and plugged to the computer.
4,Bought two of these fans hoping we could use them in our toy hauler trailer while campng to cool down two areas when no power was available but they do not push enough air to cool down the areas unless you are sitting or laying right next to the fan.  Along with the air conditioner or whole house fan at home they make great bedside or chair fans for that extra air movement of the cool air even on the lowest setting.  Also worked great at my office for air circulation and will work in the trailer anytime we have power.
4,Need a little product. Didn’t realize how small it was so I had to return it. If you’re looking for a very small fan that’s rechargeable I would recommend.
5,The model of this fan is actually a Lileng 831 as it says on the box but it doesnt really matter. It has three settings and low still blows pretty strong. I really like the fact that I can still use it while its plugged in. The actual battery lasted me about three hours on high setting but obviously lasts longer on a lower setting. The one thing it doesn't have is the option for using regular batteries which I don't mind but some people might. The battery compartment is only for its rechargeable battery. Pretty quiet not silent but its not annoying either. No handle or kickstand which proved annoying at first fixed that with a little adhesive velcro to make sure it doesnt fall over every time my desk moves. I am buying another regardless its been a real lifesaver on these hot days.
5,I just got my fan today and this is the best fan I've ever come across. I haven't tried the battery yet  but it works on my charger and it blows really great. Even on low it it's got a great flow to it and it's very quiet as far as I'm concerned.. I love it I would advise anybody who is a fan addict to get this fan.
5,I was looking for a small portable desk fan this fit the bill quite nicely. I spend 6 or 7 hours per day at one desk and another 1 or 2 hours per day at another desk. This fan works perfectly for this situation. I leave the USB cord at my primary desk and go to battery power when I am at my secondary desk. This fan is no wind machine it moves enough air to help me feel comfortable but it does not force me to weigh down loose papers on my desks. It is quite quiet and is very easy to setup and use. I would recommend it for anyone that is looking to circulate air in their immediate area.
4,This fan does the trick. We bought it for our 5 month old. We were going to the beach and needed something for the tent. She is a hotbox and get a so hot. This helped her stay cool and kept us on the beach. We also used it in her stroller at night to help keeps the bugs off of her while cooking out with friends. She falls asleep every time. I'm giving a 4 star because I was it had some type of clip. But we put zip ties on the back and attatched a chip clip to the zip tie. It works.
4,This is the best little fan. On a full charge it will run all night. It had three speeds (I only used low and it was sufficient). It is quiet. It has a flashlight and a cool blue light around the blades.......but sadly I have only had it less than 3 months and it will no longer work. I am now searching for a new battery but have had no luck finding one.I bought this fan again. We were able to get the original fan to work with one (stupid) battery Adjustment. We love the fan so I bought another. I would definitely recommend this fan it is lightweight and very quiet.
5,I love these fans I bought my first one a few months ago and have bought one in every color since then. My husband and I both Use them on hot days/evenings they are great for individual cooling. Battery life is good and they look nice too. The light option is fun to use sometimes too!
5,I was very happy with this fan . Quiet yet will blow you away.
5,I use one of these in my car for my lunch break.  Why don't I use the break room?  Well there is this guy that eats broccoli and popcorn for lunch and makes it smell weird as hell in there.  I try to be nice and not comment on it but come on how much self control does someone need to not make a comment like "wow Jerry that's a really interesting food choice you have there maybe you should take all of that and go eat it outside so the rest of us can gossip in peace?"  Anyway  works great.
4,I am only giving this four star due to the fact that the unit DOES NOT charge while it's in use. Also the fan speed is not full power when it is charging. I am able to get about 1hr58min out of the fan at level 3..The fan pumps out a decent amount of air and I love using it during the afternoon in my office space. All-in-All the fan is a well made however I wish there was a firmware update that could resolve those two issues mentioned above.
5,Needed this for a vacation. Comes in handy in the house too.
4,this does what I want it to do but it is a small plastic fan.  I run it on my night stand at night to keep air moving.
5,I ordered this as a replacement for an identical fan I managed to melt on my heater. A very versatile fan for home or travel. Just enough white noise to get me to sleep.
5,this thing is absolutely fantastic and I did not expect this at all. I figured this may last a few weeks/months but I have been using this fan daily at my office desk and it has held up great. I bought this to have for the hurricane season in case the AC went out and I am glad I have this. I have had it since September of 2017 and honestly cannot believe the battery is still holding a charge. I only typically use this on the lowest setting for those wondering. I cannot speak to the flashlight durability or anything like that. I am about to get another one now for the upcoming hurricane season but hopefully I will not have to use it!
5,This fan puts out the air!!! I like that it had high and low. I didn’t know what to put on Noise it’s not loud at all. It’s a fan so to me it’s suppose to cool me off and it does a great job! I don’t know what Warm is for. I really like this little personal fan!
5,This small fan is perfect for our small bathroom because it does not require an outlet. It's portability make it movable to any location in the bathroom. The speeds give me the ability to blow high or low to circulate  airfor freshness.
5,I ordered this on a whim.  I was looking for a fab to move air past an electric heater.  I actually ordered two on accident and for the price wasn't worried about returning it.  My sister in law came for a visit.  She is an avid camper and was amazed by the performance.  She left with the second one.Some notes:This runs on an 18650 cell.  This is a common battery in rechargeable flashlights.The unit has a micro USB port  to charge the battery that can be charged by most android phone chargers.  When plugged in the fan speed  is reduced significantly to charge the battery.The run time on high is about six hours.  Care should be taken to not fully deplete these batteries.These are a good deal if their use fits your need.
1,Charger cable does not stay in the fan. I guess you get what you pay for. No way to charge it. I would say do not buy this cheap fan
2,I got this for my sister and she has to take the battier out to charge it so she can't use it until its charge not happy
5,Looks small  but works great ! Fan can cool a bedroom !
5,I love this little fan.  I am a nurse and it so hot on the nursing unit I have it plugged into the computer I use.  It great because it only cools me and no one else.
5,My bald head gets a little sweaty when I'm on a treadmill at the gym.  I usually have a wet wash cloth to help with this but once I put this fan in one of the treadmill cup holders positioning it with cell phone and a workout glove it kept my head perfectly cool on the middle fan speed setting.  Now with washcloth and fan I get an evaporative cooler effect at skin level very nice.
1,Think I got a defective one. It pulled energy from  battery when plugged in. I expected it to recharge battery while using USB mode. After one month it will only operate if plugged in. About to contact customer service.
5,Nice portable fan.  Quite strong for the size and pretty good battery very pleased.
4,Overall I'm very glad that I bought this fan.  It moves enough air on its lowest setting to make my stuffy office a lot more pleasant.  But it does give off an audible hum.  It is very lightweight.  I leave it plugged into a USB port on my office PC and took out the battery and it works great.
5,When this arrived I was bummed b/c I definitely had the impression that it was a little bit bigger in size however don't let the size fool you. This little fan is quiet and powerful. On low it's super quiet on high it's a good white noise but not too loud to overpower my radio or a distraction. As the battery dies I do notice that the fan is less "cold" and more of just circulating air. On a charged battery I can get a good 5 hours on medium or level 2 without having to recharge. It does only use a USB cord and you need an accessible port or a usb "plug" to use on a electrical socket. Either way I'm very pleased!
5,Use this for my camping during the hot summer.Pros:Quiet little fanMoves a lot of airMulti SpeedUsb and battery poweredSlek designLong BatteryCons:NoneI have used this while camping for the whole summer. It will stay powered all night to blow the air on me. I only plug it in every now and then to charge the battery and it is a must have. I dont know how I made it through those long hot summer nights spent at the lake without it. We dont drop below 85-90 degrees at nights during the summer its hot. Having this moving air blowing on my uper half is a blessing. It also folds up in my tent very nicely I just leave it stowed in there.
4,Was happy with this fan. BUT it didn't have color changing light. It came with a built in flashlight. That works okay. Noise is pretty quiet.
4,The fan works great however I did not receive the cable or the battery in my box. Check your package when it arrives. I received it just 2 days before traveling out of town so I didn't have a chance to send it back. I found a cable to take with me and was able to use it but really wish it had come with the parts as described. The fan outs out a good amount of air for us size and did help me to sleep while traveling on a cruise ship that can get hot sometimes in the staterooms. If I had gotten parts I would give it five stars.
4,Fully charged it only lasted 1/2 hr. not plugged in. Was 1st time. So I don't know. It is a cute little fan though and can cool you off at your desk or wherever.
5,I take this fan with me when I have to wait in my vehicle. It has been a life saver in this Summer's heat.
5,It had plenty of power and I can take it to any room I’m in.
5,I use this fan at work because it gets too hot! My co-workers like it and they all will buy one. The only thing I don’t like is it doesn’t rotate but the air it very powerful very impressed.
5,I can’t find anything that I dislike.  I have one for work and one at home. I use it at home and when I travel.  Great airflow for such a small device
4,A three-speed fan that helps me cool off at work during the hot summer! It works just fine. The only real issue is that you can't aim it so I usually prop it against something to make it blow towards my face. Otherwise  it's a great fan that you can just carry around and blow yourself with. heh. Blow yourself.
5,Amazing! This little fan has some power! Used it at a birthday party at the park on a hot day. Everyone was trying to use it cause it it super impressive!The battery lasted all day and then some no problems. Only thing that kinda sucks is it turns on by a push button on the front that’s really easy to push. I threw it in a box when leaving and it turned on and I didn’t know. So you couldn’t have it in a bag or purse or anything it would turn on.
5,This little fan puts out a lot of air.  You can feel the breeze 6 feet away!  It is a great product.  Will be buying more of them in the near future.  It has a medium level loudness.  With this much air out of a small package you can expect some noise honestly.  I don't mind it but don't expect it to be whisper quiet like some folks say.  You definitely notice it is on even on the low setting but if you aren't "sensitive" to noise like that then it shouldn't bother you.  It doesn't bother me at all.  Only thing I wish it had was a tilt up/down feature but I knew what I was buying... a STRONG LITTLE FAN.
1,I bought this to use for work and am unable to do so. The battery doesn't charge at all and the fan only works if plugged in via USB. I wasted money on this purchase!
5,Was hesitant seeing the reviews in exchange for free sample but I love it too.  Surpising air flow and noise level (low).  I am easily annoyed by fan noises and this one has a lower hum/buzz sound than most that bothers me much less.  It is not super quiet but quiet and to me the tone makes all the difference.  I am using the low mostly because it is very easy to ignore and still really moves some air.The air is directed in a very strong and distinct "column" good engineering.With all that said it is definitely best for personal cooling I don't think it would be reasonable to expect much cooling from across the room or anything like that.  I would say 3-4 feet is the effective range.
4,This fan does deliver a nice breeze.  I keep it plugged into my laptop on my desk so haven't used the rechargeable battery yet.  It is light and portable.  The controls are easy to use.  Plugged it in and started using it right out of the box.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you can't adjust the angle. It wasn't advertised that way but I would say it is the only downside to this fan.I do recommend this product but be aware that it does not tilt or rotate.
5,I love this fan!  I am a woman in her 50's who has her own private summertimes.  I keep this fan connected to my docking station on my desk  through the USB port.  It runs almost constantly during the day when I am in my office.  It has 3 speeds which is handy depending on my internal temperature.  It is relatively quiet.  It does not interfere with phone conversations.  I am always much hotter than everyone else in the meeting room.  This fan plugs into my computer to charge and is portable enough to fit in my work bag to take with me to meetings when needed.  Love it!
4,Battery cover broke off easily but very good fan overall. Definitely recommend
5,This little fan packs a pretty good amount of power for such a little item. It came with a lithium battery that you place in the unit you then connect that to any USB charger and in a few hours it's good to go. I use it in my bedroom since I need a fan to sleep and didn't want a big over powered unit. The little light on the side comes in handy in the dark too.There are 3 settings and even on the lowest I found it was great for circulating the air in my room. The only minor drawback was the fact that it had a little more noise than I would have hoped but that's a HUGE issue. It works efficiently and quite nice.
5,I ordered the efluky 3 Speeds Mini Desk Fan to replace one of our Holmes rechargeable mini fans.  The efluky seems to move more air than the Holmes.  The one disadvantage is that the efluky fan does not have a tilting base as does the Holmes.  The battery doesn't last as long as I would have liked.  When the battery runs out I connect the fan to a small portable  Power Bank.
3,Very weak on air flow
4,Update: the company sent an email and stated some malfunctions with the fan and they fixed it and sent a new fan. Works well and now the charger fits. So far it's good and I gave it 4 stars because it would be perfect if it tilted. However a strong airflow and great device!Do not buy! I thought it would work out perfectly but the charging cord does not fit and it never charges. I'm just sorry I waited so long to use because now I can not return. It will not charge at all!!
5,Surprisingly moves a lot of air. At first I was skeptical that a USB fan would be powerful enough to keep me cool but this little fan has me convinced. I usually leave it at the lowest speed and it satisfies immensely. Since getting it I've used the fan in my room sparingly. I very much prefer this close-up local cooling. Sure when charging the fan is only capable of one speed (a tad lower than the lowest speed) but even that is more than OK. The built-in light is too weak but I didn't buy the fan for that. The battery lasts 3-4 hours at the lowest speed. This is lower than claimed in the product listing but I think that's ok. I've got a powerbank to juice it up again as required.
5,Love traveling with the Efluky 3 Speed Mini Desk fan. Noise level and battery life is great as well!
5,This was one of the best things that I have purchased all year. For the price you cannot beat this little guy. I was going to be in the field (Army speak for doing Army training where you camp) for 3 weeks in the California desert. I knew I would have the ability to recharge it and it never let me down. Powerful little thing just kept running no matter how much it got tossed around or bounced around in my pocket. The fan works the best meaning highest speed on battery power. When it is plugged in is slows down a bit. I thought that was funny. But it works great!
4,Works great puts out really good amount of air for such a small fan lasted all night on second speed easy and quick to recharge.  The only con is that the base is too small so if you are using it on anything except a flat hard surface it tips over.  Perfect for tent camping in the summer but you can't put it on the floor of a tent because it falls over at the slightest movement.  Needs a wider base.
4,Took this to Alaska with us because our cabin had no air and we were there during record high temps. This little gem saved us!! Also used it on the cruise ship.. worked perfectly. And this thing really has a powerful output of air...more than enough for us and I didn't even get to the highest setting. Great product.
4,The item works very well except that it's advertised with battery life of 8 hours for the slowest speed.But it only lasts a little over 4 hours with a fully recharged battery..Update - February 22 2017:It's still working one year and almost eight months later using it 5 to 10 hours per week. The battery is still charging too. It still blows air at 3 speeds. I hardly ever have to use it at the two higher speeds. Given its consistent performance over such a stretch of time and its price I would increase its rating from 3 to 4 stars.
5,This is my 5th purchase of these fans. They work great. I keep finding a new place to use them. I keep one on my desk at work my husband took one for his RV I have a few in various windows to pull the cool air in at night. They are just an all around great little fan.
4,So far so good. I needed a small fan for work and this fit what I needed. It is pretty quiet even on the highest speed setting. It is also very lightweight which is nice since I have to move it between desks- I can toss it in my work bag without adding too much weight. However because it is lightweight it feels a bit like it might break easily but for a plastic fan I can’t complain too much about that.
1,Battery life is not even long enough to bowl 3 games in league very disappointed. So as much as I like the size it’s useless to me. I have to go find one that will last!
5,I just charged it and turned it on and wow!!! I have it on high and I'm standing 6ft away and it works excellent. It is a little loud but it's so strong! The battery life is good so far. It's been on high for 1 hour now and still going strong. I didnt have high expectations for this but I am very happy with it. Definitely would buy again and recommend.
5,Great little fan that is portable...great to carry with me on hiking.  The fan is powerful that generates good air flow.  Worth it if you can get it on sale.
5,Nice little and powerful fan. The 18650 batter provided gives this little fan some air pushin' ability. Even on low it puts out a nice airflow. I need it for when I travel and need to sleep. I always have a fan on me or it is harder to sleep. This fan will do the work. It is not a super quiet fan at the higher speeds but for me that is perfect for some white noise while I sleep. At the higher speed make sure to put a rag or something underneath it if you are going to put it on a hard surface. The slight vibration makes the fan want to walk.
5,It is a great little fan. I bought this for my niece after I got one for myself. It is  excellent quality. And I like that it works while charging it it is fairly quiet and runs a long time on each charge.  Thank you.
5,We bought one of these for our boat last December. Our boat is in Mexico and it is blessed hot. Fans are important. We want a lot of them and we want to move plenty of air. This little guy lasts a long time is lightweight and you can sit it anywhere close to you to keep your personal airspace moving around. I love it so much we bought another one during this trip to the states. Probably should have bought even more. Did I already say I love it? Because i do.
5,So I bought this little fan for the gym. I wear a suit every day and also hit the sauna after my workout. Needless to say it takes a while to cool down even after the shower. Then I put on a suit!  This thing is powerful enough to help me cool down. And it's very compact and light weight.  My last fan required D batteries and I often would accidentally turn it on in my gym bag. We all know how expensive batteries are! More than the fan itself! Problem solved with this little guy. I just plug it into my car USB and we're good to go. I've only had it for two weeks but the best investment I've made in a while to this point!
5,This thing is awesome! My laptop is old and the fan doesn't work properly anymore. This little desk fan is small enough to set up right next to my laptop to prevent it from overheating. It holds a pretty decent charge so I can use it for a while when it's not plugged in. It's quiet but surprisingly powerful at the highest setting for how small it is.My only complaint is the orange light that comes on when the power is on. I wish there was an option to turn that off. It's not terribly bright but I'm very sensitive to light. I ended up tying a scarf around the base to block the light so I could sleep with it next to me.
5,I have had this fan for maybe an hour. While I worry about battery issues and trying to replace it if I ever should need to. I feel this is the BEST fan I have ever purchased. I have a hard time sleeping when hot. And living in Florida that is quite difficult to avoid. So since my last fan broke. I found this one relatively cheap and in my favorite colour so I simply could not resist. On the lowest setting I am currently chilly. It is the best. Very powerful for one so small. I am so happy. I hope it holds up. I’ll update if there are any issues.
4,I bought this to keep on my desk at work as the temperature really fluctuates and occasionally makes me feel as though I'm sitting in a sauna. It's small fairly quiet and pretty powerful. I've only ever needed to use it on the first setting as that does the trick. The only reason it isn't getting four stars is because it does seem to die pretty quickly. It comes with a USB cable so I can charge it easily; I just wish it lasted a bit longer. It does exactly what I need though and would buy it again.
5,This little fan puts off much power never have to use the second or third levels. You can hardly hear it and it fits perfectly anywhere on my desk even sitting in front of my computer.
3,Perhaps I received a "dud"....the battery has never charged and its been plugged in for days.  And the instructions say that the fan has an interior light and a side light.  The interior light does not exist on my fan.  The side light does work.  I have to keep the fan plugged in the electrical socket in order to use it.  That is okay for me but if someone wants portable this is not it.  Again perhaps I got a lemon.  I am not taking the trouble of returning it.
5,I absolutely LOVE these fans! I'm in Hot Flash Hell most of the time so these little dynamo's are the perfect solution for that! They are well made and love that they have mulit-speeds. I use one on my desk at work and the other one wherever I need it. In the bathroom when getting ready for work on my end table while watching tv etc. They are extremely quiet and really move the air for such a small fan. And the best part is they are rechargeable! I won't be without these little life savers!! The only negative is that when on high speed they tend to vibrate and can fall off whatever they are sitting on. Other than that.... I Highly recommend!!
2,cute fan quite and lightweight but the battery life is crap.
1,This fan stopped working one day after just 5 weeks of intermittent use in office setting. There is only a return policy for 30 days offered and there is no warranty through Amazon or the seller.
5,This fan has been a lifesaver for me with my office's inconsistent temperature. The lowest speed is strong enough to keep me cool even when the office is hot and sticky. I rarely have to use a higher speed. The fan is a bit noisier as you increase the speed but it's not enough to be a nuisance. When fully charged on level 1 I can get nearly a full day of "constant" use (with an hour lunch). Normally I just have mine plugged into my docking station.
5,This tiny fan is very powerful. It makes a minimal white noise on the highest setting. I was hoping for a louder noise to drown out my husbands snoring but I digress. It is perfect to keep you cool! I’ve owned it for 3 weeks but I usually keep it plugged in so I do not know how long the battery would last. The night light only works when the fan was off. I was disappointed in that because I thought by the description it would at the same time. All in all I totally recommend it.
5,I'm giving this fan 5 stars because it's going to be two years since I bought it and it's still blowing air even after several falls throughout that time. It still holds a good charge of battery and all three levels work fine. The light does come in handy some times. It works while charging but the highest level will blow the same as the medium level. I would buy it again if anything happens to the one I own.
4,The 3 speeds of the fan are strong unfortunately it vibrates turns backwards frequently. It does not have a directional adjustment it only blows  straight at fan level. Also the rechargeable battery does not hold its charge. I wanted to return it but the company would deduct &4.95. I am stuck with a poorly functioning product.
5,I like the product because you can carry it anywhere and it not too big and it’s not noisy
4,I was looking for something affordable and portable  to cool me down during the summer indoors and out as we go to a lot of outside events that can be unbearable in the summer heat and humidity. This fan met my needs. Outside I can plug it into my portable battery pack for unending use. On my desk at home I often use it for drying my nails. Is a great little unit.
5,When I opened the box I was a little apprehensive because of how small it was but this fan works really well alot better than fans of similar size keeps me cool and it's not too loud.
5,This little fan is amazing! I run around a lot for my job and start to sweat off my makeup before even half the day is done. This little fan packs a punch as far as the cool breeze (even on level 1 the breeze is amazing!) and really cools you down in a short period of time! I brought it to work and showed everyone how powerful and great it was for how small it is. you will not be disappointed with this purchase!
5,Totally impressed with this little fan. Works great for camping in a tent etc. Recently lost power for 4 days in a hot humid environment - this little guy was a life saver. Impressive battery life fully charged lasted all night. Excellent device with decent build quality. Will buy another.  Highly recommended.
5,Really a cute fan that charges with USB last long enough for temporary cooling. Moves air very quietly.
5,I love this little fan! We have been taking it with us whenever we travel because we like the white noise of a fan when we sleep. It is tiny (so easy to pack) and puts off a decent amount of air and sound. Battery has been lasting about 8 hours. Also I feel like it will be great to take to basketball games to keep us cool this summer!
5,I got my fan earlier today and earlier than expected!!  I'm beyond amazed with it.  The fan is SUPER POWERFUL!!!  On low it is more than excellent  and it has 3 speeds!!  The only thing that could make it better is perhaps a pedestal that is at an angle so it could be angled up.  Lucky for me my hubby can make one on a 3D printer!  Still I love this!!  Super light charges fast  haven't checked yet how long the battery lasts but certainly earns 5 stars so far!  Rarely do I rate things by choice but I chose to do so with this!!
5,Nice and quiet. Placed on nightstand for a soft breeze and white noise. This fan also has a neat little light for middle of the night bathroom run.
5,Was impressed by the fan.  Bought it before hurricane Irma.  It worked great.  It would have been nice to have a longer USB cord.  We had a big power supply that had several USB charger ports for power that we kept on a table but the USB cod to the fan was not long enough to reach were people needed the fan.  It was so very hot that we ran out of batteries really quick and very costly. . USB charge was the only way to go.  Would love for the fan to come in a bigger size.  Efluky Mini USB 3 Speeds Rechargeable Portable Table Fan 4.5-Inch Black
4,Works great except if you're charging the battery or running on USB alone (with battery taken out it's a large tubular Li-ion battery like for some vape mods) the third speed level doesn't go any faster than speed 2. As well high-speed gets kinda noisy but it's no worse than any other desk fan. There's a single LED light on the right side of the unit in case you ran out of other nifty USB flashlights that turns the fan itself off while on.
5,I bought this fan to keep a light from going on at my storage unit.  The light turns off when there's no movement detected.  This little fan does the trick in moving a piece of taped tissue to keep the light from shutting off.  This was the perfect affordable device.  In the summer time I plan to use it near my desk.  One feature it lacks is that the fan does not have a tilting base so you cannot aim the fan up or down.  It's a good value for the money and I'm happy with the purchase.
5,Small quiet desk fan with 3 speeds and a light! Comes with a USB port that can plug in to a computer. Puts out a lot of air. Great product!
4,I purchased this for my family for use right after Hurricane Maria. I purchased several and some worked well and some didn't. For one of them the battery just would not charge.The other issue is that I wish I could connect it to other power sources to charge up. Easier to find batteries would be better. I appreciate that it is rechargeable.
4,I have hot flashes ( my husband calls them nuclear meltdowns) and keep this fan on my end table. It works great and cools me down fast. I just wish it stayed charged longer. I usually have to charge it once a week.
5,the pictures are very deceiving as it is a lot smaller than what you visualize from them.  But the fan cranks a lot of air flow very surprised how well it works and keeps you very cool.  great buy very mobile we use it every where
4,It’s a nice fan. Not silent but not noisy. I wish it had a tilt on it but oh well. I would have given 5 stars but I didn’t really sound like Darth Vader when I talked into it.
5,Absolutely love it even though it last for a little while I got a charge the battery it has so much power for such a little thing unbelievable my mom had one at her house I couldn’t believe how much air that little thing put out so I have kittens in closet so I don’t have it so I put a little fan in there and it cools off the closet so well totally portable
5,I bought this for work I work in a clinic and it can get quite warm.  This fan is amazing!! I can't tell you how many of my co-workers have purchased these.  I have mine for almost 4 years! No issues with the battery it's holds a charge and the usb adapter makes it easy to plug into any work area.  Thank you!!!
5,Wonderful fan! 4 power levels Nice cool strong breeze on high mode. Make low humming sound on high but not annoying. Runs (about 5-6 (?) hours on high) long time before needing recharge.  I never ran it long time. Usually I charge it up before it runs out. Has a single LED bulb light as one of the functions. Nice sturdy construction.  Charges via USB port. I think a plug charger is available & purchased separately. One downside is its slim profile it makes difficult to stand the fan up on uneven surfaces. I wish there was a movable sliding flat piece on the bottom that would create an "X" shape on the bottom to hold the fan up.
3,The discription says a blue light. There was not a blue light. Otherwise works great.
5,This items is amazing m especially when the power is gone and it’s hot
5,These little fans are the best. I have bought a few and they work great. I even bought them as gifts. They are quiet for your desk as you work on your computer.
3,These don't last as long as my older ones
5,I love this fan I work in a warehouse and it gets very hot but this fan helps so much. It has good power the only thing that sucks is the battery. Even after charging it 100 % it only last about an hour or so I just keep the USB plugged into a wireless battery pack all day.Never seen a battery like the one that comes with it.I just ordered a second fan just like it so even with its faults I still think it's a great fan to have.
5,The item is cute and small but it is very strong.  It fans at a great distance.  Also the battery last more than a couple of hours if used continuously.  And it doesn't overheat.  I like it and the pink color is a plus.
5,This fan is amazing. It is small compact packs one heck of a punch. Has 3 different modes adjustable by simply utilizing the on button. Also comes with flashlight in the event it’s too dark to see and you happen to be holding your fan. Comes with micro usb cable (not lightning) which charges the included 18650 battery. Fan lasts about 2 hours on high 3 hours on medium 4 hours on low. More or less.... Fan is quite enough to use in office unless it’s on high setting. Fan is wonderful thank you :)
5,These fans are the BOMB. My hubby & I own about 5 of them and have them scattered throughout the house. I use them often because I get hot flashes a lot and I can just reach for one of these fans and it's such a relief! They have three speeds lots of power and even have a little light on one side. Also there is a separate button to shut it off. A perfect size for one person. I have one sitting on my office desk one by my bed one in the kitchen..... they are so handy and a great value. Highly recommend!
4,Nice fan. Got it for camping. On low batteries did not run all night. Woke up 6 hrs later and fan wad dead.Update.. Fan is really nice for what it is. I noticed the power on button can easily be pushed when packing this fan in totes or bags.
5,It's mini but the fan has good power to cool a small area or a single individual. I like that it has three different levels and a light source. I purchased this with the intention of putting it in the car when I take my dog places that I cannot bring him in. Although I leave all the windows down and park in the shade I still worry it's too hot for him. This will be a good addition to help him stay cool when I pick up something from the grocery etc. Love that it's portable and rechargable. Good price. Good shipping. Would recommend.
5,It works fine but does not hold a charge very long. This is my 2nd one purchased. Once the battery does not recharge anymore you may as well throw it away and buy a new one because you can never find a battery for these.
5,I love this fan.  It is rechargeable and battery operated.  I love that fact because it does not have to be plugged in all the time in order to work. It holds its charge for a long time.  Recently I went on a trip and was able to use the fan at night to keep me cool when I had no access to a plug near my bed.  The only thing that is a bit challenging is that it falls over some because of the narrow base.  The narrow base does make it easier to pack for transport though.  I would definitely buy this fan again.
5,the fan itself is simple and works as intended.  On high speed the internal rechargeable battery doesn't last that long but I had an external power bank that during the night I had it plugged into and it would run all night and still be on in the AM
3,Ordered twice. Returned the first one because it didn’t work at all. It wouldn’t even work while plugged in. The second one works but only when plugged in. I do like it though I keep it on my night stand and it helps keep me cool while I’m sleeping. I wanted to be able to take it outside but it looks like that won’t be happening. These days returning is too much of a hassle so I’ll just keep it and use it while it’s plugged in.
5,Great fan and people always ask where did I get it from
4,I wanted a fan I could use for our dogs (yes in the Texas heat) & at the gym when getting dressed.  I researched and found this one to meet my needs.  It works great travels well and the price was good too.  I read reviews where it would turn on & off but that just means the battery needs to be charged.  Very pleased with my purchase.
5,Great little rechargeable fan with light. Also has the option to keep a small light in the center on while it's blowing. Great for vacation.
5,I recently deployed to the middle east and this little fan was a life saver.  It is very small and its profile is fairly thin so it is very easy to pack.  I used in my dorm room at night plugged into a USB and it kept me much cooler in the desert summer heat.  I took it to work for my office during the day where it would provide 3-4 hours of cooling during the hottest portion of my shift.You can hook this up to a USB battery pair it up with a USB flex LED light and have yourself a nice portable office. I would highly recommend this item for service men & women for deployment operations.
5,What a surprise this purchase was to me. It had very good ratings but I was shocked at how much air it would push out. This uses the same type of battery my flashlights use so I've got enough batteries to run this thing for days. The led light in it is a nice bonus as well.  I plan to use this fan when I camp or fish (or both).  It is quite small and fits in my tackle box and the pocket of my backpack.
5,this is the perfect size little desk fan and super cute! I actually use it for traveling for white noise! I gave it four stars for a battery because it didn’t last a full night on one charge… That being said it does plug-in.
5,I love that you can recharge this little fan on your computer and then unplug it and carry it with you if needed to move around. It has 3 settings. It's not too loud so you won't draw attention during a hot flash.I had a battery powered fan and those batteries didn't last a week at a time---this is the perfect alternative.I LOVE this little fan. It packs a lot of power. I'm thinking about getting a couple for home---one by the stove and one by the bed.
4,Very quiet; easy to knock over due to the small base; the battery life sucks it won't even last through the night. In all for what I need it for it serves it purpose and I would buy this fan again.
5,Does exactly what I have expected. Quiet. Useful difference between the 3 speeds. Convenient Off button obviates the need to cycle thru speeds to stop the fan.
5,when i opened the amazon box i said oh no amazon what you done sent me??the best best best lil fan on the planet!!!
4,Needed a portable fan for the wife while on vacation and this worked exceptionally well. The USB charger means that it works with multiple different electric utilities for overseas travel. The charge seemed to work for 8 hours. While it has a nightlite feature we found it unnecessary. Surprisingly strong flow for such a small unit.It's light weight and small size made it perfect for travel.
5,My husband loves air blowing on him while he studies or relaxes. His old fan was noisy and not transportable. This one is SO quiet and is perfect for one person. He can take is to the living room to watch tv the bedroom to read or the kitchen table to work. It runs a long time on a charge but he can charge it right from his computer while working. I no longer have to listen to our old noisy huge fan. Yay!!!
5,This thing will blow incredibly hard for a small fan I love it
5,This fan is awesome plenty of power has 3 speeds also has a built in mini flashlight! I attached a mini power bank to it and it lasted longer than 4 hours on the high setting! After the fourth hour I stopped it I didn’t need it any longer served its purpose while watching 2 volleyball games in a warm gym! What a “life saver!”Delivery was quick all items were in tact when it arrived!
4,Bought this portable fan on a whim for some air circulation in our camper when we don’t want to run the ac. So far so good! Love that it has a USB charger instead of having to replace batteries. It happened to be just the thing to draw steam out the window while cooking. Nice and portable and easy to store. Like the speed settings too.
4,Fan is great to use at my desk. It blows really cool air. Love that it uses rechargeable batteries.
5,Everyday I get to work I am literally drenched with sweat and nothing helps quite like this fan! It might be small but it really is powerful. There are some days that the fan is already dead but as long as you can plug it into the micro usb the fan can run while being charged. Very happy with this purchase even if one of the screws randomly fell out of the back. Nothing a screwdriver can't fix though!
5,Very impressed. I love this fan. This was my second purchase. I have terrible hot flashes and constantly sweat. I keep this at my desk at work and at home. It really has power. I brought with me to an outdoor festival and it kept me cool all day. I am about to buy a third one to keep in my purse. I can't imagine life without it. I once left it on over night and it still held up another 6 hours.Better battery than my phone.
1,The concept is great but the battery doesn't hold a very good charge.  It doesn't last long before needing to be recharged so the fan is not worth the purchase or ownership.
2,I purchase this fan in 2019 and the air flow was amazing.  I wanted to buy it again but the product is not the same.  The plastic is really cheap and the fan blows about 1/4 less than the previously purchased fan.  I was disappointed.  I am returning the product and hope that they go back to the 2019 model.  It was a fantastic device.
1,I dislike how my fan stop working on the first day I got it . Make sure that your portable fan works . It’s not that loud. I wish mines worked . It’s good have in your office
5,These are absolutely perfect for any needed cooling that can be portable. The amount of air flow for the size of the fan is the main reason to buy these! The batteries charge fast and have a nice long life intil needing recharge. I'd say about 2 hours running on high!
5,Stylish looking light weight quiet portable mini fan.  No assembly needed.  Took it out of the box popped in the battery hit the on button and a nice flow of air came to me while in front of my computer.  Initial charging of lithium battery took a few hours.  A perfect little fan.
5,What you're reading is TRUE!  This little fan packs a powerful cool breeze!  Even straight out of the package it worked as soon as I put the rechargeable battery in. It's medium and high setting truly give a COOL breeze. I like it so much that I ordered two more... and have given them both away.  I recommend this highly for hot flashes hot theme parks hot outdoor events or air conditioners that don't work well.  It's small but POWERFUL!  I'll be ordering a couple more.  Thank you for a great product!
5,I used it couple nights during camping. It gave good air flow.
5,I researched small fans for a couple of weeks before I made this purchase.  I wanted something small quiet but worked great for my office. This hit the target!  I cannot attest to battery life because mine stays plugged in. It is quiet yet powerful.  I recommend this product to anyone looking for the same qualities I was.
3,Works good as a fan.. Good Flow Cooling Quiet..But Battery does not recharge.. so it has to be plugged in via mini usb..constantlyAnd it flips over constantly if touched in any way.. seems to be resilient even though it hits the floor quite often.Useful and has good points.. but wouldn’t buy again or recommend it..
4,Honestly a better nightlight than a fan but my dog loves it and he is afraid of other fans so that makes it worth the buy.
5,This is a great little fan. No complaints
1,Love this little fan.... It's quiet and meets my needs in a portable fan. The key is the 18650 batteries rechargeable and enough power run the fan for a good amount of time. My recommendations is to never use the micro usb cord that comes with fan. Purchased a month ago everything is great. Battery life on low would power through the night med and high settings worked just fine and ran for several hours. I use a Nitecore intelligent charger to charge the 18650 battery used in the fan until I was at work with my Nitecore charger at home. I decided to use the supplied usb cord I was surprised after about an hour the led changed colors red to blue. I attempted to run the fan on high setting but unit shuts off after a couple of seconds. Ever since then the unit only works on low and med setting. I have tried recharging the battery on the Nitecore charger still shuts off after a couple of seconds on high. I have tried using a new 18650 battery and the problem still there. the only way the fan can be used on high is running the fan with the usb cord and no battery.  So if you decide to buy the fan only charge the battery in a good battery charger and not the unit itself.UPDATE: 8/21/19 I have drop the star rating to one due to the unit no longer works with battery or usb cord. A product should work for longer than a month.
5,Fully charged this will run for over 6hrs on the lowest speed. As a desk fan the low speed is really all you need it never gets hot enough in the office to run speeds 2 and 3 other places you might need them. Very happy with it so far
1,This fan only works if it’s plugged into an outlet. I have returned and replace this fan twice because I thought I had a defective product. I would not recommend this fan to anyone.
5,Makes a lot of breeze for something so small.  You can charge it or leave it plugged in while using the fan.  It did come with a usb cord but did not come with the ac outlet plug that the usb plugs into but that's a common item you can purchase anywhere.
5,Great little desk fan. I even use it to blow solder fumes away.In the summer I had this little fan pointed at me and when I went to solder things I just brought it with me and pointed it away from me towards a window to get the fumes out of my face. It's not a vent hood or anything but I imagine it's got to help.
5,I have to sleep with noise when I travel and this little fan is the perfect size for my overnight bag. It makes just enough noise on high to drown out snoring lol and is perfect next to the bed!! Cute color in Pink love it 💗!  I also bought these little black mesh bags to hold it they are the perfect size to hold the fan and charging cord.
4,Work great but stream not adjustable.
5,Bought this for wife. She uses it at gym and it keeps air circulated.
5,This is a great tiny fan with powerful speeds. Light is a nice bonus and puts out a bright beam.  Perfect for camping.  Three speeds is a nice feature.  Only drawback is a little noisy for sleeping.  Sturdy enough and lightweight.  Can even carry in a large purse.
5,I bought the fan to take on a cruise.  I tried it a few weekends ago in my bedroom to see how it was and I was pleasantly surprise how it moved the air in the room.  I liked it so I ordered a second one so my kids can have it in their room on the cruise.  This was recommended by a co-worker an I am thrilled that I purchased it.  It is nice too because it has a night light on it.  Highly recommend.
5,Purchased for a camping trip I was not expecting much due to its size and being battery powered just a little air movement.The use of 18650 batteries was ideal as I have several laying around precharged and ready for action. Fan moves much more air than expected!
5,Excellent fan.  Lots of power and perfect size.  Great for bathroom use.
5,Lasts 4+ hours when I had it on high for about 20 min and then rest of time on low. Surprising how much air it moves for how small of a fan. I read that hikers like this for their tent and I can see why.
5,Very powerful! Sits perfectly on my desk and since it's wireless I can move it and take it with me to other meetings!
5,Great fan.  I ordered purple but they delivered a black and white one.  Wish it tilted.
5,I’v Had the fan for a few days now. I put it on my desk at work. I am very pleased with it. I can’t speak to battery life because I leave it plugged into my computer all the time. I haven’t had it long enough to speak to durability. It works very well at my desk. I usually have on the middle speed.  It would be nice if it would adjust up and down but I bought it knowing that it does not adjust. I have recommended to several coworkers.
5,Wish the battery lasted longer than they said. And I am taking in consideration the level of speed. That means that I am still very happy with this product. going to go to batteries plus and see if I can get a backup battery to charge.
5,The Efluky mini rechargeable fan is a lot of fan for a small price. This little fan has 3 different speed settings and the breeze feels smooth steady and quiet. The highest setting is very strong for a desk fan. It has an attractive design and a small footprint. You can easily charge the fan with a USB port and the battery lasts for hours. There is a flashlight feature built into the side of the unit which is very handy too. It’s compact size and lightweight construction makes it a great travel fan. I keep mine in my laptop bag for working on the road.
5,I am a nurse and I run the whole shift sweating constantly. This fan packs a huge punch in such a small package. I was truly amazed at how strong it is and I have all of my coworkers wanting to buy one. The span that it reaches absolutely blew me away no pun intended. Someone sitting on the other side of the nurse's station had to ask me to turn it a little because it was making her cold. I highly recommend this product.
5,Great little fan for my wood working and burningHelps me breath and extract fumes and can place it anywhereBattery life is pretty good and love the little light features
2,First the good. I use this fan on my desktop at work as it can get pretty warm in the office during certain parts of the day. This small fan is very quiet but puts out a very strong air flow. The fan has 3 speeds and a small build in LED light that can be used as a flashlight I guess. The fan is quiet at all speeds and each speed puts out a very good air flow. However the reason I give the fan 2 stars is because it did not include the USB cable that it was supposed to. That's not that big a deal as I have extras lying around but the included battery was corroded so this thing was obviously used and repackaged. Shame on eFluky for that. So the fan will not hold a charge and will only work when it's plugged into a USB cable that's connected to a power adapter and plugged into an outlet. Plugging it into a USB port on my laptop laptop docking station or desktop did not supply enough power to run the fan. Very disappointing although I assume that will work when I replace the battery. Had the box contained the cable and if the battery was not dead I would have given this fan 5 stars.
5,I bought this for work to replace a fan that finally crapped out after a few years. I'm not sure on the battery life I usually leave it plugged into my work computer. I think it ran for a few hours on battery the one time I tried it. Seemed good. Fan is great though quiet and blows like a Nor'easter. Very affordable and I would say definitely buy this fan. I am an independent reviewer no free swag perks discounts etc. Just want to put my opinion out there.
5,I love love love this fan it is everything I hoped for and more.  I use it when playing cards in a warm home other than my own (I live in FL).  I love the three speed option it will cool me for hours over games on successive nights.  The recharge is easy and the ‘green’ light comes on when the battery is fully charged.  The fan is durable as I carry it in my ‘game’ bag with my wooden card holder and umbrella.  Perfect!
5,This is my second mini fan.  I had a similar one that lasted me several years!  This one seems to be sturdier than my last one and the charge seems to last a bit longer.  I hVe it in my bathroom to cool and circulate the air whenever I’m in there.  I live in Hawaii where it is almost always hot and humid without central air conditioning.
4,Excellent fan. Portable great air movement the multiple speeds allow a range as well. Used for a week in Europe hotel had no air conditioning as most don’t. I’d sadly give it 5 stars if the included battery was better. Plan to replace for longer battery life.
2,Worked well upon purchase but ere is no "Internal blue light"  and after about 2 weeks the rechargeable battery stopped charging maybe mine was defective.  Still decent fan but needs to be plugged in to work and again  it doesn't have the cool internal blue light. Maybe get something else
5,This is my second one. I have one in my office at work and one in my home office. I only use the lowest option because it’s pretty strong that I have to turn it off after 30 mins. Pretty quiet on that level too. No issues with the noise and my work area is pretty quiet.
5,This fan is surprisingly effective.  I work as a cashier and when it is busy I get hot - customers shouldn't see sweaty cashiers.  So I bought this fan to use.  I was very impressed with the amount of air movement!  I usually use it on low setting.  The light feature is very nice too.  Easy to recharge.  The fan arrived in protective packaging in just a few days after I ordered it.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,When I first got this I thought it would be to small but it really puts out some air.  The only thing I don’t like is I have to prop it up to the exact place I need the air because it’s not adjustable.  Otherwise it’s great.
5,Only had this fan for a week but I already bought another one to give as a gift. my office doesn't circulate air well and is often noisy with chatter. This fan is the perfect antidote to both! the 3 speeds give me options as the office temp changes throughout the day and the sound of the fan acts as a nice white noise buffer. I usually leave it plugged in but it lasts decently long running on just battery. I haven't found a use for the lights yet but its a nice feature!
4,Good fan wish it was a little quieter!
5,I bought this fan for a cruise that hasn’t happened yet but I decided to bring it with me on my week camping trip...boy was I glad I did!! I was so impressed with how much power this little thing produced. Kept me comfortable in the sweltering tent. So far I have only used it for a week but it was as powerful at the end of the week as when it started. Happy Days!!
5,Perfect for work desk and home night stand. Fan feels cheaply made but it puts out a powerful personal breeze
5,I love the battery life and the low noise.
3,I purchased this fan in July 2019 for use during power outages (hurricanes)  I plugged the fan into a USB port to test operation.  I was very happy with the different settings the strength of the fan the portability and even the blue light.  I packed it up and decided I would charge the battery at a later date.  With Hurricane Dorian looming I charged the battery all day and it will not operate unless plugged in.  Unfortunately this will be useless with no electricity.  If it weren't for the battery problem I would've given this a 5 star rating
4,Great little fan unfortunately it would not work unless plugged in. Also does not light up like picture shows.
5,I'm blown away (no pun intended) by this Mini Fan! I got it for my hot office and now everyone borrows it! It has 3 settings and I never have to take it up to high because it is powerful and my office is about 79 degrees! I can't believe the price on this either! When I tell my coworkers what I paid they are blown away too! I don't have a need for the light so I haven't tried that part but if it works like the fan then we're in good shape!
5,I bought this for a cruise thinking i might need it in the state room. I ended up using it to help dry wet bathing suits by moving air  in the bathroom after I hung up the clothes in the shower. It is better than a clip fan that plugs into the wall we have at home. I love that it is portable and so quiet. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,I really love this fan!  I have a really small desk/work area & needed something to help cool me off & keep the air moving.  Since I don't have much room I placed in on top of my computer tower under my desk & it's perfect!  I haven't tried the battery yet as I don't need it so far.  It's very quiet.  It's exactly what I needed!
5,Was expecting cheap quality but turned out to be a solid product very quiet on low speed almost silent. With good air flow.  Battery life good.  On high speed not as quiet but acceptable on high speed it puts out nearly enough air to lift it's own weight.The blue led into the fan is a cool effect .  The led on the side is light ok but don't think it would ever be used as a flashlight just due to location and how you would hold fan to use the light.  Overall solid product good battery life small size. Quiet and air flow better than what you expect for a fan this size..
4,Enough wind with high but too noisy.  Battery life is not long but can switch battery easily.  Very light weight.  Can not set up and down angle.  OK for $12.
5,I really like this fan. Battery life is good. I like the 3 speeds. I use it a lot at the gym it has rubbers on bottom so that I could but it on exercise machines while I'm working. Everyone at the gym saw what a good fan it is they also ordered.I also went with kids on trip it was very good waiting in line for rides . I liked it so much I ordered another so far no problem. I have it about 2 months.
1,This little fan would be perfect if it didn’t quit working. It doesn’t charge anymore and I have no way of using it anymore. It quit holding a charge after about three weeks. This is the worst product I’ve ever Botton. Save your money don’t waste your money buy a different product
1,Cheap and noise isn't loud but battery sucks wont charge at all have to keep it plugged it for it to work
5,I love this little fan and the battery charge lasts a long time. I keep it running on the low speed on battery all night and somehow it keeps going. The low speed is almost always good enough for a strong breeze for me. In case you didn't read it elsewhere the blue LED light comes on only if you hold down the power button at any speed. I don't use that much but it is kind of cool looking. The white LED comes on only if you press the power button 4 times from the off position. I use that as a tiny flashlight when necessary.
5,I was not expecting much our of this to be honest.  Boy was I surprised.  The output on this thing is pretty amazing especially considering it's compact size.  It has variable speeds a big battery for it's size to keep you cool on the go and the USB cord is long enough to use as a fan on my night table which is great. It's very quiet and has some other features such as an LED light that can really come in handy.  Great Product!
5,Best little fan!!! Used at work blew plastic cups off top of med cart. Worth the money!
5,I bought two of these fans for the inside of my sailboat  and they work great  light weight  quiet  and reliable....I use them every day and I am super happy with the outcome....the fact that there rechargeable and usb makes them even more convenient. I'd definitely suggest this item to anyone needing a fan for any reason !
5,This is amazing! Very small but very powerful and saved my life when AC broke.
5,Excellent little fan. I use it in my office. It is quiet and surprisingly powerful. It puts out alot if air. It comes with a rechargeable battery so you can move it around or you can keep it plugged in. It also has a flashlight. Not sure why but it's cool.
5,This is a powerful little fan and it has quickly become one of my favorites and I now own 3 of them. It uses a 18650 Lithium Ion rechargeable battery and I've started using these as battery chargers while not in use.The only con is that it does not run 8 hours on speed 1 as advertised. It's closer to 5 hours before it shuts itself off. If left to wait a while you can turn it back on and only the first 2 speeds work and it will run for a little longer. This is still long enough for me though.
5,Great little fan with a good amount of power.  I use it to travel with and set it on the bathroom counter when getting ready as most hotel bathrooms don't have enough power in their extractor fans to pull out the steam and keep the bathroom cool.  I've used it several times and it fits easily in my bag.  One charge seems to last for two hours on the highest setting.  Having a wireless fan is great too as it doesn't take up an outlet and I can set it anywhere.
5,Worked as expected. I didn’t get a chance to test the durability of the battery because I didn’t use it for too long on the battery. I bought it to take it to Europe during the summer months because I had heard the office was usually very hot. I had it plugged in to my computer the whole time (which is why I didn’t use the battery as it was constantly charging) and it worked wonders. Exactly what i wanted. Everyone in the meeting room wanted one!
5,We're going on a cruise in a couple of weeks and ready on Cruise Critic about this fan.  My hot flashes are no fun and can keep my husband up when I constantly toss and turn.  A fan solves the problem.  This fan is amazing!!  It's perfect for circulating the air and keeping me cool.  I can't believe the power it has for $15!  Win win!!  it's going to be perfect for the cruise; so compact!!
5,Great portable fan quiet and fits anywhere
1,The first one I bought it’s battery did not work. Would charge the battery and nothing. So I bought a second one and the same thing battery doesn’t charge at all. It will only work if you leave it connected with the usb cable.
4,Pretty cool!
5,I love this fan! At the time of this review I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. I absolutly love it!Some ProsIt has 3 speeds. I Normally use it on the first speed and it does the job. It is small but for being the size it is It has high air turn out. It is also very quiet.Not really any cons more of just a few things to take note of...It does not glow or show any color in the area of the fans. Also It works better when not being charged.
5,I bought this fan to take with me when I travel. I just came back from a 3 week trip and the fan worked perfectly.  I removed the battery since the airlines have restrictions on those type of batteries and took the USB cable and it was really easy.  Most hotels internationally and domestically now have USB ports next to the bed so it was really easy.  The fan is light weight but has a lot of power.  I love it!!  Would definitely buy this again.
5,I've had this fan for years now and it still works great. It has plenty of power it's quiet and it has a cool blue light. I typically just run it on the lowest setting and it keeps me cool when I'm at my desk though the higher speeds work really well for such a small fan. Though one of the led’s no longer works it’s so cute it has become part of the family I will keep it as long as it keeps working!
3,Low battery charge last only twenty minutes on a 8 hour charge
5,I bought this to use on a cruise and it was perfect. It packed in my carry on luggage with no problem. I used it a night for air circulation and white noise while going to sleep. Charged it every morning and it lasted as long as I needed it through the night. There are three speeds and sound levels and it even has an LED light on the end it needed. I was very pleased with this purchase.
3,I work at a call center so I need something that’s quiet. This thing was perfect day one but ever since it makes a buzzing sound when it runs and I have to turn it off between calls. Not convenient at all. If it didn’t rattle/buzz it would be 5 stars easy because the airflow that comes out is nice battery isn’t horrible and it recharged instead of taking batteries.
4,More powerful than I had hoped for.  Much quieter than anticipated.  I have had other mini-fans that were very loud.  This one is terrific in comparison. Decent run time on a charge.  I purchased an additional battery so I can have uninterrupted operation.  Batteries are easy to find and inexpensive.  I would have given this 5 stars except the flashlight feature just seems a little "hokey".  I would buy again.  Very satisfied.
5,I live in az and suffer from a medical condition dysautonomia which causes my body to overheat very easily so this fan is a life saver! i carry it EVERYWHERE a people ask me where i get it and wish they had one as well as in cooler out and about. The battery lasts hours and i recharge it at night next to my phone and or it runs all night if plugged in. Ive brought 2 and 1 for my sister!
5,Light weight & small making it portable while retaining it’s power it has 3 settings for comfort as well as a strong LED light that one could read by...  the USB cord is a huge plus
5,This is the second one that I have purchased. I had one and my wife loved it so much I had to buy her one two. It works great and has great battery life. I would highly recommend this fan!
1,Piece of crap. Doesn't stay charged. Barely blows
5,I don’t know about the “warmth” of this fan.  We bought this fan preparing for power outages.  Love it has a rechargeable battery and runs using a usb.  Three speeds make the output quite high producing very cool air.
5,Omg I love it real nice gives good air 😍
5,This fan was a lifesaver on my recent trip to China. It has a long battery life after charging it. I like the choice of speeds; it's a powerful little fan! It's not overly loud at all. I also liked that it plugs into a usb port. This made it easy to use with just my travel charger that has a port for that. The only thing I would change is I wish it could pivot so you could direct air flow up or down. I would but it again without a doubt.
5,Great little fan for the price.  I use it at work. Provides great air flow.The only issue is not being provided with a USB and plug. I used one from my phone but feel this should have been included.
5,You can’t even tell it’s on. Powerful fan.
5,These are great portable fans!  Charge them and they last a long time without charging again.  I have one in every room of my house where I sit--office bedroom living room!  First setting not too cold; just right.
3,The thought behind this was good but I was disappointed that the battery life seems very short. I think fully charged it ran for about an hour on low. There is a slight hum but not irritating. I do lik I can connect usb.
4,Cant tell you the battery life cause I have not tried using it without the USB cord. Otherwise I enjoy the fan.
5,I bought this item as a travel fan for when I travel overseas for business.  I have found that many hotels in Europe do not have the best air conditioning and air movement in the summer months so I needed something to keep me cool while I sleep.  This little fan moves a ton of air for the size and the quiet operation is a huge plus. I also use it as a desk fan in my office.  This is a USB fan so it is very easy to charge or operate while plugged in.  I would definitely recommend this item!
5,I ordered two of these in black -- one for my home office and one for my desk at work. They are perfect for their intended use. I was having a hard time finding a fan of this size that has more than one speed so that is a huge plus. Even the low speed throws the air pretty well for such a compact little fan and all the speeds are relatively quiet for use in an office environment. I like the fact that the black color is actually two-toned with black and white and not just solid boring black. I highly recommend this little guy. :)
4,Handy relatively quiet and long lasting on a charge. I set mine on an extra music stand in the stuffy little room where I practice and it doesn't interfere with the music. It tends to creep its way across a smooth surface like a table top BUT I finally noticed that the rubber feet on the bottom had a protective plastic sheath intended to be removed (like those on the touchscreen of your new phone). Once I took those off it stays in place just fine.
5,Love this fan! It’s strong for being so tiny and it really is quiet so I’m not disturbing co-workers. I plug it into my USB so battery is not an issue for me. Not sure how long it would last on battery life. And I like the speed options too. Very cool product for the money.
5,Great powerful fan! I bout 4 of them!
5,I can't rate battery because I'm using it plugged into my workstation but I'm very impressed with the size light weight looks and substantial air flow.  Setting one is plenty of air for me. I set it about 3 feet from me on my desk and I can't hear it at all. Settings two and three have a little noise which I know because I was curious but not enough to bother cubicle neighbors. Love it!
5,This thing is very durable. I've dropped it many times. There's been a few times where it fell from 5 feet up and it still works! It's quiet pushes are very nicely and can be charged easily. I just wish it articulated. Great buy would recommend.
5,Great little fan. Have bought 3 of them
4,I just received this fan and I am pleasantly surprised at how powerful it is for its size and price. While charging it gives off a pretty low intensity breeze so at first I was thinking it would be just another dinky fan that works in a pinch but as soon as I unplugged it from my computer it went into high gear. So it can't be charging and used at full power at the same time but it charged up pretty quickly so I'm happy.
3,This fan for me was just ok. Each time I've used it on low speed only it lasted about only 4 hours. On LOW speed and no light on. Not sure how it can say it may last up to 9 hrs depending on the speed. Bummer. Was hoping it would last 8-9 hrs on low speed.
5,I have bought three so far two to friends and will be buying more! Great for travelling. Well made. Great price. Also recommended to others. Was on a cruise (before the pandemic) and could have sold it so many times.
5,Love this product. When I am overheated I get a nosebleed. This cools me very fast. Also live in hurricane region will be extremely useful.
5,This tiny fan is amazing! My office is in the hottest corner of my house. This little fan has been a great help even on the lowest setting. It’s quiet and powerful. I can keep it on during conference calls and no one hears a thing. I use it outside as well and it is great! It's about as tall as my iPhone 7. Very pleased with this fan!
5,We purchased the fan to take on vacation with us.  While we haven't yet taken it on a trip I can say that I'm quite impressed with its power and quietness.  It has 3 speed levels and turned up to high it's quite a significant output for such a little fan.  Can't yet speak to battery life or how well the product holds up over time but I'll update if we notice anything significant.
1,I received this yesterday.  When I opened the battery compartment of the fan to install the battery I found the metal contact that resembles a spring to be broken off and rolling around in the battery compartment. The fan is still able to be operated while plugged into a USB port and appears to be a good little device. I emailed the company asking how I could get it repaired/replaced but have not received a response from them.
5,I used this fan in the nestbox for a sitting hen. Was over 95 and this helped her thru the day. Now that chick hatched the fan is back in the house to use during power outages. Very quiet
4,I absolutely love this fan. It is a perfect size for my nightstand and lows me to feel the breeze without disturbing my husband. I use it every night! Great purchase
4,Fan is great battery is horrible and doesn't take charge anymore after about a year. It works with a power bank though without battery. Love it for the tent when camping. Company gave me a partial refund for the bad battery.
5,Long battery life and strong fan
5,I'm amazed at how powerful this little fan is.  It's slightly bigger than I expected which is great.  Don't even need to use the battery.  Runs fine off of the USB cord.  Super quiet I can barely hear it at my desk.  Then again I work at an automotive dealership so I get alot of shop noise constantly throughout the day.  Wonderful little fan I love it!
5,Love back up battery in this unit compared to the other one I bought.
1,Broke and stopped working about 35 days after I got it. Garbage!!  Avoid at all costs!!
5,Blows like an arctic wind! This is awesome while I’m at work!
5,Powerful rechargeable adjustable speeds portable!  Perfect!  Feels solid!
5,This fan has 2 speeds and put out the perfect amount of air for my needs. I use it at work and it is quiet although I do have to turn it down or off when I am on the phone as the person on the other end hears a roar. I get many compliments on this and recommend it often. Love the blue light and use it always. Love the battery is rechargeable.
1,We used for next to our baby's crib for additonal ventilation. However it stopped working after using it only for a month
5,I love this tiny fan! The perfect size for next to your desk or bedstand. I got this for travel. I like having a fan sound when I sleep and for anyone else who has this sleeping habit it has a pleasing sound. Not high pitched like some cheap fans you find. Just a nice low hum. The light is a great feature and the multiple fan settings. It has a lithium rechargeable battery which I'm hoping will be easy to replace if for some reason it decides to die on me. Overall a great find! I'm thinking of buying more of these for around the house or as gifts.
5,I use this fan while I'm exercising. I set it up to blow directly on my face. For such a small fan it's got a lot of power.  And it's quiet. I am so pleased with this purchase.
4,This little thing has some power! Literally pushes itself backwards on high. I haven't had any issues with battery life yet. The last cycle on the speed button turns on a light on the side of the unit not sure what that would be useful for.
5,This a great little fan.  We bought 2 of them one black and one blue to take on a cruise.  The USB charging is a great feature as is the light for dark spaces at night.  Both were used on the cruise and helped keep the cabin comfortable at night.  They are now in our camper to help keep things cool there as well.
5,I took this to a 4 day festival in the summer to use in my tent.  I charge it with a small solar charger each day.  Its pretty good but was typcially dead when I woke up each morning.  Really helped me fall asleep in the 80+ degree weather though.
5,This is a great and powerful little fan. I bought 2 and took them to Italy recently. Both fit perfectly in my backpack while we toured the city of Rome. It is very hot there in July and there is no where to escape the heat as most stores operate with open doors and no air conditioning. They allowed me to sit and cool myself while walking the city. I highly recommend them for anything from a desktop to soccer games to hiking.
3,Headline says it all basically. While the fan offers a pretty strong little breeze and it surprisingly doesn’t topple over for being so small against the velocity the battery is kaput on arrival and even if I charge it for awhile it won’t work without being plugged into usb.
5,Took this little fan with me to London and Paris it was awesome! It was unseasonably warm in both places and this bad boy worked like a charm cooling me off enough so I could fall asleep. I charged it up during the day and on low setting it lasted quite a bit especially if you do not use the light feature. If you are traveling with it remember to take the battery out an put it in your carry on.
4,I ordered 2 and one worked perfectly and the other never charged.  The one that works is very convenient and so far holds a good charge.
5,I sleep with a fan blowing in my face. I needed a portable fan for travel and camping and this guy works great. The battery is decent (easily replaceable also). It is powerful enough and it is very quiet. I am very happy with it. The only thing that I would change would be that the power button is easy to accidentally turn on. It has twice run the battery down while it was in my suitcase.
5,I use this fan for myself while sitting at desk or table. I try to keep air conditioner off and sometimes gets really hot so this fan really helps cool me off when I’m stationary.
5,I bought this for power outages and haven't had to use it as such just yet. However it charged rather quickly and the power of the fan is surprising given the small size. It's not silent but it's also not clanky and noisy either. If the battery holds out as described this will be well worth the cost come a hot summer night when trying to sleep with no AC due to a power outage.
3,Loved the fan at first until only having it about 1 month & 1 week it won’t charge.  I contacted seller only to be told it was over the 30 days

5,I love this little fan so much.  I bought one to carry on a trip to Ireland.  My friend that I was visiting liked it so much that I left mine for him and bought another one for me when I returned home.  I love that it does make a bit of a humming sound as I like to use it to sleep.  It moves a lot of air for such a small fan.  It holds a charge for a very long time.
5,A little smaller than I thought but lots of power for the size. Great for small areas such as a office desk or night table.
4,Like this fan. At first I thought I had made a mistake. Wouldn't take a charge or so I thought. It worked well while it was plugged in but not other wise. Disappointed I was all set to return it. I bought it to use at the gym I need something that works without being plugged in. SO took a look at it and changed the position of the battery. Worked like a CHAMP! Embarrassed but happy.
3,It was great to use on our cruise ship for noise and to move the air in our interior room. However it didn’t last through the night. Had to keep plugged in which wasn’t an option with our lack of charging ports.  But it worked to get us comfortable to sleep at night. Small and easy to put in our carry on!  Worth the money.
4,It works just fine. After 6 months it is still working fine. So the quality itself as a tiny fan is great. But I gave 4 stars because it doesn’t tilt and it’s very light in weight so it can tip over easily. But those are personal preferences. Bottom line it’s useful.
5,I love this little fan!  I have bought three of them!  One of the things that I love is because it is quiet and I also love it because the bands are easy to push so I can use them in the middle of the night!  I also love it that it has a little flashlight but I also used in the middle the night!  I do some international travel and this little fan goes with me all over the world!
5,Great travel fab. Having the blue light and a flashlight on the side are a bonus.
5,Battery lasted through the night and worked great! I turned it off halfway through the second night so not sure how long it will actually last but it was running strong at least through 4 or 5 hours into the second night using it. Long lasting rechargeable battery in my opinion!!
5,There’s nothing not to like about this capable little fan.  I  use it in my work cubicle and love how I can plug it in to the USB port on my computer.  For that reason I can’t speak to battery life  But I can say that it is a very powerful little fan And I am amazed at how effective it is in cooling off my workspace. Very happy with it and Definitely money well spent!
5,this fan is more powerful then i expected and it has even survived multiple dunkings in the bath tub working just fine once it dried out. 10/10 will buy more of them.
5,This little fan works perfectly for what we bought it for.  Battery lasts a sufficient amount of time.  Great fan at an affordable price.
5,Great fan to have at your desk. There are 3 speeds and I get cold with the slowest speed and I am hot-natured! If fully charged I get 7-8 hrs on lowest speed. It's awesome highly recommend
5,Excellent little fan. It is whisper quiet and is as reliable as old faithful. The three speeds are nice although even the lowest setting seems to keep me plenty cool at my desk. I usually keep this plugged in but I know for sure that it can go on it's lowest setting for at least four hours unplugged (I haven't tested it beyond that). There is even a bonus LED light just in case my employer doesn't pay the electric bill.
1,Simply doesn’t work. I been charging it for hours and nothing. Don’t waste your $$
5,Good addition to work or home environment. I plug into my laptop at the counter where I stand and turn it on when I'm too warm or need air. It's very quiet but delivers a good stream of air. The battery at least when new lasts many hours. The only limitation that bothers me is that it doesn't tilt vertically so I have to try to prop it up in order to blow on my face.
5,I have owned this fan for about a month now and it is extremely good.  I keep it at work and it has 3 settings.  I can only use the 3rd one on battery for some reason but it is strong for such a small fan.  I keep it connected to my monitor at work.  It is quiet sleek and strong.  I don't normally write reviews but I had to for this.  You won't be disappointed.
4,Me gusta mucho me es de gran utilidad
5,Nice little cordless fan that has blows hard.
5,This fan works great.  Moves a lot more air than I expected. I like that you can use USB. Overall great fan for the price!
3,Great desk fan. Virtually no noise. Battery in box didn’t work even after charge. Luckily I had an old battery lying around.
3,It works well for what I need it to do (I keep it on my desk) but it won't work if you're expecting to travel with it. It only works when it's plugged in. However given the type of charger I'm sure it would work plugged into the car as well.
5,Love this fan !  Battery lasts a long time !  Has 3 speeds and quiet enough to use during church.  I bought 3 of them.  Wish there was a folding stand on the bottom of the fan to help with falling over easily.
5,Best thing I’ve ever bought.  Just wish it had longer life when using it on high.  Only lasted a hour and half.  Have to carry around portable charger and wire with me.
5,I love this little fan have given as gifts at work. If you get little summer days at home at work on trips sharing a room and the other person like heat and you get hot BUY this little fan. It's small but powerful.  I love it and would buy it again..
5,I am really impressed with this company. I order this fan the power outlet mini strip and night light. I loved how they comically kept me updated on my product progress. I must have white noise when I sleep. So this fan will perfect when we go on pur cruise. It's not too loud. Just a soft hum. It's compact which is good for packing but blows powerful air. I'm impressed!
5,This little fan can really put out the air!  I am a hot blooded person and have had a battery operated fan that even on high did not cool me down and was much larger.  I ordered a rechargeable fan from another company and it only ran when attached to the USB port so be careful about that when looking at fans.  This one can be charged both ways - USB or plugging it in.  On high it runs approximately 4 hours.  You will not be disappointed with this fan!
5,This is by far the best camping fan moves a ton of air has a smooth clean solid sound to it that can help reduce the surrounding sound from "bullfrogs".  My favorite feature is the USB charging it can run off a battery pack even if no 18650 is installed.  It can also be a 18650 battery charger which I also use in headlamps and flashlights one of those goes dead I swap the battery from here to the light and this will charge up the dead battery when connected to my 10k battery pack.  Great product I hope to get years of use out of it
5,Have 3 of these now. Usually buy when they go on sale. Noise level is ok and batt life is good. Can use as fan while being charged. It's a fan..it blows air..buy it..😎
5,I usually don't write reviews just read them but I want to brag on this little fan! It travels great weighs almost nothing charges from a USB and holds power in a rechargeable battery. That is all great right? Better still its desktop stable and takes very little space has three speeds and is a total save when a heat wave hits. For all you gals over 45 you know what I mean. Instant relief. Yay!! Buy one.
5,small 3 speed fan will keep you comfortable. A little smaller than I expected. No tilt to fan. Plug in to work and charge battery at the same time. Or use it on the battery alone.
5,I am totally pleased with this small fan!  Quiet and circulates a lot of air for its size!  Perfect personal fan for desk or a tent.  Would buy again.
4,This thing is awesome. It actually blows air like a normal fan and it’s super portable. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is battery only lasts about an hour and a half.
3,
5,I bought this small fan because my master bedroom closet gets a bit hot while I’m in there cleaning and organizing. I charged it a few hours and turned it on. Works great. I love that it’s rechargeable and portable. I can take it to the laundry room while I’m ironing my outfit. It has 3 setting and they are all pretty powerful.
4,This is a pretty powerful fan for how small it is! I purchased this for my work cubicle and have to say I really enjoy it! I love that it is chargeable and easily connected to my computer to do so although I do wish I had the option to plug it into the wall without an adapter. I also really enjoy the speeds but the first speed works just great for me! Overall great purchase!
5,I own two of these fans and have ordered several as gifts. They put out a lot of air recharge quickly and run a long time on one charge.  I keep one with my travel gear for my carry-on luggage in case I get stuck on the tarmac when I fly. Plus it provides just enough white noise for sleeping in a hotel room. I have a friend who carries one in her purse for random uses.
5,Easy to pack
5,Awesome is the only word to describe this fan. Power portability battery life are just a few positives. The only negatives are noise and vibration. This little power plant will scoot around unless you place a soft tissue underneath or lean against a larger item. Both negatives a VERY MINOR compared to the positives. Don’t hesitate to buy. You won’t regret it.
5,Got a couple of these as gifts for my coworkers. They loved it. Happy with my purchase.Wish I bought a third one for myself though! Would definitely be a good addition to a hurricane kit. For when you don't evacuate lose power and don't have a generator for AC.
4,Very powerful for such a small fan! I've only used the lowest level! No noise at all! Perfect for my desk in an open concept offices
5,This small fan is both powerful and silent (at low speed). It is a little bit more noisy at high speed but then it is so powerful for its small size than we can easily forgive it. I've bought several of them for my Summer holydays and I had one in the bathroom in the kitchen in the bedroom... and even one for the dog at night! I am fully satisfied with this fan.
3,El artículo recibido fue el solicitado y funciona adecuadamente sin embargo el cable del cargador está dañado y no funcionó al momento de cargar el equipo. Afortunadamente lo estamos cargando con un cable que tenemos de otro equipo igual que compre anteriormente. Saludos.
5,this little powerhouse has saved my life for working at Amazon...thanks
5,Does a good job in our bathroom to blow out moisture through the window in AZ.
5,Great little fan that connects to my laptop via USB or just use the rechargeable battery. Makes it easy to keep cool without worrying about a nearby electrical outlet. If you plug it in to your laptop it always stays charged and ready for cordless use with the battery. Blows a lot of air for a small fan. I Love this fan.
4,It’s a great little fan but the charging port gets worn out over time. This is the third one I’ve bought and the only reason I’ve had to buy a new one is because of the charging port. Otherwise it’s a great little fan.
1,This product was broken right outside of the box. Two little pieces were missing making a hole big enough to put a finger in. Not safe. Cheap product.
5,I use this little fan everywhere. It is so quiet and does such a good job that I don't even need to use my large ( noisy) fan. I need cool air on my face almost constantly and I can HEAR tv too now too. Love it.
5,Very nice fan.  Runs long time on a full charge  3 speeds.  Powerful and quiet
5,Like the power of this little fan it really works great. You will not be disappointed.
5,The fan no longer works without being plugged in. Would like to contact seller so I can see if I can get a replacement battery because I think the battery no longer can hold a charge.
5,Love love love this little fan.  I swear it feels like there is a big fan blowing.  And the light is a sweet little extra!  I will buy more!
3,First off I  want to state that this thing is whisper quiet at all speeds and moves a ton of air for a desk fan. If your looking for a fan that needs no plugs though this is not it. Like others have stated the battery is a joke and quit holding a charge within 2 weeks. Plugging it in though will keep it running and the three stars are do to the sheer amount of air coming from this fan. It's rarely above the low setting because the damn thing will make you cold!  Great fan if you have access to a plug. If not this is not the one for you.
5,This little fan really keeps me cool at work. It is small and fits in my tiny cube well. It is quiet so i can talk on the phone without "white noise" in the back ground. And no one near me can hear it running.  It also charges via USB port. I have more USB ports in my cube than electrical outlets so this is a great asset.
4,I know they tell you it's small... but this thing is SMALL.  It's still pretty cool and if you just want to create a breeze at your desk or have it right next to your pillow for a breeze and dim night light it'll probably work but can't imagine it actually being useful for anything else.
5,It just happened to be very hot these days and it was used immediately. The fan is light and can store electricity and the bursting. If you like it start quickly
5,This is the best little fan I've ever had. Love that it is battery operated and fairly quiet also. I bought 2 of them one for home and one for work. I'll probably order another for the backseat of the car. Great price and a great little fan.
3,The noise level is great but the battery life doesn’t last very long. Give it take 3 hours on the lowest setting. I have to leave it plugged into the usb part of my computer to get some juice.
1,Runs for 20 seconds then stops.
5,I used this fan for everything on the go! Lashes nails kids being hot outside! I absolutely love the fact that it is rechargeable and wireless. It works amazing!
5,I take this every time I go on a vacation! I recently just got back from Disney World and the beach and it comes in so handy when it’s so hot outside. Our use it while standing in line lunch outside and standing in line. Lasts for about 8 hours on low. I also use it in my hotel room or cruise cabin - one of my BEST purchases I’ll have to say!
5,I was not sure but I got it anyway I am glad I did! I take this to work everyday I work in a Lab so sometimes it gets warm from time to time I set it on my desk and it runs for over 8 hours on the battery I charge it when I get home. It blows great air and is very quiet. All my co-workers want to get one themselves.
5,Met my expectations 100%.
3,Perfect fan for travel. Very quiet. Great output. After 2 months and approximately 5 uses the battery no longer charges. The fan only works while plugged in which is an inconvenience.
5,the fan is amazingly quiet - i have to look to see that its still running. does a great job in keeping my personal space cooler - as long as you have a flat space for it to stand - it doesn't have clips for obtuse locations (which doesn't stop it from being a great little fan. perfectly happy with my purchase.
5,Best mini fan I’ve ever used. Super small but super effective. Easy to charge with a micro USB port. The LED light is also a bonus for my gaming setup. Overall a good purchase. Only thing that could improve would be battery life. Lasts about 3 hours on full charge.
5,Very good little fan. Quiet. Works well. I use it on my nightstand. I love that it is battery powered as well as USB. I can plug it right into my nightstand using the built-in USB port. Highly recommend!
5,Led lite on side is useful for in dark use.
5,The AC doesn't work very well at my job sometimes. This thing puts out a decent amount of air for its size. It seems to last for a while although I only use it for 1-2 hours at a time. I can't say if it will last several hours. But it's pretty powerful for such a tiny fan.
5,I love these fans.  Very quiet.  I've had one for years that's still going strong for my work and then bought more for gifts for friends and family.
4,Helpful while J am working
4,I just received this item . I have barely used it so far but it seems to have a pretty good battery life and it’s perfect for what I need it for  pushing air from one room to another in a little window between the rooms
5,I need a fan to sleep.  Love how small and compact this fan is. Battery life is amazing! Last all night. And it's so quiet
5,This little fan is a champ! I use it in my kitchen to help circulate air when cooking. It used to feel like cooking in a sauna. Set on medium this gives just enough airflow to keep it comfortable in my kitchen. I typically use it on medium speed and can get several hours out of one charge.
5,great fan for my desk. It gets hot because of the heat coming of the PC. This little guy makes a huge difference. Definitely worth the money. I've only used the battery once but it seemed like it lasted a long time. I keep the USB plugged into my PC the rest of the time so it works just like a plug in fan.
3,I like that it’s a bit taller but it needs a wider base and I wish it wasn’t so noisy.
5,Great little fan for desk top
5,I ordered two fans for my cruise and There was no lead lights in the boxes. Still a good product but would have loved to have the light as I had to purchase night lights for the cabin since the lights were not in the boxes.
5,Love love this little fan. Always next to me at night on my nightstand
5,Love this product.
5,I love these.  Bought 3 total.  One for the office two for home.  Run great couple extra features you wouldn't expect for such a cheaply priced fan.  Sometimes there are deals that make these half off with coupon code too.  My only complaint would be that the highest setting (which I rarely need as both the lower settings put out a decent amount of air) is only able to be used when unplugged...  Overall though great fan!
5,The wind speed is Ok  and the wind is cool. I really look down on this thing! It's tailor-made for me . It's easy to carry and good
5,I love this fan! It produces a good amount of wind for its size. It runs for several hours on a fully charged battery. At first I thought I had a bad battery but then I realized that it doesn't charge while running. For the battery to charge you have to leave it plugged in without turning it on. I charge it at night so that I can use it wherever I need it during the day. Highly recommended.
5,Powerful little fan! All my coworkers are jealous! Will run all day on low. Bring your charging cord if you need higher speeds. Low speed suits me fine.
5,The efluky is a fine little fan. The battery feature is great -- I'll never get another USB fan without it. I use it practically every night when I read in bed because I have hot flashes. Without taking anything away from the fan's goodness I wish the low speed was even lower and I wish it had a tilt function to make it easier to angle at my face.
5,I was amazed after charging the included battery and running the fan on low speed it ran for seven hours and five minutes.  After reading some other reviews I was expecting 5-6 hours but my unit exceeded my expectations.  I was really amazed at how much air is moved even on low speed and the unit is so quiet.  I would recommend this to anyone needing a small portable fan.
3,This is a great little fan.  I use this fan when I play music on stage with hot lights.  It works great.  I wish that the charging cable was included.  It took me a while to find one that would fit.  I thought for a while that I wasn't going to be able to charge the battery and was going to throw the fan away even though I like it.
5,This has been a lifesaver. I keep it at my desk then take it home to have my wind down time on porch at night. Also helped me with my toddler when my truck a/c went out. Its not loud usb charges. And when fully charged it lasts over 4 hours on low. Also has a flashlight
3,I face it up toward my face when I am hot at work. It is why I would not recommend it to my friends
5,I CAN STAY COOL WHEN ELECT HAS POWER FAILURE.  THIS LITTLE FAN IS WELL MADE AND I WILL BE BUYING A LEAST ONE MORE.
5,We bought this fan because we do lots of cruises and my husband needs a fan to sleep.  We put it on the medium setting and sometime during the night it drains but its enough to get him to sleep.  We have to charge it daily and that wasn't a hardship just wish it lasted through the night.  Well made though and easy to charge.
5,Battery life is great faster speed faster drain of course. Same with noise level but still very quiet for the size!
5,Quiet fast charging good airflow.
5,Good product - only reason I gave a 1 star for warmth is because it keeps me cool!
1,Would have loved it but it would not charge.
5,Powerful little fan. I keep plugged in no battery and it goes to all three speeds and much more power than I expected. Haven’t tried it with battery- I see some reviews saying less strong without it and plugged in - So I can’t compare. But plenty strong for me with just plug. Tiny nice looking on desk.
5,This is a great little fan!! I bought one for when I travel out of town on short trips. I can't stand the noise from hotel radiators. I just plug it in with my cellphone charger so that I don't have to worry about it running out of battery. Great to have during power outages as well. I was so impressed by this little fan I bought a second one for my husband's side of the bed for when we go on our cruise as he can't sleep without a fan.
5,This is just perfect as a personal fan. I have purchased three one for me and two as gifts. They were a big hit
5,Powerful little fan. Creates a good breeze. I have it on my desk and work. We liked them so much we bought two more to keep around the house for a quick cool off.The highest setting does cause the fan to move a bit on my desk from slight vibration but overall it's been great.
5,I am delighted with this purchase and have bought another. Quite quiet.  Great at the desk where I use it at the computer but because of the battery can be moved to where you are.  Can take outdoors to blow the bugs away.  A friend carries it to restaurants in case it is needed for comfort.  Recommend!
5,this fan is great! i love how it has diff speeds and its very pratical and useful i like the rechargeable battery and also the plug in funtion.  i really like this fan.  i can take it anywhere too. the size is perfect too. i can always go smaller but this is still small enough for it to gee discreet which was what i was looking for.
3,My new baby..  I love this little powerful fan. Its get warm at work and I'm always fanning myself with a piece of paper. I helped a customer one day she had one of these fans and let me test it out..  I was impressed. I came home and ordered one! Ladies if you're having your personal summers LOL. Please invest in an Efluky portable fan. You will not be disappointed.*UPDATE* 07/12/2021..  The fan will not hold a charge. Normally when it's completely charged a green light will appear. However  with this paticular fan if it isnt charging..it doesn't work 😥
1,Battery does not charge. I only bought this fan because it was battery operated. Now it is of no use to me.
4,I have had this fan for only 2 months.  It will not run on the battery and must be plugged in to run.  I have tried new batteries to no avail.  I do love the fan itself but am disappointed that I can't use it with batteries.  Any suggestions?
5,This fan is excellent. It is small enough to carry in your purse but strong enough to cool you off in a hurry.  You can charge it anywhere you charge your phone (mine is Android). But it held a charge for me all day with intermittent use. I wish it had a handle to carry it with or to hook it on to something. Otherwise it is a perfect little personal fan.
5,It works great.  I love that it is rechargeable via USB cable and you can use it while the USB is plugged in.  I also like that it has 3 speeds.
5,These little fans pack a punch. They were fully charged in 90 mins. Lasted 4 hours on the medium setting. I could feel the air from about 8 feet away.
5,I bought the 2 pack for $15. Totally worth it! These little guys do put out some volume. The battery is a bit different but the unit is rechargeable OR you can use the USB cable. I go to a local bar that has live music on Sundays and can get quite crowded. Also stuffy! These are perfect to sit on our table and keep us cool. For $7.50 each? YES!
5,Great small fan for your desk or bedside table.It has a lot of power with 3 speed settings and a light setting also.I bought 2 of them. One for work and the other for home. The usb charge outlet is very convenient with using with my computer at work. It cools you quickly especially when you are having a hit flash.Worked well also during the hurricane when there was no power.Great buy!
5,I love this little guy! When fully charged it lasts for hours and hours on the low setting. I have it right by my bed and it last well into the night and really helps. Charges more quickly if the fan is off when it's plugged in - but charges slowly even when the fan is running.
5,Lack of instructions so it took me a second to figure out how to make the fan glow. Its very useful tho to have. My child can hold it and i dont have to worry about the fingers slipping through the cracks while he cools himself in the car and the glow effect just interests him more. At night its used as a nightlight and a cooling fan for my daughter.
5,This is a small fan but it works really well and has a strong air flow. AND you can carry it around with you if you have a big enough purse!! Wonderful product. I recommend!!
5,Great little personal fan...quiet and plenty of power to make quite a breeze!  Battery lasts a long time easy to recharge with universal mini USB cable connector.  Battery is removable and easily swapped.  Uses the most common battery found in Li-Ion battery packs so multiple extras can be salvaged from discarded Li-Ion computer or power tool batteries.
5,Works well. Comes with rechargeable battery lasts at least 1hr. Very convenient! i never use the light feature but could be nice for kids
5,good for a small fan with usb power
5,We got this to take to Hawaii and on Cruises where it is never cool for us.  This puts out lots of air.  We bought 3 for us to place around the room.  I don't know about the battery life.  We have not used it for very long.
4,Fan is great it works super well and keeps me cool at work. The only issue I have with it is that the charging cable does not go all the way in so it does not keep a full charge.
5,This is compact and easy to pack for a cruise/trip.  It provides enough breeze to keep you comfortable in a somewhat stuffy stateroom.  It also provides enough white noise to drown out the hall noise.  The battery life is decent but I left mine plugged in at night while running the fan.
1,Update: another day later trying to get it fully charged (supposedly when green light appears) it has never lit up green. Continuous red.Tried with using a couple different usb cables. Nope.Tried by connecting the usb cable to the wall plug of my phone charger. Nope.Will not work unless it is plugged it to the usb cable. Seriously.If you want to be tied to a usb cable and power supply then you might appreciate it.I had such high hopes for this little fan.Waste of money. Returning.Make sure you print tour own labels because ups will gouge you for printing them and the extraneous pages.Eleven hours and still waiting on the light to turn green indicating the fan is charged as the inserted flyer says it will.I will not leave it plugged in all night. Says 5 hours to charge. Eleven is utterly stupid.Also seems to be no difference in levels 2 and 3 for cooling. Same on bith for level 2.I'm gonna see how long it runs tomorrow on the highest speed if it lasts as long as it says it will and if it will recharge and the green light show up as indicated in the five hours. If not it is going back.
5,I’ve bought my 6 year old nephew legos nerf guns shoes footballs dvds games... you name it. This fan is by far his favorite gift. I’m not sure why but it’s a great deal if you have a quirky nephew you want make supremely happy. He wanted mine that I use daily at work but I comprised by ordering him one with fast shipping. Would buy again. And again.
5,Amazing little fan!!! Powerful and not very loud. Perfect for anything camping at home wherever! Cannot say enough good things about it. I will be purchasing more!
5,If there were 10 stars I'd have gave this fan a 12! I have Multiple Sclerosis and heat exacerbates my pain. Living in S. FL it's difficult to go anywhere without heat. This fan is bad ass! It's very powerful and quiet. It is going with me everywhere.There's even a little light on the fan in case you need to see in the dark.I'm on my way to go order another one!
5,Love this little fan!!
5,The convenience of charging the batteries with a laptop or charger can't be beaten. It is small enough to fit into my purse. I am almost always hot so it being small enough to fit into my purse is a plus. It is QUIET keeps a charge and has speed settings. It is so much nicer to use than the ceiling fan or other noisy options.
5,Bought this for our cruise cabin.  It was great for white noise with 3 different speeds adjustable to your level of noise preferred.  Also has built-in nightlight in blue.  This stays in my travel bag and I bring it everywhere now.  Very portable plugs in via USB.  I will be buying more for friends!
5,This little fan is a pre-menopausal woman’s dream come true! Hot flashes beware!! It’s also great when applying makeup! I have one at home used mostly for traveling and one on my desk at work. I absolutely love them!
5,I love this fan!  I have it on all day every day I am at work! Its quiet and the rechargeable battery is great.
5,Absolutely love this little guy. So light weight! The battery lasts about two hours but I generally run it on a USB connection at home so it's never a problem. It has an unbelievably strong air flow for such a tiny device. Great for cooling off my laptop when it's running hot. Also great for cooling me after coming out of a hot shower. It's also perfect for keeping cool while applying make-up. When I carry it with me I pack a portable power supply in case the battery runs out. Love love love it!
5,This fan was purchased for an upcoming cruise but I have found that this mini fan is PERFECT for the many baseball games/tournaments my boys are in PLUS I'm a preschool teacher in AZ and as the temperatures warm up this mini fan helps keep us cool.  The side emergency light does not work if the fan is on.
5,Bought this for my mom she loves it. Other then that not much details were given to me unfortunately.
5,Very strong airflow on all 3 settings. Low setting is the only one quiet enough to use in an office setting. High setting sounds like a remote control airplane and blows alot of air! It doesn't tilt up or down but is light enough to hold in your hand.Update: After a month of use the fan is much quieter. Still very powerful. Charge lasts about an hour on max speed. Increased to 5 star review.
5,Super cute! Works well.  Perfect for my desk at work.
5,Gives alot of air.  Takes up little space.
5,This small fan moves a lot of air.  I use it on low speed for most uses.  The small size is very portable.  I always bring it with me when I travel.  I've had other small fans in the past but none have come close to the air flow this one produces.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
4,it is easy to use but doesnt stayed charged for very long
5,This fan was just what looking for- very light - has just alittle sound for white noise-wish it lasted alittle longer on battery but just usually use the usb - perfect for travel- big save on a plane flight when was getting so warm when couldn’t take off and stopped on tarmac - passed it around to help our group cool off!
5,Extremely professional seller. I received a defective fan... It was working on usb but not on battery. I wrote to them on Friday night and by Tuesday they sent me a new fan.  Superb customer service provided by the seller!!My new fan is working well. It's small and powerful. I am a happy customer and would recommend it to all.I am putting up a picture with the salt tub to give an idea about its size.
3,The battery didn’t last longer than a month. I cannot recharge it and have no way of contacting seller because return window closed. While it was working it was great
5,This little guy is light portable strong quiet and long lasting. My office at work tends to get warm (old building not great central ac) and this little fan in low cools me down quick. I even got a little cold from it! Needless to say this fan works GREAT
5,Only had this for two months and now will not work even when plugged in. Very disappointed I really like it.
4,For the price they are decent. Can be a little noisy on the highest setting but that probably is normal for any fan in this price range. Don't expect them to lower the temp of a room at all since they really don't move a lot of air around.
2,This fan stopped working after less than 1 year.  It was pretty noisy.  Since it was not the expensive I did not pursue any recourse.  I tossed it when I moved offices.
5,I like that this fan is portable and rechargeable. I used it during labor and recovery after having my son. It was small enough to have it blow on my face but to not cool him too much. I like the small amount of noise that it makes as I'm used to sleeping with a fan.
5,I love the fan and it’s size. It only works when the cable is plugged in. I have charged the battery no green light take the battery out with cable still plugged and the green light comes on.
4,Love it perfect for travel and use it in my golf car.
5,A cashier saw me fanning myself one day and offered me hers while I checked out. I went home and ordered my own that night! This fan is a real fan! Not one of those little 2 blade spray bottle ones! I use it almost daily (it's also great for drying makeup) and the battery lasts for hours! I rarely ever need to turn the fan up past the first setting and I really like it can be recharged by my phone charger!
5,Already stopped working had already thrown box out
5,I literally love LOVE this product! I'm constantly battling with hot weather and this is just perfect to carry around. It definitely cools you down and the battery lasts long
4,I have enjoyed this product. I have it sitting in front of me on my desk at work and use it  often when I get hot or just need a breeze. It is small enough yet powerful.
5,I love this little fan. It's small enough to move to anywhere on my desk and I love that I can just plug it into my USB. I use this all the time. And the 3 speeds is a great feature that I didn't expect to use but sometimes turn it on low even in the winter just to move the air around a bit. Highly recommend.
5,Great little fan really moves air! Quiet & great battery life charges quick too! Use it on my desk next to my bed and camping and doesn't bother others. Sturdy has stood up to quite a lot of falling and getting kicked around.
5,I haven’t used it with a battery so I can’t speak to that. I had it plugged in and used it all throughout my cruise. I sleep with a fan on and it did the trick. Not noiseless quiet but definitely not as loud as a typical box fan.Small. Portable. Exactly what I wanted.
4,When you need a little extra air the eFluky is there for you. Not quite sure how long the batteries last but doesn't seem to make it through the night in our unless it is plugged in.
1,This isn’t good and the battery doesn’t last
5,I bought this for those steaming hot central valley nights. Oh and also because you can light up the fan blades which I figured would annoy the wife. I should have know better. It worked so good I had to order a second one for her. Well worth the money. The fan is quiet. The blue fan blade lights are a novelty at best. The amount of air this thing pushes was surprising. I have never used it an any setting about low.
2,Got this fan plugged in the USB to charge. You could use it while charging and it had great power and very quiet. Said takes 2-3 hours to charge. Left it on charger overnight - unplugged won't turn on. Only worked when USB was plugged in. needless to say- it was returned and I'll be looking for something else for my desk at work.
5,It's perfect for on top of my cart during med pass!!!
5,Received as a gift - happy with it!
3,First fan would not operate on battery power nor would it charge. A red charging light was all that showed. I checked the polarity of the installed battery and it was correct.  However when operating by USB it worked beautifully low noise and I was amazed at the amount of air that it moved. Amazon was contacted regarding the non-operable unit and sent a replacement by overnight delivery.  I will update if it does not operate properly.
5,This little fan MOVES A LOT OF AIR!!!! AND......A Separate battery makes TSA happy!!! On its own battery it runs about 3 hours plugged into a USB charger or a 10000mah battery charger....it will run all night!!!!
3,Although the fan is exactly what I needed as far as size and quietness it doesn't stay on all night when I'm asleep even though I had it on the lowest speed and my external charger plugged into it. I needed it to stay on until I woke up to help with the sleep issue I have instead of using my ceiling fan every night.
5,Fan has 3 speeds and enough power to really cool you.  I use it to cool down for a few minutes at a time several times a day and the battery lasts for many days without having to recharge.  I keep a fan at work and one at home.
5,Love it
5,Quiet enough to sit next to me in the office and not be terribly annoying to those around me.  It isn't perfectly quiet though.The battery is surprisingly useful.  I wasn't originally looking for a fan with a battery but now that it is an option it gets used around the house in all sorts of ways.
5,I JUST received this today and bought it for my home office. I work on a cordless headset that picks up pretty much any background noise. I live in an area where it gets very very hot in the summer time. THIS little thing is SUPER quiet. Almost silent and puts off a LOT of "wind" for as small and compact and it is. Love this!
1,Hey used to be at work. Battery last year for half an hour
5,It works good and is quiet
3,Loved this little fan. Problem is the rechargeable battery doesn't keep it's charge after 6 months of use. You have to keep it plugged in for it to work. So no longer cordless.Don't know where to get replacement battery.
5,This fan is a jewel in my line of work. It fits easily in my work space as well as on my cart. It was easy to put together and circulates air well.
5,Love this!  It works really well.  Don't run it on the highest speed too long unless you have it plugged into the charger.
5,This fan has really come in handy. I’ve been very happy with my purchase.
5,Perfect for my desk at work. I keep this setting on my desk and it gives just enough of a breeze to keep it from getting stuffy. It’s not whisper quiet but it’s not noisy either. Mostly just a small hum. I also like turning on the light feature sometimes too. Great little fan!
1,The fan doesn't tilt to direct airflow.
5,Puts out a lot of air for the size. Good for cooling off and drying nail polish.
5,Lasts long time got this for a friend's wife for the cool down after jazzersize It was perfect for her
4,Great little fan! I took this to Argentina during their summer because a lot of places do not have A/C and it was amazing! It doesn't get 5 stars because I left it plugged in for a few days and now the battery is unable to hold a charge off of the power cable. Other than that this was a life saver.
4,nice product but the battery won't last a full night even at the lowest speed.  Still this is the best portable rechargeable fan I have found.  Might be worth buying a brand name replacement battery though.
5,I needed a fan for work and after reading the reviews I figured I would give this fan a try. I really like it. It is pretty powerful for being so little and I like that you can increase or decrease the amount of air.It’s perfect for my desk.
5,Charges very quick. lasts long. Would reccomend.
4,The fan operates well with good output to be so small. The only dislikes are the battery life isn't long and the back fell off easily and can't be found. Other than that I like it.
3,Not as advertised! This mini fan won me over for the blue led light. I was quite disappointed when it arrived and didnt have one. I would of ordered a different one if I knew 😒
5,Use it while I'm working this fan is great. Glad I purchased also you can take it anywhere.
4,Small little fan that works really well. I actually get a little cold after a short while and thats at the lowest setting. Sits perfectly on my work desk
4,Love this fan. There is very little airflow at work so I constantly have this for air flow. It works great however I wish the battery would last longer so I generally have it plugged in.
5,These were a life saver on an overnight bus trip from Nairobi Kenya to Mwanza Tanzania.  Used a power block to keep charged all night. Wouldn't go without them.UPDATE JULY 2017 Still working great. Only use them for trips but even in a hotel room or at a friends house they are so convenient. We have been storing them without the battery installed. That seems to have been good advice.
4,Got this fan for my boyfriend because we does a lot of traveling.  The fan works great with the battery that was provided but where you plug the fan in - the other end of the USB is missing the insert part on the fan. Sending back.
5,This fan is amazing! My office is usually pretty warm and this works great to help cool me off. On medium and high it blows my hair back!Edit: I've bought two of these for my desk at work and they're still going strong. It's been a relief to find a USB fan that works as well as this one.
5,Perfect as a small desk fan and/or travel. Very powerful and easy to recharge with micro usb. Cool blue light effect too.
2,Vibrates way to much even on a flat surface
5,For a fan of it's size it is capable of displacing a lot of air even at its lowest speed. Battery life is very great as well. I like how it not only is capable of lighting up the fan blades w/ blue lighting but that this also has a white LED on the side to help function as a flashlight. Also I'm very impressed with the convenient charging method (Micro USB). This was by far the best fan I could have bought for the work desk.
5,It's been three months since I bought this.  My daughter uses every day and she enjoys it.  It's very sturdy and comfortable touse and portable.  So far we didn't find any issue.  Charging holds good. I might buy few more as gifts.
5,I’m loving this product. Surprised at the amount of air and how quite the fans is.  I bought it soon after hurricane Irma came through.  I get hot even when the ac is on 72*f in the house.  So now I’m prepared for the next electric outage  Or when I travel.  Just have to remember to charge my usb external battery pack and I’ll be ok.
5,Love it! It’s perfect for work and to throw in my bag ! A few of my co workers ordered one after they saw mine
4,I had originally received a fan that only worked when it was plugged into a USB port. The battery wouldn't charge. The seller was quick to respond to my complaint and sent me a new one. It works as expected now whether plugged in or on battery! Love this thing!
5,I took this camping and was impressed by how powerful it is. There is a low medium and high setting. Charging it via USB is a great feature too - you don't have to worry about constantly replacing batteries. It seems fairly durable but I have only used it twice so far.
5,Comes in handy when your A/C freezes in winter!
1,Cheap crap from China.  Does not charge up or hold a charge at all. Completely bogus.  Have fun trying to return it.
4,Great little fan.  Would give 5 stars if it was more stable.  Need to keep a towel under it on glass table or it moves around but otherwise fine.  I plug it into my laptop while I'm working.  Will definitely travel with it.
5,Shipped and received in a timely manner. Fan just as described and was the perfect solution to keep cool in the office.
5,I walk to work and am often sweating - this little guy cools me down in about 10-15 minutes once I've sat down. I usually leave it plugged into the charger but it's definitely versatile and compact enough to fit wherever on a desk. I'd say the battery lasts about 4-6 hours. Happy with the price and with the purchase overall.
5,I am a nurse in a long term cate facility and often five myself burning up from the hustle and bustle that comes with the job. This fan is a LIFESAVER to say the least. Even the lowest setting is pretty strong.  I often find myself turning the fan because it gets too cold 😊. BUY THIS FAN... you won't be dissatisfied!
4,Use in chicken coop.  Very helpful in the heat of summer.  Overcast weather @ constant rain slow recharging but that's expected.  I'm satisfied.  Customer service was very responsible and helpful.
5,This little fan really works and keeps me cool even with lowest setting. It’s surprisingly sturdy. Makes no noise and is so compact it hardly takes up any space.
1,Edit - UPDATE: Well in under a year it no longer charges. I got it in July used it for a couple of months and didn't use it much until it got warm again this year. The light indicates it's charged and it isn't. The light indicates it's charging when plugged in and it isn't... Complete junk and nothing more than a paperweight at this point. Contacted seller and it's 23 days over the warranty date so I'm out of luck. Looking at other reviews I see others have had the same problem. Consider it disposable.First off I PAID actual money for this fan so this is a REAL review.  I do really like it.  I used it mostly outside while sitting outdoors when it was unbearably hot out and it did the job. The charge lasts a decent amount of time and it throws a good breeze for something this small that's battery operated.  I would absolutely purchase it again without hesitation. It has 3 speeds and does have an LED light (which at this point I haven't personally had any use for it) which is a nice feature. Would be great at night while sleeping as there are no cords to worry about.  All in all very happy with this purchase.
5,This little guy literally blows me away. So powerful for such a small fan. I work in the movies and these are just as powerful as the ones that cost 70 and $80 each. Very compact as well. The rechargeable battery is a true bonus.
5,The fan really work well with a USB Port but there is a funny Idiosyncrasy if on a smooth non magnetic surface.  The torque or the vibration of the fan causes it to move or oscillate clockwise or to the left.  It does have magnets on the bottom
4,Stronger than expected packs a punch. If you run it on the highest setting it will go for a good amount of time but will automatically shut off if the battery drains. You could start it again but only at a lower setting this is a good design but I wish that it had a separate on/off button for the LED flashlight
5,This fan is awesome!  It's small (about 5 inches high) but very powerful.  It has 3 different settings.  I love the color and the little light it has on the side.  This fan is going all over the world with me.  I can finally sleep comfortably no matter where I am.  It's very easy to charge using its USB cord and it holds the charge for a long time.  Would highly recommend!
5,The battery life sucks but other than that I love it and I take it everywhere with me and I'm thinking about getting another one
5,Great little fan. Love that I can take it with me and that it's rechargable but also gives you the option to use while plugged into a charging source. It's amazingly powerful for such a small fan and it's really great for hot flashes.
4,Works pretty well. Moves a lot of air on the high setting. If you use it while it is plugged in it only operates at one speed (the medium speed). Runs all three speeds when running on battery power.
5,I bought this for when I travel. The air conditioning broke in the middle of the night during my last stay and I was miserable. I've long wanted to by a little travel fan and this one is the ticket. It is small and super powerful! I'm buying another one for work since it works so well and quiet.
5,son loves it because it hooks up to his lap top and he stays cool while playing games
5,This fan has been a life saver and it is powerful for how small it is!
5,This product is very strong and gives just the right amount of air needed to cool down. I like that it has 2-speeds and you can use a battery to transport the fan anywhere. The only downfall is that it doesn’t tilt. Other than that I’m glad I purchased it as it is definitely stronger than my last desk fan.
5,I keep this on at night when I'm sleeping and it lasts all night on just the battery! Great fan for the price.
2,It doesn’t work unless it’s plugged in. I bought it because I wanted a cordless fan.
4,Use it as a fan for the tent while camping. It’s a pretty basic fan and gets the job done well.
5,Definitely a powerful breeze noise is much lower than others that I've used. Using on max level 3 will drain it quick and also note that using it while charging it cannot be used on max level 3.
5,Pleasantly surprised this little fan move a lot of air. The noise is good if you are used to sleeping with a fan. I  thought the base would have been wider but its heavy so it wont tip over easily. Wish I would have bought more for the price.
5,The power of this portable rechargable fan is very impressive! It's perfect for my desk at work. I don't have much use for the tiny light but I'm sure someone would appreciate it.
1,Please do not buy!! As soon as I put the battery in it started to spark make noise and it got really hot. I immediately pulled the battery out and put it away. Will not ever buy again!!!
3,Great fan. Small but powerful. Just disappointed about the battery life. I basically have to charge it often or just keep it plugged in.
4,Bought as a gift. She loved it.
5,My wife uses one of these in the bathroom when she is putting on her makeup. Works great! I recently bought a second fan 2 use when I travel. I used to cram a table top fan into my golf bag when I traveled. Now I just throw this sand into my suitcase.
5,I really like this fan... once I got it in the mail I thought to myself "this is so small how is it going to work" but once I turned it on I was suprise by how powerful the fan was... even on speed 1 it blows alot. I've been through 2 category 5 hurricane and this product is one of the best I've bought so far.
5,Nice little fan.
5,I use this on my desk at work. It's small and the USB charge can last for a good few hours on low. The fan blows a good amount of cold air. To be honest I never really use the side light; but I do occasionally use the blue light so I remember to shut it off before leaving for the day because the fan is so quiet.
5,This fan is great. No more buying batteries! Whisper quiet and POWERFUL. It has three speeds but even the lowest speed is enough for a desk or nightstand. I don't even use the other 2 higher speeds. You can use it plugged in with a USB port or quickly charge the included re-chargeable battery and move it wherever you need it. I have one at work and one at home. I'm thinking of buying some for Christmas gifts.
5,I bought this fan to use at my office. I have it plugged into my USB port of my computer where I sit all day. It is very quiet and works very well.  I have not tried to use the battery so I'm not sure what that life is like. I keep it at low most of the time as high is a little louder but I don't believe than any of my coworkers can hear it.
5,Bought one for work so I could stay cool on those days the AC cant keep up. Love the fact it uses an 18650 battery so I can change it out if I need to. It will run and charge the battery at the same time while plugged in.
5,Worked great till it started smoking today when charging. Same charger charger works fine on other devices but now the fan will not charge. Owned it 3 months.Update: changed my rating to a five-star because of how quickly The seller came back with a positive response. They supported their product and are replacing it
4,The battery power can be increased as it ceases out within 1 hr of running when operated in speed 3.  Otherwise it is a nice product. Also you can add recline design
5,This thing is a beast for its size!! the 3 speeds are awesome and full blast is so much stronger than you would expect!best part is batteries are readily available at any Vape shop or online.  don't hesitate to buy this unit for your next camping trip or for your desk you will NOT be disappointed.
5,Not really sure how to rate a fan for versatility...? It blows when I ask it to seems perfect.Moves a decent amount of air and is not too loud. I bought this for nights when I'd have to sleep in my truck on the way home from late night gigs and it does the trick.
5,Due to medication I take I get horrible "hot flashes".  This little fan can sit almost anywhere and cool me down.  I love the blue light that acts as a kind of night light.  I wish that it had a warning light when the battery is getting low.  Otherwise it holds its charge well.
5,Ordered this fan last summer and still recharges like new ! Only thing I wish it had was a clip to attach to a table or stroller.
5,I live full-time in a small RV and this thing. Keeps things very comfortable. Lots of air movement and very low power consumption. A must for RV or van life.
5,Super nice small easy to use dan that holds a charge for a surprising amount of time. It's a great size to take with you anywhere and is surprisingly strong for the size of it. It is rechargable through a micro USB which is also handy since my phone uses the same type of charger. Definitely would reccomend to anyone who needs a small beach fan!
5,This little fan is awesome.I use it every time I play golf ( florida summer in the 90’s
5,Runs about 5 hours  without power on high. I’ve used it for about a month now.
5,This little fan is awesome! its amazing how much air it moves...used it during the hot summer days and at night (i can't fall asleep hot). I love the recharge capability. I leave it plugged in to USB all night and to works just fine. I store one in my back pack when during days I have to go to a windowless office to work. I bought two
5,For a small fan this moves a lot of air! I was blown (pun intended) away!
5,Took with me to SE Asia was a life saveron planes trains and boatsThe switch is not protected and can easily be switched on in your backpack it so quite you'll never hear it.I removed battery when not in use
5,This little fan is awesome! It's small enough to go any where with you. Strong enough to keep you cool and just the right amount of hum to put you to sleep! I bought this for my cruise cabin and it worked great now I take it every where with me!
5,Works really well for a little fan. Very handy and I love it. Even got one for a friend.
5,This fan was better than I ever expected it blows air and it charges it takes a bit for it to charge to use just on batteries but do you zap IUSB it works perfectly very good product and my expectations on the fan or a lot better than what I expected very good product I would recommend it to anyone
5,This little fan is more than I expected. It's very powerful. I left "battery life" at 3 stars because I haven't run through a battery yet so don't know. But the charging is very convenient and easy
5,Fan works well i use it for briefing and at my desk during my hot flashes. I use it often during the day and only charge once per week. I gave it 5 stars even though the battery compartment comes off sometimes when i have to carry it i my bag. Overall i would difinately recommend purchasing.
4,A little smaller than I expected which contributed to the 4 star rating. Battery life is decent. Quality fan and it worked well when it was in use.
5,Gave as a gift and she loved it. Portable  holds charge well and has several speeds
5,Love this fan so much it works amazing very early to carry around and I love the flashlight on the side
5,This is awesome! I use it on my station at work and it's powerful enough that I can feel it without being loud and annoying to everyone else. I bought an outlet (it comes with a cord to plug into a computer but not a wall plug). I leave it plugged all the time. Definitely the best fan I have ever found without it being huge it really is the perfect size for a desk or table top
5,I love this fan it travels with me in my purse.  I get hot easily and I use it many places from the movies to meetings to on an airplane.  It's not too loud it gets louder the higher the speed.  I only wish you could tilt it.  Love how it is rechargable.
5,Love this little fan! It is super powerful and great for on the go on these super hot days!
5,This is the best USB/Battery powered fan I've ever owned. It has 3 speeds and I have it on my desk in front of me between my 2  19" widescreen computer monitors and I have to leave it on low because med and high push too much air. It's quiet and the blue light is cool looking (I'm a guy.. what do you expect)  If someone were to steal it I would buy another one of these ASAP!
5,This is perfect for my office. I really can’t believe how powerful it is compared to others
5,This little fan puts out a lot of wind.  It's easy to carry around easy to charge not too noisy and not too heavy.  If I had had this during hotflashes it would have changed my life!  It's on my wish list but I plan to buy more for myself anyway ... one for the car one on the vanity etc.
4,I can't sleep without a fan so for my trip on a cruise I purchase this fan .  It worked decently.  The battery dies fast so I Had to keep usb plugged in .
5,This fan is well-made moves a remarkable amount of air and is quiet.  Very pleased with this purchase.
5,This is a very convenient fan to take with you to work or any other place. The only problem is that the battery itself doesn’t last all day. I use it if I need it at work and keep it connected to the computer USB if the battery dies.
5,Nice little fan. Makes just the right amount of noise for me to sleep.
3,I keep mine fan plugged into my computer because the charge doesn't last very long.
5,Keeping this
5,Love this little fan!  It goes everywhere with me just wish it held more charge.  I even use it in church sitting on the pew facing up at me; no one knows but my family whom just roll their eyes.
5,Quiet efficient fan. Compact size. Made well.EDIT REVIEW UPDATE: Beware even if you leave a review you will be hounded many times to do it again. I ordered three of these fans and left feedback six months ago and am still getting pleas to leave a review hence this update. By the way still love the fans.
2,The product never charged even after trying other cords and plugs. It ran plugged in for about a week and won't run anymore at all. Got it for a camping trip and it stopped mid-trip.  Very disappointing.
5,From such a small fan...even on the lowest setting! Great for cooling down hot flashes! Love that it recharges via USB/battery pack. Had my doubts due to its size but wonderful item! Just remember if the air around you is really hot the air blowing out of the fan will be really hot too.
5,I am shocked by how much air this little fan moves!  I only run it for an hour or so at a time I am not sure how long the batteries would last on a full charge.  I am just hoping I can use this for more than a year (unlike my last purchase)...I will check back in and let you know
5,Strong silent & long-lasting.  This is an amazing little fan with extra features:  on/off switch separate from the speed controll led flashlight built in and red/blue charging/fully charged indicators.  They don't tell you all that in the literature.  One caveat: the battery comes separate and the poles are not marked positive/negative so study up on that (hint: there is a indented ring around the positive end).  Efluky Mini USB 3 Speeds Rechargeable Portable Table Fan 4.5-Inch Black
2,This fan started out really great. Even on the low setting it provided a comfy little breeze while I was sitting at my desk. It nice and compact as well. Unfortunately it stopped working properly after just a couple of months. It used to run for a couple hours if it was fully charged and now it will only work if its plugged in. Kind of a bummer bc I wanted to use it for camping.
5,This works great for my desk at the office. It's compact enough and also can be powered by the USB on my PC. My former fan plugged into an outlet and the cord always got in the way.  This one is quiet. In fact sometimes I forget that I have it turned on.
5,I got this for when I travel to use in hotel rooms.  If you put it on the nightstand next to you it produces a good amount of air.  There is a slight fan sound which I personally love but not loud to keep you awake by any means.  Very happy with purchase
5,I am currently 7 months pregnant and work at a Healthcare Clinic. In Texas it gets HOT! I’m burning up while my coworkers are cold so I thought I would look around to get a portable fan that can stay at my desk. I LOVE IT! I keep it at 1 all day and does the job!
5,Love this fan. Perfect for work and very quite. Plugs into USB port on docking station. Work in area where area moves little and it has made a big difference
4,Great Fan for camping.  The battery is large enough to get you through all weekend.  My kids love the blue light mode and have it on a tent nightlight.  It has 3 speeds but you will only need the first one as it alone is powerful.
5,I take it on my lanai to music to my painting class; just love this fan and how I plug it in at night like my phone.  Also great on nightstand if you sleep warm.  It's not at all noisy which is a great thing.  Mahalo
5,Excellent fan stay charge a long time.
5,This little fan was a savior at boyscout camp in the triple digit July heat.  I bought it because it uses the 18650 batteries like my flashlight so I had plenty.  It also can be powered via USB but it only works  in low and medium on USB.  On high though this thing moves some alt of air.
5,So convenient!!
5,I have only used it a couple times in the past few weeks. But it was on an island run by a generator for a few hours. I was able to charge it up and it was very helpful on hot nights. It would be great if they could make one about 12 inches.....
3,Seems great but compared to my other portable fans i have used so far the air isnt as cool. Sadly return to get a different one.
5,I just used this on my 5 day cruise. And it worked great! I was able to plug it in and have it go all night. I unplugged it and it worked off the battery as well. Great power for such a small fan. I highly recommend.
4,The fan runs a little bit loud but it's okay due to its power.
5,it works great.  nice breeze battery works about 4 hours on med setting.  Base is bit narrow so if you are standing on uneven space it will tip over.  In high setting as long as it is flat surface it stays on.  Good for camping and emergency. It served me well past summer when we had power outage in 90 degree weather this alone wouldn't cool but keeping it by window it provided nice breeze.
5,This fan has multiple speeds which move a substantial amount of air for it's size. It is quiet and holds a charge for a great amount of time. Perfect size for portability.  I am really please with this item and would recommend to anyone seeking a small portable fan.
5,I've been looking for something to use on my desk at work.  It needs to be quiet and have a mild low speed (since it sits less than 2 feet away).  I tried a couple other table top fans but they were way to powerful.  This one is perfect and the rechargeable capability is a bonus.  The perfect solution.  Note: when my wife saw it she made me order her one also.
5,This fan saved my husband used on a cruise and he said it kept him cool during the night. It isn’t loud and puts out a lot of air. Only problem we had was it didn’t hold a charge had to keep it plugged in to use.
5,This little fan kicks out a lot of air. Plus is quiet.
5,I bought this in hopes that it would help when we went on cruises and by golly this little fans can really blow. It was strong enough that I was able to sleep comfortably and quite enough that it did not bother anyone else in the room.
2,This little fan is Perfect & very strong but after a full charge & 2 hrs into my shift it died!! Not impressed for only 2 hours! ******Update *****DON’T WAIST YOUR MONEY! This fan was great until after a few times (like 2 seriously) of adding a power pack the port would only work if you moved it around then got worse right away the port is in this cheap plastic it won’t work at all now $15 bucks down the drain
4,I can use it at a clients that the AC does not work well
5,Nice desktop size good power pretty quiet even on hi speed. Included USB is good length. Haven't tried it on battery yet. Running nicely right out of box for linearly 8 hours.  "3 speed" is pushing it though. No noticable difference between med and hi settings.
4,Great little fan so far.  On high it moves a lot of air for about 2 hours.  On low it's still a decent breeze up close but lacks distance.  It'll run for nearly 6 hours on low.
5,This little fan works quite well for me. I take it everywhere I go. It has saved me from the terrible feeling and embarrassment of hot flashes. It also provides a beautiful blue night light. Because it works so well for me I had to purchase one for my aunt as a Christmas gift. I love it!
5,So far so good. I had one before bought second  one that didn’t work. I wanted two for travel one for each for my husband and I. So far this one works. I really don’t care about the battery life as long as it powers up via the USB.
4,Excellent primitive camping fan. If it had a three battery option to keep the cool winds blowing.
5,Took forever to ship- still free shipping but it shipped from china.  For just a dollar more for the fan you can get the fan within the week. It only limits your color options.The fan itself is amazing.  The battery doesn't last much longer than 4 hours but that's still pretty good. The fan output is amazing.  It blows as hard as the 10" fan my friends had for their baby.  Good product overall!
5,So glad I purchased this fan.  Its small but it is so powerful! It will always be charged with the cord that can be used withmy laptop.Excellent product and the battery works well
5,Absolutely love this fan it was the best fan I bought just like all the other ones that I bought besides every one of them broke but this one so far the only thing that it could have had was the power being included but it's missing the power bank feature very durable.
5,might be tiny but it works wonderful
5,This is a great little fan! Very lightweight and portable. The highest speed puts out a decent amount of air for a small fan. The only complaint is the power light that stays on would be great if there was no light on the side bottom.
4,I like that you can charge it via USB. Overall good quality.
5,Have to recharge for every shift but works well
5,Works prefect
5,needed a battery operated fan for my new work.  It's works good especially if you hook it up to a battery charger other wise will last like 4 hours.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The grip on the bottom doesn’t hold long and the fan vibrations makes it move-especially on high. Also doesn’t have the longest battery life when used on high. However It is very powerful yet quiet! And very portable! Comes with a usb for charging. Also has a light on the side!
5,The flashlight feature had escaped my notice when I ordered it. This is a really great feature to have when traveling and in an unfamiliar hotel room. At home there are fans all through my home but this was purchased for hotels. It's a powerful fan.
4,Fan is a great purchase for the money but the picture shows it lighting up purple which is does not.
5,Just what I needed. Small and powerful I use it everyday at my desk.
4,Light and compact.  Travels well.  Good white noise to sleep to.  Can keep it plugged in.  Nightlight a nice touch.
5,The high setting could fly a kite!!!!!
5,I love this fan.  It's so cute.  I use it everyday.  I took it to church with me because their AC was not working properly. but attached it to a portable to keep the battery charged.
2,was good while it lasted
5,Great little fan! For as small as it is I'm very impressed with how much air it puts out. It is also pretty quiet which is a plus. I have it on my bathroom counter for when I'm getting ready and love that it can be cordless running on battery power less clutter.
5,We purchased 2 of these to take on a cruise. They did great! The battery lasted through the night and it actually had enough power to cool you down. It was small enough to pack in a backpack and durable enough that i didn’t have to worry about it breaking.
5,This is a perfect personal fan I can easily carry in my purse or have on my side table to cool me off in an instant. I would recommend this fan it is not the quietest fan I have ever had but it really cools me off quickly. USB charge is nice.
4,I love this fan!
5,Surprisingly powerful air flow good cooling whisper quiet. Love it.  Small but mighty.
5,Awesome product
5,Very happy with it
4,You can take it anywhere.
5,My five year-old is OBSESSED with fans...fans this and fans that. I got this for his fifth birthday and he is loving it! This small fan packs quite a breeze the blue light is cool and there is a little led flashlight(that operates when the fan is off). It holds a long charge and will be perfect for camping(when I sneak it away from my son). Very nice purchase very happy! :)
5,I bought this to use on a cruise....I enjoy the personal breeze and the very slight white noise as well as the little nightlight feature.  It worked perfectly.  Now that the cruise is over it's also wonderful to plug into my cpu's outlet to use while I'm on my computer.
3,I like the fan. Smaller than I expected.
5,It's not the size that counts it's what you do with it. This bad boy packs power and does the job I recommend. Now do know thst it moves if not taped but in my case it stays put because I use it on low and not in hard surfaces.
4,I really like the versatility of being able to use this cordless on battery. It is a powerful fan for its size.
5,We actually used this fan in the church during my nieces wedding in Rome last July. It was beautiful but soooo hot. The fan was quiet but provided several people with a relief from the heat in the un-air conditioned church. It is now a must pack travel accessory.
5,I work in a hospital and the nurses station tends to run warm.  I bought this to replace a different fan.  This thing is powerful and adorable.  I am always overheated and when it is on the 3rd setting I get cold.  Many of the other nurses asked where I got it and bought ones of their own.  I am buying a second one to keep in my bathroom.
5,Moves an amazing amount of air for such a tiny little fan.
5,Great little fan.  I use it on my breaks in my vehicle at work so I don't have to turn on the truck.  If I do use the truck A/C I use the fan to direct the air on me better.  Holds a charge for quite awhile especially if I use it on med. Instead of high.  Easy to use too!  Very handy!
4,Good amount of air from such a small fan.  Battery lasts quite a while.  I use in the bathroom when I'm doing my hair to keep me cool and it works.
5,Perfect on the go great for relieving hot flashes I keep it by the bed I purchased two of them - 3 speeds
5,I work an 8 hour shift and it can get really hot at work. I usually leave this fan on low and on a full charge it will last longer than my shift! It is quiet and light weight. It has surpassed all of my expectations and I am beyond happy with it.
5,I use it on my dog crate on the door with zip tiesto give my dog air in my crate when I go places. ( VET ) very good.I spoil my girl.
5,We bought it to use for a small area but my kids even used it at Theme parks during summer day and they liked it a lot! Very nice looking Quite and runs for long time after full charge.
5,Great fan for your desk but if you camp this little fan is amazing.
3,Well it does have 3-speed settings but there is no difference between the 2nd and 3rd speeds and the light only works in the fourth position without the fan on. It also has no tilt so you can't change the direction of the airflow up or down.
5,Likie Likie!! Powerful little fan that keeps me cool when the hot as HELL power surges hit me... Which is constantly. I bought another style of rechargeable portable fan at same time but the darn  thing won't recharge and only works sometimes while plugged in. Sending that one BACK and keeping this ONE ! I'm also going to order 2 more... One for work... One for the yard... Ok got it?
5,This fan works really great has three speeds and a light and it is quiet and lightweight perfect for travel and menopause's best friend
3,I love this fan for the look and color. It is very powerful as well. However the battery life is horrible. I have to constantly charge it especially if I set it to higher than one. And it is inconvenient because the charger is not long so I cant really use it when its charging.
5,Excellent product. Purchased two more for friends. Impressed with airflow and almost nonexistent noise. So quiet I keep forgetting to turn it off when not using it.
5,About this product to use at work. It puts out a great amount of a year even on the lowest setting. It only lasts 3-4 hours on battery but I started just plugging it right into my work computer USB port so it doesn’t bother me.
5,Love it wish the battery would last a bit longer though but used this on my cruise and it Definately helped cool things down.  Just keptbitbplugged in and it did the trick. Which we really needed because the air was not working properly.  Now use it in my home office and it gets the job done.
5,Wow!  This fan produces quite a bit of air  considering it's size!  I love that it has 3 settings and so far the battery seems to stay charged for a long time.  It's great for bringing on trips or just for using as a personal fan at home.
4,Tiny fan but actually works very well sitting right next to it at my desk.  It's very quiet
5,This fan is awesome and the fact that it’s portable and has so much power. I am so happy with my purchase.
3,I put it back in the box and here it sits.  I like the personal fan from Loews and I don't need to plug it into the computer like I thought I would
5,Great fan and iy has 3 speeds and the rechargeable battery makes it perfect for areas without plugs. And its usb which is even greater in places that have no plugs or no access to plugs or even at a cafe and its stuffy you can use it on ur laptop usb and just a smart buy all around.
5,I love these fans I have 3. In a house where everyone is cold using forced air heating. I I'm not find of the hit air hard to breathe and I'm burning up. I keep one of these near each place I sit. Now we are all happy!
5,Using right now outside finishing crossword puzzle.  Short charge time out of box. Like the 3 speeds....lights. More battery time would be nice but use battery bank usb for all night use. Will give to world roamer before she takes off.
5,This little fan and it is little is way more powerful on it's lowest setting than my last USB fan. My old one was a metal framed fan and was super noisy to the point of being distracting. This one is very quiet and compact. I will probably buy another for my home computer.
4,Quiet and very portable!
5,I seriously love this fan! I use it when I bowl in a weekly league. I get super hot and this little fan is pretty powerful. I love that its rechargeable. Our bowling league is 3 hours and it lasts the entire time on the highest setting. I just recharge it each week. For the price I highly recommend this fan.Oh and this fan actually fits in my purse which is really handy.
5,This one travelled with me to Germany (actually have two of them) while it was in the 90s there and no AC in the hotel or office.  These worked fantastic just leaving them on an USB charger on my laptop and the wall.  They helped a lot!  Well worth the price and the charge lasted from 6 to 10 hours but also charge while in use.
5,Every cruise we go on and even sometimes when going out of town we take these lightweight bad boys to keep air circulation going. The don't make much noise but they do a good enough job with cooling it down. We bought and love them. Works great on my desk when we aren't traveling.
5,I'm 270 degree satisfied with this product cost functionality performance and mobilityThere are tons of products and this is the best for money and performance you will get hands downthough it's not that durable because the battery keep pops out but it works great!
5,Cools down desk area battery life could be better but overall a good product.
5,This fan is exactly what I needed. Compact. Cute & works perfectly. Worth the $$$
5,This fan is great. I found that I used it so much. It was portable held a charge for a good amount of time and surprisingly moved around significant amount of air. I would highly recommend if you are looking for this type of fan.
3,The fan has good air movement and isn't noisy but the battery does not last as long as advertised.
5,I loved this little fan it works great in my new office
5,This fan is really good. For its size it gives good wind output and the battery lasts a really long time. On a full charge I had it running on its lowest setting and it kept blowing for 5 hours. It has 3 settings for h/md/low an led light (shines pretty bright) and an off button. It's also pretty quiet just a small hum.
2,UPDATE:Fan no longer can be charged. When I plug in the USB to charge it does not work. Tried different cables in case that was the issue (it was not). Bought in April 2020...it’s officially dead now and it’s only December 2020. 8 months usage!Initial review:I LOVE THIS FAN!!!! Portable compact and good battery life (if ran on low setting). Medium and high setting shortens amount of time fan can be used on a single charge. I take it with me to work and dialysis. Had it with me once when I was at an autoshop and this thing really came in handy since it was super hot in there! Overall worth the price.
5,This is a great little fan. My office at work gets uncomfortably hot. We are not allowed to bring in fans/space heaters that plug into the wall This fan is plenty powerful plugged into my computer USB port. Got this one based on a recommendation from a co-worker. Very happy with the purchase!
5,Muy eficazlo recomiendo
4,First one had a bad battery but the company was good about replacing it. We have one by the computer and one in the kitchen window for a quick exhaust system.
5,Great fan! I love the 3 different speeds and the built in light. Best part of the fan is that it has the rechargeable battery. We bought this to put on our stroller for our daughter when we are outside on hot days. It's nice because there isn't a way for her to stick her fingers in because the slots are small. It's worked great so far for us!
1,I have had this fan for a while now and it still does not hold a charge. You have to leave it plugged in order to get any real use out of it. To bad I missed the return window because I would returned and purchased a different fan. Not worth the money.
5,Keeps my partner very cool
5,I bought this for my young son who loves to spend time in his "fort" that has little air flow and gets very warm. This gets some fresh air blown in and is quiet so as not to disturb him. Great little portable fan.
5,There is nothing I didn't like about this fan I don't have the words to describe how good this fan is.It's small  but very powerful  you can use it while it's charging  the light is Handy.
5,Needed for both a breeze in the office and for a very small amount of white noise. Fit the requirements perfectly. Love that it can run on battery or USB. Very portable. Have had mine for over a year - no issues.
5,Excellent little fan.  Very powerful with three speeds.  I keep it charged from my laptop when I am using it so I don't know about the battery life.  For me perfect and highly recommended.
5,I love this little fan.  It packs easily in my suitcase.  The low hum and air circulation is just right for helping me sleep without disturbing my husband.  My only complaint would be that the rechargeable battery does not last for the whole night's sleep so I have to keep it plugged in.
1,Much smaller than advertised very disappointed.
4,Especially love the USB connection since I can just take portable batteries and make this fan work anywhere.  Would be perfect if it had a built in stand like other models in this price range.
5,Love it! Puts off alot of air! The only complaint I have is the battery time doesn't last long but it's a great fan other than that. I bought it for work and can't charge it there so I can't use it all day but if u don't need it for a long period of time it's perfect.
5,Love it so much I bought a second one. It's so convenient to move it where I need it because there is no cord. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a little help with their own personal summer.
4,Battery does not last quite as long as advertised but close enough. I generally will use this when going on vacation as I like the white noise when I sleep. It is very transportable serves my purposes and is a decent fan.
5,Love it! Will definitely buy again!
4,Great fan. Moves a lot of air. Small but great performance.  Shirt battery life so plan on a USB poet source.
5,Bought 3. Family loves them. Daughter takes golfing with her. We take on trips for white noise and fan.  Update. Fans don’t work half of the time. Even bought new batteries. Going to look for something better sine I am sure they won’t refund.
5,Exactly what I needed. Works great. Lot of air flow. Quiet
5,This little fan works very well. Quiet hum was enough to drown out some noises while camping and enough to cool down on the hot night. Only downfall is the battery doesn’t last on medium or high speed if you want it to run all night.
5,this is my third purchase.  I wear these suckers out because I take it with me everywhere!  I tried two other brands of fans in the interim and I keep going back to this one.  It's small enough to fit in my purse and the charge lasts all day.
5,Great as a gift.  Runs a long time on the battery.
5,Me encantó lo mejor que e podido comprar 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
4,It works well but is quite noisy on highest setting. Also doesn’t tilt but that my fault for not checking properly before I purchased.
5,Works great and the battery lasts pretty long
5,Works well  Is quiet and a nice small size.
5,I love this fan it's small enough to keep on my desk it's amazing how this small fan feels as if you have a huge fan right in front of you. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and cowokers
5,Works great.  3 speeds and it is quiet.  We liked it so much we bought 2 more (for travel and at work).
5,ordered this and it works great. only thing i wish it has was a pivotal base to be able to tilt the fan instead of a solid base. But the fan works great i just lean it against something to get the right angle.
5,Hubby loves this. I bought this for him for when we cruise. He is always hot and needs air movement when we sleep. This is easy to pack. It does take up a small amount of space in the luggage but that is more than worth it for my husbands comfort.
5,My nail tech had one. Liked it so much I bought onebv
5,Doesn't run as long on HIGH setting like reviews say but worked great where we just used it in central America. Just charge it when you don't need it. When it dies on high setting will run a while on medium then on low. Not to bad for $15
4,Better construction and build quality than I expected for the price.Only complaint is the flashlight - it's unnecessary and is weirdly included in the fan speed selector: Low Med High Flashlight Off. One star off for this oddity - 4/5
5,My little fan Works great. Holds charge a long time and is very portable.Bought my mom two and it took a while for her to charge them.  Neither one will charge.  So disappointing!
5,We got this for a late spring baseball game. It worked quite well. I brought along a few additional 18650 batteries which we needed but it was easy to swap them out quickly. Overall a good product.
5,Great portable fan that throws a good amount of air for a tiny fan. Nice that it has a rechargeable battery too.  For those who raise chickens this has been great way to get good circulation in my chicken coop on hot days.
5,Small and perfect for my desk on these hot summer days!
5,I purchased this for camping but it works great for all occasions. I’ve purchased two for us and subsequently purchased three more for gifts.
5,Love this mini fan. I bough it for work and it’s a life saver.
4,Nice rechargeable fan that you can also use off a power pack.  Nice for muggy nights in the tent.
5,I bought one to keep me cool the day of my wedding without having to lug around a big fan. Worked Perfectly! Now I have it sitting on my desk at work! LOVE!!
4,Just got it today and it comes with battery and cable. Would be even better if the actual face was able to tilt.
5,LOVE these fans!! Bought another one bc I love them so much!! Puts out SO much air! Charge lasts pretty good while if u don’t run it wide open. I had bought a $25 fan at Target that didn’t put out anywhere near the air this one does. FANTASTIC buy!!!
5,I'm a nurse and carry this around on my computer. It works great! I usually only have to us the 1st and 2nd speed the 3rd is very high has a lot of power! I love that you can charge it and don't need batteries:)
3,Works well as long as you have it plugged in charge doesn’t last long at all
5,This is sitting at my work desk. I actually have to turn it away from me because even though it's a small fan it keeps it REALLY cool.It's also so quiet that I never remember to shut it off at the end of the day.The rechargeable battery is a nice addition.
4,Wife loves little white LED 3 fan levels and it really moves the heat in our sauna!
5,This was my 2nd try buying a battery powered fan on amazon. Originally I tried Diazul and it was a total broken piece of crap. Now this one from Efluky is awesome! I love the blue color! The fan is really quiet and surprisingly powerful. I totally recommend it!
5,My family stay cold so they keep the heat up me on the other hand is a hot person all the time so we be fighting over the thermostat but now I can keep cool at night and actually get some rest
5,Powerful little fan. The lights are cool too. Love the 3 speed control.
5,I love this fan and was surprised at how much air it moves. I mostly run mine on medium as I use it next to my chair. It lasts a couple of hours so I charge it at night so it’ll be ready first thing in the morning.
3,TINY but powerful. Great night light and 3 different levels. Cools whole room. I love that its battery operated. I can take it anywhere
5,I have this and a space heater on my desk to help with temperature variances in my office. This works wonderful and is very quiet. With the battery I can move it anywhere in my workspace not just near the outlet (yes singular).
5,I loved how small and effective the fan was for our stateroom on our cruise. We kept it plugged in to avoid having to worry about the charge of the battery. Helps with air circulation and love the white noise for sleeping!
5,I love this fan!  Just the right size for my desk at work.
5,Great little fan used at work
5,Very impressive rechargeable fan. It's not a miracle battery it needs charging or left on some kind of charger but I just enjoyed its small size and Powerful motor while also being pretty quiet
5,This fan is amazing! It is about the size of a soda can and can fit into your luggage very easily. It comes with a rechargeable battery and a USB cable. The fan has 5 different speeds a flashlight on the side and the fan also lights up! It's great!!
5,Best work fan for menopausal people.
5,I love these little fans!!  They put out more air than some of the larger plug in fans i've owned!  Super portable and compact.  Rechargeable too!!
5,My friend had these on our missions trip - and they were so convenient and I was so amazed by the power of the fan from such a small item. As soon as we got back home I ordered two. I take them everywhere.
3,Nice portable fan but poor quality battery life. I’m using the fan in my RV refrigerator to improve cooling and on low the battery only lasted 5 hours. I plugged the fan into my recharger battery pack and ran it all night and it used very little of the battery packs charge.
1,It looked dirty and used when I first got it and wouldn’t turn on. Then proceeded to try and charge it but it wouldn’t charge at all and wouldn’t turn on.
5,Took a weeklong excursion to Haiti. 90 degree weather with humidity making it feel like 100 degrees. This little gem of a fan worked great for some great air movement and heat relief. I kept the fan blowing on me on a medium setting at night and it lasted 6-7 hours before running out of charge. Charges fairly quickly and runs while plugged in too. Great price for a great little fan.
5,I love everything about this product.  Lots of air flow quiet several speeds and the cutest colors.
4,Love this little fan.  I have used it while traveling in hotels waiting in carpool deer hunting in the hot summertime.  Have bought several...great gifts.
4,Only think I didn’t like about it was that it vibrates off of the table
5,This is a nice little quiet fan with 3 speeds perfect for your desk.  It came already charged and when it needed to be recharged I just plugged it into the USB port and it was ready to go again.  The first speed is perfect for me when I feel warm.
5,Love it works well good battery life just wish came in some diff colors. My grandson was enamored with it and stole it from me so have to get some more!
5,Awesome little fan. Really like that it’s very quiet and portable as at work there’s a couple conference rooms that get hot after a bit. I can now bring this fan with me while everyone else sweats it out lol. Would definitely recommend.
5,Best bang for your buck. Awesome rechargeable battery. Holds a charge for a long time even in storage. I charged mine and let it sit for about a year. Turned it on and it ran for about 7 hours on level 2.
5,I am always too hot and get migraines easily due to heat - this will be a lifesaver for me
4,The charged battery did not last through the night but when kept plugged in worked wonderfully.
5,Great product! It’s very strong and works better than expected!
5,Battery lasts a good while. More powerful fan speed w/o being plugged in
5,It is small than I thought.But It is strong and fancy.I love this item.
5,We bought this to take on a cruise due to popularity on popular “what you should pack for a cruise” posts. It’s so compact yet gets the job done! It has a nice hum and will drown out some common cruising noises. Can’t wait to use it!
5,Great little fan you can take or place anywhere. 3 speeds The blue LED is activated by pressing and holding the 'on' button for 3 seconds or so. I really like this one!
5,I am pleased with this purchase. The size output and sound level is what I was looking for as a desk fan at work. I leave it plugged into the computer so I do not know how the battery works.
5,Still going strong after 1 1/2 yrs of daily use!
5,I take it with me where ever I go. It is great for those sudden hot flashes that would be horrible without it.  I charge it once a week. It is perfect. Thanks for a great product.
5,The best little fan for work. It stays charged all day. Perfect for your work area.  Nice and quiet.
5,I love the fan. I use it at the gym while on the treadmill. The fan has 3 speeds which is very nice. The fan seems well made so I expect it to last a reasonable time. Delivery was fast.
5,I have bought quite a few fans for work… This is by far the best one. Very quiet battery lasts quite a while and it’s a very good fan to keep you nice and cool
5,This little fan is awesome! It is powerful battery operated borrowed during a power outage in 90 degrees weather. It worked so well I ordered one for myself! I love it!
5,I have my Mac mini in a cupboard below our desk.  I plugged this fan into the USB port and placed it in the cupboard to get some more air movement.  It keeps the area nice and cool for the computer.
5,It’s a really good item I use it at work because it be so hot and this can come in handy everything works really well no problems on my end.
5,This fan is POWERFUL!Its really small but it works great!
2,Strong fan blows better than the ponvey brand I just bought and the blue glow light is great for a night light (took us a minute to figure out you had to hold the on button down to turn the light on).The problem I had with this one is the battery they sent was loose in the box and won't charge or power anything. I tried a different battery in the fan and that worked and charged fine so it is the battery and not the fan. Since this was needed for a camping trip that kind of makes it hard to use.The fan gets 5 stars the lack of working battery drops it down to two.
5,The Efluky fan appearance might fool you this small fan is perfect to survive emergencies like the one we are going thru in Puerto Rico  at this moment. The fan is small but powerful for its size and it is a blessing to survive the caribbean hot nights without power.
5,This can is amazing!  It is quiet and works great.  I use this in an office with zero privacy and no one has complained about the noise!
4,It could have been a bit more powerful but works well for my desk and a travel fan.
5,This thing is strong! I haven't tested out the run time of this fan as it isn't hot enough to use it yet but man this thing can push air. I purchased this for the little one for days when we are out and about in the hot weather but even on the low setting I will probably have this thing indirectly blowing on her.
5,I love my hot flash fan lol I bring it to work with me
3,You get what you pay for it was cheap so I didn't expect it to be great. It vibrates around my desk after a few weeks of use so I have to pen it in behind my keyboard at work. I only use it plugged in so I can't comment to battery life.
5,It’s a cute little thing. Hurricane Michael done knocked my power out for a week and it was hard to sleep with how hot it was. I purchased this because it is rechargeable. I’ll be ready for the next one.
5,Good quality fan
1,not a good product does not work as described. will not charge defeats the purpose of portability
5,The previous budget priced fan I bought lasted very little time. This one however it's still going! Well not at this moment but you get what I mean. I am supremely happy I bought it. It's very powerful too.
5,Do not underestimate this fan because of its size and cuteness.. It packs a lot of power in a a very quiet and efficient little fan. And the lights put it into cuteness over load. Perfect when I am sittiing at my desk or in the front room watching tv. Shoot. It's rechargeable. I could take it to a restaurant or when I travel!
5,I use it all the time at restaurants I get hot after a glass of wine the fan cools me off.
5,I love this little fan! I bought it because I get hot at work sometimes and this little guy puts out the perfect breeze. My coworkers kept borrowing it and several of them have now bought their own.
5,UNREAL THIS LITTLE FAN CAN PUT OUT SOME COOL AIR EVEN ON LOW.WOW HARD TO BELEAVE RUNS ALL NIGHT ON LOW.HIGH IS REALLY POWERFUL AND MID.ALSO.AND THE LIGHT IS REALLY NICE YOU CAN JUST LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN ALSO WHEN RUNNING IT.GREAT PRODUCT I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE IN BLUE.GREATTTT FAN FITS ANYWHERE NOT SMALL AND NOT TO BIG JUST RIGHT.
5,Died after 7 months of use.
5,I go to a high school that is overpopulated and lacks air conditioning. So you can imagine that there is no difference between my high school and an inferno. I usually buy desk fans to keep myself cool and I can definitely say this was the best one I’ve ever purchased.
4,Love how compact it is. Only issue is that the fan speed slows down when you plug it into the wall with the charger.
4,Great for the price and USB charging is really convenient. I recently went to Germany during the HOTTEST two weeks of the year. They don't have AC there so this little fan kept me sane and cool. It is pretty powerful too for its size.
5,This is the perfect fan to have on my desk at work. It’s quiet but puts out a nice cooling breeze! The battery life is great! I only have to charge it once about every 4-5 days.
5,I really love this fan. It is light and portable. It really came in handy when our power went out I was still able to have a fan and the light on it is very bright. This puts out a lot of air esp for such a small fan. I am able to charge it with the charger for my samsung phone.
5,I use this fan at work everyday at work! It’s quiet very strong fan and the battery plugs into my computer! When I in plug it the battery last a long time!
5,The small fan is very quiet but move an amazing amount of air for such a small fan.  If it was on an any stable base it would be the very best personal fan available....serious...I bought 2 more fans as gifts since you can use the lithium battery or run on the sub cable with a plug adaptor.  Highly recommended!
1,The fan only works when plugged into the charging cable which completely defeats the purpose.
5,I'm sold! This tiny fan delivers a powerful stream of air. Perfect for Florida heat. Got one for my kitchen. Will DEF buy a couple more for those hot spots in the house.
5,Replacement  was very quick. And works perfectly.  Thank you
5,So far it's been reliable. Uses 18650 batteries. Dropped it a few times and it hasn't broke yet.
5,What a great little fan I bought another one so I could have two in my RV
5,Best little fan!
5,I love this fan!  Great power in a compact space.  Really cools!
5,Small fan quiet adorable aqua color. Strong cool breeze on each setting. The added light feature is fun .  I have it plugged in to a USB outlet and run the fan for 8 hours at a time with no problem. I m very happy with this purchase. Would definitely purchase again. Packaged well and great communication from the seller.  Thank you!
4,Powerful and compact
4,This is an awesome and powerful portable fan easily more powerful than any other I've purchased.  It's perfect for trips to the beach or the dreaded New York City mass transit system during summer.  Battery life is awesome!
5,I have bad hot flashes. I have a fan on my desk and fan next to my bed. Best fan ever!!!!
5,This is the best! I travel in my van and this fan puts out an incredible amount of air for its size.
5,Great little fan for my desk at work. Keeps me cool and hooks up to computer for all day usage. Love it!
5,Great for individual use especially when others don’t want a fan blowing on them. Powerful enough to cool on a hot day. Best  if used within a foot or so.
5,Great little fan. I keep it by my computer because I tend to overheat. I hardly ever have to go over the first setting because it puts out so much air. If you need a little desk fan that thinks it's an air conditioner this is the one to buy!
5,2nd fan I have purchased from Efluky.  Great desktop fan but also portable with the battery.  Lasts a long time on the battery.  Highly recommend if your workplace is warm or need a little fan by your bed.
3,This is a good little basic fan but I don't use it as much as I thought I would. Even with different speeds it seems like it's blowing too much in my face.
4,Good
4,Great but it doesn’ have LED light
5,I love the fact this is a small fan and easy to use. I take it out of my desk and use it for a few minutes if I get hot the power it has is crazy awesome
5,I've bought this fan for my 2 year old daughter whenever we're out and about (usually strolling in disney.) So far it has been very good. The battery lasts us all day on and off only on speed one. This thing can push some air. We don't even use the second and third speed. Very good product and fid quality i highly recommend!
5,This little fan has been a real work horse. I use it at work where the summer can be a bit warm. this last summer was quite comfortable because of my little efluky. I heartily recommend it.
5,The reviews are true!  You open this fan and think it's not going to put out much air.  Wrong!  It's a beast of a fan for the price...
5,It's small but powerful. Great for when your desk has a lack of airflow and needs a little bit of circulation. My boss and coworker are looking into buying one for themselves as well since I told them about it.
5,It is a little bit noisy but depending on your working environment you can use it in the office. Since it is quite light you can also enjoy this portable fan outside.
5,No longer have to purchase multiple bulky heavy batteries and transport them from place to place.  Charge runs out a little quickly but keeping USB cord plugged in while using it at hotel solves the problem.  Love this fan.
5,Moves a lot of air for its size and it is quiet. This is now my new camp fan. My tent has an overhead mesh shelf wich makes it perfets as a tent fan for me otherwise you would need to get nightize twisty ties or simething like it to hang it in place.
5,Wow.  Can't believe how much air this thing can put out.  I put it in my backpack and was at the airport in Saint Lucia where there was very little air conditioning.  Everyone was sweating and miserable but not me.  I had this on and everyone wanted one.  I'm ordering a couple more
5,We bought it to use on our cruise to move the air around in our cabin.  It was great for a little fan.  Definite get when you go on a cruise.  Great shipping great product.
5,I purchased this fan specifically for my office desk. But with the convenient usb charging battery I can use this anywhere including on camping trips. It's perfect for any travel. I would highly recommend this fan.
5,My daughter is always hot in her office and/or her research lab.  I thought this might be a solution to getting some air blowing no matter which location she is in. She always has a laptop or Ipad with her so charging this shouldn't be a problem.  It is lightweight and can be easily moved.
5,Fan works great battery life is not very long if on high but on low it lasted almost the entire flight from Dallas/Ft Worth to Hawaii.  The blue fan light works well in hotels for a good night light too.  We bought anther one after our trip.
4,Used this on a cruise.  If you have it on high it will not last all night on the battery.
5,I have another fan for my desk at work; it has only one speed and must be plugged in. This fan has 3 speeds (the slowest is what my other fan put out) and runs on battery!  You recharge it by plugging in a USB to mini.  You can take it anywhere.  Going to buy more.
5,We’ve used this every day for about 8 hours per day for the past two months and it has continued to operate smoothly and quietly.  The price was competitive and the USB connection is very convenient.
5,Great little fan! My office doesn’t have air vents distributed well so I can get really hot in my cubicle. I use this on my desk and it makes a huge difference in my day. Everything was as described and shipped fast.
5,We have two of these now.  Love how strong and quiet they are!  Small enough for desk and portable enough to take with you.  Charges fast
4,I didn't have this for too long but it was good while it lasted. Unfortunately it was stolen on one of my trips.
5,Love this fan and I use it everyday.  I bought to have it with me for business trips. I like a fan at night. It is very quiet and moves a lot of air even on the lowest setting. Would definitely recommend.
5,Wow. I bought the Efluky 4.5" at the same time I bought the  O2Cool 10" and the little tiny Efluky puts out more air than the O2Cool.  Amazing little fan that has. 3.7 volt lithium ion battery and a built in charger.  At 1/3 the price and almost no weight.  I highly recommend this fan.
5,I love this little fan. I was recently in the hospital and used this fan they keep the rooms to warm. Every nurse doctor and visitors offered to buy it from me. I bring it with me everywhere. Love this little fan great investment
5,Have it on my desk at work and it blows nice cold air all day. No one in my general area can hear it or even know I have it.
5,So far so good. Blows a pretty good amount of air for the size and can’t complain for the price. Now just waiting to see how long the battery last.
1,This sucks don’t buy
5,Nice little fan to keep at my desk. A little loud on its highest setting but I don’t expect it to be super quiet at it’s price. Battery lasts awhile when using it intermittently.
5,I purchased the fan for a recent cruise. It was fantastic! I couldn't believe how such a small fan could do such a great job. Love it! Very compact lightweight quiet great air movement.
1,smaller than expected but cute and portable. I had it a month and it just quit stopped charging. complete waste of money!
5,Love this fan. I read the reviews and thought it sounded goodso I bought it. Wow does this fan work ! It's blows like a bigger fan. The night light and the flashlight are so handy. I bought this fan to use on end table by my bed. I have hot flashes through the night and this fan is my lifesaver. I highly recommend this fan!
1,I hate I wasted my money this fan doesn’t work unless you have it plugged in. Once unplugged it lasts for 10 minutes. Noise level is cool but that battery isn’t working at all.
5,I couldn't believe the amount of air this little thing kicks out! Battery life is way longer than I expected. Comes with a 18650 battery to boot. I'll be getting more of these for gifts. My father in law wanted one as soon as he saw it.
5,Cool blue glow at night. Love rechargeable battery included and portability.
5,I use this fan on my work cart. It can plug directly in my computer for charging or I can disconnect and use the batteries. Strong little fan provides me with the breeze I need to stay cool.
5,Great to have at work for when hot flashes hit! Lol3 speeds work great and the noise level is low. I keep it on my desk at work!
3,I was shocked at how small this is.  It seems to work ok but it’s kind of flimsy and because of it’s size the span that the fan blows is very small.  I’ve bought several smaller usb fans and have to say it’s definetly over priced for what you get.
4,not the biggest fan of the color but it serves the purpose! Love that it's wireless and portable can move around my office desk with no worries
5,I was really surprised with how much power this fan has.  I use it for the Gym and its very portable and lightweight.  Would definitely purchase again.
5,Love the design.  It's not silent... but it helps me sleep.
4,Like the fan but you can't adjust the direction of the fan (up down etc) because it's stationary.
3,The fan works decently well but not as well as others. When charging you can only go up to medium setting. The battery doesn't last nearly as long as other fans i've purchased. It's also not adjustable so you have to lean it against something to get it at an angle. Would not buy again.
5,Got this to dry cookies as I decorate them. Perfect small size with a good fan effect and multiple speeds. Really like being able to charge with plug in cable. Much easier than replacing batteries.
5,I would recommend this for anyone what needs a little cooling off. I know of 3 other people that I ordered it after seeming mine.
5,Love these fans. I use one at the office one in the kitchen and one in the camper they work great to get a camp fire going! 🔥🔥🔥
5,Easy to charge and small to carry.  I bought 6 of them and use them all the time..
4,I loved it until the battery took a poop on me after only 6 months
5,Nice little fan that moves a lot of air for it's size (about 5" in diameter). If you use it regularly you will want a few extra batteries because they only last a few hours on a charge. Construction is a little plasticy but it is quiet operating.
5,This is a nice product and works very well. I keep it in the garage and in the jeep when traveling and it is a nice addition to my camping gear.
3,Battery never charged but it works fine via USB
5,I love it  and the flash make it awesome
5,These things are awesome.  I have multiple and use them as fans when we overnight on our boat.  Get yourself a 10ft USB cord and a external cell phone battery pack and you have a portable fan that will run all night for days and days.
5,great product .
5,For the size it is a great fan! Will definitely take with us on road trips when we travel and for hospital stays (have had kidney stone issues lately and go quite frequently). Love this fan and will buy probably a couple more!
4,I love this tiny fan.  I live where summer temperatures run between 98-110.  I use this when I can't get the room cool enough!
4,So far my girlfriend loves this fan.
5,Didn't expect the amount of coolness this fan provides. It is rechargeable - a big plus - but the real draw is the amount of cool air it puts off. At the highest speed there is a little noise but not annoying and you don't need that high. LOVE this!!!
5,Bought it for camping trip.  It lasts about 6-7 hrs.  Has a nice quiet breeze.  Now I use at the office for hot days.  Wonderful product I would buy again.
3,I ordered two of these and 1 works okay and one arrived with the battery cover missing also stopped working after a couple hours. It refuses to charge and I know the battery is good as I put it in the next fan and it works fine. I believe I was sent a used fan passing off for new.
5,These work fine.  I need air to my face to keep me awake at my boring call center job until they take it away.
5,I'm just so  overwhelmed  and surprised how this tiny usb fan can cool off my 3 m X 6m room. It came just in time when the temperature rise up to a high 80+*degrees. Unbelievable performance small but terrible I can sleep better now. I carry it in my purse all the time. The best thing that ever happen to me today.
4,First fan I received did not work.  The company replaced it with one that does.  So far it works great. Light and fan works at 3 different speeds.
5,I bought for camping and was surprised that the reviews were right. This thing is tiny but has quite a punch the air flow is very strong for being so small. It is not that expensive and if it only last a couple of years that's ok time will tell.
5,Perfect to use with a USB charger..battery is not replaceable and does not hold a charge.
5,A lot of power in such a little package. I bought it for work and it's kept about 2 feet in front of me; even on low speed it gets too be too much air and I have to put it somewhere not so close to me. Love that I can charge it with my phone charger!
4,My husband likes a fan when he sleeps and this is easy to pack.
5,The battery just lasts and lasts and lasts...very quiet even on high it really does the job. i just love the fact that it is rechargeable
5,Love this fan bought it to use at work station at work other co-workers had them and we love their perfect size and different levels. I also got one for my Son who uses it while he is DJing to keep him cool and he loves it. Would recommend to anyone who needs a personal fan
5,I bought for my husband whom works outside all day and he was able to carry around with him and love that he could put it on the USB charger in his truck overnight.
5,Love this little but mighty fan. I use it at my work desk  and it is hardly noticeable but makes its presence known with great air flow ..
5,Great little fans. Bought one for my desk. Bought one for my wifes night stand she sleeps better now. Bought one for my shop.super quite for a fan that moves a lot of air.
4,We purchased this to keep in the car for our dog. It worked pretty darn good. Don't forget to turn off it's so quiet you can't hear it. It has a recharger that makes it nice.
5,this is a great fan moves a lot of air for its size and last a while
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is great for the parks work or during long drive. I also use this to speed up lighting the charcoal grill.
5,This is the perfect desktop size personal fan. I have several of them and take them everywhere (small enough to fit in my purse). Three speeds good battery life charges quickly. A great product overall.
4,Good powerful little fan. Only thing I'm disappointed about is I thought the light was in the fan not on the side but it works well so can't complain in the operation and usability of this fan
5,Strong and quiet fan for an office setting.  I am really impressed with the air flow movement for this tiny fan.  I am excited to take it around during the summer for my children to cool down.
1,Almost zero airflow!Terrible don’t buy!
4,I like that it's portable fits in my bag runs a while before needing to recharge.
5,Bought this to take on a cruise as we have had two previous experiences with our stateroom being too warm.  That was not the case this go around but did come in handy during excursions when riding on buses and.  The amount of power this fan has in unbelievable for it's size!
5,I am NOT kidding! This little fan is powerful and kept me cool for hours during a night spent enclosed room riding out hurricane Irma...high winds took out our electric and so no a/c in stiflingly Fl...thank you thank you thank you!!!
1,No sirvió
5,Perfect for my desk at work!!
5,Works even better than I thought!!!!!!
5,I use this fan frequently because my office is so hot.  It provides enough air flow with out being to much and allows me to do my work and feel comfortable.
5,Have not had long enough for battery but it looks like superior tech.  It moves air recharges via usb.  Small enough to travel. with.
4,Good. Just what I expected and needed
1,Unfortunately within ten minutes of use i smelled burning.  The included battery was smoking up! Just be safe. Maybe I got a defective one.
5,This small fan is really quiet and blows really powerful for something so small. Can’t speak on battery life just yet haven’t had it long enough. Will update soon.
5,This little fan is more than worth it when you are camping in the desert and it's still hot at night. It runs all night and if you have the same batteries you can replace them and keep it running.
5,Great for the price strong for the size relatively quiet. Haven't used it unplugged yet so can't speak to battery life but planning to take it camping soon.
5,Puts out a lot of air for a little guy.  I have it on my desk at work.  I plan on taking it along with me when I travel.
5,Best battery powered fan I’ve got have purchased three of these now.
5,So this is the 2nd fan I’ve ordered on amazon. And this is by far my favorite. I use it at work and love it!!!
5,Very happy with this purchase
2,I have bought this fan 2 times. The first time was a black and white and it lasted maybe 2 months and then the piece that you insert the charging cable into broke and fell into the fan. Well that just happened with this one and it’s very disappointing. I would not recommend this fan.
5,I use it at my desk at work and its fantastic! I can easily charge it with the usb port throughout the day and take it along with me if needed. Holds a long charge and produces a nice breeze with the three settings.
5,I can not imagine how it would have been staying in a cruise ship cabin with a woman in menopause and no ceiling fan.  OMG !! So glad I purchased 2 of them.
5,So far so good i love that I can re-charge it after each use and that it came with a charging cord. Perfect size not to big- not too small!
5,Lot of power in this little fan
5,I love this fan this is the second one I purchased. It’s a very powerful for its size and very quiet also. Three speeds  plus a light. Great item
5,A fan like this was on my 16 year old nephews birthday wish list.  When he opened it he was super excited & thought the small size was perfect.
5,SO many small fans to choose from...I gave this one a shot. It was beyond my expectations. 3 speeds flashlight battery (included) or USB operated  plus fancy light up blades if you push and hold the speed button.  It puts out a strong breeze. Buy it you won't be disappointed.
4,Not to noisey
5,This is the second Efluky fan we have purchased. It works great!  My husband used mine and had to have one of his own. Strong air flow and small enough to take anywhere. We love them!
4,Very powerful little fan!
4,It's not adjustable with it positioning
5,This fan is very powerful and blows exceptionally strong for a small fan. It works great.
5,This fan is perfect I keep it in our travel suitcase. Cruise cabins and hotel rooms have a tendency to be stale this provide just enough movement to keep the air in our room or cabin flowing. Plus the little light comes in handy during the middle of the night.
5,Perfect! Two of my fellow coworkers bought one and loved it so I decided to purchase one too. Love taking this to outdoor activities and having it at work! A must have.
5,I use this fan at my desk and it's perfect. Super quite and just the right amount of air flow. I love that I can keep it charged by plugging it into my computer!
5,I got this for the wife for work she loves it.On a full charge on low setting it will run for 5 to 6 hours works great. We like it so much we ordered another one so she would have one at the house.
5,Like the power of this little fan. I use it at my desk at work. Nice and quiet.
4,Wonderful quiet little fan! One of the most quiet that I have! I could really use a clip on it right now though :/
5,Really has kept me cool without having to plug in.  Just love it!  Battery lasts long.  Has a bright light too.
5,Good so far
5,Love it. Produces the right about of air flow with all the different speeds. Very quite on my office desk (I feel I work in a morgue somedays) and charges nice and lasts a long time. Loved it so much I bought one for my desk at home.
5,Super simple to use at my desk - does blow enough to cool me down and not too much air that it blows papers around. Seems like it does need to be charged constantly so I keep it connected with USB.
5,Great quality and comes with the lithium ion battery. I'm very pleasantly surprised as I was expecting a flimsy fan made of cheap plastic. I took this camping and it was so worth it.
5,Love love love it..
5,I just received my fan and the insert states "it is strictly prohibited the battery is used under ambient temperature over 60 degrees.  Is this a misprint?
5,This little fan don’t judge a book by its cover.  This definitely gets themost bang for your buck.  I recommend it.
5,Powerful little desk fan which can be plugged in or use enclosed rechargeable ion battery.  I love that it has 3 speeds.
4,Great little fans and love them rechargable. If could adjust slightly at the base would be 5 stars hands down but the fan and power are 5 stars.
5,Love this fan. Battery life is great rechargeable and it's quite and powerful. This is the second one I bought. 1 for my office and one for travel to hotels.
5,Awesome desk fan. I use mine at work and love it for when my office gets hot. It has three speeds each of which is pretty powerful for the size.
5,Works as c expected.
5,Great little fan! Bought it for my hospital stay when I had a baby kept me cool and lasted more than the four days I was admitted on one charge.
5,Fan is smaller than I thought but has great air flow.  Haven’t used it yet.  Waiting for a power outage
5,We bought this to have on our wedding day since it was 90 degrees out.  It's a very powerful but quiet fan.  I like that it is rechargeable.  I'm not sure if I'll ever use the light on the fan but it's nice to have in case it's needed.
5,Compact 3 speed sturdy fan. NO cord when charged long life rechargeable battery. A great fan & I may buy one for the office.
4,Works good but drains battery fast. Have a few 18650 back up ready.
5,my daughter loves it
5,It works great! I have a few different types of portable rechargeable fans and this is one of my favorites.
5,Perfect for what I use it for. Easy to travel with and the 3 speeds are perfect
5,Battery life is fairly good on a full charge -- and the fan really blows!  Great on hot summer days at the desk.
5,Very good portable fan. Long lasting battery and lots of power.  A bit loud at highest setting. Otherwise it's a great little fan
5,Bought this fan to help keep my thumb dry while bowling. Works great and gets the job done Especially in the summer league. I have been pleased with the purchase.
4,Good little fan. Not as loud as I needed for a travel fan but the size is great!
5,This is the greatest little fan. It’s crazy the amount of power it has. I have one at my work and I’m always getting compliments about how well it works.
5,Works great for us. Bought it for our bunnies to have some cool air flow.
5,Love this little fan it’s on my desk at work! Does the job battery doesn’t last too long if it’s on high but I usually leave it plugged into the computer anyway.
5,This fan is great! The power lasta for a long time.  The wind it produces is surprisingly powerful for such a little thing.  The light is just a bonus feature (small and dim) to add a bullet point.  But I've got two of these and have bought some for friends.
5,I bought it for my girlfriend and she uses it every day so far she hasn't had an issue be nice if the battery would last a little bit longer
5,Great little office fan. Ordered it twice already. Although the 2nd one vibrates where my first one didn’t.
3,I love that this puts out a good bit of air very quietly so I can use it in my examination room without having difficulty hearing my patients.  Three stars because I can only use it with the USB cord the batteries never would charge.
5,This is a nice travel fan for those that like to sleep in the cold air
5,The temperature is uneven at my job so when everyone else is freezing I'm hot in my office. This little fan does the trick!  I love the size yet it definitely helps cool me down.  It's also so convenient that you can charge it by plugging into your computer. Great buy!
5,This is the best desk fan I've ever had. I bought it for work:  super quiet even on high speed and great price. Once it's charged I can take it with me to break if I need to.  It would be nice if it tilted up and down….very pretty as well.  I highly recommend! Thank you. :)
5,I keep it plugged into my PC and keep it on my desk where I can get uncomfortably warm with all my surrounding electronics and whatnot. The 3 power levels are nice. It's not too noisy but I'm usually wearing headphones anyway so I don't hear it at all.
2,The problem with these fans is that they last about a year and then the electrical connection fails. I'm sure that if I knew how to pop it open and re-solder the connection it would be an easy fix. I can't in good faith purchase a THIRD one: obviously this is an issue with the design. I really loved the battery option but sending two of these to the landfill is all my conscience can handle. Will recycle the battery. Will buy a different product as a replacement
5,Small and quiet. Brought on a cruise and gave one to my sister. Made sleeping very comfortable. Product was exactly as shown and transaction quick and painless.
5,Works better than expected. It has been hotter than usually in the bay area and this fan was perfect. Very compact but works wonders! This product will be perfect for my camping trip.
5,Great little fan for personal use. Have had many people ask me where I have gotten it from
4,I love this! My only wish would be a tilting ability. I highly recommend it.
5,I love it for my desk but when I charge it the charge doesn't last. Definitely will keep it. I use the cord provided.
5,Another great find for me. My sensory seeking brain injured child loves this fan and it has the capability of turning a blue light on as well as a flashlight. And on top of that it is rechargeable. I don't have to buy batteries. And it's very durable.
5,Love these. Bought them for IMF and i’m glad they hold a charge charge quickly and have great settings and a mini light
5,Noise level is great until you drop it a couple time off of your fork lift. Still a great purchase for me.
5,I usually travel with a larger fan and wanted something smaller.  This is the perfect size.  The battery lasts about 6 hours but you can plug it in with a USB cable.  I've taken this fan on four trips and it has travel and worked perfectly.
5,Really nice fan for the price! It had more power than I was expecting for a tiny fan! It works really nice! It is a rechargeable fan do that is kind of a pain but it is very nice.
5,Great little fan. Blows alot of air for its size. Nice blue night light and small white flashlight on side. Great for campingoutdoor restaurant patios travel to countries where a/c is rare etc...For camping suggest one of the new lithium ion battery car jump starters that have a usb port and you can run all day and night.
5,Good airflow even on lowest speed.  Got this so I could cool myself while working at my desk and not freeze my wife.  Great battery life.
5,Great for our cabin on the cruise.
5,The only issue I had was that it didn't have purple blades. It was all white. Other than that it's a great fan for work. I use it on my med cart.
5,I used it for work at a warehouse  it works great but only stayed on for about 3 hours while on high speed
1,Was great for the whole month that it worked… but now it suddenly doesn’t turn on.
5,Love this little fan. I use this every morning when I’m getting ready for work. It’s just enough air perfect size and the battery lasts a long time.
5,I bought the fan for a friend in Puerto Rico. He uses the fan when he sleeps as the nights are very hot and then He charge it via USB to a power bank during the day.
1,Cannot get it to charge so I haven't been able to use it.
5,Bought and sent to a friend in Florida after Hurricane Irma left them without power. They had a power pack and could run these fans for a little bit of relief! Great buy and very useful for power outages!
5,good little fan the only thing I don't like is the battery life (around 3 to 4 hours medium speed) but I am asking too much XD overall good product
3,Bought a total of around 16 but the receipt of goods there is a battery is bad and then there are days with less than a charging port is broken get friend then told me to buy now I can not help he bought and then do a good job if the mass point it is very value hope to improve.
5,This fan is great
5,This fan is small and portable.  For its size it gives out a powerful amount of air.  Took it on trips and used it every night.
5,Very happy with this compact fan. Battery life is great. Easy to carry in a equipment bag or backpack. Moves a good amount of air for this fan.
5,This fan is very portable and moves a surprising amount of air for its size! I've never even used either of the two higher settings and the battery lasts all day and is easily recharged with a standard cell phone charger. I'm very happy with this fan.
5,I use this cute little baby in a window by my kitchen sink to keep me cool when I do dishes and stuff in the summer.  It works great and since it is rechargeable I don't have to worry about electrocuting myself.
5,I love this little fan. It’s very powerful and cools me off quickly. I have bought at least 8 of them and given them away to family members.
5,Looooove this little fan. I bring it to the gym and place it on one of the side trays on the treadmill definitely helps keep me from turning into an over heated angry mess while running :D Just need to make sure to recharge it. Only seems to last 2-3 hours at full speed.
5,One of the people leeching off my prime account bought this. Apparently he is very satisfied with it and has had no complaints.
5,I bought this to take on camping trips but have yet to use it as such. So far though it works great everything works as it should. I haven't had a problem with it being unstable like the other reviewers and its pretty powerful for such a little fan.
4,Fan works well but the green light never appears on my unit showing that the unit is fully charged.
5,The battery is really a 2200mah 18650 I actually got 2300mah on mine doing a discharge then charging it back up.
5,This worked great on the nightstand during our cruise. The battery lasted all night. Kept us cool and the noise helped me sleep.
5,I am in love with this fan. It's a teeny tiny fan as shown in the picture. I keep it inside my bag wherever I go and it is doing an amazing job in this summer. I play indoor badminton and it comes handy when I need a little breeze.
1,Works great so far and seems to move a lot of air for something this size may buy anotherUpdate 4/17/2019...The fan no longer operates on battery and always has to be plugged in to work. Not sure if it is the battery that is bad or the charger in the fan. Can't really expect too much for the price.Update 6/17/2019...Well I was able to test out the battery in a 18650 charger a friend has and then tested it in a flashlight and it works fine. It must be something in the fan that is preventing it from charging. The fan is only use as a desk fan in my home office. Sucks because I did use it at work in a data center and it helps when you're working in the hot aisle.
5,For a small travel fan this puts out a decent amount of air. We used it in our room on a cruise and it was perfect. Charges easily with a USB and hardly makes any noise.
5,For me it’s the best portable fan used...and I have bought several.
5,This little 3-speed fan is worth every penny.  The battery lasts a long time between charges.  The low speed is so quiet that I can use it in church.
5,I needed something to move the air around my desk and this little fan is awesome!  It is so small but puts out a real cool breeze and having it charge on a USB is so convenient!  I
5,Great little fan. Moves alot of air for such a small fan. Battery lasts quite a while. Very versatile. A perfect addition for any travel camping hunting or fishing gear.
5,I needed a small fan to travel with me to hotels. This fan is nice and flat and can be plugged in during the night so you don't have to worry about the battery dying. I typically use it on high but the medium setting can be enough to drown out noise.
1,I had high hopes for this rechargeable fan but it had many issues After installing the battery and turning it on  it wouldn't  turn off fir about a min after it turned off I thought that maybe it was that the battery needed a full charge for it to work properly after getting it fully charged I couldn't get it to turn on again the fan would move slightly like it was trying to start but it never did. the lights are the only thing that worked but if I wanted a flash light I would have bought one needless to say I had to return it. Just an FYI many companies just rebrand this fan and sell it on Amazon I would suggest staying away from ALL OF THEM!
3,With the battery in the fan on!t stayed in for 15 minutes before cutting off. Only stays in if plugged into a usb port. Small enough to pack. Wouldn't recommend.
5,Long lasting battery good options
5,This is the handiest fan I could have.  I use it all the time. So nice I bought my sister one
1,It’s noisy
5,It has a strong motor.  Great for personal use and to keep yourself cool if you have a warm or stuffy office like I do.  The battery has a very long life.  3 different speed settings and a small LED light on the side that lights up bright.
5,Great air output & a really pleasant sound! I’ve purchased 2 more as gifts.
4,It was a gift and she loved it.
5,This fan is perfect for me at my work desk. It is lightweight portable and very quiet. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Very easy to use and useful during emergency.I had some trouble getting the lights to come on. My sister used it while traveling and loves it
5,I have bought 4 of these fans. 2 for myself and 2 for coworkers. Powerful and compact. Perfect for taking places where a fan wouldn't be an option. Totally happy with these purchases.
4,Powerful and compact. Super helpful and cute.
5,I use mine at my desk at work.  It's quiet and it has enough battery life to last the day.
4,Great little windmill.  Kept me cool while helping the victims of Hurricane Maria in PR.
5,This fan is small (not compact) quiet and worked like a gem! Hoping that it will work just as well in Mexico!!
4,This product really works great especially for its size. its perfect to take on A backpacking trip.
5,Pushes a lot of air for a tiny fan. Great for window sill to vent a room. Also has a little flashlight on it. 3 speeds lasts a long time on charge.
3,the battery only lasts about 2 hours and it doesn’t turn in while your charging
5,I dance and take this everywhere with me. Cools you down. RECHARGABLE. a PLUS. Love it. and  would buy again
5,I have enjoyed this little fan so much.  I've purchased a few for family.  It charges very well. And the charge lasts. I take it everywhere I go.
5,I use it at my desk and it puts out a nice blast of air...three levels..recharges fast with a usb port on computer...Love it ..works great for me.
5,This is my 2nd purchase of this fan. I liked the first one so much I recommended it to my friend.
4,Good
5,Love this fan quite powerful too.  My co-worker was so jealous I had to buy one for her as well!!!
5,Love this little fan! I can plug it into the computer or wall charger.
3,Good idea good power but very flimsy. You can't just throw it in a backpack and expect it not to break or be turned on by the slightest movement. If like me you like to throw your backpack on your bed or lean on it while sitting on the floor i suggest keeping it in the box or not getting this product.
5,I needed a refund because the delivery truck broke down BUT I re-bought an identical fan and it works great! I use everyday at work. It's quiet also
4,Very nice little fan.
2,This blew really well unless you tape it down you be adjusting it. Battery didn't last more than couple of hours.
4,I use this at college the battery life isn't the best. I need to plug into computer to make it stay on longer over all it's portable and easy to use.
5,Like this little fan very nice. A bit loud on max setting. Battery lasts good.
3,I can't believe what a difference this little fan makes!!  UPDATE:  after 6 weeks the fan now won't work unless it's plugged in.  : (
5,Nice for outings
5,Brought this to Burning Man and I was pleasantly surprised by this little fan's power and battery life. I bought a few different fans to see which was the best for three weeks in the desert and this one beat all the others by far.
5,I love this product. I had had one for myself and loved it so I bought one who a friend who gets overheated very easily.
5,I have it plugged into a digital timer to keep my Fire Stick cool.  Hope it will extend the life of service.
4,Great product but one thing is missing. It needs a pivoting stand so it can reach your face. Otherwise the versatility of the battery and also use power makes it useful.
5,Simi-quiet Very forceful fan/wind volumn.
5,Great little fan really puts out the wind compared to some of the other small fans I've used. I haven't had any problems with the battery. Would recommend and buy again.
5,Nice little fan powerful for its size. Not too noisy
2,I would probably like this fan if it worked without the USB port. That's the reason I bought it! I need it to be portable! Am I doing something wrong? Is the battery included dead? I bought 3 of these fans to take to Puerto Rico. Now I don't have time to get something else. Really mad!Turns out after a trip to the hardware store that the two batteries shipped with the fan were dead and cannot be revived. Really? Had to spend an extra $12 per fan. Would return if I had the time.
3,I was only able to charge the battery once and then it wouldn’t charge again but works fine when hooked to a power source. I use it when I travel and in my office.
5,I take it to work it's very hot so I bring my own fan.  Doesn't last very long on high but medium it last about 6 hours.
5,Battery doesn't charge 😑😑
3,This fan worked great for a few days...it now doesn't hold a charge so if I want to use it I HAVE to have it plugged in. The battery must not be great quality. Also it doesn't light up while running the light is a different option that you can only get while the fan is not on.
5,Bought for my son for college and his desk.  He brings it everywhere with him.  He loves it..
4,pros: quiet. cute.  nice size for my office cons: can't figure out how the "portable" part works.  doesn't seem to charge.  Could be broken... no idea.
5,Recd it as expected. I did fully charge it. My wife saw it & started using it first. She really likes it. I may have to order another for my use.
5,This little guy has put in some work and still going strong after two years. I can not recommend it enough.
5,I use it to help my makeup dry faster. I also use it to circulate the air. It is little but quite powerful.
5,This fan is both light weight and strong.  Multiple speed settings.I liked it so much that I bought a second one for my husband.  He likes it too.
5,This is a powerful and quiet little fan.  My PC was overheating so rather than install another fan I popped off the side and set this next to it.  Works great. I can't really comment on battery life as it is plugged in to a powered USB all the time.
5,Compact and rechargeable.
3,I bought this fan to bring in my cruise. Its very small but very strong for the size. The only downside is there want a place by the bed to plug it in and the battery only lasts about 3 hours.
3,I’m a flight attendant and needed something to carry in my bag. The fan only works when hooked up to usb plug. Does not work with just batteries alone.
5,I love it
5,I'm glad I got one as this is one that is small enough to fit in my office desk.  thank you
5,Keeps charge for a long time.  It's easy to throw in a bag--very lightweight.  Works great~
5,Works REALLY well! I bought several and took them on vacation with me to the Caribbean.  Everyone was jealous!
5,Bought this to take on cruises as we had 1 cabin that was too warm for us. This fan is perfect! Blows a nice amount of air and not too loud either.
5,It has a powerful breeze but wish the battery lasted longer
5,Works great in our room on the ship plugging is weaker than not.. but worked great.
5,wish battery charge lasted longer
5,This fan is amazing! Small quite and pushes air if air for its size. Purchased a second obe!
5,If you are looking for exactly this than its good
4,Great fan for the size.  Its really powerful.  Battery doesn't last long though... i get about 4 hours at the lowest speed before it needs to charge.
1,Junk. Stopped charging 5 weeks after purchase. Do not buy. I am out 16 bucks.
1,i read - rechargeable battery - so i thought you could use it without being plugged in. not the case. powerful yes. portable not unless you have a battery which with the picture i thought it came with one and since the listing said AND battery
5,Perfect for traveling! Puts out good air.
5,I would highly recommend this fan! It cam fast product was as expected and has no mechanical issues
5,Bought to use on our cruise.  I need air to circulate this little fan was great.  Charge it ran about 7-8 a night.  Very easy to charge.
5,Stays charged a good amount as long as it is being used on one of the two lower levels.
5,Love my fan!!
5,I was much more impressed than I thought I would be with this little fan. Charge time is decent the wind power is good and it's great to be able to carry it around.
4,Mine won't run without being plugged into an external battery (ie a power bank for a phone) but it works great like that!
5,Bought this fan to take on a cruise. It  kept the air moving in the cabin at night and acted as a nightlight.
3,It needs a longer cord usually keep it plug in as even after  full charge  it doesn't seem to last as long as I think it should.
5,Fantastic little fan. I have 2 of them now.  They are great for travel because I can’t aleep without a fan running.
5,Love love this fan. It’s sits on the side of my bed and keeps me cool at night. It blows good but not to hard.
5,Nice cruise fan! Blows hard and cool. Easily portable for around. Smallish but doesn't deter it from blowing! Needs a handle or a place to hook it up but it sits firmly.
5,I’m surprised how light weight it is to carry
5,Great little van that uses a rechargeable vape battery. Good price good value. Highly recommended.
4,wish I bought more well built very functionally elegant design little power house fan
5,This fan works quite well considering the size. Very convenient.
4,The only disadvantage is it’s not adjustable.
4,Nice size and good fan speeds but takes forever to charge and dies quicker than I had hoped. All in all though it's worth the price.
3,This fan would be great if it didn't move all around when it's on. It needs to have a weighted base. Otherwise you have to surround it by items so it doesn't move and fall off the table when it's on
5,works great in the office. haven't tried to run it for as long as i can before the battery runs out but i like it since I can pretty much place it anywhere. it is pretty noisy and is useless outdoors but it works for what I intended to use it for.
5,Got this fan for my desk at work and it works great! I keep m it plugged in to my laptop but it works on battery too. It's a little hard to figure out how to turn on the light (I always forget) but it's more for fun anyway.
5,I have not had this fan for too long but so far I am very pleased. This is a small yet powerful and quiet fan! I have personal summers (hot flashes) all the time and this fan is the answer. Great fan and fast shipping
5,Use this  when I work out on the treadmill. It is a great little fan! I am happy with the purchase
5,It's light and powerful for its size. I like the rechargable battery feature that let's you move it around wherever you need it
1,I love these fans! This is my third the other ones are a different brand but same fan this one was just a dollar cheaper. I should have stuck with the other brand!!!!!! The fan ONLY works from the battery then cuts off. Doesn’t work plugged in at all and yes I tried different outlets and different plugs!!!! DOES NIT WORK! Don’t buy go buy the other brand for a dollar more it works GREAT!!!!! Now I have to waste my time and energy sending sending this piece of crap back getting a refund and on and on and on! All I wanted was a freaking little fan that WORKED!  Would have given a 0 review if I had the choice!!!!
5,No
5,Bought this for my 4 year old that loves fans. Blue light is cool. Rechargeable feature is awesome. Great for small office or personal fan that can move around easily without wires. Charge lasts long too. Also comes with a LED flash light feature.Awesome little buy!
5,Great little fan!!! I did have to return as batterie cover wouldn't fit. Will reorder. Soon as I get  credit. I also. Got. A black one
5,Quiet and super light weight. I brought it backpacking and it was lovely.
3,It would be better if it had an adjustable stand
3,Battery won't stay charged and just bought it. Is very quiet and works well when plugged in. Just not portable so disappointed.
5,Excellent product. Used it when bowling.
5,used it at a music festival and it saved me from sweating my ass off at night
3,Fan works good but it doesn’t glow
4,Love it
5,We used the fan in our interior cabin on a cruise and it was perfect for just a bit of moving air.
5,The fan came in handy! I’m thinking about buy another real soon!!
5,Perfect size. Tremendous power for a small fan. Love that I have dual ways to use fan- battery and charger. Not cheaply made. Very durable
5,I like the product we use it for bowling
5,Love this fan! Rechargeable and the battery last a good while. Perfect for travel! Highly recommend.
5,This fan was exactly what I expected when I ordered it.
5,I love this fan. I leave it plugged in when in use. It works great!
2,this little fan will move some air!!  holding up well.  no complaints!  numerous people have asked where it came from!  battery lasts for a long time.  haven't killed it yet when not plugged in.  if you want a small portable fan that will keep ya cool this is the one!Edit:. After less than a month total use fan will not run off of battery.  Only when plugged in.  This is my second fan.  First one lasted almost 2 years.  Quality has gone down.
5,I’m using the fan for my desk at work. Like the size fan speed is good and like that it is a rechargeable battery.
5,We replaced our last one with this model - works really well and is quiet - yay!
5,Great fan...works well and VERY durable.If only it had a swivel option
5,Strong little fan.  Pushes the air with its three speed. I like the recharging battery.
4,Nice fan but I really thought it would be a little bigger..
5,Love this lil fan! Works great...just got it yesterday n works great at work...
5,Holy COW this thing is awesome.  I take it everywhere and the battery runs forever.  I use it at sewing class and it sits on my machine and keeps me cool in during hot flashes.  Just what I needed. Great for traveling and personal spaces....
2,I think this could've been good if not for the fact that it ONLY works plugged in. Because of that i’m giving this two stars. It works well when connected to a power source. It is a powerful little fan and the light inside works wonderfully.
2,Great fan other than battery life is supose to be 3-9 hours but even on low setting runs maybe an hour before needing to recharge
5,Battery isnt useful but the fan works great on phone charger.
3,The fan is great if you only need it for a couple hours. It puts out a great amount of air but it doesn’t last long at all before it needs charged again.
5,Used when I went camping loved that it had a light on it. Very useful for charging phone if need be too
5,Easy to carry around easy to use and most of all it works very well. Money was well spent for this fan.
4,like it fine but I wish it had an adjustable base so you can angle it the way you want.
4,Nice fan but the battery will not run the fan through the night. So we keep it plugged in at night.
5,I  purchased this to put on my childs stroller while we are at the beach. It works great and the best part is how quiet it is even on the highest setting. Thinking I need to order myself another one just because!
4,This is a powerful little guy! I love it! Just wish the rechargeable battery lasted longer... You get 45 min to an hour tops...
5,Quite powerful for a small desk top fan.
5,This fan is strong and fits on your desk perfectly. It comes with a battery or you can run it with the cord.
5,Perfect little fan for work! I had no idea it has 3 speeds. I like that I can use USB or the battery for portable use.
5,Just right amount of white noise and breeze for my daughters room
3,It’s smaller than the picture shows and when it’s on the third setting you will have to make sure it’s not on a  slick  surface  or it will fall off  just saying
5,I work swing shift and need to sleep with a fan on for that white noise. This is perfect especially for when I am on 3rd shift. It's got a nice little breeze and I love the blue light that's not as bright as a lamp.
1,This fan doesn’t have put out enough power. It has to be on level 3 to feel it.
5,Great product would be cool with a hook or something to attach to a desk
5,love it
5,This mini fun is great for summer very handy. I'm glad it has include a battery inside. The USB charger is good for charge it. The power is not very big but good enough.
5,The size is great for us on bowling nights.
5,Love it! Best fan for my desk at work.
5,fan is quite powerful. fairly quiet.  pretty impressive for a battery powered fan.
5,Great product. I pretty much take it with me everywhere I go. I highly recommend.
5,Three power levels this little guy packs a punch. Rechargeable to boot? That's a win-win!! I've already recommended this to my friends. Love it!
5,This little fan packs wind!  And it fits in my purse.  Recommend to all!
5,It is perfect for my makeup routine. It helps speed up the process when I apply setting spray eyeliner or eyelash glue.
5,More air movement than I thought it would deliver. Not sure on battery life yet
5,It is quiet and works well for me. It is better than the cheap small handheld fans or the portable ones that plug into the smartphone.
5,I love this fan. My job doesn’t allow the kind with the plug attached so I charge this and stay cool all day. I also bring it to outdoor concerts
5,I really like this portable cordless fan.  The battery life is good and it is quiet compared to other fans.
5,Super powerful! Good price ! Love! I use at the end of my lash tint or lash extensions service. So helpful
5,This fan is great. Lots of air perfect size. We use it all the time.  I bought two since it worked so well.
4,What a lifesaver for the islands. I ordered a bunch of these after my island went thru a devastating typhoon.  It delivered exactly what it promised heat relief.
5,I don't know if it is a new model of the one that I already owned but it seems that it works great. These things are powerful.. You'll see..
5,Love this fan!  Second one we've bought.  Fits well under the desk and provides much needed coolness.  Price is good too.
5,Enjoying this fan without the need of continuously buying batteries. I also like the choice of three speeds and it has a small flash light. Light weight and convenient. Overall great fan.
2,I purchased the same fan in 2017.  It worked well for 2 years and then began shutting off after running for 10 seconds.  I liked it well enough that I purchased the same fan a couple of weeks ago.  The second one worked for 3 hours and then began shutting off after running for 10 seconds.  I'm returning it and will try something different.
5,Love my efluky fan - so much I bought 2. Love the color and its just the right amount of fan power for those pesky hot flashes.
5,I planned to use these fans when power went out during a hurricane.
5,Great for the office
3,If the fan is plugged in to charge II does not blow as strong as it does when not plugged in
5,Just received this little fan  blows enough air to keep me cool at work. Love it so far
5,Very quiet fan. Love the product.
5,Good little fan. Very versatile since it can work plugged in or wireless and use the on board battery which last a long time. About 7hrs straight with the highest setting.
5,Great product.  Perfect travel.
5,Bought to keep my laptop cool when I'm in the field programming HD Diesel engines. Works good & the battery lasts a long time.
5,This is great for traveling.  Use anywhere.  Little light on side is appreciated.
5,Love it! You will not regret purchasing this fan.
5,This is the most awesome little fan ever! With an 18650 battery it is strong and powerful in a tiny little case. Got the wrong color but oh well it works great!
5,Excellent product immediate shipping Thanks
5,This little fan is great.  I use this all the time when I travel and end up in hotel rooms without AC and fans.
1,I had plugged the fan in and I tested it at work and it didn’t turn on despite being charged for hours before.
5,This is a great USB fan! Like a swiss army knife with all of its little features.  The fan pressure is just great compared to another brand I purchased.  I have already bought 3 of these - really "cool"
5,Definitely nice for my desk keeps me cool during those hot flashes... lolAnd hot days 😀
5,Quiet but powerful fan. Portable too!Rechargeable or leave it plugged in.Us in in my RV and really used in on our cruise !!!
5,Right sizevery effective nice colorsthe Best part it's Rechargeable!!!
5,I LOVE this fan! It puts out a very strong breeze even on the lowest setting I was pleasantly surprised. It was exactly what I wanted and exceeded my expectations.
1,Cheap cheap and very damn. Cheap…I am Very upset the cheap ass fan stop working the first day I took it to work and placed on my desk.  I will definitely be returning and would every dime of my money back.
5,Great portable fan.  Liked the first one so much got 2 more.  Definitely recommend
5,Fabulous product
5,Great little fan quiet and powerful.
5,Nice and quiet. Perfect for travel.
3,Battery didn't last long at all so I end up plugging it in and leaving it plugged in all night.
5,Took this little gem on a recent cruise.  Worked perfectly to circulate the air and was powerful yet quiet. Worked just as described.  Very happy with this purchase.
5,Powerful little fan for a great price
5,Got fan for wife she loves it. Keeps it with her all the time for some reason she is always HOT.
2,First the pros: compact in size can be recharged can be plugged in good design. The problems is that it's a little too noisy and the fan power is kind of weak for my taste. If you treat it as a toy r use it casually it might work ok but in a hot day it doesn't help much since the fan power isn't good enough.
5,Good small desk top fan. I like the fact the battery is rechargeable unlike some other fans and I love the blue light.  It's has a small footprint so it doesn't take much space on the desk or in a bag keeping it very portable.
5,Used this fan while traveling. It has a low humming sound. I also plug it into my computer while working. Great buy!
5,Battery life could be longer bought it for work it’s definitely worth the price
5,Great for n't desk at work
5,Love this fan- Great product would buy again!!!
5,This is a great little fan.  I had a couple of issues with it and contacted the company and right away they sent a replacement!  I recommend it and their customer service very highly.
5,It keeps me cool when I'm working.
4,Not bad
5,Our company moved to a new building this year. We can't use plug in fans. I bought this battery powered on from Amazon and it is amazing. It can be charged with my computer while I work and my coworkers are so envious. Wonderful product.
5,Quiet. Good breeze and speed of air when pointed directly at you. Used this in an outdoor theme park when sitting and resting to keep the kids cool.  Only beneficial for the person it is directly pointed towards can't feel any air movement on the side
5,Works great. Small and powerful. I normally don't give 5 stars cause I don't trust all the "to good to be true" 5 star reviews. But this little fan is good....note I've only had it for over a month.
5,Quiet yet has enough power to keep me comfortable (AGE 65) during bible study.
5,Love it works perfect for my desk at work.
2,I’m on my 4th unit now. They work wonderfully - while they work. Seems each one only last about 4-6 months though.. (then they no longer turn on).
5,Use it every day sitting on my desk.
5,Omigosh ! This is too cute and functional at same time.  Powerfful fan for its size. Love everything about it.
4,works well but there is not an option to use regular batteries!
3,FAN WAS NOISY WHILE OPERATINIG
5,Good little fan for the price.
5,It is used for work to keep air circulation around the desk that was well needed. No problems as of yet.
5,Great desk fan just the right size. Wish it tilted but easy to stack on something.
5,perfect for traveling or just using at work for my hot flashes!!
5,perfect for a office desk! Low level doesn't blow papers all around
5,Amazingly strong for a little fan. This is perfect to use at my computer. I like how you can move it around to wherever you are or take it with you.I use this baby to stay cool and even to dry my nails.
5,I love this little fan. Very well made and I can travel with it
5,This little fan is the best!!!!!  It has 3 speeds and for being so little it has a lot of power and it lasts a long time on a full charge.  HIGHLY recommend!
5,This is great little device for any office desk. It tuck away into the corner keeps just enough to air circulating to refresh your area but can also be turned up to be a powerful fan. Very quiet.
5,My wife is using the device it blows good air and it charges good. no issues with it.
5,Small and powerful. Very good personal fan. I bought a second one because it was so good.
5,Great light weight personal fan.  I liked it so much that I bought the second one for one of my friends.
5,It does everything I wanted - gets so hot at work I can just plug this into my laptop and it works great!
5,Works great and would buy again.
5,Best one ever!!!!This one Rocks
5,Great little fan! Provides surprising air movement for its size. I use this as a desk fan in my office and it provides great air movement without the noise of previous fans I have used. I definitely recommend this product!
5,Bought this to travel with since I have to sleep with a fan on!  Did amazing.  Make sure to keep it plugged in to go all night.  I have even used it at home a few times
5,Perfect little fan to use in our stateroom for our cruise. It has a lot of power for such a small fan.
5,Very nice fan and powerful only one little problem battery dies really fast maybe it was just mine but i keep it plugged in great color also
5,It works perfectly for what I need it for.  It doesn't seem to stay charged for very long but that's not an issue.
4,Love the fan but the battery is trash. Went out after a month. Had to replace.
5,Love this fan. Use it all the time. Easy to move around.
5,use it frequently inside and outside.  holds charge for several hours of constant use.  this is my second one.
5,Wow! It was charged right out of the box and put out quite a display of power.  Can't wait til it warms up around here! Just wish it had something to hang an S hook on for camping.
1,Bought it a year ago to give a relative that was coming to visit from overseas. Never used it and at the end she could not come so I put it away. Today I opened the box and tried to first charge it for about 4  hours and nothing happened. The light was still red and the battery compartment very hot. I tried using it without the battery and  the light turned green but it still did not work. It is cheap so I did not waste much money but it did not last at all. I basically bought it tested it (did work when tested) and put it away.
5,Long lasting battery life
5,Small and easily fit in my bag to take anywhere you go . Very powerful for its small size
5,Very nice little fan i liked it a lot put it on my work desk in office works great and its quite nice flow highly recommend!
2,Lightweight easy to transport but very cheaply made.in less than two months the USB charging port broke & the motor burned out.25 minutes of use before it needs to be recharged.spend the extra money for a better product before spending money on this one
5,Awesome product high-power multi-function simple operation. Can't imagine how to develop a better product (and NO I was not paid to say this)!!
5,Our family has loved this fan.  You can feel breeze for quite a ways away from it.
5,I love this fan.  I keep mine in a half-bath where there are limited electrical outlets and no cords make for a happier me.
5,I keep this on the night stand next to my bed.  I run it when I get too warm.  Works great.
5,Amazing little fan. Great output.  At higher settings or with the light on I only get a couple hours out of a charge but on medium without the light I got about five hours.  Not it does run while plugged it to USB.
5,Don't be fooled by its size it's a powerful little fan.Love it
5,This will cool you down or keep you cool after a hot walk into the office.  Love that it is portable and rechargeable.
5,Does what it needs to do
5,Awesome buy. I use this to do facial chemical peels at home works great I have had for a year with no problem and just bought a 2nd one for a friend
5,I’m surprised with this little fan. Don’t get fool by its size. I bought for my family in Puerto Rico after hurricane Maria. My niece loves it.
5,Best portable fan. I would suggest buying an extra battery for it.
3,The battery life is not so good
5,This is the second fan we've purchased like this. These fans are amazing! Rechargeable powerful lasts a long time. Highly recommended.
5,So far it works pretty good. Lots of power so such a small device.
4,Fan works great but battery does not charge
5,Got these after a sweltering summer power outage but my teenage son just uses it all the time. He loves it. It's a removable battery but you can USB charge it with the battery inside.
5,Bought this for hot flashes. Have used small fans for years that use 2-4 D batteries.  It's so nice to have a fan that is effective rechargeable lighter and more compact for travel.
4,Powerful little fan
5,Keep this fan on my nightstand. Love feeling the breeze on my face at night to keep me cool.
5,I have one of these fans in both of my offices and I love them!
3,The fan works great I just hate when things aren't as advertised. No blue light here.
5,Ordered this fan yesterday for my office and was pleasantly surprised that it showed up today using the TWO-DAY free shipping.  This fan is great!  Quiet portable and blows air well.  I'm purchasing another to use at home.
5,I took the fan when I went camping and it was a godsend when the temperature got really hot. I charge it using portable USB battery packs which I recharge using solar panels. Must have for Burning Man!
5,Perfect portable fan for traveling and camping. Compact but powerful. What really sold it was having the option to use the rechargeable battery OR power with the USB cord.
3,Very cheap looking
5,This little fan works wonders!
5,Also super quiet and with the rechargable battery super easy to travel with
3,This fan blows a great amount of air and and was not too loud however it did not stay charged all night even on low.  I would only recommend it if it can stay plugged in all night long.
5,Muy pero muy portátil cabe en la palma de la mano
5,This fan does exactly what I had hoped it would. Keeps me cool while I'm on my computer.
5,Not noisy and great fan gets cold fast
5,Powerful little fan great for hot flashes. :-)
5,LOVE my fan!! It puts out a great deal of air to be so small. It stays charged a long time too.
5,This is pretty cool only tried them to check out.
5,Bought for my 3-year-old son. Safe for children at this age.
5,I absolutely love this. I own 4 personally and I bought it for friend and family...
2,I already owned a desk fan that needed to be plugged in to operate.  I specifically purchased this fan for the chargeable battery functionality to travel with and unfortunately the battery does not charge at all.  Fan does not operate unless plugged in seemingly because the battery doesn't charge.  Functional and powerful as long it is plugged in though.
5,I liked the battery and being able to plug it in.
5,This little thing is amazing! The fan blows a great amount of air and it is surprising for its size. I love that it is USB chargeable and works while charging. The LED light is cute too. Very impressed!!
5,Good
5,This is a great little fan!  Small lightweight and quiet with lots of power.  I bought it to take to an art class to dry my watercolor paintings faster.  Everyone loved it as well.
4,Great thing to take on a cruise
4,Perfect little desk fan. Some noise but actually helps as white noise in the office.
5,This is a must have. Perfect little portable fan. Lightweight !
5,I love my fan I take it to all my activities biking cards visiting family. Great gift
5,Fast delivery more powerful and quiet than competition at this price point.
5,Husband loves it I hate it. I’m a cold person during the winter and I can feel the breeze on my side of the bed.
5,Love this little fan!! Took it with on vacation where I had to walk everywhere in 90 degree heat.
5,Took on a cruise with us and i cant imagine not bringing them with us next time. Highly recommend.
5,We took this on our cruise ! And it was soooo worth it :) it works perfectly highly recommend this fan !!!
2,very disappointed. I got 2 of these in the last year.  First one the battery lasted about 10 months before I had to leave it plugged in for it to work.  I just got another on Prime Day and this one already does not work without being plugged in.  Prime day was 2 weeks ago.
5,Just received but I like the 3 fan option.
5,this fan is a great idea. i have carried it to use on the subway platform in the summer months. no A/C on the platform.
5,I run hot and have had many desk fans and this one takes the cake
5,I LOVE this fan. It’s small and mighty! Just what I was looking for!
5,Took it on vacation with us and it was perfect!
5,Love this fan. Take it on my scrapbooking trips. Just what I needed.
5,This has been a great addition to my office desk. It is small enough quiet enough and refreshing enough!
4,Its a fan. it blows air.
2,Only works while charging.....will not hold a charge
5,Love this fan! Small and light but it works well and has really high speeds.
5,quite fan long battery life great product for outdoors and indoors.
2,My fan will not work without it being plugged in. Which is pointless for the “rechargeable” part. I’ve already messed seller and just waiting for the response. Might’ve just been a defective one.
1,Terrible doesn’t work
5,Works great
5,I like the size and the potential. I great for work station
5,Perfect for my desk
5,smaller than I expected but still a great buy
5,Use it at the bowling alley. Works really well and us built well.
5,Wonderful little fan!
5,This fan is amazing. For how small it is the fan gives off good air movement.
5,Really strong breeze coming off of a small fan. Was a great surprise!!
5,you have to plug it into a usb
5,I have had many USB/battery operated fans & this one by far blows the strongest. Also the streamlined design is a plus.
5,Battery life is very good.  Puts out plenty of air on low to keep cool in the office.
5,I have this fan sitting on my desk at work. It is quite small but very efficient and works well for my needs.
4,Nice product but the battery drains fast so look to have a power source nearby.
5,Love it!
5,very nice strong even though small charge 4 hours and will last a few hours and lights up also nice blue light
5,I really love iteven this mini size but it blow so hard cause it has 3speedand I put it on my accounterit looks greatI was fully recommended!
5,Perfect for any use
5,These fans are so awesome! I highly recommend them. Three speeds and cool lights
5,Very nice... battery holds out for a while micro usb powered/charged... looking to buy second.
2,I have bought a few of these already. I have an issue in which now the fan will only stay on for 1-2 minutes while not plugged in. Not sure what happened but I think my battery is going bad. Defeats the purpose of a portable fan if it must be plugged in to work.
5,The color is a nice aqua mint. Very compact and lightweight. Works great. Comes with a cord to charge but not the plug. I just used a USB power plug from an old Blackberry and it works great.
5,I absolutely​ LOVE this! I'm able to keep cool without freezing everyone else in the office and I can take it with me wherever I'm working. Probably one of the best purchases I ever made!
5,It's a good fan that last a long time.
5,Works great does not swivel which I knew when I ordered..Just a heads up!  Love that I don't have to worry about batteries
5,I got this for my desk and now everyone want a fan like mine!!
5,Handy  nice feature one button for shut off.
5,Came in time and was able to take it to PR to people that needed bad. It works perfectGod bless you
5,Great  little fan. It puts out more air than I expected.
5,This fan is great for my desk!  At 52 I get hot flashes and this is perfect to cool me down until it passes. It doesn't blow around my papers and it is not too noisy.
5,Overall good item. Although wish it could stay on longer before each charge
5,Loved it. Does the job for someone like me who gets hot very easily.
5,Love love love this powerful little fan.  It has 3 speeds and it really blows up a storm.  No kidding! everyone that I show it to wants one.  You have to buy one you won't be sorry.
5,Great little portable fan. Bought 6 of them for use in several locations. Rechargeable long lasting battery a major plus.
5,Works great for when I wake up at night with hot flashes
4,Good fan action works cordlessly.
3,Very Good little fan .. however .. the charging cord was cheaply made it doesn't fit. I've had to buy another cord for it.
5,I gave this as a gift to my sister and she loves it. I have a similar one and she wanted one as well. They are perfect for traveling!
5,The battery lasts a long time. The fan creates a strong breeze that almost feels chilly.
5,Great for a desk for for Travel when the air does not work as it should ~ giving these as gifts
5,Smaller than expected but very useful for office or desk. I like the three speeds.
5,Awesome for my home office. I take it with me to the kitchen too. Don't have central air so this is a lifesaver in the summer!
4,Works great.
5,It works great
4,Grear for camping. Not super strong but it makes a big difference
2,The pic makes you think the fan has a neat LED blue light that lights the fan. The description doesn’t point out that it’s a flashlight instead. Additionally the fan doesn’t tilt to better direct the fan. The fan speeds are nice and the fan is relatively quiet. I just feel a bit misled.
5,Great little fan. I use it at work.  5 people in a small space makes for warm conditions. It helps me alot!
5,Nice and quiet. The three speeds are nice and have good air flow. The blue light and light on the side are really nice. It worked great while I was camping in hot weather.
5,Pretty powerful fan for its size. Quick recharge.
5,Great for travel! Small and rechargeable batteries. Fairly quiet and nice soft lighting. Much better than anything sold at your local drug store. I did have to recharge the battery every morning after having it on all night.
5,I love the portability of the fan!  It has a lot of power!
5,Great little fan. Works greatits pretty quiet
4,very handy but not long battery charge
5,This little fan is fabulous! This is the second one I have purchased so that I have more than one charged at all times.  Really blows strongly for such a tiny fan.
5,A great little fan it is rechargeable charges/runs from USB. even rechargeable.
1,Dislike.. charge port don't recharge batteries
3,I love it but I plugged it with my little apple head charger thing and it didn't charge all night... does it only charge if I use a different kind of power head or through my computer? Let me know asap
5,Works like a gem. Perfect for my desk
5,Great little fan with awesome output. Would recommend any day to anyone.
5,Quiet portable powerful fan! Small and keeps a charge for hours. The nightlight option is nice too.
5,This fan is excellent. It is solidly made and really is quite powerful. If you are just using it on and off for just several minutes at a time the battery goes a very long time between charges.
4,Move a good amount of air for its size
5,But nice for the price. Does in a pinch
2,The fan power is good but there is no blue light that they say there is. Also you have to turn the fan off for the flashlight to work. Kinda bummed
5,This is one powerful little fan!
5,I just love this little fan!It really pushes air and it plugs into normal outlet's or USB. Fan lasts for hours on battery mode.  Very happy with purchase.
5,Great little fan.  It is pretty powerful on 3rd setting.
5,It helps on the hot food truck. Wish it came with 2 batteries 😉
5,Got it for work and all my residents asked where I got it from . and now they all want to get.one . it works wonderful and very quiet
5,Great small portable fan to have near my bedside when traveling.
5,Basically love everything about this fan. I wish I had purchased it months ago.
5,Amazing little fan. Three speeds with lots of power for such a small fan.
5,I use this fan everyday. It provides a nice amount of air flow at my desk because I feel the air gets stagnant sometimes because I work in a big area with not much air flow.
5,This little fan is exactly what I wanted for the office. It's not too loud has 3 speed settings and it performs great.
5,Nice air flow for a mini fan
5,love how compact it is... holds charge for a long time
5,Provides just enough cooling. Also good to dry wet laundry sneakers etc
5,Excellent. I use this everyday at work because it’s like a sauna at my office.
4,Great little fan. 4 stars for the battery being DOA.
5,this is a great little fan.  I now pack it when I travel in case the relatives keep the house too warm.
1,Battery would not charge to use independent of USB- waste of money and travel space! Very disappointing
5,These put out alot of air.
5,Lightweight Fits into your pocketbook! Silent and excellent speed. Very cooling. Worth the money.
5,Very powerful fan Good battery life.
5,Battery life could be better but it's rechargeable and very portable
5,Bought after going through Irma and suffering from no power no a/c and no relief from the relentless heat...never again!
5,These things are so powerful for their size! They make great gifts but they don't come with a charger (1A USB) so keep that in mind.
5,Like it a lot. Have it on my bedside and I keep recharging and using it at the gym too.
5,Such a awesome little fan  really could not believe the power it has and a flashlight too  such a great surprise  you can't go wrong with this fan.
5,Love this. Compact great value. Saved me from my hot flashes!
5,Took this on a cruise and it worked great. I will use this on the night stand when I travel. Great for white noise and those of us with hot flashes at night.
5,Excellent desk fan. Ordered 2 for Co-workers.
4,Excelente
4,my kitty loves this in his trailer. quick recharging!
5,Great Quality  use it in school and on the school bus
5,It’s easy to carry and works great for outdoor concerts in the summertime.
5,I love this fan. Just what I wanted to stay cool.
3,The Fan does not stay charged. barely lasts an hour. Fan does not tilt at all. Very Disappointed
5,Love this product so much I ordered more for everyone in the office!
5,Works great
5,I like it that small in size and you can bring it anywhere
5,Works great
5,Great little fan for the money
5,Absolutely what I was hoping it would be. Small enough to fit it my powder room and quiet enough to not annoy me... Most important powerful enough to tame those hot flashes when getting ready!
5,I love this small fan.  I travel with it and it is perfect.
5,Just received the fan but have used it overnight and it worked perfectly!
5,I purchased this fan for a trip to Europe.  It works well.  I would buy it as a gift.
5,Surprised at how powerful this fan is and it's small size makes it easily packable for Scout camping trips and other travels.
5,I love my mini fan I use it all the time
1,There's a vibration and it's a bunch of loosely clipped plastic so thing thing makes an annoying rattle.  I was able to dampen it by setting it on some bubble wrap but that's pretty ugly.
5,This a very cool gadget for gadget lovers. I keep it in a small bathroom. It's easy to charge from the wall a power bank or several portable solar panel. I bought a second -blue.
5,Lots of power and sturdy little unit
2,The fan worked maybe for 3 weeks and one recharge.  Now the battery won't recharge so it's completely useless. For the price I paid I'd expect this fan to work longer than a few light uses over a couple weeks. Terrible product.Updated:  I can run this fan off my portable iphone charger which makes me believe that just the battery in the fan is bad.  These should still last longer than a few weeks.
5,Amazing fan amazing company.  There is no desk fan that even comes close to the power of this fan.
5,Definitely a small fan but worked for our needs; not sure if it would have worked for the entire night.
5,Works great for an office fan!
5,This little fan moves a lot of air. It’s the best small fan I’ve found.
2,Needed it for trip I was taking & decided to try it out first. Tried it on my flat counter. When I put the fan on high speed it vibrated around counter & if I didn’t stop it would have fallen off the counter. Highly disappointed. I am hot natured & needed it specifically to be on high speed. Poorly made
4,It's kind of weak but it does help.
2,This fan works good when it works unfortunately after a few days ours stopped holding a charge so we are left having to leave it plugged in. We tried to contact the seller with no replies. We waited to long so now we cannot return it disappointed as it works ok when it works. Will not buy again.
5,Great little fan. like that it can be run plugged into USB or run on battery. And that it has three speeds.
3,It works well however the battery life does not last and you need to keep the fan plugged in.
5,This fan is super quiet and powerful. I only run it on low at my desk. I loved it so much I ordered one for my wife.
5,Cute.Large battery. 3 speeds. Not loud. Blows strong breeze.Surprising little gadget
2,Runs fine but there's a high pitched buzz and it's annoying. That's all.
5,What a great travel fan.  It's quiet but moves a lot of air.  Recommended buy.
5,This little fan has a lot of power. Bought for my grandchild's play house and it's perfect! Works a really long time on a single USB charge as well.
5,Great
4,Great little fan. Wish it held the charge just a little longer but that's technology for you.
5,Quiet for office desk.  Air seems from a larger fan but it’s a mini fan.
5,100 percent working no problems at all  I would order from this company 100 times over any others
5,Nice and compact. I love that I can charge it with my laptop.
3,Battery lasts no time. Can be used plugged up but output is about half
5,Love this little fan. Much more powerful than you would expect. Very convenient.
5,made my life so  much easier. Used at office. Almost no sound at low speed. Works wonders...
5,Works well so far I approve.
5,I almost always sleep with a fan on to provide air movement and white noise. While traveling not so much...until now. I love this little rechargeable fan. It's wonderful. Can't say enough good things about it.
5,Handy little fan. Really puts out a lot of air for its size. Great to have along during hot weather.
5,Product is as expected. Fast delivery and good price. Will do business again.
5,Good battery life and more powerful than you would think.
5,I have one at work one downstairs and one on my nightstand!
3,It works just is cheaply made
5,Looks so great...not noisy at all
5,Works great.  Got between 5-6 hours on low setting.
5,Cute little fan to set on my desk. So far so good.
2,LOVE THE FAN.  MY 5TH ORDER. BATTERIES GETTING IFFY. AS USUAL AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE SAVES THE DAY!
5,Quick deliver. Product was as described in ad. Good purchase.
5,I love the three speeds and the glowing blue light. Delivery fast
5,It's been going on very strong for me I love how small yet strong it is and it is fairly quiet!
5,I have one by my computer at work and one by my nite stand.  It works great!
5,Perfect size for desk very quiet!
5,Gift for my mom in conferences. She loves it.
5,This is just perfect for the places you need a little air but don't have access to power.  It is  inexpensive works like a charm battery life is long and it's rechargeable.
1,I ordered 2 of these fans and the battery life sucks! It states low (stage 1) lasts for 9ish hours but that is not true maybe last 3 hours! med (stage 2) lasts about 1 1/2 hours and Hi (stage 3) more like 30 minutes..  I'd like to state again that I bought 2 fans and have the same issue with both .... The fans are portable rechargeable but it takes longer to charge the battery than the fans actually last! I am very disappointed with this product.
5,Love it
5,Been using this alot..its loud at its loudest setting but can go for at least 3 hrs on a charge.
5,Fan was loose in the cage. It only ran it held upside down. The blue light was nice.Follow-up:Amazon replaced the fan at no cost. The replacement fan is quiet and works great.
5,Great speed
5,I love this little fan!!  Works great!  Easy to use easy to charge the battery; just exactly what I wanted.
5,Fills the need for a fan.
5,This is the coolest thing ever
2,Used once to to try to see if it worked. It did. Put away in hurricane supply kit.  Took out to charge when we had a potential one  coming out way and charging port on fan bent so cant charge it or use it. Waste of money. Good concept though.
3,It has a VERY bright light that's piercing. I had to cover it with several layers of duct tape so it doesn't keep me up at night.
5,Awesome little fan with great power and 3 speeds. Ended up getting another one for my father in law who as well likes a fan on his head when he sleeps
5,Arrived quickly and looks cute on my desk.  Easy to use and put out the perfect amount of air. I would recommend it for others.
5,I love this fan.  I ordered another one after I got the first one.  I put one on a bathroom self (no cords) and one on my desk at work.
5,This is the best little fan you ever want to have  it puts out some good air. Very good price
5,Love this fan. Great size and quiet. Puts out a great breeze. Bigger than the size would indicate.
5,This thing cranks out a ton of air especially for a portable fan. Couldn't be happier with this. Much better than any other one I've ever used.
5,Battery life almost 7 hours
5,Love this little fan!
5,This is the best battery operated fan I have bought.  It's rechargeable and the battery last at least a week or more before I have to recharge it again.
1,I really liked this fan when I first got it. It is very hot in my office and I use it on my desk. It worked great for the first couple of weeks and then one day I had it on the lowest speed and it just kicked in to the highest speed. Now it only works on the highest speed and vibrates so much it moves across my desk. I am very disappointed as it was perfect for my needs and now I can’t use it at all because it won’t stay in one place.
5,It's a little louder than I'd hoped but it doesn't bother anyone in the office. Best of all it provides great air pressure.
5,Love it. Works great.
5,This little fan will amaze yoy. Love it's power! Saved me on a weekend of triple digit temps!
5,Love this fan.  Arrived early. Battery life is excellent.
3,Fans works well but the battery needs to be recharged fairly often
5,This is a great little fan that works well. I use it at my ballroom dance events to cool down. It is powerful enough to cool you off and love the fact it is rechargeable.
5,Awesome
2,Loved the fan when I first got it but unfortunately it no longer works. Used it daily charging as needed no problems then the last time I tried charging it the light stayed on and it no longer holds a charge.
5,Battery life not all night
2,Love this little van for my desk. The battery does not last long but I love that you can plug it in. No worrying with replacing batteriesUpdate: ordered another one for a coworker and the only way it will charge is if you hold the plug. Will be returning this.
5,Decent fan. Wish there was a way to tilt it some how.
5,This is great! Perfect for my office. And I love that I can plug it into my computer!
5,Battery doesn't last all night but the fan has really good flow for it's size.  I was impressed by the air flow coming out of it.
2,Not made very well. Something is rattling in it after first use that I have to tape it to decrease the noise. Not quite the same as a real fan but could be worse..
5,These are great little fans for camping. Small powerful and have the add on benefit of having 2 different lights. Great for my hammock camping trips.
5,I travel with it and it puts out quite a bit of air for its size.
5,Blows pretty well when first opened didn't think it would but it actually dose very well
5,Great office fan. I would say the only drawback is the light on the side is kinda weird but other than that it's perfect.
5,I like everything about this little fan
5,Charged it up and it runs great
2,Purchased the fan on March 11 2018 and love it Battery failed however after 5.5 months and no longer holds a charge.That makes the fan less than helpful for what I wanted.  Eluky never responded to our message for resolution.  Otherwise a nice fan
2,Worked good on high for an hour enough to get me to sleep then cut out.. Doesnt balance well in a tent either
4,its great product its strong and durable I recommended it
5,Moves a surprising amount of air for it's size.  I can't say much about the battery life as it hasn't been an issue yet.
1,A friend of mine recommended this fan.  He said his has worked flawlessly since he had it.  I bought the fan and took it out of the box it worked for five minutes and died.  I bought the fan in June but did not use it until now so now it's too late to return it to amazon.  I'm trying to find the manufacturer so I can write to them directly.  Very disappointed cheap china fan.  Not worth the aggravation.
5,So awesome I bought 2! Packs a powerful punch for a little fan and extremely quiet!
5,This fan puts out a lot of wind for a little unit. Battery charge lasts about  4 hours on low
5,Awesome little desk fan.  Quiet and powerful!
5,Just received this little powerhouse of air! Great product so far.
5,Very convenient
5,My cubicle fan when I'm hot or fart at my desk. Love this powerful bad boy! Blows those farts out of there real quick!
3,Plastic blades but does move the air. Just much smaller than expected.
2,I am dissapointed in this fan as it does not have an Intel blue light. I was excited to see a blue light displayed in the fan. Other than that fan is alright. However I won't buy again.
5,Great fan with long lasting charge.  Portable and easy to use.
2,Three fan speeds are: loud louder and unstable. The lowest speed is too fast and loud for any personal cooling. The highest speed forces the fan to move around the desk.I don't see how one can use this as a personal desk fan.
5,Very effective little fan at a great price.
5,I'm a welder and I used this little fan to blow away the smoke. It did a great job
5,Dies kind of quick
5,Gods gift to human kind.  This thing is worth its weight in gold!
1,Purchased this product to use for camping. Arrived in perfect condition. Then I started to test the battery life....in less than 10 minutes the fan stopped working.  No problem we were going to have electric at our site.  Plugged in the fan and let her rip....in less than 10 minutes the fan stopped working. Maybe its overheating?  may need to buy another fan to cool this one down.  Not hearing back from the vendor I would not purchase this fan if this is its acceptable performance.  To boot the vendor does not accept returns : \
5,I am satisfied. Thank you .
5,I LOVE this fan...only thing I don't like is it doesn't tilt.
2,The little fan is being used by my wife on random occasions. Unfortunately the battery life is very poor on it - maybe 20 minutes on a full charge...
5,Wow. This fan is great and has a lot of power.  I love that is has 3 speeds.  I bought one for my desk and one for home.
2,Not so good
5,Great product I love the fact that it also has a nightlight and is a very powerful fan
5,Wasnt expecting this to be this good
2,The fan is great but the blue ambient light doesn't work.  Sounds dumb but wanted the light part of it...thought it would be cool 🤔😔
5,I'm one of those people that 'live' with a fan on.....home work car etc.  I bought this for my desk at work.  Best fan I've ever owned.
2,Rechargeable battery doesn't work.  The fan its self is great as long as it is plugged in to a USB.  It actually really powerful for the size.  Just wish the recharge worked but as is it will be fine because i dont want to go thru the hassle of sending it back.
5,Perfect for camping or power outages
5,This is a great little fan rechargable 3 speeds a purple light  a side light and quite powerful. I use it in my office. Very happy with it Highly recommended.
5,Saves me in the office. Use it every day!It's a little noisy - but it does what it meant to do so it's good!
5,Great office fan for your desk !
5,Love it for all these hot days NYC has been having for the summer it came in handy in the hot darn subway.
5,Works great but not purple like it looks in the photo. It’s black and white.
5,Very nice color and it works really good.
1,I have two Opolar brand fans like this that are perfect and perfectly awesome. Battery charge lasts a long time. With  a hurricane coming and the possibility of losing power I decided to order one more. However the Opolar was out of stock. So I ordered this brand which is almost identical to the  Opolar. Except for one thing. The battery was dead as in DEAD. WILL NOT CHARGE. Not very helpful if the power goes out. Disappointed.
5,Such an awesome little fan! So powerful and quiet.
5,Cute efficient & so very portable!!
5,Great product!
5,Worked great for travel
5,These little fans are powerhouses. Definitely worth it and will definitely buy again.
3,just okay
5,This little fan is awesome! I'm a big hot natured guy....... this fan really does a great job.
3,I really liked it but it stopped working after about 7ish months.
5,This fan is surprisingly powerful! I love that it has 3 speeds and all of them are powerful. Great product all around!
5,Love it use it professionally for eyelash extensions. Great little gadget cool design great to be able to charge via usb.Very happy with it!
5,Great for nice breeze in the summer!
5,This is the best purchase I have made on Amazon ever! I am going to order a few more as gifts! FANTASTIC product!
2,Unit was missing the battery so I can't say whether or not it functions well enough but I can say that failing to include an important piece is enough to make me not want to find out. Packing list does say battery is included so its not as if I made the mistake of not purchasing one. :PReturned for a refund.
5,perfect little desk fan for the office that can never agree on temperature controls love the usb charger and the fact its easily mobile and also very quiet and inconspicuous.
5,Great little fan! Perfect size for desktop or side table!
1,The night light worked but fan never worked. Was not eligible for refund had to contact Amazon on line to get the refund for a defective item.
5,What a great little fan with amazing power!  I no longer have to worry about having battery's in Mt horse trailer.  Won't last all night but long enough!
5,Powerful quiet and portable because it has a recharable battery!
4,It works.
5,This is my 4th one I've order! It's great! I love how it is rechargeable so you don't need to waste money buying battery!
5,it's amazing..i like the power.. i didn't expect that!! .. and the three levels option is greatthe shape and size are suitable for office ..
5,Great for a cruise
3,The battery life on this is very short it may as well be a plug in fan with the amount of time I spend charging it
5,Love this fan!  It’s great for traveling and staying in hotels !
2,The deal killer on this fan for me is the fact it will not run at it's full speed while plugged in.  If you're strictly a battery person it should work well for you.
1,HI  Kept trying to figure it outBattery life very short tried to return they said was to late? She was never pleased with it!
3,Does the job however only while plugged in; the battery refuses to charge and polarity was checked. Will likely buy a cheap replacement battery later.
1,The worst !! Started out good for the first day !! Charged the battery fully and it ran great but never ran on battery again !! Then when using the USB it kept shutting off ! I kept changing the port and the same thing would happen. There must be some sort of short in the wiring. I was going to purchase multiple (10+)for coworkers and glad I didn't. I am planning on returning it if I remember to bring it home from work before it's too late ! Waste of money should have purchased the $7.00 one !!
1,Very disappointed with this fan.  It will not charge.  I've tried various charging cables (including the one that came with it) and plugging it in to different chargers.  Nothing ever charged it.It seems to be a really good fan when it's plugged in and running.  Moves a lot of air and is very quiet.  I probably just got a lemon but not going to try it again.  Back it goes.
1,First impression it was a nice little fan. Plugged it up at home to see if it worked and it was quiet as advertised didn't move much air but consider it's a 4" fan. Took it to work this morning and went to turn it on and nothing happened. Plugged it into my usb port to charge and nothing either. Tried another cord charger into a 120 volt wall outlet and fan began smoleering and white smoke came out of the bottom area by switch. A circuit must've fried Definitely disappointed in quality will be returning this item may exchange or just go for something larger
5,Love it!! Have brought it to every football and soccer game my kids have participated in. Won't leave home without it
2,So much potential....  The fan worked great for the first few weeks.  I travel for work and many hotel rooms don't have a fan and this helps me sleep.  Unfortunately the USB recharge port that is glued in place let go and is now somewhere inside the fan so I can't recharge it anymore.
5,Excellent portable cooling!
5,Great little fan
5,Love this thing. I nap in my car during lunch and this thing keeps me from going full beef jerky.
5,Took on cruise. Was small but effective
5,Absolutely love it! This little fan was perfect to take to a quilting class and keep me cool it's still being quiet and didn't bother anyone else.
5,Small but does the job well.
5,Great little fan. Worked well for scout camping trip.
5,Perfect for tavel
5,on the lowest setting it lasts all night. perfect for camping I cuddle with it so it blows down my body.
5,Works great. It's pretty quiet on low which is all I need. Doesn't take up too much space. Easy to charge.
5,GREAT for desk
5,Great Item
5,Luv it
5,Girlfriend loves it
5,Awesome little fan! Wish it could tilt but I'll make do! 3 settings and comes with a quick battery and USB cord. Perfect.
4,Great for traveling
5,Awesome fan
1,Well it worked for the first week then the problems started battery would not stay charged then it would just shut off while running just a few minutes. I contacted Amazon via chat widow and the tech said they had a 1 year warranty. All I had to do was email request to efluky@yahoo.com. I sent a message to efluky with a copy of the purchase. It been 2 weeks and no response
5,Excellent little fan.  The bonus side light is a nice touch.
5,Battery's are the same as most flashlights aND vape mods. Lasted about 6-7 hours on a charge. Good airflow!
5,This little fan is amazing. It blows really good for its size and is fairly quiet. I love that it is rechargeable!
2,The charger stopped working. The battery is hard to find.
4,strong little fan.
5,I love this fan.  It is very effective and the rechargeable battery lasts and lasts.  Highly recommend!
5,Works great for travels and for work
5,Very impressed as I opened the package as to how stout the material is. Hoping this one will never break under normal use.
5,Bought for cruise vacation great purchase
5,Works well.
5,great little fan. Very cute too.
1,Dislike this fan .. THE DARN THING DOES NOT TURN OFF .  I have to take the battery out so the blades stop spinning.  Very disappointed
5,Excellent little fan that is incredibly quiet.
5,Nice small quiet fan for the office.  Love it.
5,Great little fan...is fully charged and ready to go....I bought two for the beach....
2,This is the fifth fan I have purchased as I like to have them throughout the house instead of carrying one fan around. Sadly the battery that came with this fan will not charge.  This is the first bad experience I have had with these fans.  Aside from the problem noted they have great power.
5,Great product.
5,This little fan rocks!!! My co-workers are always borrowing it! Is quiet but yet has allot of power.
5,Love this little fan.  PERFECT for my night stand.  Just the right amount of air movement and fan sound.  Very quiet.
5,Get this fan!Amazing power for such a small and quiet little thing. Highly recommend!!!
3,Is way smaller than what I though
1,No noise waste of money. Trying to return but Amazon is being difficult
5,it’s great for an office desk. I love mines.
5,awsome fan fast shipping works great
5,This little fan packs a punch. Works great! I would definitely recommend purchasing.
4,Super handy for hot flashes!
2,The fan work if stay connected the battery will not charge...
5,It's the perfect size for game days
5,Nice size very practical
5,Perfect for what it's designed for. It is quiet and moves a surprising amount of air for its size.
5,Literally the best travel size fan that I know of!!
5,Works great!
5,Works awesome for my desk at work.
5,Good
1,I purchased two of these fans.  They worked fine initially but after the first couple charges the batteries would no longer hold a charge.  They would only work if they were plugged in.  After using it plugged in twice it no longer worked at all.
5,Works perfectly. Very powerful on high speed.
5,Used it for van camping and it saved our trip. Just enough air movement to keep you cooled down on a humid night.
2,When i received the product i was ready for a fan  not one i had to turn on every 5 min. You should not buy this and would be better with a hand fan
5,Nice!
2,Doesn’t last long. Not worth the money
5,Battery life better than expected
5,This has worked really well.  I use it to keep my dog cool in my truck.  Simple and effective easy to keep charged.
1,This fan does have three speeds which is great however you can not tilt the fan to feel it where you want it. The battery will not charge and plugging it in without the battery it lasts a mere 2 minutes. I bought this to put it on my desk at work and it when it works it hits me at chest level..i would not purchase this again.
5,Great
5,works great just what I needed for work
1,did not like this fan did not turn on and i would charge it and still would not turn on. do not buy ! its actually smaller then i expected.
5,Lots of air for a small fan. Lasts a while on 1 charge.
1,The fan is to loud even on the lower settings and the battery doesn’t last more than 20 minutes.
1,It will not work even when “charged” it literally has to be kept plugged in for it to turn on. Useless to call it “portable”. I do not recommend.
5,Very happy with my purchase!
5,Great little fan! I use it everyday I work!
5,Perfect for what I need it for
5,Excellent - thank you!
5,Works great on a cruise
1,This has the 18650 battery that is removable and therefore a high hazard.  The battery can explode! I've just pulled the battery on the fan to send for recycling and tossed the fan out.
5,All ok
5,Excellent product.Performs very well
5,Love this fan! Very small but VERY powerful!
3,It would be a great product if the fan could tilt to direct the air flow up or down but it does not.
5,Cool!
5,Love!
2,The battery is terrible.  I charge it for hours and it won’t stay on for two hours at medium speed.
5,Great product
1,this fan shut down and would not work.  The solution?  Repackage print the  postal information take to UPS and wait a week to clear while paying interest.  I ordered this one because my wife had one for 2 years and it finally broke. Nobody from company has bothered to contact me. This one could be a dud but I only bought 2 and both malfunctioned while being treated with care.
5,Small but works wonderful.Lasts about six hours on a three hour charge.
4,cool
1,I do some work in my storage trailer and use this to help me cool off. It works well while it is running  The battery life is very disappointing  It's not a conventional battery or I would buy another to use when the first one dies. I would return it but I am past time to do so
5,I love this little fan! It's compact and makes a nice breeze much better than I would have expected for a fan of this size.
5,I purchased 14 of these for my office staff at Christmas time!  They are functional cute and perfect for desk fans!
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this fan. It is so portable and had SOOOO much power. Would recommend it to anyone!!!
4,good
1,It won't charge now. Yesterday was the last day to return it. Now they won't do anything. Shame on you!!!
5,Amount of air movement is incredible!!
1,Works great when plugged into USB. Battery will not charge so kind of a pain always needing to have it plugged in.
2,It would not work but for a a minute or so then stop. Even fully charged or it was as saying charged.
5,Excellent dependable great price
5,This is the perfect little fan!
3,The fan has a lot of power and works great but the battery doesn't last very long and it doesn't pivot at all.
5,It works great now I don’t have to buy Batteries anymore
5,it's a good fan
5,Works very good.
5,This little fan is surprisingly strong for how small it is. The flashlight on the side is very bright!
5,Keep me cool anytime anywhere
2,Works great when plugged into a USB but does not recharge as described at all.  It never has.  Very disappointed.  I was only using it plugged in and didn't realize it would not run at all without the plug until it was too late to return.  Major bummer.
5,Works well!!
5,so powerful! this is a WONDERFUL travel fan
5,BLOWS HARD! YOU'LL LOVE IT!!
1,Bought this for our road trip through Utah... super disappointed. The charge never held to use. So when the car was off and no a/c this was worthless. Frustrated and feel ripped off. I would say move on if you’re looking for something to work while unplugged.
3,Nice personal fan
1,Where u plug it in to charge is terrible. You have to hold it in one direction or wiggle it to get it to charge. Tried several different plugs. Same results. Terrible product. I've had another fan similar for over a year no problem different brand
1,Was great while it worked then it died after 2 weeks of use. Hopefully you have better luck.
5,I love my little fan. It's small but mighty. Just remember it has to be charged by the USB port in computer.
5,you will like it.
1,I have had 3 fans  that arrived with dead batteries. I have had 2 that were fine. What’s up?
5,These fans are so powerful. Just bought a second and my wife bought one for work.
3,Too small for my need.  Otherwise works well.
5,Great product!
5,We liked the first one so much we bought a second one.
3,A lot smaller than expected. Dies very quick. Its overall an ok mini fan.
1,This fan stopped working after 2 months.  I chatted with Amazon and sent an email to Efluky as instructed to see if we could exchange it because my husband loved it out in the brush when fire fighting (he's calfire and would use it at night when sleeping in the field).  I did not receive any response.  Very disappointing.
1,Efluky? Its more like Eflunky! This thing worked good for about a day then it stopped charging for some reason. If it wouldn't of broken in one day i would of rated it 5 stars the air it throws out is very good for such a small fan also the charging battery was great if it worked properly i can only say if you want a cheap ok fan that might break in a day or two then this is the fan to get. I think i am going stick to name brand fans from now on.
5,Very nice. May buy 2 more incase the power ever goes out. Which seems to happen regularly around here.
5,It is small but very powerful
1,This is cool.  Battery power has a higher top fan speed than when plugged in.  Battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped but it's ok.  The blue light is very bright and the flashlight feature is pretty handy.UPDATED 9 8 2015One of the blades just cracked off broke and come flying through the grill.So that was short-lived...now the fan is worthless except to just hold; the broken blade makes the whole thing unstable and it rattles and vibrates off the table...this goes to the rubbish or back to the shipper...
2,I don’t know about battery life yet. Super tiny like a toy.  If you have Hot Flashes then don’t waste your money buying this product for camping!!!
5,These are cool. Were used during the hurricanes. USB recharge
5,Perfect desk fan. Very quiet.
1,Received on the 6th. The fan was inoperable by the 9th. Battery wont hold a charge and I have to position the cable just right to get it to register that its plugged in. Even then it will only run for a few seconds.
5,GREAT little fan I use them all the time
5,Works great at work
5,Best little fan
5,Perfect Size Great Price Multiple Speeds Quiet - Exactly what I wanted.  Great for the office.
5,I'm a dancer and this fan's wind speeds have really impressed me.  I won't go dancing without it!
2,The battery didn't last but like 4 hours at most before going dead. I would not recommend this to other customers.
5,The charging USB is so convenient! No more replacing and wasting batteries! Excellent to take on the beach on a hot summer day!!
5,Everything is good no complaints
1,This product only Works if it is plugged in. Defeats the whole purpose of purchasing it
1,Didn't work after about 2 weeks of intermittent use.  Do not recommend this product at all!  Very disappointed
5,Exactly as advertised thank you!
3,Loses power too quickly
3,Fan works great but doesn't have a long lasting battery life built in even after charging it.
5,Love this fan. Works well. Inexpensive but well made.
5,Great fan. Best one I’ve had.
1,Received the fan and immediately charged it for the whole day as I wanted to use/try it out ASAP. Put the batteries in and nothing. Tried charging it again. Put the batteries back in and nothing again. Definitely disappointed. I'd put 0 stars but it says I have to pick a star rating -____-"
5,Perfect little fan I needed for work.
5,Perfect fan for everything in my opinion. Thanks Efluky
2,This little fan worked great when I received it in Mid-february. I loved that it was portable and I had the flexibility to unplug it and use it but now 3 months later it doesn't work anymore. The light indicates it's "charging" but it won't turn on even if it's plugged in.
1,Don't know if it works or not because it was broken into three pieces when I opened the box.  I bought this fan because it was slightly cheaper than the OPOLAR one but it was clear when opening the box that the materials used were far cheaper.  I had to return this fan because a few pieces of black plastic (spokes) were already broken off leaving the blade of the fan exposed.
1,I bought this fan and was not able to use without plugging it in. The battery never charged  no matter how long I had it charging  as soon as I unplugged it fan stopped. So I figured I will leave that one plugged in and buy another. The 2nd one works fine it is perfect for hot flashes!!
5,small enough to fit anywhere on my desk.  cools quickly great for my hot flashes. ahhhh...
5,Perfect for my desk
3,They work well when they're working :)
5,This little fan packs a punch. I keep it on my desk at work & It's perfect.
5,Have two of these fans works great.  Small enough to travel with.
1,I have waited for this fan for almost two months. First they took it back. Then I reordered it. Today I was so happy that I got this fan but wow! It's not working! This is ridiculous! Now again I will have to return and reorder it and suffer for God knows until when.
5,Bought this for my mother to use.  She loves it
3,Product works well
5,As expected
3,pretty yet its not that strong
1,THIS OVERPRICED PLASTIC ITEM PRESENTS MULTIPLE ISSUES AND CONCERNS.  AMONG THEM IS THE VENDOR'S APPARENT NEED TO SEND EMAIL TO PURCHASERS DIRECTING REMOVAL OR PROTECTIVE COVERING FROM A BATTERY PACK -- WITHOUT ANY SIMILAR DIRECTIONS OR HELPFUL MARKINGS ON THE PRODUCT OR PRODUCT PACKAGING I AM AT A LOSS.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT WORTH THE LIGHTNING DEAL COST AND I AM SEEKING TO RETURN IT.
5,Bought for third time as product does not last but perfect size for traveling
5,Great
2,Short battery life
5,Will buy again
5,Easy and always work
5,Powerful little fan!
5,Great product for the beach or pool area. 3 different speeds.. Rechargeable battery so no batteries needed...
5,Very nice fan
1,It only worked for like a week without it needing it to be plugged in. The battery isn’t sold anywhere so I do t even know if it’s that battery but again I only had it for like a week before it stopped working without it needing to be plugged in
5,I like it
5,This is one powerful little fan. Really does the job.
5,Very nice...and works really well.  Easy to carry about
5,Moves a lot of air for its size. still going strong after seven months of daily use.
5,I love my fan.
5,Great fan!
5,Perfect for desk fan !
1,It's adorable and I love the color. Unfortunately I can't tell you how well it works because it arrived without a charging cable or battery. I contacted Amazon and they issued a refund but I'm issuing the 1 star review because the seller really should ensure that the product is received in working order with all necessary parts.
2,I bought 5 of these fans and only 2 of them really work as advertised. Batteries were defective and did not work. Hence 2 out of 5 stars = 2 out of 5 fans that really worked.
2,I ordered this to replace my small plug in fan on my desk at work. This fan was a disappointment. It doesn't move a lot of air. I ended up keeping the fan that I have.
5,Love it!
5,Good
5,A buddy is on a walk from OK to Key West and says this has been a life saver at times.
5,Couldn't be happier. Had it for almost a month now. Battery lasts forever on medium speed. Has surprising power. Very good fan.
5,Portable
5,Excellent desk top fan three speeds lots of power battery life long and recharges fast.
5,Quiet and moves air well.
3,I love the size and power of this fan however it does not hold a charge for a long time.
5,I am happy with my purchase.
5,Very quiet powerful little nightstand fan.
1,Used up pieces missing & Broken. Has the guy's address on stickers all over it who owned it before me (he returned a broken item!)  No cord. USB wont plug in from the exact other fan that works. So disappointed
1,The size is great but doesn’t last. Died after a few weeks
5,My new best friend.
5,Useful output of air is better than I expected
1,Started making a ringing noise and hasn't gotten worse since
5,Puts out a LOT of air. Works nicely on batteries or USB cable
5,Provides a great breeze when working on the computer.
5,Nice portable fan.
5,Love it works great
1,This product came dirty and broken. There was so much dirt and dust on the fan blades so disgusting.
2,Purchased this fan for the office. When I received it it was just as pictured. However the battery does not charge. I cannot use it unless it’s plugged into the charger.
5,Nice powerful fanliked it so much brought 2 more
1,At work for like 12 hours then on recharge for a day every time I turn the fan on it would run for 15-20 seconds and then power down. Even if I had it plugged in to a charger at the time
5,Great
5,Fantastic fan! Has a great battery with very long life. Quiet and powerful!
1,Opened up the fan and plugged it in with the rechargeable battery in place. Charged for 3+ hours fan will not turn on. Will only turn on when plugged in to a USB. I do not recommend this product.
5,Great product
1,I Bought this fan in January.  It is now June and it stopped working.  I had used it very little.  It smells like burning wiring and so I removed the battery and threw it away.
1,Don't waste your money. I charged it and used it once it lasted about 20 minutes. Charged it to full again and it dies within 5 seconds. Total waste of money
1,the battery will not charge.  I see others have also have a problem with this.  Fan works fine as long as it is plugged in.  Ordered a different fan from a different company and it works great.  Their battery even fits this fan so I know it is the battery.  Too bad they can't just fix this
5,Love it. Little fan produces a lot of wind and I have saved on batteries.
5,Very powerful for it's size.
5,This little fan is amazing! It's pretty powerful and has a cool blue light too.
1,I don’t recommend this product.... stopped working shortly after purchase.  Also the air output/flow is very very low.
1,Got sent a fan that charges but a battery that doesn't fit into the compartment. Looks like they either sent the wrong battery or a broken compartment. Returning it was not worth the effort during CoVID
1,I bought two fans and the battery with the second fan doesn’t work right out of the box. I know it was the battery because I used the first good battery on the second fan and it works fine. I will write another review if a new battery is sent. Thanks!
1,I bought 2 of these fans. I used one right away and it worked fine but the second one I opened later on and it only worked for about a week. The fan won't charge and it only runs for about a minute before turning off. Unfortunately I opened the broken one second because it is now outside of the return date so I'm stuck with it. Disappointed.
3,All good products
1,The battery on mine was a piece of junk. It wouldn't last half an hour on high. Either the battery life was way overstated or I got a defective battery. Luckily it got stolen and I found the same fan from easy ac with a better battery.
5,Works awesome! Use it for my baby in the car and in the stroller perfect size and blows really well.
2,Well disappointed. Had these since last years hurricane season.  Charging up for this season and battery not holding charge. Fan works if plugged in but that’s not helpful.
5,My wife liked it so much she asked me to order another for our daughter.
5,Great little fan
5,I love this little powerful fan
2,Even though it's small it puts out a lot of air. It's nice for the office. Only problem is the battery that came with it doesn't work so it is always plugged into my computer.
5,this is a great fan I just love it would buy over and over again good product
2,Battery already crapped out less than a month.  Fan itself is bottom heavy which you want blows fine.
5,This little fan worked great on the cruise ship.
5,A great little desk fan that helps to keep you cool when there's no A/C at your work station.
5,Love it
1,Product overheated and failed while charging the 1st time.Prior to charging the fan functioned but when plugged into a standard micro-USB charger (used for cell phone) the unit got very hot and failed with the white LED on. When disconnected from the charger and let to cool down the fan will not function.
5,Very strong for a little thing!  Rechargeable battery lasts for a good amount of time but not that long.
5,Arrived on time packed nicely nice construction well put together works great little light on the side us nice touch.
5,Great affordable product!
5,I put in my purse and take it to church and love how silent it is.
2,Very portable and powerful fan with some cool features!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Son un ÉXITO!!!! Los compre en el 2017 despues que el huracán María azotó en PuertoRico. Todavía funcionan !!! Todo! Las luces y la intensidad del fresquito! Son pequeños pero fuerte! La bateria dura mucho mas si lo dejas en nivel 1 o 2. En el 3 la drena en menos Na. Por eso tenia 2 baterias para cada uno. Y así pasabamos el dia. Los abaniquitos de dia. Tengo 3...1 rosa y 2 blanco y negro. Todavia los uso y mis hijas lo usan para la escuela. Definitavemente una excelente compra.
5,Excellent product
5,Love this!!  Great for travel and home
2,About a month of use and now my fan won’t work unless it’s plugged in. This also means I can no longer use setting 3.
1,liked it because it presents as being small and lightweight.  The downfall was this fan lasted not even an hour I charged it turned it on fan worked then it no longer worked one hour after I had charged it.
2,Battery doesn't hold any charge after only a few weeks. I can only used it plugged in. Dissatisfied.
1,I REALLY LIKED THIS FAN AT FIRST.  BUT THEN THE BATTERY WOULD NOT ACCEPT A CHARGE.  BOTH AMAZON AND THE VENDOR WERE NOT HELPFUL IN REPLACING.  I CONTACTED BOTH 4 - 5 TIMES.  MAY HAVE TO TOSS!
2,charged when i got them had to use them last night and they both died only after 8-10 mins.
5,Works as advertised. I own multiple.
1,dose not work the battery does not hold a charge at all. fan works if you plug it to a computer or a usb port but that defeats the purpose of a portable fan
2,I'd probably be giving this 5 stars if it came with a working battery but it did not and only works when plugged in defeating the purpose.
2,The fan works great when plugged in but the battery does not work so no portability.
5,Works great thank
5,Very powerful. Really is the height of your iphone. My friends from work want to order their own now!
5,This is amazing. this cute little thing has a lot of power and was a great purchase.
5,Cool little fan. So far so great.
5,Works better than I would have thought.
3,Battery charge does not last very long even on low or middle setting
1,Got this fan to use on a couple of weekend camping trips then used it for white noise in the bedroom. Love this fan but after 4 months it no longer operates whether trying to run on battery or plugged in.
5,Best portable fan I have ever owned!
5,all good
3,Could be stronger.
5,This fan is AWESOME.  Quiet as a mouse and moves a lot of air.
5,Works great.  Used it for my office and for my son while he slept in his stroller.
5,Perfect little desk fan!
5,Love it! The best thing I could get for my bathroom while Im getting ready!
1,doesn't stay charged .have to be constantly plugged in .
1,I ordered this because can be battery operated. DID NOT HAVE BATTERY!!! Please send battery ASAP . Product states battery included and NO BATTERY!!!!When I get battery I will do an update review
5,small lightweight and portable. no issues so far
5,a great little travel fan really works and is powerful for its size
2,The fan worked perfectly  for awhile. The fan only works when plugged in.  I am disappointed that it did not work longer.  I am just beyond the return period.
1,The battery barely lasted 30 minutes. Everything else was fine. It's nice and small produces fecent wind but with the battery not lasting it was wprthless to me. Returned.
1,Shame on Amazon for picking this one as their choice.  Thing is a piece of junk! My box came with no rechargeable battery no USB cable or manual probably was return.  Once I look at it I realize why.  Do yourself a favor do not buy this product.
5,Really love this lil fan. It blows like a regular fan
5,Good
5,very good
2,Mine doesn’t hold a charge. Usually I’m only using it at my desk with my nearby so it’s fine.
1,Don't know why but the battery just stopped working. No matter how much I charge the fan only runs when plugged in now and it doesn't run on battery at all. Such a disappointment
2,It tips over easily.
1,It does not run for more than 20 minutes.  I have made sure that it is throughly charged.  Unfortunately it was too late tosend it back.  I need it for a cruise in 4 weeks.  I will order a different brand. Thank you.
1,The battery in this is junk. On a full charge the fan won’t last more than 10 minutes or so on low speed. Pretty useless. Would have given a zero for battery life if I could.
1,Very minimal fan power especially on level 1. Low charge life
5,Love it!
1,I bought four of this  and one came broken  the battery doesn’t work since I took it out of the box . I would really appreciate your help about it  thank you
1,The fan works fine while plugged into a power source. However it doesn't even work for a second on the battery. I charged the battery overnight and tested it with my multimeter and not even on the millivolt scale did it register. Makes me believe the battery is a fake as even a dead battery will have a little electrical activity.
1,The fan does not work when it is not plugged in no matter how long I charge the battery.  It is also not clear how the battery is supposed to go into the fan.  I tried it both ways and it still does not work.  I will be returning this.
5,Fan works great 3 speeds cool light battery included rechargeable.  Lightweight
5,My daughter loves her fan
5,Perfect for my desk. Air speeds are great. Would definately buy again!!
5,Best little fan ever! Powerful little sucker...helps in a pinch when those hot flashes kick in.
5,Holds a charge pretty well!
5,Good fan.  Comes in handy for camping and doing outdoor thing.
1,None
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 it cannot stand still when in the strongest mode it will fall off the table if you do not pay attention to it.
1,After less than 10 uses the USB cord no longer stays plugged into the fan.Update: They sent me a new fan which worked for a few months and then I started having the same USB problem.  Now the fan does not work at all.  I wouldn’t buy this again.
2,Bought this March 8th and it worked fine for a few months but now it will won't turn on anymore.
1,Poor quLity and product
5,This saves my life! I have personal summers and its amazing!!!!
5,Love this little fan! 3 speeds and a light. Great price great product!
5,Works great. Use in my cubicle at work. Love how it works on battery and is transportable!
5,Small but very powerful. Way more then I expected.
2,Package came without the battery.  Selling refurbish item?
1,The fan that this one replaced lasted 20 years.  The switch on this one died in less that 2 years.  It worked well but less than a year into it the switch starting acting up.  And now 22 months in it's dead.
1,Total crap
5,Great rechargable Fan. Just what I needed while on dialysis. Thanks
5,Very useful at the pool!!
1,Broke within 2 months. Didn't grip well so it slid all over smooth surfaces when at full power. You can't adjust it at all so it can't be pointed upwards.
1,It was nice when it worked. I bought this last year for summer so I only used it for maybe two months. This summer went to try and charge it and fan no longer operates on the battery. It will work with the cable plugged in but I need it portable.
5,excellent product shipped fast
5,Best buy ever I can put it in my purse and take it with me
1,I got this a week ago. Love the design and breeze is good for its size. However after a full charge it lasts only 45 minutes. I think I got a lemon :(
1,This fan is very cheaply made & definitely not worth the money.  I would not recommend this product.  I threw mine in the trash.
5,works well.
5,very functional and strong breeze.At the highest setting will blow for 3 hours straight.
5,Very small but very powerful perfect for by my bed!
5,Great for cruise
1,I just got this. it works when it is plugged in but the battery does not stay charged to run without the cord!! If that is why you are buying it ...SAVE your money and buy a different one!
5,Great portable fan. Perfect for a desktop and doesn't take up much room.
5,Lots of power.
1,The fan lasted just a short time before it would no longer work.
1,This thing is a piece of crap. It works plugged in but no matter how many times I let it charge up it doesn’t work if it’s unplugged. Save your money.
1,I really like this product plugged in but came with a battery that won’t even charge. Have been messaging the seller about product and haven’t got anywhere so far.
5,my wife love it
5,Love this style fan.
5,Love it.  Carry in golf cart in florida heat.
2,I must keep it plugged into a USB port to run it
5,This is perfect for your desk at work. Powerful for a little fan
5,BEST fan. I've purchased 2 more as gifts.
1,I give this a one star because it doesn’t work unless it’s plugged in despite have a rechargeable battery. Don’t waste your money!
1,The fan works fine when plugged in but does not charge  at all so it will not work when not plugged in to USB power.
5,This has way more power than i expected great fan
3,eh looks very cheep
5,i love it😆
1,These used to be good back then but lately I've gotten a defective one that lasted about 4 days since the fan blade holder separated from its hold and it neglects to fully use the battery before it's no longer willing to run and whenever I turned it on it stops unexpectedly. Not purchasing this again.
5,Fan charges and works well.
1,2nd fan I've purchased. Both have stopped charging. Only had for 3 months. Waste of money!
1,Initially I LOVED this fan. I'm on medication that makes me sooooo hot so this was a godsend! It worked and kept me cool for three weeks. Then one day I charged it and took it to work and when I tried to use it it was dead. Will not hold a charge at all. So sad!!
5,quiet and small just what I was looking for
1,It was a fan. It blew air. It had a light. It was rad. But then it just quit working. Sad that it lasted less than a year.
5,Perfect for the office!
5,Powerful little fan. I wish the charge could last longer.
1,I barely had a chance to use this fan and now it doesn't work at all. Even when it's plugged in it will shut off within 10-20 seconds. Don't bother with this junk!
2,Cheap product. Got damaged right away.
5,Love it in the small bathroom. Love the size and that it is rechargable
5,I love the mobility of this product!
5,Works awesomely
5,awesome works great really powerful. If u need a good small fan this is it.
1,Item worked for about 10 seconds. After it stopped working the base became extremely hot. Tried turning power off without luck. Took battery out and returned.
1,When I tried to remove the USB cable after charging the interior charging connection came with it!!  It will no longer charge even if i try to push the unit back in using the USB cable.  Cheaply made and won't allow a return.  Do not buy this product.
2,This product was not powerful. Would not buy again
2,Worked ok but now it won't run on the battery. I have to keep it plugged in.
2,Rip off. Spends more time charging than working for me. Could not get full proper use and now the charger has failed. Definitely do not recommend. No good for regular standard 15 min use.
1,The fan works great as long as it is plugged in however my main reason for ordering this fan was because it was battery operated too.  Not what I expected.
2,Lasted about what you'd expect for fifteen dollars. After a few weeks of continuous plugged in use next to the bed at night it stopped working.
5,Very nice
5,Wonderfull
1,Mine does not hold a charge. I use it with battery packs but pretty disappointing as the fan can be powerful and useful!
5,Powerful little fan.
2,Pricey for the quality. Noisy after little use. Good looking product design though.
5,very nice. charges well is small but powerful. perfect for work!
5,beautiful and great little cooling machine I recommend tremendously.
5,Bought it for my office desk. Does a great job. I recommend this product.
5,LOVE THIS LITTLE FAN STRONG and Battery Powered and rechargeable
5,This fan travels everywhere with me!  Easy to recharge durable.
1,Broke immediately - it’s where the cord plugs into the fan. Won’t stay plugged. This is a piece of junk.
1,I purchased this fan end of July but just got around to getting it out to use.  Fan works fine plugged in but battery will not charge.  Shame on me for not checking when it arrived.
1,The fan isn't stable enough.. When I place it in the upright position the blades weigh down (the blades drag on the bottom) and all i hear is the motor running trying to get the blades to spin... just spend couple extra bucks and buy something better. Worst buy ever.
5,Great little fan for a great price
5,Love this fan!
1,Battery does not recharge cable already coming apart in less than a month and I don't plug it in or replug it very often - so it is not due to hard use. I had it on my desk plugged into my computer charging port. Very disappointed.
2,Bad only works plug in
1,Battery dies so quickly it's stupid don't want this cheasse thing but it ant worth the shipping or return Hassel
2,In theory it is a good fan but after a couple of weeks it would no longer hold a charge disposable junk . . . .
1,only works when plugged up.  Keeps no charge! DO NOT BUY FOR CAMPING
5,Love it!
5,GREAT PRODUCTFAST SHIPPING.CANT COMPLAIN.WILL BE BUYING MORE
1,Charged for hours. Dead when unplugged and turned on.Repeated many times.
5,Helps drown out office neighbors offensive music while keeping air moving.
1,Wouldn’t have bought it if I knew it only worked while plugged in....
1,I bought this for a couple of trips I took this summer. Unfortunately it only worked when I first got it and tasted it at my home. By time I got back where I could return it my window had passesed...just like you should on this fan.
1,Would not wk unless plugged in once unplugged it didnt wk
5,By now... excelent product.Give q lot more air i expected.
1,The battery does not hold a charge. Fan won’t operate without usb being plugged in. I needed this for a trip to the beach and it didn’t work. Very disappointing.
1,Not much power Pretty much useless. I sent it back
5,Great product!  Would buy another one.
5,For use on my boat this summer - Rechargeable!
1,Fan is quiet and for its size gives an amazing amount of air flow however my one and only gripe which most likely was a defective battery or capacitor.
5,Works great on my desk at work!
1,Stopped working after just a few uses. Dont buy it!
5,4 Fan Blades and 3.5 inch Diameter
1,It was returned. The battery wouldn’t charge.
5,Love it! Great product! Exactly as shown!
1,Blue light doesn't work! The main reason my daughter wanted it! Disappointing!
1,I loved it at first lasted 3 and half months now the battery won't charge up....so now can't use it or find replacement battery for it :(wish it was working or would still use it other than that it is a good little fan.
1,Good size fan BUT it does not hold a charge and will only last seconds before it shuts off unless you use it while plugged in.
1,Bought this for a trip and didn't try it out when it arrived.  By the time the trip came and I found out it didn't work it was too late to return.
5,I like this. I put it on top of my desk. It's wonderful.
5,Great fan. Would definitely recommend it.
5,very powerful little fan and recharges from a USB port
5,I love it looks great charges easily and works as advertised.

1,Bought May 2018 pluged in today wouldn't charge got hot smelled ozone fire hazard unsafe.
5,Strong fan with good battery life.
5,Love this little fan.  It's quiet yet strong!
5,Just 5 words the best of the best!
1,It's good definitely. But I used just for 3 days because now it's broken down.  At the same time my roommate bought another fan and his fan is still working; of course fan should not have broken up in 3 days.
1,I plugged the unit in and fully charged the battery over night.  When I removed the charging cable not only did the charging connector come apart but the battery did not hold a chage either.  Unit is now dead.
2,Stopped working 2 months after I bought it
1,Battery is already dead. Will not buy again.
1,I could not get it to work.
2,Miniature fan too expensive
1,I bought this for my 2 week trip to Italy. It died after one week. The charge plug literally fell out and thusly the fan became useless. I can't return it because it's past the deadline but buyer beware!!!
1,Will not keep charge. Has to stay plugged in. Definitely returning.
1,I ordered this fan because it’s battery powered but it only runs for 20 minutes and then goes off using it with the electric cord it’s already quit working.
5,really powerful I love it
1,Blade broke inside fan and now make louder noise and isn't as efficient. :(
1,This only works when plugged in...  battery operation doesn’t work.  Fan goes fast but doesn’t produce much air/breeze...  look elsewhere.
1,Will not charge. It will run as long as it is plugged in charger but does not charge so you can run it without charger.
1,No clue why I have another travel dan like this that’s still going strong not recommended
1,does not last long
1,Already broke!!! I just bought this not too long ago. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!
5,Will also charge batteries!
5,This item lived up to the description and met my expectations!
1,I liked it at first but it began turning itself off which became more often until it just quit. $15 wasted!
2,stopped working completely after only a few months and now I cannot find manufacturer contact info anywhere.
1,Works fine when plugged in battery won't charge even when trying new cables.
2,This is was a fantastic little fan until it broke.  The night light still worked but that was it.
1,Takes awhile to charge doesn't last long and the strength is ok.
1,Returned for refund bought a different brand.
1,Bought this last month and got it charged ready for vacation.  Haven't even used it once yet and now the battery refuses to carry a charge.  Useless product.
1,Ordered two fans one works perfectly the other does will not charge.
1,Did not come with a cord to charge the fan. Fan will only work when plugged in battery will not charge.  If my coworker hadn't thrown the box away I would be sending this back.

1,This only works in plugged in. Did I get a dud?

1,Not functional
4,I've only had this fan for around a month and I do like it however recently it has started making a clicking or tapping sound. I e looked it over and there is nothing obstructing the fan blades so I'm a bit worried as to the longevity of this fan. Time will tell I suppose.
5,"eFluky" -- what a name.  But this little fan works surprisingly well is compact and light and very inexpensive. It was on sale when I bought mine for I think $11. The 2200 mAh battery included with this version gives me 6.5 hours of service at low speed.  And at low speed the fan is quiet and effective -- I doubt that I will use the higher speeds much.  There are two control buttons one turns on the fan and cycles between the three speeds and the LED light. The other turns the unit off. The separate off button means you don't need to use the one button to cycle back to "off" a pet peeve of some reviewers on other units.  I don't see any way to have the light and the fan at the same time. As should be evident from the pictures the simple design is fixed and does not tilt.I've seen the same model fan branded under two other names for a few dollars more I think with higher-capacity batteries.For the price I think the "eFluky" deserves five stars. It could be improved in a few ways but those will raise the cost.  The feature I miss most is Tilt. With the fan on my desktop I would like to tilt it upward to get some breeze on my face. The light is not very useful without a separate light switch in my opinion. Higher capacity battery is always a plus though 6.5 hours is good enough for me.
4,I recently bought this and another make//model USB fan for my new cubicle job. After using both extensively I have some notes as to this particular unit's functions- though I do want to say since I have a compare and contrast of similar items at the same price range I do prefer my other fan a tad more.So- this mini fan includes a standard 18650 battery used in many other USB items such as tactical flashlights. We happen to have several other of these batteries on hand- if you don't you can invest in a 2 pack for around $11 on Amazon (at the time of this review). I note this because I feel having multiple batteries extends the convenience of keeping this cord free and on the go. While you can leave it hooked up to USB and use it endlessly the power is a bit weakened when running solely off direct power (in charging mode).Here are the times I calculated on a full battery for each speed:Low: 7 hours 40 minutesMedium: 4 hours 3 minutesHigh: 1 hour 50 minutesCharging time seems to be about 4 hours though I was able to knock the speed to 3.5 hours with one of my better cables (Not the cable provided). You can also run this off of a power bank as I also do in my cubicle since we cannot use the power outlets for personal accessories.The 'blue' light which is optional is nice but really has no purpose for me- it looks cool and it doesn't seem to drain the battery noticeably quicker. The buttons are very stiff to use in my opinion and the design isn't as modern/chic as I would like. Lastly I think this really could use some sort of kickstand to angle it as I often have to prop it against something because it's almost never on a surface flush with my face. I did receive a discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts which I have done.
4,I needed a desk fan for work but most of the smaller cheap ones either have no speed control or are pretty noisy.  This fan works great as a desk fan super quiet on the lowest setting and moves plenty of air.I've also used it as a portable fan for sporting events and the combination of light weight and compact size makes it an ideal addition to your game day bag.  It's durable enough to toss it in and forget about it until you need it.  I also love that you can easily change the battery with commonly available 18650 lithium batteries though with the lowest setting I have yet to be at an event where the battery completely ran out.  At higher settings or longer events the option to swap batteries is a great addition.The flash light on the fan is just a simple led but works great in a pinch it is nice to not have to carry another item in your kit.  The blue light on the fan blades themselves is a bit weird you don't have to use it but I guess if you wanted some mood lighting at night you are all set.My only real complaint about this fan is the lack of any true stand or holding device if you need to angle the fan for better aim you are stuck either holding it or propping it up.  Not a real problem as it's light enough to either just hold in your hand or set on an object to change the angle but it is a drawback.Overall if you are using this in your office because your facilities guys think your desk should be the focal point of heating distribution for your building even in the summer you won't be disappointed.  As a bonus even if the power goes out you'll still be nice and cool even as those around you lose their precious precious air conditioning.
5,Don't waist your money on just a normal USB fan when you can have something like this for a little more.  I have a couple of the USB fans and they are crude 5V no speed control - just fans - cheaper motors.  You can see through the front of this unit that they are using a higher quality motor that is of a multi stator brushless design.  And when coupled with the speed controller you can expect smoother operation and typically more efficient and a longer life.Pro's - Nice fan with 3 speed settings and a bonus light.  The fan on low lasts a good amount of time with the provided 3.7v 2200mAh 18650 LION battery when fully charged.  The fan motor itself is high quality.  It is not noisy and the molded clear fan seems well balanced.  It provides a nice movement of air at level 1 or 2 and 3 is really blowing.Cons - It won't go max speed when plugged in to charge and charging does take some time.  When just tossed into my work laptop bag I have to take out the battery or something will bump the switch turn it on and kill the battery.  On speed setting 3 and a flat surface the fan will move around from the force of the it's air moving.  "Not big deals - just quirks.  And the moving bit is solved by proping something to keep it in place and could be resolved with some rubber feet."Control of the fan is via an OFF and ON push buttons.  Pressing the on will turn it on to speed one.  Press again for speed 2 then 3 and finally the LED turns on for the 4th press.  Pressing off at any time turns the fan or light off.Indication LEDs on the fan are a Charging LED which goes from red to green when fully charged and a red LED above each each speed setting to indicate speed.I use this for business - me; on site engineering at times - in an auto plant or on the go - programming engineering and just keeping cool when the environment is lacking AC.  I have a separate battery charger that will charge these 18650 type cells much quicker than a 5v micro USB cable can along with a few extra high capacity cells.  I keep a couple extra batteries with my laptop bag so I can have extended times if needed and not worrying about charging when in use.I would recommend this for anyone who needs a personal fan for a few hours without being plugged in.  And even plugged in and charging - I would recommend as a higher quality fan than just a USB fan.  ..."Works for me!"
5,I carry this in my work bag daily and work at several busy MRI Centers where the temperature is a bit higher than what I want it to be. A lot of computers in my cramped work area seems to keep it a bit toasty. I sawall the flgirls I work with gave one of these I went out on a limb and got one for myself. Now I can actually get chilly sitting in front of it. It's quiet and breezy now at my scanner. 5 MRI technologists can't be wrong. We love them. I always keep mine plugged in so not sure about length of time it lasts on battery. I wish it had a thing on it to tilt the fan up is my only dislike. I angle it up with some folded up sticky notes on bottom taped. Lol
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             PROS:- Rechargeable- Powerful performance - 7.2 mph wind- Portable & lightweight- Value priced- Multi-featuredCONS:- No rubber feet - moves on hard surfacesBOTTOM LINE: Shut up and take my moneyDone with burning through batteries in other battery powered fans in my search for a rechargeable fan I came across this gem.I needed a portable fan and this fan meets and even exceeds my needs and expectations.  It comes with a rechargeable 3.7V 2200 mAh 18650 battery which I promptly replaced with a higher 3400 mAh 18650 battery.  You can charge the battery through the fan's micro USB port.I tested this fan's wind speed with an anemometer at 7.2 mph.  Compared to an O2 Cool fan powered by 2 D cells - 3.2 mph a 12V powered automotive fan - 7.6 mph and a 110VAC area fan - 8.0 mph.  Surprising performance from a very lightweight and compact fan.As with most everything on Amazon the most powerful factor when determining what to buy (for me anyways) is price.  This fan comes in at under $15 US and surprisingly was the only fan I found that met my requirements (see PROS).In addition to the fan exceeding the basic functions that one expects from a battery powered fan it comes with other features such as: 3 speeds; a single LED emergency light on the right side and a glowing fan blade that illuminates in blue.  You can activate this when the fan is running and by pressing and holding the "ON" button.Sadly the fan doesn't have rubber feet.  This causes the fan to "walk" when placed on hard surfaces.  Obviously one can add rubber stickers onto the bottom to prevent it from moving while the fan is running.Weird company name kept causing my Youtube video to be rejected.  However it's a terrific fan at this price point!!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I got this on sale and wasn't expecting much really. I was quite surprised with the quality of this fan. It's small and compact but don't let its size fool you.At the "High" setting this fan blasts a good amount of air. On long tiring day I usually go take a power nap in my car during my lunch break. The high setting of this fan has a good enough amount of air flow to keep me comfortable during hot summer days.I tested it on the high setting continuously and it lasted a good 2 hours on a single full charge. The unit itself  uses a 18650 rechargeable battery which isn't a standard sized battery but I'm sure you could easily find online. I just wished it used something more standard like AA or AAA batteries.Pressing and holding on the ON button will activate a blue LED light that illuminates the fan blades. Not exactly a feature I love—but I guess you can use this fan as a night light also if you want.The base of the fan also has an LED light off to the right side to use as a flashlight which can be activated by pressing the ON button four times (Low >> Medium >> High >> Flashlight On).I'd love to see a better and sturdier base for this fan. Even a head tilt feature maybe to change the angle of the fan? Overall I'm thoroughly impressed by this fan and love it.
4,Don't feel or hear any difference between speed 2 and 3 so at very most this is a 2 speed fan. Nice that it has a replaceable rechargeable battery. Can be used when plugged in as well and being portable. I was looking for a USB powered fan that I can put on my desk at work and got this for a good deal. Wish it had a clip or a mount on the back or bottom. It has good air flow and is pretty powerful for it's size.Update: Great customer service they contacted me and sent me a new fan which does work at all speeds. I use this at my office desk and there is plenty of airflow to keep me cool. Upping a star due to them caring about their customers and standing behind their product.
5,The air is diffused nicely the lowest speed on this moves far more air than my Arctic Breeze PRO on its (the AB's) highest setting!  I don't need to use the higher speed settings can feel the breeze from across a small room. It has a serious battery in the 18650 that is supplied with it.  You'll get longer performance with this battery than you would using the usual AAs before needing a recharge.The base IS narrow but there are 2 peel-off sticky strips on the bottom that will allow for a broader base to be attached.  I may put on Velcro® strips so I can remove the base for travel.Suggest removing the battery (or interrupting the electrical contact with a small strip of paper) before placing this in a suitcase because the switch may be accidentally tripped with the jostling of travel discharging the battery.This has a small glowing light indicating charge and speed selection plus a tiny flashlight at the right side (facing the front of the fan).  On the left side is the mini USB charging port.  A charging cord is provided along with the 18650 battery.I'm happy with my purchase  may have to buy more of these before the price goes up the way my Arctic Breeze PRO DID!
4,GOOD: Extremely responsive CS; Powerful fan even on LOW; Can be used via USB with or without battery; Good included generic 18650 battery capacity measured at 2080mAh (via Opus BT-C3100v2); Cute blue light (probably won't be used by me same for the exterior white LED); Seems solid and well made of all plastic...( even has Q.C. sticker); Good click ON and OFF buttons w/ charging/power and speed indicator LED's.NOT SO GOOD: Noisy even on LOW....may not be an issue outdoors but indoors if used on a desk with fan located nearby in a quiet environment the fan noise may be disconcerting...ergo the 4 star rating.NEUTRAL: a tilt mechanism would be nice.NOTE: Remove the thin clear plastic from the 2 bottom pads and the fan will not "crawl".Durability has yet to be determined.
5,I can't believe the power this "little" fan has...There are 3 speeds.. Low medium and of course high but after you press the button for high hold it for 3 seconds and a cool blue light comes on while the fan is on! I like the fact that I can place this at my computer desk and on the low setting it didn't disrupt any of my papers. I did however notice that when on settings 1 and 2 the fan didn't move at all but when on the highest setting it would move around. I made sure something was behind the fan so It didn't fall off my desk.In the box you get the fan a usb cord ( that's how it charges) and a battery.The battery seemed to hold a pretty good charge. I had it at my desk for 3 hours on low and It didn't die. This fan is not just for the desk though. It's portable and as long as you have it fully charged you can take it anywhere. If you run out of power you could definitely charge it in your car.**Thank you for reading my review** I received this mini rechargeable fan from efluky at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4,This fan is excellent for the price.  It is durable (been dropped multiple times)  strong (been using it over the stove when smoke needs to be directed out the nearby window decent battery but not the best (charges quickly and lasts for a reasonable amount of time.  There is only one thing that I wish was different about the fan.  When it is plugged in and turned on the fan is not nearly as strong as when it runs just on battery power.  So in the situation whee you need a powerful breeze quickly but the fan's battery is not charged it doesn't quite handle the task.  I would purchase this again.
4,This little thing is really cool. The fan is strong for it's size. The battery is an odd size which means when it dies you may have trouble finding a replacement but it will still work directly with the micro USB that comes with it.My only issue with it is that it can only blow air straight. When I was buying it for some reason I thought that the front grill might be adjustable/rotatable allowing one to adjust it to blow air slightly up or down. Since this blows air only straight even though wide spread you'll have to place it on something higher if you want it to blow air at your face.
4,A powerful fan for the size. I was impressed. I also like that it is rechargeable. I have another that uses batteries and I have to change them constantly. I have a battery pack charger for my phone and tablet and this will work with that as well. I write out in a barn and it's scorching in the summer. I wear the cooling towels drink plenty of water but a fan is a must. The electrical work out there is a bit old and I don't like plugging anything in so this fan is perfect for me. The only thing I don't like is that you can't rotate it to blow exactly where you want. I received this product at a discount for a fair and unbiased review
4,Perfect little fan for the bedside table or desk.Likes: Very quiet on low speed setting and on high speed it moves more air than my Holmes HPF-0467 USB rechargeable fan.Dislikes: Cannot adjust fan angle. Mine only runs for 50 minutes on high setting not 2 hours. I will recharge a few times re-test and adjust review as necessary.As noted in the title you need to remove the protective tape off the rubber feet on the bottom of the fan or it will move around on the table when it is set on "high".
4,I've been using a USB fan for a while but this is a lot better! Much ore powerful quieter (on the lowest setting at least) and harder to stick a finger in and get hurt. The only downside is that it's bigger (obviously) but it's a trade off you'll have to decide if it's worth it to you. The rechargeable lithium battery works well and should help it last a long time. This will be my go to for meetings from now on. Don't think I'll carry it around everywhere since it's a little larger than my old fan but it's worth it in my opinion.
4,The fan works surprisingly well despite its size. I keep this on my desk and for me it's good enough to avoid buying a larger fan. The blue light feature is also quite neat and unexpected. Just hold the ON button while the fan is on to activate it.The only thing I dislike about this fan is the battery life. It don't know approx. how long I get since I'm turning it on/off frequently but it seems like I charge it a bit too often. Keeping a powerbank nearby keeps it on though
4,Very good fan. Small portable long lasting and easily rechargeable. I took off one star because while the overall build quality is good the back plastic grill is pretty flimsy and can crack if you grab it with too much force. Also know that it does not come with the charger. It did come with the USB cable. This was fine for me as I have literally dozens of the wall chargers laying around the house. I liked the fan so much I ordered a second one...
5,Omg I love this little fan! We live where it occasionally gets on the 90s-100s and we don't have AC. This little fan helped me survive being 9 months pregnant during these heat waves. I keep it on my nightstand at night and it helps so much. I carry it all around the house during the day. It is quiet and the battery lasts a long time especially on setting 1. I've even brought it camping and to the beach. We have another one of similar size from a different random Amazon brand and that model is louder and less powerful.I didn't think the little LED would be useful but it is the perfect amount of light for late-night bathroom trips and I can see myself using the little light once the baby is here for midnight feedings & changes without waking the husband or overstimulating baby. The only thing that would make this little fan better is if it had some sort of clip or base that would make it more stable or allow you to tilt or angle it. It is super lightweight and does tip over easily. It would also be great to be able to clip this to a stroller for example.
4,Love the fan.  I can place it wherever I am as it is small yet puts out a powerful breeze.  Have used it a few times in the kitchen while doing dishes or working at my desk. Only negative it seems to take awhile to recharge.  Not a big deal as long as you remember to plug it in when done using. You can also use it while plugged in if a USB port is available and within reach.
5,OK I bought this on a whim. It was during the sale days.  It has been about a month and I am thinking of getting a few for some friends.  It is the perfect size for a bedside table or by your computer or where ever you need access to cool air.Pros:  It is cute. It comes in different colors.  It PUTS OUT SOME AIR.  It has 3 speeds it has a flashlight function it is USB rechargeable it has a neon light if you want to use it to create atmosphere.  It is small and plastic.Con:  Fully charged it does not last all night.Comments:  I grab this fan in the middle of the night if I get a hot flash and it does the trick (even on low setting) instead of a big hand fan.  It is fairly quiet.  I use it on low speed and it helps me drift off to sleep.  It is easy to operate in the dark although it has a red light that stays on if it is in the on position.  The "on" light does not bother me like the neon light (than can be turned on or off) but one could tape over it if needed.  I don't remember how long the instructions say that the charge will last.  I am sure it depends on which functions you are using and what speed but if I don't run it constantly all night then I get cooled off when I need it.  (I did a little research on running things while charging them and I decided it was probably not a good idea.)  I like the size and functionality so much that I will be taking this on my next vacation.
4,The output is good fan is a little smaller than I expected (my fault for not researching properly) the battery life seems to be good the only thing I don't like about it is that it has no stand or way to tilt the fan back or forward. It blows straight out on the plane of whatever it is sitting on and while the batter helps keep the bottom weighted down it seems to be slightly tip happy if bumped.
4,The product is small but when you turn it on it feels like a big fan. Last year we went through hurricane Maria and we had no power and it was hot no wing. This product would have made our lifies a bit better if we has it. Always it must be recharged. Very happy with it thinking of getting a few to store.
4,Works as described and is a nice little fan.  I've found that even the first setting moves enough air around my desk to cool me off but does not generate background noise while I'm on phone calls.If this had some sort of kickstand to angle the fan I would give it 5 stars but for the price this is a nice fan.
5,I’m on my second one of these fans the first one broke on the back of the case (center).  I don’t fault the manufacturer for this as it was likely due to getting stepped on after falling off the nightstand.I have mine always connected via microUSB as I don’t usually take it anywhere unless for traveling.  I figured it was better to run off usb as opposed to the battery so I removed the battery as a safety precaution as to prevent overcharging.  However due to having a cable connected it’s easily pulled off the table.  I may try some Velcro or routing a cable better to prevent snagging it resulting in the fan falling.I don’t use the led light feature but it could be handy if needed.  Since I use it on my nightstand the led indicator lights (red) are a tad brighter than I’d like but not a big deal.Overall this is a great little fan not noisy and perfect for a nightstand or using at the office (my coworkers admired it when I brought it into a meeting once where the conference room we use is often really hot).It would be cool if there was a way to make it a little heavier on the bottom or adding a removable suction cup.
4,I bought this fan to take on trips. It does not come with a carrying case but I had no problem throwing it in my bag. I never had issues with it turning on while packed away. The battery does not last an entire 8 hour night but it does have a powerful breeze. You can use it while it is plugged in.
4,I bought this for my makeup vanity. It is the perfect size (I'd say about medium sized). It is actually very powerful and I love that you can recharge it instead of going thru batteries. The only complaint that I have is that I was sent the wrong color. I was hoping it would match my makeup vanity.
4,Pros:- Good cooling power for its size- USB powered/chargedCons:- Does not remember last fan speed setting or LED on/off setting.  Nuisance for something so simple.- Does not allow for max fan speed when plugged in.- Got mine for $6.99.  Not worth $15 as its currently priced.
4,Good:Great little fan for the desk at the office.  Easy to take into meeting when some Einstein invites too many people to a small meeting room.  There's lots of jealous stares.  :-)Bad:While you can tell the difference between speed 2 and 3 when it's plugged in speed 3 on just battery feels the exact same as speed 2.
4,Like the fan as it is fairly quiet and pushes a good amount of air. the reason I took 1 star off is because the angle is not adjustable. It sits straight on the surface and and cant push at a up or down angle. Other than that it's great. Thank you
4,I bought this fan for work because I work outside.  It's powerful enough to do the job and the battery does last when it's fully charged.  I also use it at night so I don't have to waste electricity.  The nightlight feature is cute too
5,I AM BUYING ONE OF THESE FOR ALL MY FEMALE FRIENDS. Everyone I know right now is in their mid-40s and THIS is the gift for them! I bought this because I work on-site at various business and don't always have a power outlet. I do have a couple of USB power banks though so I figured if I ever ran low on power with this fan I could switch over. So far I haven't needed to. The low speed has been plenty cooling for me and is rated to last 8 hours. I haven't used it with the blue light which was not a draw anyway. It is easily packable and very quiet so I can use it while I work. It also works if you take the battery out and run a USB cable to a power bank so that is an option if people have trouble keeping a good charge with the battery. And yes you can plug into your computer. The battery easily pops out the back compartment and this is a breeze (excuse the pun) to use. I will never be hot again. OK - that is a lie but I will always be able to do something reasonable about it. This is going EVERYWHERE with me.I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review but I plan on buying more. MANY more. LOVE!
4,The first fan I received was defective due to the battery not charging. I contacted the seller and a new one was shipped to replace the defective one. It works perfectly and does a great job. Nice and quiet! The replacement was easy and The company stood by it’s product.
4,Nice little fan for the price. Works great on my desk and moves air well on low when it's pretty quiet. Keep it plugged into a USB port and run this for days on end. A little bonus with the little light on side if one might need one in a pinch
5,I was excited to try out this Mini USB Rechargeable Fan by efluky.  To be honest I wasn't expecting much out of this little plastic fan but was I pleasantly surprised. This little 4.5 Inch table fan packs some power. The fan has 3 speeds and even the low speed sends out quite a bit of air. High speed was definitely high speed.I have been testing out at my computer since that is where I spend the most time.  The fan was easy to charge just plugging it in to a USB port.  I ran it on low speed which was the perfect speed to freshen the air.  It was still going when I turned it off five hours later.  The other times I have used it I just left it plugged in. Most likely it will become my best friend this summer when it gets much harder to cool my office off.I am also looking forward to trying it when I travel.  It will stay on the nightstand in my hotel room. So many hotel rooms now are energy efficient so if you aren't moving around in the room the a/c turns off or at least is limited during the night. This is the first time I have had something small enough to pack.  An added plus is the cool blue light option that will be very beneficial when I need to get up during the night. I will just plug it in to my multi-port charger with my cellphone so it will run all night.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I don't think you will be disappointed.
4,Must admit when I opened it I was disappointed by just how small the fan is. I knew it was small just didn't think that small. But when I charged it and turned it on high I was amazed. Strong little fan for battery operated...very pleased.
4,This fan is great in terms of quality.  however  my only complaint is that it cannot tilt and or holese to hang it.  I found out after using it fora little while that other brands offer the tilt feature with the same price.
4,I love this little fan... It's not only totetable but super powerful for such a little thing. As I have bouts of hot flashes thru out the day and night it's extremely convenient and the extra lights are nice to have at night.. thank you
4,I like this little fan so much. Charging is quick and for such a little guy  this fan is powerful. Keeps me cool anywhere. I have not timed how long it holds a charge yet so perhaps I will be updating my review.
4,Too bad that the light on the side cant be turned on while the fan is on but other than that it produces a nice breeze.
4,I have a very small guest bathroom and it get very warm so I added this great little fan.  It does not take up too much room on the counter and it helps cool the person getting ready.
4,This is a great little fan for your desk or even bedside. Battery life is fine I haven't paid too much attention but it last a few hours. It charges right in my computer at my desk which is nice.
4,great little fan bought it for recharge feature love that it's quite quiet.speeds are good and unfortunately the weather has not indicated that it's time for a fan so I can't tell how well it will perform with extended use.
4,These work great. Perfect size for my needs. I ordered 2 and one of the batteries went bad. But it still works plugged into the charger. I should be able to find a replacement battery fairly easily.
4,I leave it plugged in when I'm at the computer 3 settings work for having a nice cool breeze.  This is what I got it for handles that role perfectly.
4,Battery life could last a little longer but it goes for a while on the low setting. Also has a flashlight and adjustable modes. Easy to use with minimal buttons to confuse you. Small enough to fit where you need but powerful enough to deliver the cooling power you need!
4,Purchased this product for my dog's car kennel.  It is wonderful to keep air moving Easy to charge and the LED is very convenient at night to give a little light in the area.
4,nice little novelty fan. would not do much when its really hot but works when you are in a pinch. wouldn't buy it again but very decent quality.
4,If you're on the fence about this fan jump off. It's amazing. Moves a CRAZY amount of air for such a little thing. Super powerful. The only thing I wish it had was a kickstand so I could angle it up towards my face but I Jimmy rigged one.
4,perfect for my desk at work on battery it doesn't last long (and actually runs faster)...maybe ill try good rechargeable batteries instead of the ones it came with.
5,I have only had this a few days but I am very happy with the purchase.  I was pleasantly surprised with how much air this can push and the fact that it has three settings.  This is an awesome battery powered rechargeable fan.  I hope it holds up for a long time.I purchased this as I sleep with a fan every night and did not want to take my larger fan on vacation for 15 days.  This little fan @ 4 x 5 x 1.5 inches can be thrown right in with my luggage and can be charged everywhere my cell phone can be charged.One thing I did notice is that the fan was actually more powerful when I was using the battery vs when using the cord.  Not sure if my power supply was low or if it was charging the battery and powering the fan at the same time.Pros - High speed puts out a huge amount of air for such a little fan - the blue light is a cool feature - three speeds - flashlight built in - very small - rechargeable batteryCons - haven't found any yet.Overall this is a great little fan that I would happily purchase again.  I received a discount on this product in exchange for an evaluation and honest review.  I will update this review if there are any problems in the near future.
4,This is a small but very good portable fan its quiet and the charge on it last quite a while. i use it as a laptop fan mainly overall it keeps they keyboard and laptop cooler.
4,Great fans perfect for when there is no power. Batteries are junk! No batteries are hazardous waste! They shouldn't be included OR they should be QUALITY name brand batteries.
4,It works good on speed 3 runs about a hour on full charge. Use it in my day cab when the truck isn't idleing
4,Powerful little thing but keeping it charge when I needed it can be a pain.  Portable fan and does the job well enough.
4,Got it actually impressed with the airflow but wouldn't charge.  Looked for similar reviews and then I realized hm maybe I just have the battery in backwards........if you're in a similar boat you might give that a shot.
4,It's nice that you can charge it using the USB. Functional. Fan turning creates a small humming noise but nothing that would bother you.
4,I was looking for a small fan that I could travel with.  This fan is the perfect size and throws out plenty of air.  The battery won't charge so I took off a star for that.  I will have to keep it plugged in.  Luckily I have several usb chargers that I can use (since the fan does not come with one).
4,Only thing to make this better would be if you could adjust the angle of the fan.
4,This is the second fan I have bought and I couldn't be more satisfied with it.
4,Nice thing for office or car if you have a dog inside waiting for you in the shade.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Nice little fan. I paid $9.74 with prime shipping. The three levels of speed are a good option. I notice that on the 3rd speed it wants to scoot around on my desk but the fan is fairly quite. I would buy this again.
4,I thought the fan would be a little bigger it is actually the size of my hand.
5,This efluky Mini USB Rechargeable Fan is quite the accessory for anyone.  I work a lot at my desk from home and I use this fan all the time.  This fan plugs right into your USB port on your desktop or laptop and charges or you can run the fan while it's plugged in as I do that most of the time.  There is an on and off button.  The on button lets you choose how much air flow with three different fan speeds.  Low Medium and High.  This rechargeable fan is super quiet and perfect for any cubical or office setting as it doesn't make much noise.  This fan is small but not too small and comes in different colors. The size of the fan is comparable to a college calculator as shown in the photos.  The slits in the front that allow air flow are close enough together that my young daughter cannot stick her fingers through and the blades cannot hurt her.  The fan is made of all plastic and does come with the rechargeable battery.  The rechargeable feature is great if you need to take it traveling or on road trips as the charged battery will last about 8 hours on the low setting and about 2 hours on the high setting. I would recommend this rechargeable fan to everyone.  This fan also works great for those having hot flashes.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4,Liked this Product. I use it at my workplace very quiet and portable as described.
4,Perfect for sitting at my pc. I only wish it could be charged while being used.
4,Smaller than I wanted so I returned it but it probably works fine
4,Works reasonably well but the buttons do feel kinda flimsy. No problems so far though.
4,Love this fan.  Its AWESOME in the golf couse
5,I bought two and love them.  My air conditioner isn't working so these little fans are life saviors right now!  I tend to carry one around with me because it is SO HOT... averages 93 in my house at all times!  The thing I like most (other than the obvious) is that there is a charging indicator light no guessing... while it is charging the light is red but turns green when fully charged.  One of them has is a pretty blue light inside the fan when it on.... but only on one of them ??? .  I'm sorry I always forget to time how long it stays charged and how long it takes to do the charging because I tend to use them while they are charging  but I think the timing is pretty much as described in the description.  Pay close attention to the fact that you have to use a USB cord to charge I didn't.  Yes the cord does come with it but you will need the usb / plug adapter if you want to use a regular plug.  I just use my android phone charger that is always plugged in anyway.  The good news about that is if you are using it at a baseball game or fishing or something if it dies you can use a portable charger.  That to me is a major plus.
4,Christmas gift.  Looks like just what they will like.
4,LIke that it is rechargeable.  It kept me cool.
4,Works very well. Might be to loud on high for a quiet office environment.It's a nice little portable fan.
5,I have purchased USB fans in the past and was extremely disappointed with their durability. That is not the case with the Efluky fan. This fan is light weight but feels way more sturdy than other small travel fans I have purchased. I really like to sleep with a fan blowing on me. I also like the white noise that a fan provides during sleep. I travel extensively so I miss my fan on the road. With this fan I no longer have to go without one on the road. This fan has already traveled to Europe and the Southeastern part of the US. Its easy to carry and holds up well to the rigors of travel. The breeze is created is truly amazing for its size. I typically charge while I use it so I am not sure how long it will go on the battery. I can affirm that you should get more than a couple hours on a full charge using the fan at the Highest speed. I have used it on the battery power for multiple hours several times with the unit showing no signs of slowing down. As you can probably tell from this review I am a fan of this handy little fan.
4,Great little fan.  Very powerful and compact.
4,Works good  powerful for its size.
5,Great little personal fan.  Easily powered by the included USB cable.For some reason even when connected via USB 3.0 the battery still drains a little when on the high setting.  Turning it off while not at the computer solves this after a few minutes (depending on how long you're using it) and the battery is fully charged.  Doesn't happen on low/medium settings.If you're expecting a Vornado you're not going to get it.  This is a small personal fan.  At medium setting around 18 inches away it's a nice relief and keeps me cool with ambient temps around 80f.  At high it's a bit much for the eyes (if pointing toward your face) but you can position it however you want so you can angle it to be comfortable at high.Overall with the discount available well worth it.  Will be using it throughout the summer when at my computer (turning it off while away for the battery).4.5 / 5.0
4,It runs on a battery (that is included) and USB It's quiet at full speed and has a good air flow.
4,It's a great little fan. Works quite well.
4,Seems to work great!!
4,A nice personal fan
5,This fan is awesome! Surprisingly powerful for how small & compact it is. And for a "trinket-sized" unit it's not cheap-feeling at all. In fact it looks & feels very nice. The 18650 battery that comes with it adds just enough weight to it and gives it just the right amount of heft. This may also contribute to the fact that it stays put on my desk while running. It has three speeds which increase as you press the "On" button. After you pass the 3rd speed the fan turns off and powers an LED light on the side of the unit. It's quite bright! Obviously intended for use as a flashlight. I wasn't expecting that added feature. The fan comes with a micro USB cable for charging (micro USB port on the back of the unit). I cannot comment on battery life. I leave mine plugged in all the time and only unplug it sometimes when the fan is needed elsewhere (where a USB charging port is not present). With an 18650 battery I'd expect a run-time of at least a couple hours depending on the speed setting.I highly recommend this fan for those considering it. This was a great purchase and I'm glad I took a chance on it. This little fan makes a huge difference in keeping me cool during these hot summer days in the north-east!
4,Nice desk fan!
4,Works good
3,Update:  efluky emailed me promptly after my review and offered to send me a new one.  WHICH WAS AWESOME!But  I'm okay not asking for a new one b/c after I had it running on low w/the red light on I happened to jiggle the cord at the computer and noticed the charge light came on.  I had to prop up the cord with a nail clipper (McGuyver style) and it charged.  So far I cannot tell you how long the charge lasts but it works ok.**********Purchased as a lightning deal.  SO FAR it is attached to the USB cable turned on low with red light on. (Each low med high will light up).I cannot tell if it is charging?  When I first plugged the cord into the fan the "charging" light flashed quickly and then nothing.  So I couldn't tell if it was charging.  I turned it on low and the low button has a solid red light.  I am waiting to see if having it on while attached to the USB cord will charge it.I purchased it to be used with the lithium battery not attached to the cord.  Oh there were no directions about which way to place the battery I guessed.  I did flip it to see if that made a difference - it did it just didn't work at all.Other than that it's a cute little fan.  I really want it to work as it is supposed to work.
4,Nice
4,Haven't used much but so far works great.
4,Blows really well and quite to sleep next to.
4,Very nifty and quite breezy portable fan.  No complaints since it works very well!
5,It small and compact. Very easy to operate. It has your choice of 3 speeds . It also has a little flashlight on the side.It came with a battery pack. There’s a USB charging port and a charging cable.I honestly didn’t think it would put out that much air. However it does produce a good bit of air. Definitely worth the money!
5,I bought the eFluky fan to use for a summer camping trip. As advertised the little fan has impressive airflow for it's size. On low and without any of the lights on the battery lasts probably 8 hours max. I can't remember if it lasted 6 or 8 hours for me but that's likely the range.The blue internal LED lights shine pretty bright through the white fan casing. If you have kids they'll probably like it as a bright night light in a tent.The flashlight works fine but I'm not sure how useful it would be. In the tent in 80 degree weather it did ok but I'd recommend a much bigger fan. At night when it's in the 70s or lower it's fine.Overall I'd recommend this fan. If you're just using it for camping or as a personal fan at your desk it's great. For emergencies it's not exactly the best choice because the battery won't last all night and you wouldn't be able to recharge it if the power is out but it is better than not having any battery operated fan at all.
5,This little fan is great. It has 3 speeds and is very powerful for being so little. It uses a lithium battery that comes already charged. No cords to have to deal with it recharges with a USB cord. It is so light weight and versatile. It makes it convenient to take anywhere. It also has a beautiful blue LED light that you can choose to turn on as well. I at first couldn't figure it out but then I read on some other reviews that all you have to do is hold down the on button while it is on any speed and low and behold it does work. You can also choose to hit the on button 3 times and instead of the fan you can use it as a flashlight. A little white light will turn on in the bottom right hand corner. Now it is not a blinding light by any means but will work in a pinch until you can get to a proper light. The only negative that I can say about this fan is that I wish that you could tilt it up or down but other than that it is a great fan that I absolutely love!I received this product free or at a reduced price in return for my honest and unbiased review. This in no way impacts the review I left it is based solely on my opinion and experience with the product.
4,a lot of power for such a small fan.
5,I truly didn't expect much from this fan and mostly bought it because it was a lightning deaI.  I had already ordered another battery powered fan to take on a camp out but when this fan came up at a good price I said why not.As soon as I put a battery in and turned it on I was super impressed!  Even on low you can feel the breeze from 3-4' away easily.  On medium it's a good strong breeze out to 5-6' and high is even better.I used a 3000Mah 18650 I had already in this fan for testing and it ran for about 4-5 hours at medium speed.  Since it also has a micro USB charge port you could easily plug it in an external battery pack for even longer run time.  I'd estimate that a 12000Mah pack and the internal battery would run it at medium for 10-12 hours at least.  I'll have to do some test and update this if I have time before I leave for camp.

5,This little fan actually makes me cold! I love it! It's only 6 inches high and I do not mind that it does not tilt because It puts out a fairly large breeze surounding my whole area anyway. It works very well  dispersing the air flow. Some suggested usage other than your work desk..  Hot feet.. put under desk Night sweats... nightstand.  Pets and babies in a hot room... perfect size. Work shop table.. etc.  It is very versatile and it works very very good. Made in China of course but so does just about everything else we buy. Would make a great promotional gift item for any business to distribute also.. Im sure I'll get my $10 - $14 dollars worth out of this even if it last a year.  If it dies in the next month I will update.
5,We have a tempature problem in my office too hot or too cold and we don’t have a thermostat. And on top of that of course no one can agree what is just right. This fan is so awesome! It works great fits perfectly in my small desk space and doesn’t effect my coworkers! It’s powerful for a small fan. The light is cool too. Plus if I need to use my USB port for something else this fan has a battery and can keep going! I love it! Some of my coworkers were thinking of getting their own too! Plus because it’s usb we are not violating osha guidelines about all devices needing a 3 prong plug.
5,I bought this with low expectations. It was inexpensive enough to try. I'm glad I did. It moves a lot of air while using very little power. A USB cord is included to plug in and charge like your cellphone. It also has a battery that can be removed and charged on it's own. The 18650 battery is one I'd not heard of until 2 or 3 years ago. Now we have at least 5 things that use them. I bought extra batteries and chargers for under 10 dollars a while ago. This is a great little fan for the money. Make no mistake it is small. But small and mighty. I'm leaving a review because I'm ordering one for my sister today. I know she'll love it.
3,It's unclear if the electronics in the fan prevents overcharge and overdischarge and manufacturer/seller hasn't come out to say whether it does or not.  I thought it would be a good idea to use a protected 18650 cell but the clearance in the battery compartment does not fit protected batteries.  If only they made the battery compartment 1 mm longer it'd fit.
5,The air that this little fan puts out makes it feel like it's a mini air conditioner instead of a mini fan.
5,I travel all over the world as a professional underwater photographer.  It's a problem when I am on a plane or hotel room and it is too hot.  For the past 25 years I've carried around in my check-in luggage a portable fan for such situations.  The old fan was a pain however to power.  This Eflucky USB fan is the answer to my dreams!  It is light and it has an internal battery that lets it run for hours.  I can power it off a USB power pack by itself off my computer and the list goes on.  I just came back home from Africa and used this on a bed inside mosquito netting to help me get to sleep on hot nights.  Normally trying to get to sleep under mosquito netting was a huge problem.  I used this on the flight home when the airplane got too hot also -- perfect!  This thing is awesome.  Get one if you are a "hot" person!
5,I ordered 2 of these little fans. I have not any problems with woth either of my fans.I use them at work where we are restricted by what products are plugged into outlets. this fan is UBS and battery powered eliminating the concern with the outlet.pros: feels like a mini a/c unit  ability to move ot around effortlesslycons: the fan area is not able to move up or down  ( I knew this before I purchased the fan)all in all a nice fan for my desk at work and at home.
5,I had low expectations for this fan but I went ahead and purchased 2 of them before the incoming hurricane. I wanted something that was lightweight but also gave me the ability to recharge it via an external battery pack just in case the power went out during the storm. Unfortunately the power did go out and this fan worked wonderfully! It did an amazing job of keeping me cool at night and actually made it through the entire night without stopping. I love this fan so much that I've already purchased 3 more and adding them to my hurricane preparation box. I've also already recommended this fan to other family members as well. If you need a personal fan that will keep you cool and allow for recharging this one is perfect. Highly recommended.
5,Great little fan with multiple speeds an off and an on button as well as a little light mode which makes it handy in a pinch. The lowest fan setting is powerful enough to move plenty of air inside a tent with no problem and runs quiet too. Comes with a good 18650 battery and will plug into a USB outlet to run either way. The base is flat and will stand it upright. For the folks who may wish to hang it in the tent or wherever you will need to simply string a thin wire or paracord type thin rope to loop it through the vent ribbing at the top and done - no biggy - you can even get creative and run the suspension positioning the fan to breeze in any direction you need or wish which is nice :)
5,Works great! Blows cool air!
5,This fan is awesome. My little guy runs got like me. Being in strollers and car seats can make it worse.  This fan makes it all better.1) Moves a good amount of air with really different speeds for when you need a little bit of air movement or a lot2) Lasts a really long time (18650 battery inside)3) The covers over the fan blades are such that curious little fingers do NOT get through4) If you hold the power on button it toggles a light on the blades themselves. Keeps tired little babies awake on the short drive home from grandparentsI have two. That's how much I like them.
5,Great fan with more power than you probably imagine. But I have a suggestion for people who will use it heavily or need extended run time. Get yourself a good Li-ion battery charger (preferably an analysing charger) and a Panasonic NCR18650B battery (or two). This will add almost an hour of runtime at high speed giving you a total of almost three hours (on high). Using a good charger (instead of the fan's charging circuit) will keep your batteries healthier improving their overall lifespan. And you will always know how much charge you have left.I also have the black fan with the white face. The "blue light" feature is not as good with the black one. The blue fan (actually more of a surf green) is more opaque letting nearly the whole fan body light up. Makes a great night light. (Pictures included.)
5,Nice little fan even at low speeds still has good air flow. The battery I received with it last a about 4 hours on low fully charged Nice that you can run from usb without battery when it dies permanently.  This would be a great fan for a summer school student in class or when you're just chillin at the pad on a hot day/night.  I've even used it pointed in the back of my desktop connected to the usb to help cool it down on a hot day(you know those little desktops don't have much air flow inside)  Cool blue light by holding down power button 2-3 seconds and also has a single led night light that turns on 4 presses of the power button. Just one very little issue I have with it but still giving it 5 stars is the base depth is a little short and can easily tip so you need to have it on a flat even surface  I recommend this fan.
5,Its a really good small fan to put on you’re desk 10/10
5,I have to say that buying the Eflucky Mini fan is one of very BEST purchases that I've made on Amazon (since I became an Amazon Prime Member in 2009!).  This mini fan has great power it's a quite fan and the battery lasts for a good amount of time (much longer than I expected!).  One final comment.  Recently I took my son to a baseball game. The game started at 1:30 and it continued to get hotter and hotter as the day went on.  Lucky for the two of us I had my new Eflucky Mini fan and what a life saver it was for us (it was 92-97 degrees that day).  It's amazing how powerful this mini fan is and let's just say that "I'm certain many people were extremely jealous and I'm certain I did a lot of promoting for the Eflucky folks!" It looks like they should have some new customers of this MIGHTY FAN!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product(!!) and thank you for a wonderful product!
5,I love this little fan! It may be small but it is quite powerful!  I use it on the lowest setting and the cool air is plenty for me. The light is just fun and pretty looking -- my grandson really liked turning the light on while using the fan. The little flashlight is a nice helpful touch too. I've used this fan in several rooms and on the porch and love it! It seems to hold the battery charge well and easily charges too. When I first got the fan and tried to charge the battery it did seem to take a long time but did finally fully charge. I haven't had any problems with it since then. It's a great little fan!
5,It's a cool small little fan but don't let the small size fool you. It puts out a lot of air way more than what I was expecting which it a plus. Simple 2 button operation and the on button lets you cycle through the 3 fan speeds and a white led light on the side. It looks really cool when you turn on the blue led lights for the fan blades. It's a great value cause it comes with a Rechargeable flat top 18650 battery and micro usb cable for charging. Love that it works with flat top 18650 batteries cause I got tons of them from old laptops. I can also use it to charge all my 18650's. Can't wait to use it when I go camping I know everyone is going to want to use it especially at night. I took a few pictures to show how compact it is and how cool the LEDs are.
5,Update - eflukey contacted me re the issue and offered a credit to allow for ordering a replacement battery. Great customer service in fixing this problem.  Up back to 5 stars as the fan is great and efluky is too.Boughtgust 2016 and have used it on and off to circulate air when I soldering and gluing on the work bench to get the smoke and fumes away. Worked well enough until yesterday when I went to use it and it was dead. Charged for 24 hr now and nothing. Checked the battery with a volt meter and getting 1.6v. Looks to be a bad battery. Fan still puts out 4.1v when plugged in so looks like the unit and charger is OK. Too bad as the fan is great but a failed battery makes it tough to give much more than a three stars five the cost of replacing it.
5,This fan moves an incredible amount of air for its size.I'm a computer consultant that often finds myself troubleshooting hardware in non-airconditioned areas that often feel like a sauna. This fan had been a life saver.This fan not too bulky and fits nicely in my laptop bag. Doesn't take up much room and has a pretty decent battery life. The micro-usb power/charge feature is super convenient.I can't speak to the usefulness of the incorporated light though in a pinch I suppose it could be useful.The only complaint I have is that it's a bit on the noisey side once you pass the first speed level. Although in all fairness this is to be expected with a fan this compact and isn't a deal breaker at least for me.
5,This mini USB fan is awesome! I always get hot everywhere I go so I thought this would help. I am more than happy with the little fan.There are three speeds which go from a cool breeze to a quite powerful wind. I was surprised by how strong this fan can be on the highest speed. It also has a built in white led on the side as well as blue led lights shinning on the fans themselves(It can be turned on and off by holding the on button for a few seconds). As for sounds it isn't that noticeable. If you are on the highest setting it will have some noise but nothing like a larger fan.  It last the advertised 8 hours on the low settings with just using the battery but you can also plug it in through its USB connection.I would highly recommend this fan to anyone needing an easy portable fan or just an at home fan that doesn't take up space.
5,This is my second order.  Love the size.  Very convenient to stick it my purse or beach bag.  I  brought it with me on many trips from Disney parks to the cruise to Cuba.  It's very easy to recharge runs very quiet and blows a lot of air to keep you cool.  It's not very well made but with this price why not get one.  Plus it came with a rechargeable battery.  After a full charge it lasts so long.Cons: The on/off buttons are very easy to get pushed when I put it in the bag.  Many times i noticed that it was running in my bag but at least i can feel it to know to turn it off.  Never regret buying this product!
5,This little thing is amazing!  I'm a floor nurse and sometimes it gets hot doing my work so when I get back to my desk this little thing is a gem to have.  It has 3 speeds.  I mainly used it with the USB port on my computer.  So glad I bought this.
5,I’m always running warm and naturally a sweaty guy. I bought this to replace the p.o.s. fan I bought off amazon for my desk at work a few months back that stopped working...gotta say one of my better impulse buys. This fan was cheaper quieter and is way more powerful than the one it replaced(even when the p.o.s was brand new) and is portable...it’s the creme de la creme of mini fans imo. Great for a quick cool down after getting all sweaty while being out in the heat and humidity.
5,Brought for a Vacation to Vietnam.  WOW best for Summer.  Must buy this item!! help a lot when summer.
5,I was originally skeptical with a battery powered fan but when I started using it on a regular basis  it kept me comfortable indoors without using the AC as much as I would usually. It is quite powerful for it's size and lasts for a while. When the battery is low it will shut off randomly but I can just recharge it at that point or plug it in to my external battery pack .
5,Compact. Light weight. Stable (I'm on the laptop and it's sitting/standing on the sofa cushion next to me) Easy Peasy - took right from box inserted rechargeable battery plug into my usb port and cool air was coming my way.  You do have to (1) turn on (2) hold ON button to activate the Blue Light feature.  Can't speak to life battery or durability (yet) - I'll wait for this to go on sale again.... the grandkids are already eyeballing this sweet fan....
5,Nice for the size does give air.
5,We have 3 of these fans!  I LOVE THEM!  Went to a couple of graduations this spring and while everyone else around me was sweating bullets I just smiled and pulled this little jewel out of my purse and I was envied by all!  Everyone wanted to know where to get one! Lol!  And let me tell you this little gem can really blow!  The fact that it's rechargeable is a SUPER DUPER PLUS!  It's already a very decent price but the fact that it is rechargeable and you spend no extra $$ on batteries is A~MAZING!  GET ONE! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
5,Works great! It’s small lightweight super quiet and easily portable.  I take it to my son’s soccer games to help me not melt when sitting in the AZ summer sun watching his games.  It blows air REALLY well for its size and holds a charge for a long time. I like how there’s no cords involved!  Easy to use with just 2 buttons: off and on. Then each time you push ‘on’ it circulates thru speed settings.
5,I saw this fan mentioned on a camping blog . Glad I bought it! Im using it on the nightstand in my bedroom right now but plan on packing it up with the camping gear and taking it with me on the road next time we head out. Love that it’s rechargeable and portable. Perfect!
5,This portable fan has some serious power to it. I was showing my husband the fan and  had it set to the highest speed and his first response was that the fan had some wind power to it. The rechargeable battery gave me a little trouble when I first opened it. The fan was saying that it was fully charged but was not operating when it was not plugged into the portable USB charger. Luckily it was just a case of the battery not sitting in the slot properly so after some finagling the fan turned on. Other than having to make sure that the battery is seated just right I was very pleased with the portable fan. It has clear controls with red light meaning it is charging and green meaning it is fully charged. There is a clear on/off button and three clear levels of speed. There is also a light on the fan making it perfect for camping or late night sports games. product was purchased for the intent of review.
5,This little fan is AMAZING! I simply can't believe the amount of air it puts out. It is small enough to fit in my luggage and when we traveled our hotel suite was hot in one room and cold in another. I had the hot room and this little fan absolutely saved the day. The light on the end is nice but unnecessary imo. But oh this fan! I'll be getting another one so I can have one by my bedside (hello hot flashes during the night!) and one in my home office. I'm very glad I gambled on this device. Incredible.
3,I purchased the fan in June of 2018. I used it for camping and sparingly for white noise. Works as described with somewhat decent battery life but suddenly stopped working after 6 months. Pretty odd considering the minimal usage and direct charge via lithium ion battery charger.
5,I love this fan.  I have it on my bed stand ready to use for hot flashes. I brought it with me to watch my son practice. One charge lasted me an afternoon. It can charge on portable chargers.  I can put on a stand. I can hold it and carry it. Small enough to fit my purse. I’ve had it for two weeks. I hope it stays sturdy and durable.
5,Very useful quiet little fan. The first charge takes a few hours but the fan lasts a very long time. So far I've used this fan for cooling off in small rooms on the go in the car while cooking and cooling down my wireless modem because it doesn't have an internal fan causing it to over heat and constantly reboot. I'm positive there are other uses though.
5,I like the efluky mini fan for several reasons: recharging fan portable small. I take this fan to my daughter’s football games and I feel great! If it had a string or a handle of some kind I would love it even more. It definitely packs a lot of power in a tiny fan. At full charge and using it for the whole game...3-4 hours high in Florida heat!
5,I recently charged up this little fan and was pleasantly surprised. I needed a fan for my desk at work because I tend to be much hotter than those around me. I didn't have an available power source and thought this would perfect. I do not know how long it will keep a charge while in use or even how long it stays charged while off. However as of now I am very happy and satisfied with this purchase. It has three speed settings with the third being quit powerful for such a small unit. It takes up very little room lightweight and portable! You can't go wrong with this choice.
5,Picked this fan up on Prime Day for my desk at work. I've been using it about a week now. It's been plugged in a USB port since I took it out of the box. It moves a lot of air and does so quietly on low speed - big plus in the office since our office is very open. I doubt i'd ever run it on high (or even medium) in the office. The built in flashlight and the blue LED are nice touches but neither are features I "need" per se. The fact that it runs off USB and has a rechargeable battery are two big pluses for me as cubicle wiring is notorious for being less than stellar and as such we are not allowed to plug in fans or space heaters unless we are near a wall outlet (not a cube outlet).
5,I am a writer that lives in Florida who loves to work outside. This little fan is perfect!For those days when the sun is intense and there is no breeze coming off the water it keeps me cool enough to focus on my work.Love that it has different speeds and the recharging feature is an added bonus. Great product.
5,I just got and love this little guy.  Great desk-fan at work for when the hvac isn't behaving.  Runs on USB only (no battery).  Low/Med/High and "small light" on.  The light does not come on when the fan is on.The two round buttons are off and on and on cycles through low/med/high/mini light.  The mini light is at the bottom right.  If you look at the picture you can see a tiny little bump on the lower right side.  That is the light.Very happy with the sound and air it moves for being such a little fello.No idea about longevity.Note the switch is electrical not mechanical.  That means if the unit loses power it will reset to the off position.
5,Even though it is small it has a 3-stage speed control and it's really convenient because it has a button to turn off the power. There is also a small LED on the side. Best of all they use rechargeable batteries instead of disposable batteries. I put this fan in my car and I use it to circulate air conditioning air quickly to the back. I highly recommend it.
5,I love this fan!  The new treadmills at the gym do not include a fan. This cuts my endurance. I noticed that the treadmill does have a USB port so I purchased this fan. It works great and keeps me cooled enough to "go for it". I haven't even tried the rechargeable battery yet but that is a very nice bonus. As is the LED light.
5,This is an excellent little fan! I  highly recommend it for desktop personal use. My only issue is that it doesn't stay on for long when you use the highest setting on battery use. That's really not an issue for me because I always keep it plugged into a power bank or AC outlet.
5,This fan is so awesome! I carry it to church & bible study too. The motor is super quiet. More than 5 of my friends have purchased this fan. I have hot flashes and this fan kicks their butt! Oh yeah I have 2 so when one is charging I can always have one!!
5,I love this fan! It can be used wireless so it's so convenient. This summer I have used it for baby in carseat while in the car in the kitchen while i'm cooking and I need to cool down my face on the desktop desk and when i'm tending to my balcony plants. I originally bought this fan for travelling to Malaysia in 3 weeks i know Malaysia's weather is so hot and baby is still not used to heat as she can easily get heat rash.This fan has flashlight! and then the speed is awesome no complain whatsoever. not noisy and it actually emits cool air.my only wish is it has a way to hold as I have a small hand and pretty hard to hold it for long time. i plan to attach command hook or something.
3,This little (6' tall) moves a lot of air for its size but it is a bit loud for an office desktop environment. Even at its lowest setting you get a nice breeze (which is quite cool)...I actually wish there was an even lower setting so that I could get a truly gentle breeze which might also make it a bit quieter. At this low setting it also produces a significant hum. None of my neighbors have complained but it is loud enough that I have to turn it off when I get a phone call (unless wearing a headset). At the two higher settings it moves a lot of air but the noise level becomes ridiculous...basically a high pitched roar. So if you don't mind a bit of white noise and a stiff breeze instead of a gentle waft of air this is the fan for you...if you want something to just move a little air and be thoroughly unobtrusive look elsewhere.
5,My first fan had an issue with the power insert.  Basically the power insert was pushed into the fan over time by the USB cord.  This is probably an isolated issue since the reviews for this fan are very good.  I wrote a review about the fan and my experience with the power insert.  Efluky contacted me and offered to replace the fan free of charge.  I'm impressed with the company for the follow-up and have updated the review based on their customer service.  I also like the fan very much.  It barely weighs anything and has three fan settings.  The highest fan setting is perfect for one of those hot days in the office.  Overall I'm very satisfied!
5,OK I bought this on a lark because of an email with a big discount. When I saw it came with an 18650 Lithium Ion battery I couldn't resist. If you went into a store to buy one of those batteries it would cost more than I paid for this fan. So I figured if the fan was junk I got my monies worth on the battery alone.But the fan is good. We live in Las Vegas and in case no one has told you it gets hot here in the summer. I particularly like it comes with a micro USB cord that plugs into my computers and it is amazing how much more comfortable you are with a gentle breeze blowing on you when you work.It is reasonably quiet and powerful.
5,I got this because of all the good reviews. I didnt expect it to be so small. At first I thought that it probably wouldn't work well because of its size. Boy was I wrong. On low it gives a nice gentle breeze with a soft hum. Perfect for my desk. The other two speeds are a bit too loud for me.  All in all I really like this fan.
5,Small and powerful with three speeds and a light too. What I like is that I can take the 18650 battery out and juice it up fully in my charger rather than using the USB cable. I use it while lounging around the pool area in the bathroom while cooking and next to the bed.For this price and quality will get more since hurricane season is upon us and we lost power for several hours last year.I had no battery fan then...lesson learned.Update: 9/14/17 Power was off for 12 hours during Hurricane Irma. This little fan was such a lifesaver.
5,Needed something small very portable (carry on a bike) but "significant" for camping in summer during heat spell. This worked great - 3 speeds!  Ahhhhh!Stored carefully but by the beginning of Summer 2019 battery would no longer hold a charge and it does not appear to be a usual/replacable battery. (Works if plugged in).
5,Bought this last year before winter and had it stored all this time. I had the battery out. Brought it out put the battery in and it goes strong! It gives a very strong wind current. Funny enough it blows a lot more when unplugged I suppose that is due to it charging the battery when plugged in. I plan to be using this all summer long.One tiny thing really wish it had something (like a stand) to angle it so that you could set it to direct air upwards or downwards at angles. That would make this perfect. Can't complain however. Looking to buy another few as gifts.
5,I love these little fans! I bought one just like this a couple of years ago and have gotten a ton of use out of it. It's still working but the casing is starting to break in places after dropping it on my hard floor numerous times. So I got a new one for when my old one is finally usable no more.They blow a surprising amount of air and having the rechargeable battery has saved me some money too. As someone that gets hot really easily this is probably one of my favorite products and I take it with me almost everywhere.
5,We took this fan to Italy with us to place on the nightstand by our bed to cool us during the night. Italian air conditioning leaves something to be desired. It worked great. I used it on the low setting and the battery lasted all night. It takes a while to charge but fully charged lasts a long time.
5,I love these little things ordered the first about 18 months ago.  Have one on my desk at the office with the battery removed and powered by the USB on my PC.  Ordered two more for the kids to use while camping the fight over them when we dine outdoors on the desk at home so will order enough to satisfy the demand.
5,Great little portable fan for a great price! I bought it just as an afterthought when placing an order preparing for Hurricane Irma. I'm glad I did! I ended up making a little "redneck" a/c unit (Styrofoam cooler 2 holes and ice) that a friend ended up using to cool her dogs when her power was out for the week (I did not lose power luckily). Worked perfectly! Only issue we had with it is that the cool blue light came on once but never again. Doesn't affect the performance of the fan so it's no big deal.
3,I really like this little fan it's been a life saver at work this summer. I'm docking a couple stars because the battery doesn't hold much of a charge unfortunately even after charging overnight it shuts down after a minute or so after when the cable is not plugged in
5,I like to sleep with a fan at night. this little fan is just right. I took it on a cruise and when they x-rayed my luggage and saw a fan they were going to confiscate it but when they saw it was battery operated they let me take it on the ship. Sigh of relief!
5,I just got this and I am pleased at how well I works.  It didn't seem to take too long to charge and I'm planning to use it in places where plugging in a fan would be either inconvenient or impossible.  The light will be nice outside at night but otherwise I probably won't have much use for it.  I may be coming back for a 2nd one I'll see how much I am using it once it gets hotter outside and I will downgrade my review if it does not live up to it's initial promise.
5,Was looking for a little fan to gently blow air around my plants and was pleasantly surprised to find out this fan packs a punch! Three speeds rechargeable battery & usb cord. What a great little deal! I plan to get at least one more! Lowest speed is gentle but strong enough to feel air blowing and the highest really can blow! You wont be sorry purchasing this!
5,Fantastic product! The fan is very powerful... you can actually feel the strong breeze from it! I under estimated it’s power when I ordered it thinking it’s just a small fan. However the wind is strong compared to its size and it has a stable base runs on rechargeable battery( included) and also on usb power and the led light inside and flash light outside is a good bonus. Overall very satisfied with the purchase.
5,I just wanted something compact for our cruise but this little thing really does blow hard. It has 3 speed settings and setting 1 is crazy strong as it is.Comes with a battery pack and batteries and a USB cord (no wall plug). Has a little light on the side too that’s pretty bright.I am really shocked at how strong this is. I’m waiting on a flash sale to buy another.
5,This fan is outstanding. When it is running on battery it's a real dynamo. The fan actually generates enough force that it moves on smooth surfaces over time. The battery life could be longer for my tastes but it's impressive that it lasts as long as it does given the displacement of air involved. The LED lighting feature is a cute gimmick. When the fan is connected to USB power the fan speed decreases considerably but is still quite adequate. I bought this fan only because I couldn't find the type of USB model that I wanted. I'm glad it happened because this fan is more versatile than a simple USB connected version ever would be. I strongly recommend this fan.
5,Excellent little fan I ordered during hurricane season in Florida. When our power went out last year we used these fans and they kept us cool. Don't let the size fool you! The batteries lasted through the night and we used portable battery chargers to charge them the next day. The only thing it lacks is the ability to move/position the fan. I would highly recommend.
5,This little fan is amazing! I bought it for travel because I’m going through the stage of life where I experience hot flashes and night sweats and hotel AC is never cool enough. It’s quiet enough to sleep through and cools me down quickly.
5,I love this fan. The air movement is excellent and the battery life is great. My wife loves the pretty color if the blue one. This is the second fast if this brand I've purchased and have owned the first one over a year. It has held up well and is a must have for summer camping trips.
5,I bought this fan for work and it is great.  It provides plenty of air flow and I don't even use the highest setting.  I love that it plugs right into my computer.  It sits flat quite easily and is very lightweight.  It's exactly what I was looking for and I am loving it.
5,This is a great fan to have. It’s got 3-speeds to choose from and the battery lasts several hours on a full charge. The only thing that would make this fan perfect is if it had a base that could tilt towards your face but it doesn’t.  I still love it and use it frequently when relaxing outdoors
5,Perfect for my office desk. Plugs into my computer and hardly makes a sound even on high. I use all three settings depending on how hot I get during the day! It lasted a full day on its batteries but I usually keep it plugged into the usb port. I love this little fan!!
5,I LOVE this fan.  It puts out 3 speeds of strong cool air.  I’ve used it by my bedside. My husband uses it when he travels.  It will come in handy if the power goes out.  I enjoy the handy flashlight and extreme portability of this fan.  This item exceeded my expectations.  Please buy this fan and you’ll be glad you did!
5,I opened the box plugged in the cord attached the USB cord to the fan waited for 2 hours then turned it on.  It worked perfectly!  I love it.  It’s runs stronger then I thought it would.  Will definitely recommend this item to all my friends!
3,If your getting this for camping it’s too small doesn’t push the air Around a tent that good.This fan would be better in a small indoor space
5,I love this little fan! Perfect for my desktop on hot summer days. The fan is just as described (blue LED light 3 different speed settings a white LED light towards the side and on/off buttons). My only wish is to add a rotating function so I could move the fan up a bit so that the wind hits my face without me having to lean it on something.  But for the price and size this fan packs a lot of punch.
5,Used this fan in my bathroom because it doesn't get very good AC like the rest of the house and has a bunch of lights so I'm constantly sweating trying to get ready and put on my makeup!! 😓 My hair's frizzy and my makeup is a mess in the summer time!😡😤😂 I stick this thing right towards my face when I get ready now.. So much better!🙌🏻
5,Perfect little fan for my needs. I use it at my table when doing my hair and makeup after drying my hair for 10 mins (I have super thick hair) I usually end up sweating half my makeup off. This little thing is pretty powerful for the size!
5,Not sure why some folks are saying this fan isn't powerful enough.  But I have this in my truck and use it on the dashboard when I have to sit in my vehicle and don't want to run the air conditioning.  For a personal fan it works fine but its not going to cool off a room.  Its extra small and I can't be happier.  If you need a small personal fan to be used away from you home like in a hotel room camping or in your vehicle......buy this!  Oh and yes its cheaply made but it works just fine and exceeded my expectations.
5,These things are amazing! I have bought at least 8 for friends and family. Everyone loves them. Women love them especially if they are having a hot flash. Don't know what that's all about but they love their little powerful fan! Be nice guys!
5,This can is a total lifesaver at work!! I work in a high school cafeteria and don't have a place to plug in a fan near my cash register....this little fan is amazing!! It is much more powerful than I ever would have guessed a small rechargeable fan would have been. My co-workers were even shocked by how well this works!! I've been using it for a few weeks now and it charges up pretty quick can be used while charging and holds its charge as stated!! Would definitely recommend it to anyone that it is need of a portable cord-free fan!! Would be great for camping or a outdoor concert etc ...too!!!
5,Grabbed a few of these for the kids. They love that they have flashlights built in. They take them camping have them in bed for reading and in the car. Love the fan lasts all night on low.
5,FANtastic and Cool!! This fan is as advertised. Very quiet and effective. Appears to be very well made. I like it so much that I am considering them as gifts to friends and family. I am as excited as one can get over a fan.
5,This is a great fan for travel.  It charges the battery through a USB cord.  This was helpful in the hotel I just stayed in recently because it had a USB port next to the bed.  It is small and light weight and fits easily in my carry on bag.
5,This little guy is great for your desk. I keep it plugged into my computer on my desk and it really does cool you down. I have not needed to go beyond #1 of 3 and it really cools you off. Can’t speak for battery life but plugged in this thing rocks.
3,Worked great for about 6 months then quit working altogether.
5,Took this on vacation and it worked great. Much better airflow than the smaller personal fans that I have tried plus it doesn't fall over when you put it on the nightstand. The little light came in handy during the night.
5,This fan puts out quite a bit of air to be so small.  I purchased it to put inside our storm shelter with a couple others I already had.  I love the fact that it is rechargeable a real plus so you don't have to purchase batteries.
3,Battery didnt last as long as I would've liked and does not flex. Maybe good for handheld fan but too big for that.
5,Love our little fan!  Bought it to use for a upcoming cruise so haven't gotten to use it a lot yet but when I have it's worked great!  And it has a little LED light to use if needed.  Worth the $$
5,I like that it is rechargeable small portable and moves a decent amount of air.  On a very hot day I used it to increase airflow into a duck house.  It really cooled things down in there.  The small size makes it very convienient to use anywhere.  The blue light that turns on with a long hold on ON button is a bonus.  Like it!  No complaints.
5,Fan is small powerful awesome and I love the blue light!!  What a bonus!
5,These little fans are great!  The fan is fairly quiet but the amount of air pushed even on the low setting is impressive.  The LED light is too weak to use for anything.  Also the case is lightweight so the fan will "walk" a bit when on.  But that's easily fixed with some sntislip tape on the bottom.  Overall I am very happy with the performance of the fan. I would buy again.
5,I love this fan. I use it when I am putting on make up with hot rollers in my hair to stay cool. It is very quiet as well.
5,Great for taking on trips to grandmas where she keeps it 90 inside.  Will also run just off usb without the battery installed so you can use it while charging on a separate charger if you want.
5,I use this for my infant at the pool. It sits with her in her pack and play. The only issue I had that the battery does NOT last long when on high. It has a great output though
5,This fan is perfect and does exactly what it says it does. I bought this for use when applying skincare products makeup and styling my hair. I can quickly dry products on my skin and cool off when styling my hair. It has 3 speeds which makes it even more convenient. The charge seems to hold well as I have not had to recharge yet however I am only using it in short spurts. I would definitely recommend this purchase. It is great especially for the price.
3,It does a decent job. However consider that there is zero adjustment on direction. So it will not tilt. If you put something under it to tilt it it will fall over. Basically if you want it to blow in your face it needs to be on a platform level with your face (i.e. probably not your desk).
5,Got this for my office didn't want a big fan. This little fan is awesome! has 3 speeds and it works great. Great size for a small area. I let my mother use it by her bed and she loves it too.....gotta get another one;)
5,Great little fan! We use them around the house when washing dishes working at the computer as well as on camping trips. They’re light versatile and just handy to have around
5,In the past I would bring out the large box fan to keep me cool on a hot night. With this fan it is so useful at night as a personal fan without being overwhelming. I like the ability to have a cordless fan on my nightstand just right.
5,You cannot go wrong buying this fan.  I have greatly enjoyed using mine and I'm surprised at how long the battery lasts even with 4 grandkids fighting over it.  Those grandkids are also cub scouts and girl scouts and this is going with them again this weekend for another camping trip.  Perfect size and weight to carry in a daypack and I didn't know until I bought it that it also has a tiny flashlight too.  It was more than I usually pay for a portable fan (even with it on on a lightning deal) but I have NOT regretted buying this fan at all.
5,first one i bought lasted for months until the battery started giving out and so i was bummed as i really liked the fan so i just used it via USB charger.  But later on the micro-USB port gave out too so i contacted the vendor and they took care of it.  Went and bought a second one when as backup when it was on sale again. Thanks!
5,Amazing fan!  I bought it because it's so hot out and it's great for use while waiting in subway stations and on the train.  It is very powerful at the max setting.  It has a cool blue led light that you can activate to use like a flashlight or it can illuminate the fan blades while the fan is on.  It's rechargeable (USB cord provided) and is a must for anyone who is always hot.
5,This puts out a lot of air for its' size.  Its very quiet and the price was right.  I will use this.  Got one for my daughter.  She camps a lot and this is perfect.
5,Love this fan I always travel with my own bed side fan and this is the most powerful one I have ever owned.  It won’t last the whole night on battery at high speed but love this fan
5,Great little fan. I have one at my desk at work and one for at home.  They are good to keep the baby cool in the stroller.  Zip ties hold it in.
5,So it works good but my blue led doesn't work... it never came on for me. Disappointed about that.Updated 6/27/2017:  they sent me a new one and it works perfect!  I didn't realize that you had to hold down the on button after it is on to activate the blue light.  The manual didn't state this.  Loved the fan!  It worked great! Great customer service as well!
5,Wow pleasantly surprised by this Fan.It is built very well.  How I can tell? When you turn it on the fan blades do not wobble and make a weird noises because it is not balanced.I know this because other USB Fans (3) that I have used did this.I like the Green light indicating when it is fully charged.The battery to make it portable is awesome!  It lasts for about 2 hrs on the lowest setting which is still plenty fast.In fact I would prefer an even lower and more silent setting.
5,This is great to keep by the bed to cool you off and also doubles as white noise.
5,Perfect mini fan and battery life. I was surprised at how strong this mini fan blew. All in all no flaws but i wished it had a tilting/adjustment feature.
5,Very powerful little fan in cute colors. The battery charges up fast so you can move it with you from room to room.  Of you have a big purse you can take it with you.
5,This is a powerful little fan.  I use it to quick set my makeup on the morning.  I love it 😍
3,It was an awesome small little 320mm fan until it randomly started rattling unless put at an angle. Now it's just annoying but at least it does its job.
5,This is a great little fan!  It’s very quiet and puts out a lot air. I have it on my nightstand and use it every night!  Worth every penny!
5,Love this fan! It's small but very powerful. Battery dies fast if you leave it running all day like I do. But charges fast.
5,Couldn't find my old review so posting a new one. After I had purchased this fan everything worked well except the battery. After leaving a review about this issue efluky contacted me and offered a partial refund for the defective battery. Wish big corporations had this level of customer service but overall very pleased how it turned out.
5,I use it at my office and the battery life is just as advertised. I use the #2 setting and charge it while I’m out of the office.
5,Much more powerful than I would have guessed.  Can be used to recharge other batteries.  It includes a small side mounted light.  Very portable and light.
5,Great to use for summer swim meets where there is no access to power and no breeze!!
5,This fan is just what I needed! I have hot flashes all day long and I can take this with me in my purse and use it at work and anywhere else I may need it . It is powerful for its small size and quiet.  The blue led light is really cool also!  Great buy for the $.
5,Love it.  It blows really strong and the fact that I don't have to keep it plugged in to use it is great.  Definitely recommend it!
5,Used it about 6 times had it for less than 2 months and now it is dead. Runs for about 10 seconds then dies. Does the same quick death whether or not it the micro-usb is plugged in. It was nice while it worked.EDIT: Originally gave it one star but promptly received email for Efluky customer service offering a free replacement for defective fan.
5,This is a great little portable fan. It’s a little smaller than I thought it would be but it is pretty powerful.
5,A very impressive little gadget that I use for my work desk. Don’t let the size fool you. This device is really powerful. And the battery life is pretty good.
5,I LOVE THIS LITTLE GADGET! Seriously don't think twice if you need a portable fan. Those $5 hand fans got nothing on this little bad boy! It has 3 speeds and you have the option of using the battery (it lasts forever--1 month of sporadic use still have yet to charge it) or take out the battery and plug it in via usb.Also it's a great fan if you use a desktop without the side door like mine since it can be powered via usb on the comp.
5,I love portability that I can carry this fan around.  There is a bonus LCD light on the right side.  I like it so far
5,I Love this little portable fan.  I can take it anywhere I go! It is so quiet and the lithium battery is fully rechargeble. I can take it when I travel back home and put it on my night stand at the hotel. I am always using my lap top so it is very easy to plug the fan into the computer.
5,Puts out a lot of powe. Battery lasts long. Would’ve been nice to have a charging cord come with it. Took me a while to find one that worked.
5,Love this fan. For a little fan it packs a lot a lot of breeze. Can carry it anywhere because of its compact size.
5,I really love this fan! It's so portable and very strong wind for it's size. When it uses the battery by itself I noticed that it's a lot stronger wind than when it's plugged in so that's pretty cool. It help me a lot to stay cool when the really bad heat wave in California hit a few weeks ago.
5,~~~UPDATE~~~: Efluky was nice enough to follow up on my review and send me another one out. So far so good with the new one! I appreciate their prompt reply and their understanding on the issue I had. Great company!Stop working only 6 months after opening. I didn't overcharge it or anything. Had it portable about 3 times and now it won't charge or turn on at all. Kinda bummed I got a bad one out of the many that people were raving about.
3,Product works great when plugged in but battery appears defective.  Charging light never changes whether I install or remove battery.  I think I will return it.
5,Nothing too special -- it just works as you would expected.
5,Love this fan!!! In fact I have now bought 3 of them. I have 2 at work and 1 at home and don't know what I ever did without them. More power in these little guys than you can imagine!
5,Great product has been a life saver for me.  In an office with constant temperature changes it keeps my area cool. Also takes up minimal space and is rechargeable via USB port.  I just hopes it lasts for a long time.  Great product small but powerful.
5,This little thing is great. Portable and can be used on the go plugs in via standard USB so can be used with my laptop on hot days. I've seen these used to dry makeup at the malls and overall a great buy for the price.
5,Bought this for work since it can get a little warm sometimes. It works fine. I have a USB converter plugged into an outlet at work in case I need to charge my phone so when I get too warm I plug this in and I am instantly cooled off. I have also used it with the battery and it goes for many hours on a full charge. I have also used it plugged into my computer and it works well that way also. My coworkers are jealous!
5,Use this for JAL airplane trips... small footprint solid airflow quiet & good battery.
5,Stronger air flow than I expected from a little USB fan.  And I can take it with me by using the portable rechargeable pack.
5,Blows lots of air ia very quiet and portable and can operate with battery.. This thing is awesome
5,This is a real kicker nice and small but boy does it kick out the cool air works great thinking I might get another one great price as well
5,Great little fan.  I bought it for my desk at work.  it works great and is quiet.  I chose it because if was battery powered and USB changed so I can Leave the plugged into my work computer over night and then move it to optimal location during the day and run it on Battery
5,Great little fan. It can be taken anywhere. I like the fact it is rechargeable. When on low and medium you can barely hear the fan.
5,Perfect for a desk - quiet and small enough to position where you need it!
5,We love this fan and we will buy more! So handy and works very well!!
5,Nice product definately worth the money....I primarily use it for camping it helps keep the flies away will eating
5,These fans are amazing.  My dad was in the hospital for about a month and he used to get these hot flashes and these fans came in handy.  They were running 24 hours a day continous and never had any issues.  Definitely recommend this fan.
5,Fantastic large easy rechargeable battery makes for long run time and it puts out an incredible amount of wind !  great for taking to outdoor concerts and the light helps in walking in the dark !!  glad I bought two !  SMALL BUT MIGHTY very quiet also and THREE SPEEDS !  WOW !
5,I bought this fan as a gift for my grandfather who's been having a hard time getting the AC to work in his car and truck he drives for work. Just testing it out it definitely has some power to it. It can be charged and came with a battery which was really nice. My grandfather even used it as a fan when he went to bed and worked nicely. He just has to buy velcro to be able to mount it on his dashboard.
5,VERY POWERFUL FOR ITS SIZE  CHARABLE BATTERY MAKES ABIG DIFFRENCE
5,Works better than expected.  A little smaller than I thought but perfect for my needs.
5,Saves me from the heat and has a pretty awesome battery life.
5,Lots of power with long battery life.
5,Liked it so much I bought a second one. Powerful little fan
3,I like the fan it works ok however the battery does not seem to last long.  I like to sleep with a fan on at night and took this with me on a business trip.  I hoped the fan would last the whole night but didn't without being plugged in and when plugged in it doesn't have as much power.
5,Great for camping
5,Great little fan that is really powerful for its size.
5,Works great. Very powerful for the size.  Just wish the battery lasted a full 8 hour day.
5,I use this all the time. Great breeze long battery life and quiet.
5,I bought this to take on a cruise with me. I haven't used it for an extended period of time yet but have tested it out and I am surprised how much air it puts out on high. I am happy with my purchase.
5,Great little fan. I share an office with 4 other people and use it on my desk at work.  I had to turn my previous fan on and off to hear my coworkers but not with this one. I also like that it doesn't take much room.
5,Works great. The replaceable battery makes it easy to keep it going
3,Lasted from August 2016 - July 2017
5,Works great.  Even at the lowest speed it pushes a decent amount of air.  Noise level is pretty low at the low speed as well and it seems to last quite a while on battery.  Only downside really is no tilt feature.
5,Mighty little fan.  Cools me off without blowing all the papers on my desk around. I really like this product.
5,perfectly little portable fan.  puts out a nice breeze
5,Great during a power outage. Very powerful for the size and the price is great.
5,Love all four of ours! USB charging is the best!
5,Good product for a casino!
5,I'm very impressed with this little fan (bought blue & black).  Took it out of the box put it to charge which fully charged in a little under an hour.  Quite powerful on high not too loud. Will serve their purpose walking around DC sitting in car lines and any other purpose a fan will prove useful! They have a little flashlight (tiny led) on the side.Great fan for the Amazon prime day price I paid.
5,Excellent product - particularly for the price.
5,Great little fan for my desk.
5,Excellent product and Extremely fast delivery
5,Nice little fan. Strong for its size. Battery seems to last a long time.
5,Last a long time on a single charge.
5,Great little fan for the price. Purchased for our recent cruise. Our 15 year old son used it at night on our trip and now is using in his bedroom. Would definitely purchase again.
5,More power than I expected. 3 speeds and a small light. USB recharger. One of my co-workers actually asked me where I got it from. They totally want their own. I work in a very quiet office so this mini-mighty fan does not disturb my "neighbor".
5,good
5,My home office is way in the back of the house and it can get stuffy during the hot and humid summer days.  This little fan works so well I wish I had bought it a year ago!  Just plug it into one of your computers USB ports let it charge and you are ready to go.  For such a small fan it really moves the air around. It has three settings to take care of just about any situation you need.
5,My grandson used this fan to stay cooler in the backseat of my car
5,This fan works very very well.  On the lowest speed it still moves plenty of air for me while not making much noise.  On battery at low speed it lasted at least 3 hours (I have not had a chance to run it longer).  I liked it enough that I ordered a second one.  The fan does not tilt which would be a nice feature to have.
5,Awesome little battery powered fans. They help make the heat bearable.
5,Love these little fans..powerful and cools well.
5,Have used during several camping trips.  Does not last through the night but when used with a USB charger -- look at https://smile.amazon.com/10000mAh-External-Carabiner-Emergency-Travel-Orange/dp/B01FWH0KQO/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1474540303&sr=8-4&keywords=usb+charger+10000 -- it works for more than one night.  Different settings allow you to use to move air inside the tent or just as white noise to cover the partying crew in the tent down the trail.  Bought as a Prime Day Deal and wish I had bought more to give as gifts!
5,Lasts through a baseball game. Just  enough to feel cooler. Battery charges last.
5,I like this little fan with the power of a big fan. Love it.
5,i wasn't expecting much airflow from a USB connected fan but it worked better than I expected it to.  It actually goes faster when on battery power.  I would recommend getting an extra 18650 battery to swap out.  Testing this on high speed it ran about 90 minutes.
5,Great product!
5,Great
5,What a well thought-out product!  It's even a flashlight!  Very well made and it pushes out a good amount of air. Being rechargeable makes it very portable and light weight. Yes I would recommend this to a friend.
5,Out door concert
5,Have a couple of 18650 batteries that I cannot use for high wattage vaping so I picked this fan.So far it did not disappoint especially in hot summer days while outside playing tennis. No I did not use it to keep the ball coming in my side of the court no only as a fan during breaks. Opponents suggested to rent it from me but I said 'NO' - get yours!
5,The fan works great. It's quiet and has a nice breeze. It also works wirelessly if charged up.
5,It is good for desk fan. I like this fan. Good working and good price.
3,It worked great the first day. The next day it wouldn't work on the highest setting or the flashlight when on battery only; it would just shut off. It works fine plugged in but is very glitchy (sometimes not even turning on) when on battery. Other than that it's a good size and puts out good wind but you get what you pay for as the saying goes.
5,This is the best little portable fan. It is solid no dancing across the table when on "high" setting. Pushes a fair amount of air for its size. Plugs into my phone charger cube.  Love it
5,It works great when its hot outside and you need some air inside the house near your computer.Downside if it's charged it will not work unless it's plugged in so what is the purpose?
5,Puts out a lot of air on high great personal fan.
5,I love my little fan I keep it on my night table so that it'll keep me cool during the night. Works good for people with breathing problems.
5,i'm still using this amazing fan as i type. almost one year later this tine cheap fan is going strong and powerful I have to use setting 1 or 2. # is too much wind
5,Great for social events very convenient.
5,I never imagined such a tiny fan could have such power! I used it on the low setting so that I could sleep when we lost power during hurricane Irma. A life saver! I never would have been able to sleep without it!
5,Good speed long charge
5,I love this fan. I have used this for several nights and it has worked flawlessly. I really like the battery power so I can take it camping etc. I can also run it off of an external battery pack if needed.
5,I seriously love this thing. Really. I thought it would be a piece of junk but figured it was worth the few bucks to try it out. I take this all over with me in the summer. Great fan speeds portability and battery life. I don't yet know how long the li-ion battery will last but I'll update if it dies too early.It's small but thats what I want. The breeze is targeted but keeps me surprisingly cool for such a device.
5,Very powerful for such a tiny fan! We ordered this to keep my son cool while we are on vacation in Palm Springs.  We still haven't left for our trip but we've had a couple really hot days here at home and he loves this fan!
5,I love this little personal fan. I've been using it a lot over the past several weeks. It's so lightweight and easy to carry around. It seems to run a really long time on a charge. It's just made of plastic but seems to be well made it runs very smoothly. I am so glad I purchased this little fan. The next time I go on an outing that's hot and possibly sitting in the sun I'll definitely take this with me.
5,This fan puts out more air than I ever imagined. Even on the lowest setting it is more powerful than I imagined. So far I am extremely pleased. I plan to do some run tests to see how long it lasts on each setting.
5,Portable and strong wind battery last quite long.
5,First one didn’t work they sent me a new one and that one works great so far
5,Works great for the ball park and hurricane season!
5,I bought this to use at work at my desk to plug in via the USB adapter.  It actually works great and is pretty powerful!  I only use it on the lowest setting which is perfect for me.  All around very good experience with this product.  If anything were to change I will update my review and rating.  If you found this review helpful please click the link below.  Thank you.
5,very happy with the power.
5,This is a MUST for Florida Weather.
5,My wife loves this little fan. Portable "HOTFLASH" relief.
5,I really like this little fan.  It pushes more air than I thought it would.  The other day we had about a two hour blackout and this fan ran the whole time only losing a little thrust.
5,This desk fan is a life-saver for me at work!!!!  Powerful and quiet I love it!
5,I like being able to take it with me anywhere and I have the choice to use it battery powered USB charged and/or USB plugged-in.
5,Quiet I like the multiple speeds. Great product!
5,Love this prefect
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this fan! works so well for such a small unit. Very powerful and works the same on the USB or the battery.
5,Great product. We use it during the emergency of hurricane and is a quality product. If you use on low speed you can use it by hours.
5,Powerful little fan great price on sale
5,perfect for the desktop and has great wind
5,These fans are AWESOME!!! The 3 speeds are perfect and the rechargeable battery option works great.  The blue light feature is cool the flashlight option is nice.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat!
5,This thing is way cool. I've only had it a week so I can't say how long it'll last overall but it plugs into my computer at work and has a nice little steady breeze! It does add an extra cord to your desk but I just wrap it around the backside of the computer and put the fan on the opposite side. Works great so far!!
5,Very powerful little fan.
5,Love this little fan.
5,Really powerful for the size!
5,Love everything about it does what it says it would.
5,This is a great little powerful fan! I have tried the top two personal fans on Amazon and this fan is by far the most powerful fan yet. No other personal fan has 3 variable powerful speeds and a flashlight! Can't be beat
3,While the fan is quiet and provides enough air flow the battery came corroded and currently will only run if it is plugged in.
5,good
5,Just perfect!!
5,These are handy convenient and worth every penny. My only gripe is that the fan doesn't blow as strongly when plugged in but overall fantastic quality and value.
5,This is compact and surprisingly powerful. Easy to use and portable exactly what I was looking for. I love it.
5,Awesome little fan.  I love the fact that it is wireless (after charging via USB) or can be wired full time...  Even the lowest setting is powerful enough for me -- the 2 higher settings are very powerful indeed especially for such a compact fan.  For the price I couldn't ask for a better fan.  Well done eflunky!!!
5,I've had this thing for a while and love it so much during the hot summer months of the year and its portability and ability to run off of usb battery pack!
5,Great little fan for the money.
5,Quiet moves lots of air even on lowest speed.  Got it on a daily deal which was really a great bargain.  Time will tell how battery holds up for now it is great!
5,Great little fan. I use it daily at work on its lowest setting.  It makes very little noise and puts out a comfortable amount of air. Very happy with this purchase.
5,perfect!!!  live saver....  I bought 5!!!  they are supower powerful for such a small fan
5,This little fan works great 8.5 mph on medium 12.5 plus MPH on high. See how long it lasts.
5,This Mini USB Rechargeable fan is plain awesome.I received a discounted product in exchange of my honest unbiased opinion and I must tell you that it couldn't have been better timing. The summer is at its peak and the AC in my room is on the other corner of my working station. I didn't want to be running the AC all the time and this was the perfect solution. It also has a rechargeable battery inside it which charges automatically. So I don't have to have it connected to the USB at all times super portable. And with its super quiet operation no body even knows its there!
5,This fan is a lifesaver.  I kept in in my cubicle at work during pregnancy.  There is the option to use the battery or plug the USB which I would through my computer.  The lowest setting of three is plenty strong.  It is lightweight which makes moving it around easy.  Highly recommended!
5,I got a mini fan from eBay but it was as loud as a jet on the 1st speed however this one is quit.Excellent product strongly recommend it.
5,Great little fan battery lasts long time dogs took a liking to it on hot days after playing.  perfect for the gamer on a hot day. quiet too!
5,Works great! Very quite for a fan. Has 3 settings. Easily plugs into usb when needed. Able to use it plugged in and also wirelessly.
5,This little fan is great it blows quite well for its size and it has a led flashlight and it has a rechargeable battery.
5,Love it! Works great at my desk I use usb  or take it outside to the game and use a battery. I will buy more of these.
5,For how small it is it is impressively powerful.  Very quiet can barely hear it on the 1 setting.  For a small desk or cubicle I recommend.
5,Got to say did not think this fan would work but was pleasantly surprised!!  Puts out a lot of air !! More than my 12 inch fan!!
5,Samll and inexpensive.  Still working after several months of regular use.
3,battery doesn't last very long but it's nice to have plugged in on my desk
5,Bought it last year August. Its dead in 8 months.EDIT:Once I wrote this review customer service voluntarily contacted me and sent a new one at no cost and its working great.
3,well its def mini but puts out well for its size.  battery doesn't last long
5,This fan is the best.  Great size.  Easy to use.  Gives strong breeze.  Perfect for work desk.
5,Wow really pushes out the air. Thin and light too.
5,Didn't except the size but I didn't look at details when I purchased so that's my fault but it is a powerful little fan and my kids llllooovvveeee it
5,Muy bueno.
5,Great little fan.  Has held up well for 6 months.
5,Powerful quiet fan for so small. Surprised it has a light with it also. Very nice. Would buy another one if needed.
5,Great little fan!
5,Love these fans! Saved our butts during softball and since it's Texas it's also saving our butts during cheer!
5,Puts out a TON of air and holds a charge for the day.  I have 4 other small portable fans and this one is THE BEST
5,Don't let the size fool you very smooth running and reliable one  really impressed me..
5,Very nice fan for the price.
5,love this fan  gives powerful wind chargeable battery charges via usb cable.  Awesome  purchase.
5,Perfect for sitting at the baseball field when there's no breeze! Makes spectating a heck of a lot more tolerable.
5,I seriously LOVE this fan! It puts off so much air and it lasts a long time. I HIGHLY recommend it!
5,Love this fan. Came with a strong battery and works like a charm. Great for when the AC goes out at work in the warehouse.
5,Perfect for travel. Small lightweight not too noisy. I use it with a USB outlet adapter to supplement hotel A/C.
5,Super compact great speed  perfect for on the go carrying around
5,Mini is right. But good.
5,This fan is fantastic! HA!  I all reality I like this product a lot.  It keeps me cool in my office with a nice gentle breeze.  The output is quite surprising from this little device.  It also is very quiet.  Great product!
5,Great product I love it and even my colleagues like it as we share whoever is feeling warm at their desks.
5,This works quite well blows harder then I thought it would.
5,Very strong fan!
5,Wow! It's actually a super powerful fan. I didn't expect this little fan to blow stronger than the bigger fan I have at home. You can use it while charging on the USB or you can use it with the battery standalone. I used this while camping the whole night no problem.
5,Wonderful little fan runs for a few days on one charge
5,it shuts off after about 10 mins even if it plugged incustomer sevice sent me a new one and it works flawlessly!
5,Even though this is not a large fan I am really impressed with the amount of air this thing puts out. It's not too loud either. I bought this fan to use at work but after playing with it at home for a few hours have decided that ai need both one for home and one for work.
5,Small but powerful!! Love the convenience of it!! Will be very helpful during this hurricane season!!
5,An amazing little fan.  Going to order another one for my mom.
5,I have owned this fan for almost a year. Really like it for its side power of wind and battery replacement.
5,This fan is amazing I can't believe how strong it is for as little as it is. Love it
5,Very nice light fan. Doesn't take too much space at my job desk. Like the blue light. The fan is very powerful for a small fan. I haven't use the battery yet as I only have it connected to my computer. Overall this was a nice perfect fan.
5,Haven't had any issues using this in my car. I don't have ac and this does help. Not with the temps when it's hot but to at least have somewhat of a breeze while sitting in traffic. Charge lasts a pretty good while the way I use it
5,This lil fan is stronger then expected. I love the how compact it is and that it's rechargeable. The built in flash light is just an added bonus. Great to have in you cubicle or anywhere you are limited on space. Highly recommend
5,For someone who seems to be hot all the time this is a great portable fan that I keep beside me on the living room end table and take with me on hot days when I am golfing or at a concert.
5,Great fan. Not near as loud as I expected and really moves some air. I'll be buying more.
5,Excellent one.Very happy with the product.
5,Very impressed I am pleased with my purchase
5,Worked great on our cruise.
5,Love the item
5,This mini fan can bring the air.  Awesome that its rechargeable and has a led light background.
5,I love this fan!!  Works fantastic and will most likely order again!!
5,This fan may be small but it is powerful. Great buy.
5,Bought for my husband. He uses it every night.
5,Unbelievable amount of air flow love that can run it even if plug in with usb
5,Works great.  Love that you can change the settings.  Powerful for such a small device.
5,This is a great little Dan for the money. It holds the charge very well.
5,It is great and works perfectly. Great doing buesness with you.
5,Just what he needed-it was a gift- thanks!
5,Oh my gosh. LOVE this. When I exercise at the gym I get overheated due to an autoimmune disorder. We have large fans at the gym but not near equipment where I work out. This small one fit on the machine & worked so well. Holds a charge & is surprisingly powerful. I love love love it.
5,This rechargeable fan is so brilliant that praise alone is insufficient
5,Perfectly portable with very distinct cooling levels. I love how quiet this fan is and the fact that the included battery is rechargeable via the fan's micro usb input. The fact that the fan can light up and that there is a flashlight are simply functional bonuses but nothing special.
5,works great.  fully charged battery lasted 5 hour 45 mins!  not bad.  however the plastic is commensurate with price. My other battery didnt work on the highest fan settings. I guess you need a high drain battery when using it on highest setting.
5,Surprisingly quiet and powerful. Includes an 18650 lithium ion battery that sells for 6.00+ by itself
3,Falls over really easily
5,it is very handy and the battery holds charge very good.
5,Great little fan
5,For something so small puts out some cold air.
5,Excellent customer service.  Good product.
5,Very quiet fan. Good for office use. Battery last for at least 6 hours.
5,Handy and practical. Love this little fan because it is efficient and compact.
5,This fan puts out a lot of air.
5,Nice little fan. Surprisingly good air flow.  Runs quiet too.  Purchased for my desk at work.  18650 battery charged right up with no problems.  No complaints from this consumer.  I would buy this fan again.
5,Favorite fan
5,Wonderful fan! Fantastic customer service!
5,Awesome quiet little fan the battery makes it really portable . Great value
5,Work fine recommended
5,This fan is the bees knees.  Great price and powerful for its size!
5,A great fan for my desk at work.
5,This is a great little fan. I mostly bought it for the white noise but I'm sure I'll appreciate the cooling effects in the summer. It's handy that it plugs into the USB on my laptop.
5,Works wonderfully!
5,Very useful for cooling down hot foods. Compact design
5,This fan works great.  Unfortunately the name efluky is written on the front of it had to cover that up with a sticker so it would look cooler. <--pun
5,Great little fan
5,I'm loving this fan.  The battery that came with it didn't work or charge.  I purchased some better ones and they work and charge in the unit.For a little fan it pushes a lot of air even on low.
5,Nice little fan can't beat the price. I have it on my desk and while I wish it was slightly quieter (though it's by no means loud) it does the job and has multiple settings.
5,Works very well the light is cool to have too.  Fan puts out a good amount of air.
5,This thing rules. It charges so easy and runs pretty good. I dropped it and now it buzzes a bit though so be careful! Might just order another one it's so cool. Love the stupid name. Efluky is my little breezy buddy
3,Lightweight  portable doesn't hold a charge long.
5,Work great so far.  Seems like a deal
5,Love this little fan  more then I expected
5,For a small fan this packs a punch. 3 speeds and very convenient to use love that it is rechargeable. I can carry it around in my purse and whip it out when I need it. Will be buying these as Christmas gifts for friends.
5,Perfect fan for my desk.  quiet on low
5,This fan is a lot more powerful than I expected and it holds a charge well. I use it often at work leaving it attached to my USB port on my laptop.
5,Love this little thing.. Worth every penny!!
5,Love this fan!!
5,I use this daily and often leave it on the majority of the work day. Have been using it for a month with no problems and the battery is surprisingly robust and lasts many hours.
5,It's so quiet and yet puts out a good breeze. Love that there are no wires and no need to worry about being near a plug.
5,Great Item !!
5,Perfect fit for cubicle desk!
5,Great little fan.
5,Really an unbelievable amount of air movement from a rechargeable fan. This fan blows me away (ha ha) with the power it packs in a tiny & very durable & portable design.
5,This is one of the best portable fans EVER! I opened the box and found a rechargeable  battery to make it a even better deal! The speed on the fan is very power for the size of the fan. I turned it on and let it set on my cabinet and the dog even loves it. The fan has three different level of speed and also a light on the side. My partner has already stolen this for me!!!
5,Really cool (pun intended) product. We bought this to put on our stroller during hot summer walks. The color changing is so fun and the battery life is great. Keeps our little one entertained as well as cool.
5,Great customer service! Excellent response time to my concerns and addressed them appropriately. The fan itself is a great product! The concept of it being portable was a deciding factor for me to purchase.
5,Great fan. Portable quiet long run-time. Rechargeable battery is awesome. I had no idea how many uses I could find for this thing.
5,Lasts 4 hours on a single battery charge (on low) . We used them at the game and kept us comfortable!It charges pretty quick too I used a solar clip on and it worked with that too.
5,This little fan is awesome.I can not believe the output it has.It's nice because you can charge w/ a usb cord.It will come in handy for power outrages.
5,Works as advertised. You need to put this on its highest setting to get any meaningful airflow but it works. And for some reason there's a tiny flashlight on the side. Sure why not.
5,PERFECT LITTLE FAN
5,I really didn't expect much for the price but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and power of this fan.
5,Excellent air flow.  An unexpected plus from this small fan.  It does run faster on battery but it runs quite well on USB power as well.
5,Quick and simple review:  Perfect for those days when you need a personal fan and your hands just don't do the trick.
5,Had it for a while with no problems. Smaller than I expected.
5,Perfect for cooling our RC motors while at the track
5,This little fan generates a lot of wind for its size.  Even on the slowest speed.  Having the blue led and the white led options are a nice touch.
5,ordered this for my daughter I think she will like it
5,Works perfect.  Great size for desk or bed stand.  Quiet and perfect to mask night noises.  Good product.
5,AAA
5,Great little fan! Powerful portable battery last a decent amount and can also use wired. Great buy.
5,Excellent product
5,Quiet lasts long between charges case is sturdy. Overall good value.
5,This little tiny fan is powerful. Don't be fooled by it's size. I also loved that the rechargeable batteries are replaceable.
5,Great little fan for my desk. I keep it on low cause medium and high speed are actually too much.
5,Way better than expected. Airflow AMAZING. 3 speeds. Light makes it great for bedside and you can run it via USB while the battery recharges.
5,Goes with me to work every day.  I love this fan. Very good output.
5,I wasn't expecting much for a little $10 fan but this thing pumps out some mad air. It even has a flashlight I'll never use.
5,Great amount of air moved by such a small fan. Fits perfectly on my desk at work!
5,Wow this little thing blows allot of air for it size.
5,Just what I needed for my desk at work. Quiet enough to not distract powerful enough to cool me off.
5,my guys love these for hunting and time outdoors...
5,This little fan is much more powerful than I expected! Works great.
5,Surprised at the strength of this little thing.  Charge it up and let it go!
5,Better than expected.  Cool little fan.
5,I love my new little fan. It blows lots of air and is portable.
5,PRETTY SMALL FAN BUT VERY POWERFUL.  I'M VERY HAPPY WITH IT!!!!!!!!
5,Good little fan and it blows very good to be small
5,Excellent value! Powerful fan and lasting battery.
5,Moves a lot of air for such a small fan.
5,Great fan!
2,This is a great little fan in fact I own two.  However the battery arrived dead when the fan was given as a present a few weeks after it was ordered.  I was able to check the fan worked properly by swapping batteries with my older version.  So this would be all five stars if the battery would have worked.  The fan has good speed options and the light both work well.
5,Small and pretty quiet should be perfect for a dorm with limited space.
5,Oh what a life saver with this summer heat
5,work well.but summer is gone.
5,great product! Just as described
2,Apparently I received a dead battery with my fan and it will not charge. I have tried several different plugs. I received it last fall and had not used it or charged it. Now that I want to take it on a trip the battery is not good. I guess I will use it for plug in purposes only unless I want to buy a new battery.
5,Perfect for what I need it for!
5,Sent to my son as a gift. He was very happy with it
2,Believe it or not for a tiny fan it really moves some air.  I was impressed with the volume of air blowing through it when I used it but the battery doesn't last long.  To complicate matters if you leave it plugged into a USB to charge it WHILE operating it the fan operates at a slower speed so the ONLY way to get full speed is to disconnect the charge cable and enjoy the blow until the battery dies.
5,Love that this fan has a USB feature. Perfect size for a desk at work
5,awesome
5,Impressed so far
5,Sweet little fan for whatever flat surface you place it on
5,I'm very impressed with this small little fan.
5,runs and cools great
5,This thing moves alot of air for the price.
2,Thank goodness I got this fan on a slight discount as a lightning deal. The fan itself works when it connected and powered but using just the battery that came with it does not work. Attempted to charge multiple times and the battery itself is Dead on Arrival.Ideally when you make a purchase it will work 100% but that is not the case with this. Normally I would contact Amazon to return a faulty item but since I plan on using this on a desk it can just stay plugged in. So because it will function I gave it two stars but docking three stars due to the faulty battery.
5,Love my nifrty efluky!
5,Love these!  I bought 2!
5,powerful little thing!
5,Like
5,Works well.
5,Great little fan!
1,Works great when plugged in. I’ve charged the battery but it doesn’t work at all. Disappointed this is not portable and has to be plugged in to work. I was hoping to be able to use the battery function.
2,I bought this thinking I would be able to use it not plugged into a power source but so far in the many months I have had it the only time the fan works is when it is plugged in. When it is plugged in it works out great but I feel mislead and don’t appreciate having a defective product.
2,It was good for a few months. But then battery stops holding charge making the unit useless. The unit ended up collecting dust.
5,Love it!9/1/18. Update  This is the BEST!  I have dropped it several times and it still works. People are amazed at the high volume of air flow on the lowest setting.
2,PRO:The fan works great. The full charge worked for 6 hours when I went camping and kept me cool the whole night.CON:3 weeks later the rechargeable battery does not keep charge anymore. It has to be plugged using a USB power cord in order for it to run. I will be unable to use it for camping purposes.
2,I thought the idea of the rechargeable battery fan was great. I'd charge the battery properly before needing to use it as instructed. The fan didn't last 2hrs w/o needing to be recharged. Disappointed.
2,Bought 2 of these fans to put in Camper fridge to cycle the air.  One would last a while and the other one didn't even last a day before giving up the ghost.  Not pleased.
2,I was happy with this fan until I attempted to charge it. The usb connector in the fan is so misaligned from the plastic housing that it's not possible to make connection without breaking it. It was recommended i purchase a battery charger for 18650 batteries.  Charger will cost nearly as much as I paid for the fan. The led light on it is useless in wouldn't purchase this fan with intentions of using the light much not very bright and it has a very blue hue to it. Also wouldn't recommend  due to the quality lacking on the charging port.
2,Battery arrived covered in think and not working. Fan itself was great - three speeds were nice compact very quiet. However 3 weeks of use at work (5 days a week not in use very often) and the USB port snapped this morning when I turned it on. Hottest week so far I work in a plant with no climate control high humidity and I'm 30 weeks pregnant. Not a great time to crap out especially being so new. I suppose you get what you pay for.
2,I bought this fan to replace an OPOLAR fan that was purchased a couple of months ago. The fan was easy to set up and get going. The three speed settings were nice. However it didn't take longer than 30 minutes of running before it starting making a rattling noise. I was very disappointed. I unplugged it and put it back in the box. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,I paid for this fan not a free review.I am actually surprised at the quality of the fan and battery. Works great tiny footprint. Bought it for camping but I can see this being used for more than that.10/10/16 update: After a 5 star review I am lowering my review because the usb charge port failed and fell apart after less that 6 months of use (port pulled out with the charge cord). The unit still operates fine if I remove and charge the battery but is not nearly as convenient for camping.
2,The battery lasted about 3 hours (if even that). We were camping my daughter was hot we turned on the fan and it was great! Until 2-3 hours later when the battery died! I made sure to charge it completely before usage.
2,this is a nice little fan but the battery died in less than a month.Yes you can run the fan of usb power bank or get a replacement ?Li-ion? battery but the "Rechargeable" claim by efluky is misleading.also the angle can't be adjusted; it just sits flat on a table; some similar fans have the angled for the similar price range.
1,Purchased in June 2019 now September 2019 and fan is plagued with the immediate shut off issues mentioned in numerous reviews. Did not even work for 3 months. The old adage holds true “you get what you pay for” I would avoid purchasing if I was you.
2,Battery not able to be charged after a very short amount of time.
1,2nd update.  Received the new fan and this one lasted 3 hours and then died.  At this point I am done.Update: I emailed the company and they got back to me surprisingly quick.  They sent me a new one as they do not sell the individual batteries.  Just got it today.  I will had an update if this one doesn't work.  Otherwise  I am satisfied with the support received.I  received mine on Monday.  Was soo excited.  It works amazing but only lasts for an hour and a half and then shuts off.  I even charged it all night and still only worked an hour and a half and shut down again.  So disappointed as I purchased this to help with my migraines at work.
1,Fan worked great but then died after 4.5 months of 2-3 days per week (estimating 1 hour/day) of use. The product seems to have had a hardware power issue in that one day it just stopped charging and operating with no warning signs.I have contacted the seller via Amazon and will update the review once I see how well EFluky customer support assists me here.
2,worked great for a little while and then after a couple of months the USB stopped working. Wife used it at work on her desk about 3 days a week so it wasn't used a whole lot and it should have lasted much longer than a couple of months.
2,This fan is extremely smaller than I thought. It barley makes any noise. So that’s a positive. But it’s probably Bc it’s Tiny ! Lol
2,I've been reading some reviews from other purchasers whose batteries are DOA.  Mine is no different from those.  Fan works great but the battery shipped does not charge at all.
2,Powerful unit when running on the internal battery but only 2 speeds are available when running off of USB power.  Also wasn't a fan of the fact that the airflow can't be adjusted or tilted. That doesn't make this a very good fan solution for an airline flight.
2,pretty weak fan for the kind of battery it utilizes
1,This fan worked for 3 days .  Keep in mind I had it plugged in while using and it still died.  Most likely its the cheap battery it comes with.
2,Fan only works when connected to a charger. Came with odd sized/unmarked battery which I thought was rechargeable but doesn't seem to work. Ok for use at my desk would be better if the charging cord was longer.
5,i love it
2,Didn't figure that it would be SO small.  Hardly makes a difference running on high in the bathroom to help vent.  Would NOT buy again.
2,When standing the fan points downward and there is no way to angle it upward without leaning it on something (which may block the air flow).
1,I only received the product after a month due to being out of the country before receiving it.  Once I got it I was having to plug it in constantly before the plug went inside the fan and now can’t be recharged.  It’s not very good.
1,i got it out after Hurricane Michael to use it but it will not stay on.  it runs for a few seconds and turns itself off.  turn it on again and it does the same.  Not worth the money at all. Cheap product.
1,This product lost its ability to hold a charge not long after I got it. It now has to be attached to a USB charging device to function. Sort of defeats the purpose. Very unfortunate.
1,Battery died in 2 days not charging anymore
1,I had to return the original and the replacement. Neither worked from the beginning and the company told me to purchase a new battery which was nearly 1.5x the cost of the fan.
2,The fan I got blow well but does not work unless it is plugged in
1,Stopped working after a week will not be buying or recommending
2,This fell 1’ off the table and never worked again.
1,Charged the thing fully turned it on and it runs for about 2 seconds before turning itself off. No matter what power setting no matter how long I charge it the charging light is green for fully charged. Probably a faulty battery and what could go wrong with a cheap faulty 18650 right? Hint: check the internet.
1,I liked this fan at first but if I try to use it at max speed (3rd setting) it runs for seconds and then completely shuts off.
1,I purchased this in preparation for hurricane season in Florida. I trusted it worked so I saved it in the box. However when tried to use it didn’t work at all. My husband tried to make it work but it didn’t. Money lost because return window has passed.
2,Fan works great when plugged it however it won't charge so can't use it away from power source.
1,USB port is broken quickly. Absolutely zero star
1,Fan broke within months of barely any use. It seems as if the motor seized so a battery swap won't fix it
1,White model with yellow fan: Wish I had more of these @ the price we got one. really like the fan. Sturdy with a good breeze and somewhat quiet.(update) Have 2 of these fans - the one purchased in 2017 still working. The one purchased in 2018 no longer works. When plugged in just the light works. The battery is fine as it works in the other fan no issue. You can smell the fan has a bad board. Used fan maybe 70hours .
1,I wanted to like this fan since it is strong not too loud and very versatile. But the fan cuts out in 10 seconds at high speed and at medium speed the red light blinks.  I tried it on several 18650 batteries.
1,Bought a similar fan the OPOLAR F201  and loved it. When I saw this Efluky at a great price under Deal of the Day I grabbed it. When it arrived it looked identical to the Opolar but... first the rechargeable battery wasn't marked +/- for polarity. So I had to look at the Opolar to confirm which way to insert it. I then charged the Efluky and the lights indicated it was fully charged and the flashlight feature worked but the fan would not spin. Returning it to Amazon as D.O.A. and purchasing another Opolar.The concept of these tiny fans is great though! Lots of airflow for the desk or nightstand.
1,Wouldn’t work without being plugged in charger. It would charge all night and never complete charging and when you unplugged it it won’t even work!!!! Such a huge disappointment
1,It worked for about 2 months then slowly died and wont take a charge now.
1,As excited as I was to get and used this fan it was a total flop. The fan refuses to charge and work without being plugged in. Unfortunately I didn't figure this out until I was on my cruise.
1,I was so excited for this fan to arrive. Unfortunately the fan would not stay on for more than 5 minutes. I very much regret this purchase.
1,Crap! Product did not work after three weeks. Would not charge will not work. Never again.
1,This fan is TINY and has poor air flow.I bought for cruise and this will not be going. Air flow so mild will not eve work for my desk at work. Save your money and keep looking. This product is not worth it. Went right back in box and will be going back.
2,Died and doesnt turn on anymore. Owned less than 2 months. Disappointing.
1,This fan never even turned on for me
1,battery doesn't charge.  Fan only work when plugged in
1,I purchased mine in April and the USB port brokeI love the fan but unhappy it broke. I'm getting another one hoping this one doesn't break
1,Doesnt work at all
1,Battery was dead when I got it. I tried to charge it for two days. Took the battery out & put it back a few times Incase I had it in wrong. Just won’t charge !
1,I was very disappointed with this product. I charged it with the battery in place but when tried to use it with the battery alone it did not work. It would only work when plugged in.
1,Died within 3 months with little use.
1,I got this fan for my desk since I am going through menopause & am always hot. It doesn't hold a charge at all. Last's 5 minutes on low. Not happy with it.
1,Spent about a month charging then when I unplugged it to take it somewhere I realized it didn't work unless it was plugged in. Hopefully yours works as it's supposed to.
1,Fan broke after a few months not a sturdy item at all...cheap china made item
1,This tiny ridiculous fan is not only loud but a simply aggressive fart would move more air than this thing. Let me repeat. Small. LOUD. Useless. Buy a timeshare in Syria before putting money into this cash/time/soul wasting purchase. Just saying...
1,Fan noise levels are too high for the power settings.Fan is very directional and short ranged. Must be sitting right in front of it to feel it.Anything higher than level 1 has a very distinct sound that is hard to ignore.Pros: size battery recharger are all common types of items that are easy to replace or buy back ups of.
1,This little fan might be too strong for its own good.  The base isn't heavy enough to keep this fan upright when it's blowing in its highest setting.  I watched as my fan wobbled and then fell backwards off the nightstand and onto the floor breaking it.  I think I'll go get a real desk fan instead.
1,Battery trouble
1,The fan's battery does not charge at all. It works while connected to the USB. However I bought this for its portability. With the battery not working it defeats the purpose. I have read similar reviews to this product so I am returning.
1,The fan did not work well for me even after charging
1,the place where you charge the fan broke off after several months of light use.  I would avoid.
1,Brand New Fan Just arrived and the battery won't charge. Works fine when plugged into the wall. It has also become very NOISY!
1,It won't keep a charge so it's pretty useless unless you're willing to constantly charge it.
1,Really like the fan. High output and battery works very well  however charging port broke off inside unit less than a week in.
1,I ordered the fan..a box was delivered today..the box contained only instructions on how to use the fan.. the instructions looked just great..BUT there was NO FAN in the box...  The instructions did what they were supposed to do they told me how to turn the fan on and off!  The box was a lovely shade of blue with a picture of the fan on the front...  Unfortunately there was nothing in the box other than the lovely instructions.
1,The Fan works OK but the battery does not charge even after leaving it for charge over night. I will keep the Item if seller replaces the battery. This is the second time I bought this item. First time the Fan was not even showing that the battery is charging and returned the Item.
1,Garbage. Stopped working after 3 days.
1,this thing is terrible. it died within hours of it's first use. it won't charge. instead it just shuts off within seconds of attempting to charge. i'd not recommend anyone waste the money on it.
1,The battery doesn't charge at all. The fan works when plugged in to power but the point of this fan is portability. Other fans I've bought like this give you 2 batteries but this only gives you 1. With the battery not working this fan is almost completely useless...
1,Do not buy this fan. A little over a month after purchasing I took the front off to clean it and the motherboard started smoking. Now it won't turn on and the room reeks of a harsh paint smell.
1,Good power for such a small fan but the recharge plug came out after about a month of use so is now worthless.
1,I got two of these..one was defective when it arrived..the other...died within a couple of days after usage...it was good when it worked...but i had to return both..
1,I gave 5star 1month ago But....This is stopped working and not able to charge. I think this was a defect product. Dont buy this.
1,Positive end of battery  seemed to melt when I first charged it. Fan only works when pluggged in
1,Piece of junk. I kept it plugged in the entire time I tried to use it and it constantly randomly shuts off. Would not reccommend.
1,It's a great idea but the first time I plugged in the USB cord to charge it the socket broke loose. Returned it.
1,Awful.  Didn't work at all.  From the minute we took it from the box.  Very disappointing.
1,DOA item. battery dead on arrival only works when it's plugged in. I would not recommend this.
1,Battery died in less than a month. Fan only works while plugged now.
1,Stop working after 15 days! Do not buy this fan trust me.
1,Doesn't put out much air.
1,Stopped working within a week
5,The cooling fan in our cable box was noisy and eventually died so the box would overheat. These little fans sit next to the side vent and effectively pull out the hot air.There is a USB port on the cable box to power this fan but that box is shut off nightly so the cable company can upload some software and with a previous fan we had to remember to restart the fan every morning. This particular fan has a battery backup and it might help some with issue of the fan shutting off but we haven't tested it - we use a USB converter to plug it into the power strip.
4,The only reason I gave 4 stars is that it tilts down slightly so I have to lean it back against the monitor so it I feel on my face. It doesn't look as though it would tilt but it does.I've had it for about 1 month and thought it developed an issue of not holding a charge and even with the cable plugged in it would run for a few minutes and then turn off - turn it back on and the same thing would happen.I switched out the USB cable and now it seems to be working fine.
5,Wow best portable fan ever. Works so well I had to order more for the wife and kids. Has helped out tremendously with this hot scortching summer. Also used a few times to blow away the smoke during a BBQ. If you are reading this just order it. Have tried many portable battery powered fans and rechargeable ones and this one is the best!
5,It's very powerful for a small fan. It lasts very long before needing to charge again and I carry it everywhere with me as it fits in all my bags. I mostly use it on the lowest speed since it's that's powerful and the noise level isn't bad but you'll hear it in a very quiet room. I absolutely love my efluky!
5,Works well it's nice and quiet but I thought the picture was inaccurate. I held down the ON button and the blue light came on.I mostly leave it plugged in but the battery life is good. Overall I'm very happy with it and I bought one for my wife as well.
5,The fan was smaller than I had anticipated but it packs a solid punch especially for a rechargeable fan. I get moderately hot at work. So I usually have it set to the 1st speed and thats perfect but 3 speeds helps.
5,I just bought a second fan. My first one is still going strong after more than 2 years of regular use!. I am an RN working 12 hour shifts and I use it every work day! I bought the 2nd one for home use.
4,Good value has 3 speeds can operate off of battery or charger cable only issue is that on the low level mine makes an annoying noise on higher levels its pretty quiet. Color vibrant.
5,Since I can't sleep without a fan noise this portable fan does the trick.  The battery life doesn't last long so keep it plugged in while using when you can.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Feel warm turn the fan on it is cool enough for personal use. Move from place to place. Battery one charge last about couple hours. Three adjustable levels. Not to noisy
5,My little fan may be an anomaly but this little thing lasted almost 5 years.  I’ve left it running multiple times for an entire week 24 hours per day.  But it is always on while I work.  At least 10 hours per day for almost 5 years.  Again mine might be abnormal.  But it’s seen extreme use for almost 5 years.  Never had one issue.  It finally has started to come apart.
5,Okay I’m not crazy about displaying the word “Fluky” on my desk as my husband takes the opportunity to tease me. However in the summer months I have the last laugh. I love this little thing. Looks cheap but it is mighty.
5,It's so cute and it has a lot of power for being so little. You are able to take it anywhere. Battery life is great!
5,Love it !! Very powerful for a small little fan . Perfect for work . Battery last a long time .
5,I love how small the fan is but work better than a large fan (good for individual use).
5,Very strong easy to charge was great for work because it gets overwhelmingly hot and the price is even better.
5,I bought this for my desk at the office and for travel - this is a powerful quiet little fan that did the trick.
4,I bought this fan to keep on my desk. So far I have not had any issues. The noise level is so little that it does not distract me while I'm working.
5,I bought this for my husband who travels for work several times a month. He always needs a fan to sleep and says this one works wonderfully!
5,This fan is great! I work in an office and try to do some office workouts when I can and this fan definitely helps cool me down. It is small but mighty. Love the fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery!
5,Looks good to me! Heard some people breaking the charge port so I supper glued the port all around it.
5,Battery lasts a while. Fan works great and has more power than you would think.
5,Very nice looking product.
1,did not work on battery AT ALL! Did work if plugged in but that is NOT what I bought it for. Battery arrived HOT maybe that is why it didn't charge after more than 24 hours plugged in to charge.
5,Over 3 hours on low and battery is still going strong...highest setting lasted about 45 minutes great fan just bought my 2nd one
5,good  and  made well.. fast shipping..Item as described
5,Using it for the bathroom after a steamy shower
4,works good. I leave it in the bathroom. strong fan.
5,I love it! I wanted to use it for traveling this year!
5,This is a surprisingly great powerful fan for such a small one. Very quiet and the rechargeable battery and light puts this fan on my must have list. Great buy!
5,Awesome strong wind very impressed you won't be dissatisfied. Small looks deceive. Will buy more.
5,Great for my desk. It gets super hot and this fan helps
5,Powerful little fan. It is super impressive.
1,Disappointed my led lights didn’t come with the fan and it’s just a regular fan which I only ordered for the lights. Very unhappy with this purchase.
5,Love the fact that when put on the highest level it still lasts as long as when it’s on the lowest level and is very cooling for the really hot days.
5,Funciona muy bien me parece perfecto
5,Its really powerfull
5,I love it . I charge it on my lap top.
5,Great fan
5,Works perfect!
5,As expected
5,Great
5,Works great wind needed!
5,Just got this fan. I work in a hot kitchen and this little fan puts out a large breeze for the size. Will definitely recommend this to friends and family
5,Great comes in handy.
5,Size and strong
5,The fan broke after 2nd use. No way of contacting seller. Very disappointed.
5,Quiet great fan speed and has a led light. Great for camping! Last most of the night. Could always use a longer battery life but if you have a battery bank then no problem!
4,provided comfort for my wife when in Hospital and long lasting battery. easy to recharge
5,Small but very efficient.  This works really well
5,perfect size and volume
5,Bought it to keep my xbox one x cool it does the job cant complain.
5,My daughter has this sitting on her makeup vanity to use when she's trying to dry lash glue primer spray or protectant. It works like a charm and she likes the size - compact so it doesn't take up too much room!
4,The wind is not strong enough
5,For such a  little fan it has a lot of wind power and yes they come in very handy such as power goes out etc.and yes I will be purchasing some more. ❤️❤️❤️
5,It's a fan it does fan things at 3 different speeds and turns off as expected
1,It only runs a minute & then it’s dead ! Won’t hold a charge!
5,Lots of cool from something so small. I get hot so easily and this little thing works so well I ordered 2 more
5,It's not that loud for how fast it can spin perfect for Infront of a keyboard when your hands start to sweat or when u wanna freeze yourself out lol
5,This thing is AWESOME! It goes forever and ever its super cute pretty quiet and POWERFUL. I use it at a tattoo shop when its a billion degrees and at night when I need a little white noise. Still going strong after all this time.
5,Second purchase. We use these on the plane since they don’t know how to keep planes cool anymore.
4,Very powerful desktop fan It is nice to have different power levels. The only problem is that you can't adjust the direction of the fan i.e. left or right or up or down.
5,Don’t let the size fool you; it’s much more powerful than expected.  This fan is small & perfectly suited for a the limited space in a cruise cabin.  It’s a personal size so perfect for the desk or nightstand. It also offers nightlight options. Quick & easy to charge
4,Updated review. The intel blue light comes on once you turn the fan on and hold down the on button for several seconds. The fan isn't quiet on medium or high. All in all it will do what is needed so I'm happy with it. I do wish it was tiltable.
1,It doesn’t keep a charge at all. It has to be plugged in for continuous use.
5,Bought a few for family and friends fo those times when power goes out. However this year I find they help when temps and humidity go sky-high!
5,This dam puts in work. Very powerful quiet and compact.  I don't leave home without it.
5,Blows an extraordinary amount of air for the size just what I was looking for during Texas summer power outages.  Battery is swappable which was important to me…would make a great desk fan if you don’t have a handy outlet.
5,Se lo regale a MI tia y le encanto
5,Put in front of truck AC vent driving through desert and worked great.
5,Exactly  what I was looking for. Easily can be taken while traveling.  Works great for my hot flashes.
5,WORKS GREAT WIFE IS HAVING HOT FLASHES AND SHE LOVES IT BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD AND REALLY CAN'T HEAR IT WHEN IT'S ON.
3,I bought one of these from another seller under the name "DPOLAR" which no longer exists. However this fan is exactly the same in every way. It just has a different label sticker applied to the front of it. I think sellers buy these from an outlet like Alibaba and put their own labels on them to resell on Amazon. You've probably seen this before on other products.I liked the DPOLAR fan so much that I bought this "Efluky" fan so I could have two of them. The original one was inexpensive quiet and efficient. It offers 3 speeds and the lowest speed produces a gentle quiet breeze when you're sleeping that doesn't disrupt or wake you up at all.** Update in 2022: The Efluky fan turned out to be unpredictable and sometimes it won't run or charge. It won't even run consistently when it's plugged in. What a disappointment! My other fan (which looks just like it) works great. I'm going to look for another rechargeable portable fan on Amazon now.
5,This Portable Fan is good I keep it at the lowest speed have to be careful because of the lithium ion battery.
5,The battery doesn't last very long
5,Great mini fan
5,Just got this little fan. Not sure what I was expecting but for the price it is awesome. It really moves some air. Had to charge it once it got here. I will be taking this camping just to keep it from getting stuffy. Having it on the lowest setting will be adequate for my small enclosed sleeping area and the battery will last all night. Very glad that I made this purchase
4,The battery didn’t last long enough for it to merit being used as a stand alone.  It’s an unusual battery.  The fan is great when it’s plugged in!  The noise is minimal.  Would be perfect if battery lasted longer before needing recharging.
3,Unfortunately the battery doesn't charge and I did try it both ways.  I have to use the charger to keep it on.  I wanted to use it without the charger and that was just only way that I wanted this particular fan.
5,Use this when I am on my patio
5,I love this little fan. Holds charge a long time. It’s very cool.
5,I love this little fan and it's the second I've purchased it.  The first one is still working great but I liked it so well I just wanted another!  The battery life is excellent and I can take this fan anywhere with me and usually do.  It's easily charged with a micro USB connection.  I use it to help me sleep when traveling and have used the first one during a major power outage.  It would be great for camping!
5,I love these fans they are very convenient and blows out really good. It was well worth the price !!
5,This is an awesome little fan. I just purchased my second one the first one lasted a few years with constant use. It's whisper quiet on the first setting as you get on the highest setting it naturally gets a little bit louder but it's never very intrusive. It's very small and for the size you wouldn't think it puts out much air but it does it has a very good output IMO. It does not oscillate.I'm very happy with it (obviously) or I wouldn't have purchased it again LOL. I highly recommend it!
5,This is the second fan I’ve purchased. I loved the first one so much I had to have another to keep in another room. It has GREAT airflow for a small fan! Awesome! Get one you won’t be disappointed.
5,This is a great little fan.  I have 2 of them and I use them in my camper van plugged into a portable USB power pack.  Depending on the capacity of the power pack you can get anywhere from 10-20 hours of use even at the max fan speed.  Yes it has a battery and you may get 2-10 hours out of it depending on the fan speed but it runs just fine even with the battery removed and plugged into a power pack.  I've run this fan for 17 hours straight when connected to a 23000 mAh power pack.
5,It works great for being so small. I even order a second one....
5,I love this fan. Im at the age that I get Power Surges (AKA HOT FLASHES). This is my second one. I already burnt out the other one😂. I had it for over a year. You will not regret buying this fan.
5,I was dismayed when I saw how small it was but it is a solid performer. A little noise on high not enough to matter.
5,This little fan is a gem! Took it with me to France as I sleep very warm. I was so glad I did used it on my train ride in a very stuffy six bunk room. Just put it right by my pillow and it did last all night on the medium button. It does not last as long if you use it on high. But very easy to charge and travel with.
5,It runs so quietly and it's so handy that I take it with me in my back pack! So easy to use with the simple controls.
5,The best mini fan I've ever had.  Great price too👍
3,Battery doesn't last long
5,Delivered timely. This little fan is quite powerful without taking up much space. Have it in the bathroom.But when the computer gets too hot I put it up to the top speed(it has 3 speeds) and it works to keep the heat down. Surprisingly solid product for the size.So I will get another. Thanks
2,Needs to be plugged in and does not charge (so it is not portable). Good power and noise level is ok. Good for a desk or bedside table.
5,I saw this fan when an acquaintance was using it. I ordered one right away and I am so happy that I did! It is great. I keep it on my bed table and use it every night.
4,Easy to port around live in Florida so has been useful especially when working on the computer where area can sometimes get warm.
5,I liked
1,Does not work I want a refund
5,Just received very nice so far.  Battery should be good have not had long term yet.
5,Very powerful little adjustable fan easy to travel with
5,Excellent item for my office. When the time comes I'll buy it again.
1,I've had this fan for a year.  The battery never worked for more than a few hours. It's a flat topped 18650. I tried to put in a quality button top battery from my Flashlight collection (3000Maha) but it didn't even fit in the battery compartment & it died after only a couple extra hours.Not worth the money!
5,We love these fans! My birthday is in August and my husband and I go camping every year for my birthday. We just recently moved from Wisconsin to Florida so it's definitely A LOT hotter than we are used to. These fans were a huge hit on our camping trip! They put out a lot of air and aren't loud and they are small so they aren't bulky to pack or carry around!
5,This fan is great... I purchased because I needed something for my desktop that was smaller quiet and moveable.  (The USB fans are restricted to area and the cord usually dictates how you can position them!)  I can put this fan anywhere and it does the job.  4 Different settings - I only need setting 1... the fact that it is a rechargeable battery is awesome.. I have had for 2 weeks now and have recharged 1x.. just plug in to a usb and it's back up and running in a couple hours.  I live in Florida so I can drop this in my purse and take with me to any event!  I think I may need another just so I'm not without it.. crazy easy and efficient.. I LIKE !  Oh - and the light on the side to use 'just in case' is nice too ;)  !!!!  No worries with this one !
5,I do not have one negative thing to say about this fan. This little fan really packs a punch. I highly recommend this product particularly if you need to travel.It charges up quickly and works efficiently.
5,I originally bought this for desk fan. It is an amazing portable fan with great battery life.
5,I just cannot say enough about this fan. It is small but powerful it is quiet it is packable. It fits in your purse you can literally take it anywhere.It charges quickly and hold to charge all night. Is great for camping or R v's.
5,Great little fan
5,Perfect item love how long it lasts and I can take it anywhere.
5,I keep this by my bedside and run it on low all night it very quiet and the charge lasts all night.
5,A great little fan for the money! It does the job and the fact that it comes with rechargeable batteries is a plus you can take it anywhere.. but the fan does NOT light up blue like the pic shows… overall I am satisfied with my purchase
5,Good for the bowling bag
5,I love these fans! I have 3 of them and also give to women friends as gifts when they complain about being hot all the time. I use it everywhere take it traveling with me and have only had one that the battery will not charge in but still works great plugged in.
5,Have three or four of these. No unsightly cords.
5,Wonderful for those hot flashes or just because... its a little too hot sitting there.
5,Great little fan! I love it. Holds charge well.
5,It gets so warm in my work place that I decided to try one of these fans.  Works great and I've probably sold a dozen people on buying their own.  I like it so much I ordered one for my 90 year old Mother.  She liked it so much she purchased several more.Update 07/2022I love these and have now bought 4 over time.  I keep giving them away!!!
5,Thank you very helpful. Fun. .
5,It's quiet and little. Although it's small it does the job!
5,I just received it today add tried it and will fully charge the battery and use it sometime soon but have no idea how long the battery will last until I do but it's a great little fan and came with the battery which is a definite plus. The video/photos of this fan show it having a glowing light when it runs but it does not. When you turn on the little side flashlight it turns the fan off. I had misunderstood the description  I guess as the light only projects out the side in flashlight mode.
5,How is everything about this fan the battery lasts for a long time and I've dropped it about 4 or 5 times from about 3 ft height and it works perfectly still. If you're looking for a portable fan with a lot of power this is the one for you.  Kinda loud but for the power output it's great.
5,Super quiet sleek powerful and AMAZING. Love that it has 3 speeds and is rechargeable. I want more!
4,I had previously purchased 4 OPOLAR units that are almost exactly the same as these -- except the OPOLAR units are almost silent on their lowest speed (which I use the most). Otherwise they are quite good and the fact that the rechargable battery is REPLACEABLE is a major plus for me because I can have several charged and just swap them to keep the fan going when I don't have power (or am not willing to wait) to recharge.
5,It’s a good small fan kicks off a lot of air
5,I love the durability of these small portable battery powered fans. I had only one break in the many years that I have been using the fans and that was the usb connector on the side.  It still works from a charged battery. I have one I leave plugged in beside my bed it has been running continually for over three years!  I have one at work and I give them as gifts too.  I usually don’t use the built in fan lift but the are neat to have available.
5,I love this little fan . Does the job and it is light weight. I purchased several
5,When I first opened the package I thought that I was getting screwed over. I thought what this tiny thing going to do. Until I turned it on. This fan has so much power it blows itself over. My father was very happy to recieve exactly what he wanted. It was so cool to see him smile like that. Thank you.
5,I loved this fan until it stopped charging at that point it no longer worked:(
5,Very compact great price just what I needed.
5,Very small but covers facial and neck area well. I ran it on high and it lasts 3 hours. Supposed to last 1 but I get 3. We go through hurricanes and small fans like this allowed us to sleep when had to let generator rest.
3,Its good though I did expect a bit more air flow but still good
