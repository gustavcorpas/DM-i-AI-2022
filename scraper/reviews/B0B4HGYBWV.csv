5,This product came in very handy for my husband and I when we went on vacation. I was able to charge my phone watch and AirPods all at once and still charged pretty fast considering they were all sharing one cord. I would recommend this for anyone wanting something easy and compact to charge all of their devices!
1,The wireless pad doesnâ€™t charge at all. The others take forever. Save your money
5,Love
5,very handy. i liked it for travel and office.
2,This would be great for travel to cut down on the charger/cable mess in my carry on. However the pigtails coming out of the breakout point are too short to accommodate a phone and Ipad comfortably at the same time.
5,Love this charger bought this so I could charge my watch and phone. Charges fast and is great to use!
