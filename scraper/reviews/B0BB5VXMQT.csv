5,Ink works as expected. Came with a postage paid envelope to return empty cartridge for easy recycling that was nice.I did receive an offer to receive a gift card for a review. It did request I not mention the offer. The review is true but I believe all such situations have to be disclosed. Of note I have not yet received the gift card and this may make it so I don't but honestly is important.
5,Normally I buy the normal size cartridges and get maybe a handful of photos printed before my ink supply is low but I've printed 5 large prints and about 10 multi-page colored documents so far and still have plenty left. Spend a little bit extra and get these XL cartridges.
5,It worked perfectly on my HP DeskJet 3755. What I liked the most is that it comes two cartridges color and black and white. Great price!
5,Good quality product package nice and seems to last longer than other brands the cartridges look fresh not dried at all like some.

1,doesn't last long
5,Nice ink cartridges. Installed in my HP printer and it recognized them with no issues.  Printed a couple test pages in color and couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between these and genuine HP cartridges.  Works recommend.
5,I have an HP DeskJet 2636 printer and these cartridges worked perfect. No issues putting them in clear and crisp printing with no smears. These are much less expensive than buying the new HP cartridges from the store so these are definitely going to be my go-to from now on. I was also pleasantly pleased to see they had put a recycling bag in for my old cartridges to be recycled for free. That earned the company some brownie points in my opinion.
5,Prints just as good as a genuine HP ink cartridge. I have no complaints especially at this price point and getting black and color. Buy it
