5,Of Course I would use this not some copycat brand
5,In the past I tried to cut cost corners with buying not Epson products and the machines clog and you get to buy a new printer.
5,Great product for your Epson Printers...
5,It does what its suppose to do. The color is great
5,Nice product - works as advertised no issues.
3,No choice - we have to pay the big bucks for this ink.
2,I really want to keep using the original ink for my wf7840 but this ink is not cutting it.
1,I hate my 7824 epson printer so much.First - it came with an ink starter pack that was good for 1 use. What a waste of plastic! Ecologically irresponsible!And now the "real" ink cartridges last only a few weeks of very light usage.Epson was one of the first printers I ever bought and now I feel betrayed.
5,Purchased a non-Epson to start and it was not recognized therefore I purchased this cartridge and it was recognized and worked immediately.
5,Better ink quality. Highly recommended and lasts longer
5,Exactly what I was looking for!
