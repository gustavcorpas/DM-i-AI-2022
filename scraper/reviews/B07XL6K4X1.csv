4,This screen is great for my projector. I took off one star because the adhesive clips kept falling off. If you can manage to reinforce the screen to your surface by some other measure then do so. Other than that. The fabric is awesome!
5,Not bad for the price. Convenient for anywhere but make sure you have hooks or something to tie it up from the corner
5,This screen is exactly what I was looking for works very well.  I highly recommend
5,Love it! It looked like you were watching from the tv. Would definitely recommend that you use a better rope to put it up with though if you put it between trees like we did.
4,Order came quickly. Will use as a backup for my outdoor blow up screen
4,Everything came as described and prompt shipping. Just wasn't what we were looking for at the time. Are walls are white so picture quality was better with that if you have different colors on your walls it would benefit though.
4,Everything was perfect until the plastic hangers started falling and sticking to the floor. I still use it with tacks but if you want to use the hangers get a good wall adhesive. :)
4,Thinner than expected but has good quality picture
5,
5,I absolutely love this screen. Not transparent at all picture quality is great!
5,Great size! I haven‚Äôt tied it down in pic but it does come with ties!
5,It was easy to hang and very affordable.
5,Awesome screen especially for the price!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†We love itü§© good quality üëåüèº
5,Love our late nights in the pool listening to music and watching the screen ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíô
5,This srechy fabric works great. I put it up with thumb tacks in drywall.
5,The media could not be loaded.
3,This is horribly thin. We have a projector that we love but needed a traveling screen. This screen is the perfect size. But it is so thin. You cant hang it from a beam or window. You can see right through it.  If there is any light through yhe back at all it is un usable. Thos defeated the purpose. Would only be good hanging on a wall. . Very disapointed. It was nice that it is grometted all the way around and came with hooks. Sad that it diddnt fit our needs.
3,Honestly I can‚Äôt really be too picky of what was wrong with my screen but just one of the top loop holes was not either put on properly so it comes out setting up at times but quick little stretch and it pops right back in. Other than that works GREAT
5,We put up hooks on our pergola and with the grommets make taking down/potting up so easy!
5,I got this for my son‚Äôs birthday to project his memories and to entertain kids at the party. This is such a good investment specially if you have wild kids at the party and you are afraid of breaking your TV. This was a very easy setup at the amenity center . We used Command hooks to put it up. Size is decent soft/bright fabric and the price is affordable! I will be using this at all my parties now
4,Nice and bright picture at night with this screen. My only complaint is that one of the grommets came off after a few days of use. Could be made a bit stronger in that area.
4,Very nice product have used a bunch of times with a problem. Picture quality nice. However either bu a nice or make a custom one. Screen needs to be taught for it to work well.
5,i can't complain about this one bit everything worked out fine only problem was me! i should have bought a stand. i tried to hold it up with sting lol no dice. if you're are going to use in the back yard please buy a stand. picture was great and that was from around 20-30ft back from the screen and it was clear as my 65" i have in my living room.
3,Bought this for camp but didn't work for us We tried to hang on camper which we thought would be great but blocked our vent for fridge so couldn't use without a frame So instead we bought the 80 inch with the frame That was perfect
5,Absolutely üíØ  accurately portrayed in description.  Reliable  great picture possibility.  Easy set up.  Durable  made with quality  and versatile. Indoor or outdoor use. INCREDIBLE value.  Absolutely GREAT for family  friend gatherings and parties.  Made our daughter's "Sweet 16" a HIT!!!
5,This is the closest thing you‚Äôre going to get to an actual movie theater screen indoors or outdoors. I would not buy any other this is the one that everyone needs to buy.
5,We purchased this item to watch movies outdoors. It had creases when taken out of the packaging but once it was hung it was easy to stretch it out to remove the creases. It came with different hardware to hang in different places. The picture quality was great. So far it's been a great purchase.
5,Purchased for outdoor movie nights and it is perfect. Easy to put up and take down. If it gets damp just make sure to dry it out before putting it back up. Great quality and would purchase again.
5,Be carful with the double sided removeable adhesive strips they're pretty good at removing the paint off your walls. Other than that it worked out great for the Holidays! Larger than expected and good quality screen.
4,The product had  several creases. However able to release them. The picture quality is great. The price was amazing
4,Very stretchy and easy to put up!
5,Bought for Brother in law for birthday with projector. He loves it great to set up on patio when gang is there to watch a game.
2,The screen didn't come with hooks and ropes like the description said I'm really disappointed.
5,If you're expecting to get a large thick polyester sheet then this will be great for you're money. I've used it twice so far and the picture is great. I think it'll be better once I build a frame
4,Inexpensive doesn't really wrinkle.  Can't go wrong for this price.
5,All the stuff to mount in the package.  Could easily double as a really nice bed fabric haha
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Easy to put up. Comes with hooks and string. Good picture. Might just need to stretch it to get the wrinkles out.
4,It‚Äôs almost wrinkle free but does it‚Äôs job
5,Will you put this together one time we had to make a frame for it because we have nowhere to hang
5,Very good for the price. Its very thin so it is a bit see thru. Putting a sheet as a liner helps for front projection.
5,The screen is good quality and super easy to set up. No wrinkles were visible once the screen was up. Great screen for the price!
4,Needed more outdoor hooks....but great screen.
5,Really pleased with the variety of mounting options included in this kit. The screen is of much higher quality than I expected!!
5,The picture quality is excellent and yes it is wrinkle free. A quick low heat iron after unboxing to remove a few minor creases and it looks amazing!!
5,Great for outdoor movie night with the neighbors. Picture quality is great. We used a photo backdrop stand and clamped it on to it.
5,Perfect for socially distanced outdoor movies! Just add lawn chairs neighbors and beverages. BYOP. (Bring your own projector)
1,Didn‚Äôt come with hooks or rope. Much thinner then expected.
5,Great product very minimum rinkles easy to install. Recommended.
5,Movie quality is great! Don‚Äôt really have any issues. It stands up to what it offers.
5,Evething Good
5,This covered the entire single car garage door. Now movies in the driveway is picture perfect!
5,Great for outdoor movie night!! Very satisfied customer!
5,For its price this is a solid choice for your projector.
5,Great picture quality!! Feels like a theater in our house!!
5,Very happy with purchase. Great quality and delivered on time.
5,Easy setup screen worked just fine for outdoor movie theater.
5,Nice
5,Easy to install  great fixtures with it and plenty incase you want to move it .
5,high quality easy to use
5,Super good for movies
5,Works perfect!
5,I luv it it's like a theater!!
5,Its vary big and slightly stretchy to pull out the wrinkles and came with good hooks
5,Amazing quality and love it
5,Have been enjoying our screen
5,Definitely more than expected.
5,Very nice
2,The material is super thin if it‚Äôs used against  a white wall it‚Äôs ok but otherwise not the best picture. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,it wasn't okay to install because you would install it and then they keep popping off the walls. I didn't have enough pieces to put back on the wall after they keep loosening up and popping free.
1,I should‚Äôve read the description more carefully. This is basically a bed sheet. That‚Äôs it. A simple white bed sheet. It does what it‚Äôs supposed to do and I guess I expected something more.
1,Haven't been able too
1,Don‚Äôt waste your money
4,It didn‚Äôt come with the hooks but it seems like it would have worked very well if it did . I‚Äôm gonna try to use thumbtacks though
5,Hung on the back of my garage with the included clips. Awesome screen heavy duty never wrinkles. Love it
5,Value for the money
5,Love it good product!
4,Just what we needed to go with our portable projector for some socially distanced outdoor movie nights. Easy to hang & take back down - stores in virtually no space at all.
5,Hung this on our wall down stairs and love it. Great picture quality. I love that we could take this with us. We camp a lot and this will be a fun opportunity to bring with.
5,Absolutely love this product. The cloth quality is wonderful and not thin like the others also has a black border with reinforced holes for the hooks. Definitely worth every penny.
5,I'm impressed by the immaculate quality of the screen as well as the availability of ropes and other hooks etc. which allow for more than one scenario.
5,Really exceeded my expectations easy to unpack and easy to put on my wall without the hubby help.
1,This thing is just a thicker white polyester fabric. The multiple layers thing is a flat out lie.When I told the seller this they only responded with a "thanks for the suggestion" and said they would improve the description...eventually. Find a more honest seller.
5,I mean seriously what more could you ask for? I think I paid $25 got it the next day. Wow it looks great comes with EVERYTHING you need to mount it with and do not wrinkle when you fold it.  If I needed a second one I would certainly buy it again!
5,I got this hoping it would work well enough for me to use to watch movies outside with the kids. I was very skeptical because it was a good price point and some other reviewers weren‚Äôt happy with it. I‚Äôm happy to report that it does it‚Äôs job well!
5,It's nice 4 a budget screen works well even with light just have to have a good projector what I didn't like the cheap hooks and it's way bigger than what it looks like
5,This is a great screen of outdoor movie and game nights.¬†The fabric it stretchy so it‚Äôs easy to tie up with ropes and get any wrinkles out.¬†The included rope hooks and sticky strips will allow you to set it up anywhere.¬†It works great for my purpose of having an outdoor screen much easier than using a a plain white sheet.¬†I would recommend it.
5,Love this screen. Easy to put up and easy to take down. It's perfect
5,Great screen!! Easy to put up and never has wrinkles every being folded up and put away. Not too many holes to secure up but stretches and we get a smooth clear picture!
5,This screen is awesome it never wrinkles and sure makes our movie watching lots more fun.
5,Very good for the price. Loved all the accessories that were provided to hang on different surfaces. Very convenient.
3,es facil de transportar pero el armar es un poco dificil por su tama√±o
3,Great product!!! Would definitely recommend brought a-lot of mounting material
5,Good material. No creases. Very stretchy. Bought for outdoor movie watching. Did the job well!
5,I expected a wrinkle free sheet with attachemnts for hooks ECT... So I could use it a as a dual purpose curtain & projector screen to use more of my tiny house's floor space. Overall I am Very Happy with my Chrismas present to myself!In the past I have used cheap shower curtains for projector screens and run into the unfortunate issues of:-wrinkles in your movie-A glare because it was too shiny-Or worse you find out it is too thin so what's behind it bleeds through to your picture.Pros:-Full set of attachments to stretch out projector screen for permanent placement with sticky backs to attach to a wall or nails. (Didn't use) Pretty straitforward on how to install Find area big enough for screen then hang it.-Solid metal eyeholes with black double stitched fabric around edges.-Right color of white for contrasting dark movies not to dark or shiny.-Thick enough to get a good picture.-In my price range.If you read ALL the info and know you are basically buying a really really nice sheets with all the attachments you need for a projector then you will be pleased with purchase. It is NOT one of the higher price screens that have a light reflective center layer.I like doing outdoor showings over the summer so I look forward to trying it out when it warms up. So update if I run into any issues.
5,This is awesome. Bought two 1x4 cut it to 108 inches and  painted them black. I then stapled the screen to the back and hung it with 3 screws. The weight of the second 1x4 stretched out the screen perfect with no wrinkles. Comes down easily if needed. I also put bluetooth surround sound speakers attached right to the wood. Love this. You can't beat this for the price. Total to make this with screen was about $40. Home depot will even cut the wood for you.
5,I wish this would be easier to install but the color is as good as my projector will allow. Wish I would have read review that it does include poles.
5,It was a gift so I can‚Äôt give a review on it
5,Good product for home projection. Very happy with my purchase
5,The perfect screen never had any problems I use it outside when I wanna watch my movies at night
5,The hooks it comes with aren't the greatest but the screen is very nice and it's large enough to hosts parties and game nights with. Tried w 2 separate projectors and both looked fantastic picture wise with the screen and colorsno extra shadows or issues with lights.
5,I bought this for outdoor use. I built a freestanding frame out of 1-1/2" PVC. The elastic material makes it super easy to hang. Material has weight without being too heavy. Seems to be a nice projection surface.
5,Let's just say I got one before this oneI wish I would have gotten this one before.The set up is simple and the hooks for this one is more secure and easy no holes in the walls.Best purchase on Amazon.
4,Wish the holes weren‚Äôt so far apart but it‚Äôs works good. It‚Äôs really big so make sure you have adequate space.
5,image looks good with no glare
