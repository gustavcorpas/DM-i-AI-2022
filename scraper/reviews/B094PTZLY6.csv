5,I like the length of the charging cable. It allows me to use my phone in the kitchen easily
4,mine are 3.5 inches short of being 10ft but they charge my phone and my computer recognizes my devices when using this cord.
5,This work really good worth the money
5,Funciona bien y es compatible con iPhone
5,Wonderful
4,It works. Bought it for my older Iphones the fit perfectly. Had no problem with the charging.
4,They easily allow charging throughout my home and for flexible travel.
5,Affordable and Working perfectly fine
5,Charging phones in living room area
5,This cable is worth the price point.
4,It charges great however one of the charger I have to keep pushing into the charger port because it keeps coming out
5,The cords work perfectly and are long enough for me to use my phone and not be against the wall.
5,Good quality and good price paid for the 10 ft. charging cords
5,I like them. They work good
5,Pleased with product
5,Recharging our phones
4,Cheap and handy it’s a must have for those day when your brand charger fails or let behind on a trip. Not too bad
5,I like the length of the cord. It meets my expectations.
5,Very good
5,the cheapest pack of oem apple chargers i could find!!
5,I loved the fact that it is 10’!  I needed one that could reach from an outlet (I live in an old but cozy house) that are few and far between!!
5,I use the product every day and love the long length and fast charging. Wish I did this a long time ago.
5,Add phone chargers around home.
5,Me encanta este producto porque es muy largo y porque tiene USB
5,They work!  Better than the last cords purchased.Seem to be good quality and durable.
5,Charges quick
5,They arrived within 1 day and work great
5,Excelente inversión. Bien largos
5,Great cables
5,Great customer service! Excellent fast charger!!
3,Used about two months and one of the cords stopped connecting or charging my new pro max 13
5,Charges my devices well and I love the extra long cords I can drag it all over my bedroom.
5,I don't understand why the chargers they give you for the iPhone and iPod disintegrate no matter how well you take care of them but for some reason they break down at both ends! I found these here on Amazon and they were well priced for 3. Plus the cords are super-long - no more leaning over the arm of the sofa reading emails while my phone is plugged into the wall! The charging power and speed is the same as it is with the one that comes with the Apple product so if you're looking for a replacement charger I highly recommend these!!
3,One of the cords did not charge right had to wiggle it for it to work
5,Cables look sturdy and charge pretty quickly
3,One out of the three chargers I purchased stopped working
5,Needed a long cord for traveling in Europe.  Can never count on power point being close to head of the bed.
5,Very durable.
5,really good
4,Bought these so I could use CarPlay in a new (2021) Jeep but the phone only shows up as an "iPod" and doesn't give any options to use CarPlay. They're nice and long and charge just fine.
5,They’re a good bang for your Buck..
4,If your device has a case on it you have two options. 1. Grind back some of the plastic tip ( to install with a case) then it will fit no problems. Use caution.2.  Plug this into your phone without a case.3.  At times it seems it takes longer to charge but I did not time the charging time.
4,This is the perfect cord. If you need to plug in a device while using it the extra length helps with that. Durable and works fine
5,buena calidad
5,As described
5,
5,Great
5,Good
4,Only reason that I did not give 5 stars is the adapter that is needed was not included. I’ve ordered 2 adapters but had to return because cable did not fit. Would have been nice if option was available to get so that you have the correct adapter.
5,I like it because I can plug it almost anywhere!!!
3,Not compatible for Apple car play. I have an IPhone 12 Pro Max and it won’t charge consistently. It will connect and reconnect on its own when connected to vehicle. I tried it with different cable and it worked fine.
5,Product meets my needs of having a longer length
4,Average charging speed average durability great price for 3 chargers.
5,Love them
5,These are pretty efficient. So far I like the chargers!
5,perfect length for my iphone n color is perfect
4,The quality seems ok the cord works ok to charge. Not as fast as Apple equipment cord will not fit into new Apple fast charging cube. Works good in the car since cord is 6 feet
5,Good cord fast shipping
5,Good value and good quality used for cell phone
3,I love that they are 10 ft long and they do provide charge BUT as you can see from the photo the charger does not sit all the way in charging port securely. This sucks because they constantly fall out. Disappointed.. I was really excited for these.
5,I love the length it allows me to move a lot. It still charges fast after couple month
2,Love the long length of the cord but have had them for just over a month and 2/3 Have stopped working!! You get what you pay for u guess :/
4,Perfect length for charging
5,Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the charging cord.  My husband even had to order his own set after I got mine.  I’ve gotten the corded wrapped ones but they never seemed to last long as at the part that goes into the phone it would come loose and slide off
5,Perfect length for bedroom charger. Durable and charges fast. Doesn’t heat up or anything.
5,So far so good! Great value for the money! Nice long cords. Exactly what I wanted; one for my vehicle living room and bedroom!
5,Good charger love  the convenience of length
5,We were constantly replacing cords for our boys as they would use their phones plugged in reg cords to short so they were always pulling/extending on their devices the cords always bent/broke at the area u plug phone in so these r plenty long enough we don’t have that problem and so should last forever ! 3 boys at home so this being a 3 pk worked perfect !
5,I really like the quick charging ability!
2,2 of the 3 cables didn't work. Not worth the hassle of returning to a UPS store to return.
2,I’m not sure if the ones I bought had a defect of some sort but after a week of using any of them they would just stop charging on their own. Honestly at a loss for what happened to them. Ended up getting one $10 charger from Walmart that’s works great.
5,I love the fact is does not take a long time to charge and the length of the cord is great. Not too long or too short.  I can lay in bed and still reach it easily. Very good value and would recommend it.
5,I want to call it lightning charging but it does charge pretty fast
5,it's durable  and charge's my phone fast
3,ok buy
5,No issues and love how long they are!
3,The cord is super long
3,These were given to me for Christmas but they are way too short for my needs.  Don't have the packaging to send them back.
5,Good buy long reach good quality items.
3,IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A THREE PACK BUT I ONLY GOT TWO
5,I like the 10 ft. Charging cables I ordered for my iPhone. They work great so far.
5,Charges wonderfully.  Very nice
5,Used to charge Apple products. Good value the money. Only time will tell how long they will work.
3,The cables are a lot thinner than I thought they would be.The charging power is average- not fast but not too slow.
5,phone charging????? !!!!!!!!
5,Very nice charger cords.
5,Finally a cord that allows you to actually use your device while charging— not being tethered to the standard 3ft cord is great
5,Great product
5,So glad to have received the cords they are great and the length is exactly what I wanted
5,Love it
5,We’ve been using these for over a month now with no problems and happy with quick charge.
5,Muy buenos e utiles
5,I enjoy these because the are extra long.
5,I am very pleased with this charger the length is great and the durability of the cord so far seem to be good.
5,Fabulous
5,Exactly as described.  Works well and a great value.
5,Would highly recommend
5,The cord is actually very long and charges good its not as fast as the original one but then again its quite long so that's to be expected of it.
5,No comment at this time
5,Phone and wonder boom items came quickly
5,Que es bastante largo
5,excellent
5,I am at college so having long cords are essential. None of them have broken or have a short in them and they're true to length.
5,Just as described
5,Perfect Product!!! I have gifted my friend 1 of the 3 chargers that arrived in purchase. 10ft chargers seems generic and works just as well as as the 3ft charger.
5,We’ll worth the money.
5,Like the size
1,Sending these back these chargers are not I repeat ARE NOT for IPhones. I’m giving 1 star because I never used them didn’t fit my phone but I can’t submit the review without hitting a star rating
5,Bought to take to the hospital for when I have my baby. Everyone recommended.
5,I love long cords
5,I love the chargers.
2,Title says 3 pack but I got one single charger lol
5,Love the length  fast reasonably priced
5,I liked this product it arrived on time thanks to the seller and to whom I delivered it.
1,Did not want the iPhone charger to be plugged into picture #3.  I wanted it to be plugged into a charging block like in picture #1.
5,They have worked ever sense I bought them. They are very long!!!!
5,Excelente te
5,I am very happy with these cords. Good quality and value.
2,Really bad quality there not charging anymore and I bought them on February of this year
3,I haven’t had these very long and the cord is already splitting.
5,Product exceeded expectations.
5,These chargers work great. So far no issues.
5,Real apple product
1,When I first received the chargers I was excited because it came in a pack of 3 and 10 feet long but they did not last! The most they last was probably 1 month and afterwards they wouldn’t charge anymore.
5,Love the reliability and length
5,Love it
5,Charging
2,Charger is loose when connected. You have to double check to see if your phone is charging. If you charge your phone while using it I’d stay away from this charger.
1,Liked the price BUT it was a waste of money. Didn’t work on some of my Apple products. Worked intermittently and lacked power. Other manufacturers are much better.
1,Awful! We used 2 chargers (for my kids) they both stopped charging a little over 30 days after having them.
1,Does not connect well don’t waste your money.
1,The 10ft cord seems great but it failed to charge my daughters iPad properly. I didn’t expect for it to charge the iPad as quick as an apple charger but I did expect it to charge at a nice paste. Had my daughters iPad plugged in for maybe 30 minutes where even a dollar tree charge would charge it at at least 10-15% this charger charged it at only 3%. Total trash and waste of money where I thought I was getting a great deal it’s no wonder they were on special. DO NOT BUY!
1,They wasn’t any good
1,They did not work with my tablet.  They worked with my IPhone 11 depending upon which outlet I used.  The cord length is great.
1,I’m just gonna say…. They don’t work. Waste of money!
2,The end of the cable that plugs into the phone is thinner than a normal cable. It will work but you need to wiggle it around to get it to charge. If you move it the charging stops
1,It’s been 2 months! All of them have broken like in the picture!
1,Worked fine for a few months. Now two out of three won’t charge.
2,One of the cords lasted about one week very disappointed.  Not charging phones. Not worth it.
1,Does not charge phone and cable cuts out power
1,Stopped working after 1st use.
1,These did not work with my iPhone. There was no charging power at all.
1,Only one cord worked and it took almost two hours to charge my iphone fully. Waste of money and not worth the gas money to drop off the return. I threw them all away. I wouldn't recommend this item.
1,None of these worked
1,These do not last. One never worked one stopped working after a month and the third one just stopped working after less than 2 months of use. Lesson learned. You get what you pay for.
1,I bough these cords for my home as they were apple approved which put my mind at ease. About a week later they stopped working. They were not damaged in anyway. Not pulled on or wrinkled and they just stopped working. Very misleading product. Do not buy.
1,This product does not charge your phone but rather takes away the battery percentage. Horrible product don’t buy .
1,I wish I could give this less than 1 star. After a couple weeks 2 of the 3 chargers don’t work. They barely get used and don’t work. I want my money back
1,One didn’t work the day I got them. One lasted about a week. One lasted about a month.
1,It’s advertised as a fast charging lighting cable but it’s by no means that. If you are looking for a fast charge you will not get it by purchasing this cable.
1,Within a week of purchasing all of them were broken
1,The charger that is shipped is NOT the charger that is shown. I was not able to use right away and had to order a different block.
1,NONE of the chargers worked as soon as I opened the box and plugged them in. Also wouldn't even stay in my phone and it says they work for the phone I have so...? I'll pay the $ for Apple brand from now on. Returning ASAP.
1,Please don’t waste your money the only positive is that the cord is long definitely not comparable to an Apple charger
1,These are listed as iPhone 13 compatible but they are not. The new iPhone 13s have a different plug on them! I use 2 cords 1 by the bed & 1 at my desk so I need a 2nd one so I don’t use just one for 100% of the time!
1,Really Bad quality. Purchased on February 22 and on April 1 one of the cables stopped working. Return window passed and I can’t return them.
1,Stop charging my phone less than two weeks after purchasing the product. The last time i used the charger it was actually draining my battery while plugged in.
1,Not satisfied at all two of them quit working almost immediately could see no damage to cords they just wouldn’t charge at all
1,This is the only charging cord I’ve owned that wiggles around while being plugged in and the cord falls out of the phone very easily.  Throwing these out and ordering from somewhere else.
1,I liked the price and the length however three of them lasted noLonger than a week or a little past a week.  One of them lady’s only an hour.  They cannot be genuine Apple chargers
1,Did not charge constantly. Had to jiggle wire constantly.
1,Only worked one day ;(
1,DONT WORK WHEN YOU PLUG THEM IN IT SAYS “LIQUID DETECTED” and WHEN YOU USE A DIFFERENT CHARGER IT GOES AWAY these SUCK!!!
1,First of all it’s not rapid as it claims to be. The quality is very cheap.
1,All three stopped working within weeks. I tried to return and they sent me another 3 pack. I returned those without even trying.
1,Phone doesn’t even recognize that anything was plugged in.
1,It didn’t work after 2day
1,This said it would work on an IPhone 11 Pro Max. It does not plug into the charger base I’ve got that phone!!!
1,Terrible charging cords-don’t buy
1,THEY DON’T FIT TIGHT & KEEP BECOMING LOOSE WITHOUT TOUCHING
1,One cable wasn’t working at all the other 2 only few days. Don’t buy
1,It stopped working in a week… waste of money
1,Product worked fine for about a week or two. All 3 stopped working after two weeks.
1,Checked all 3 none charged my phone and when it said my phone was charging it didn’t continue to charge
1,I just bought this charging cables and they take hours to charge definitely not worth my money.
1,Stopped charging after a couple weeks of use
1,I just received it through the mail & the moment I went to use it it won’t even charge!
1,I received these on September 1. Two fo the tree have already failed. They war very very fragile.
1,Does not fit I phone 7
1,This product doesn’t work
1,Does not charge phone.
1,It worked a few days
1,The cable stop charging my phone after a week of usage
1,Not worth 2 centsCheaply madeWires popped throughMetal charger broke offJunk
1,None of the 3 chargers I got work
1,Horrible ones - avoid
5,Charging my phone. Sometimes when you’re traveling the plugs are not available but with 10 feet of cord easy to hook up your phone
1,Not working
1,Doesn’t work after a day
5,Estoy satisfecha con esta compra que realize
5,Phone
5,Many of these off brand chargers are terrible quality but that is not the case for these. These are actual solid & quality chargers. Gotta give these people a hand. Just when I was beginning to lose faith in off-brand charging cords - BAM - these guys come in and save the day… Also 10ft length is great for charging your phone on the toilet 🚽
4,You can tell the cables are not the most amazing quality and the lightning end on one of the cables only works on one side (have to flip it when connecting to the phone) but other than that they are nice and long and charge the phone right.
5,Exactly what we needed for a great price and delivery was fast!!
5,We got this really long couch. This cord running underneath is not a tripping hazard and allows us both to charge and not re-arrange the lamps little computer table and other stuff already in the power strip. It’ll take a while to learn about it’s durability
5,La longitud es excelente
5,Now I never have trouble finding a charger. The length of the cords is so convenient while laying in bed.
5,Good length/ charging power ok
5,I love the fact that they’re 10 feet long they work perfectly and they are great for the money I would definitely buy again
5,When our other name brand cords stopped charging these did the trick. My son actually bought the three pack and sold the other two to his sisters.
5,Great value
2,These chargers give out after a few days or weeks in some cases. I don’t recommend this product at all if you’re looking for a long lasting product. It isn’t worth your money.
5,Arrived quickly and well packaged. Great value for number of cords & blocks included. Only just started using them... so far so good.
5,Perfect for my car for road trip can go all the way from the front to the back
5,Chargers do what they are designed to do. Charging time is pretty quick. Cords are durable hence should last a while. Got them as extras for a plethora of Apple 🍎 products owned by my family. I recommend.
4,Great cable length for charging devices in the car and in the office and in the home
5,Fair price. Good quality
5,The product met my needs
5,These chargers are the best I’m not even playing they charge super fast and the don’t rip easily
5,Have only had for a week or so I will have to let you know in a couple months if I still feel the same as I do right now. I looked specifically for an Apple approved cord this time as the many others I have purchased didn’t last more than 6 months before they wouldn’t register on my devices anymore.
5,Good value  good quality
5,buena calidad y precio
5,I can roam my room while on a call without asking what the other person said multiple times. The cords are loooong 10’ long! They charge as fast as the original iPhone cord I had and I got 3 for less than $15. Buy it.
5,bad packaging but durable
5,Must order this if you have a iPhone long cord charge fast
5,I gave as gifts but I like the length and the price
5,Nice cords
5,These cables fit well after Having to replace the cables that came with the phone and decided to go for something longer and more durable.
5,cords work great
5,Product is just as described. Thumbs up 👍🏼
5,10 foot charger cable package deal. Great price. Well made and supple. My iPhone is charging as I write this.
2,They quit working with hardly any use.
5,These work great and they charge very fast.  Great value!
5,I was surprised how long the cords are! And they are not flimsy value. Definitely would buy again.
5,Great chargers

5,Having to replace the cables that came with the phone and decided to go for something longer and more durable. These cables fit the ask well.
5,I like the 3 pack because I can keep one in house and one in the car
5,They work as they should for the price of 1 not 3.
5,so good for daily usage
5,The cover for my iPhone is small and most cords don't fit but this cord works perfectly and charges fast.
5,It is good quality and the cord is very long which I like .

5,One of the best product I have got till now
1,It takes 10 mins to 1% charge
5,I use in my car at home and in my Office!I use an iPad and I phone!
5,Wow. Long cable’. Fonctionne bien avec le iPad mini plus capricieux sur les choix de fils.
5,Great price and works just like OEM
5,This is great for apple iPhone iPad has a nice long cord.
5,Working for now!
1,Waste of money. Used 1 in my living room and 1 in my bedroom and in a month bath stopped charging.
4,Câbles très pratiques pour le chalet
5,The charging cord makes a positive connection when plugged in and starts charging immediately. I replaced the original charging cord that came the phone; it tended to have a flakey connection and sometimes charging stopped. I have only had the cords a few weeks so it is too early to comment on the durability.
