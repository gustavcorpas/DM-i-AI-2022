5,Unlike other cases you can actually see the LED charge light and press the button on the back. Definitely worth the money.
4,Product was not the same color as what was shown. Color was a lot brighter. But other than that the material is nice and I am satisfied with the order.
5,This is a nice cost effective case! Love it
5,I like that my AirPods are secure I have dropped it a few times and it keeps it from scratches. As well as getting discolored from being in my jeans. Sometimes I use the keychain part to hang from my Jean loop holes.
4,Like color and weight
5,My son loves it and the glowing in the dark really helps
4,It’s great but the clip broke about week after I got it which I was really sad about specially because the whole reason I wanted to buy new case but then I started noticing that the case started ripping and the top of the case wouldn’t stay on and kept falling off DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!
5,Awesome when just wanting to add your AirPods to a keychain. Easy to remove and reattach. Minimal design.  Does not bill up the AirPods. I’d recommend
5,They fit over my AirPods case cute bright pink.
5,Durable and looks nice
4,Hooks onto my keys cute color
5,Color and design as expected !
5,Using for air pod 2nd generation
5,Love this case. You can’t beat the price. I love you can attach it to things and has been very durable! Would buy again.
4,I’ve had my case for almost a year and it’s been great! Has protected my AirPods and the case itself still looks good! The only issue is that my case has grown over time? It was very tight and hard to put on when I first bought it. Now my AirPods can slide out very easily if I’m not careful.
5,Overall this is a nice silicone case for AirPods. It fits snug and protects the original case. I find the price to be fair based on the quality of the item. The carabiner included is not heavy duty but does the job. I’ll definitely purchase another once this one wears down or gets too dirty - it’s worth the price.
5,I got these as an alternative to more expensive ones so far I can’t complain! They easily fit my basic AirPod case and make them easier to keep track of. Has a hole at the bottom for easy charging. The carabiner has potential to fall off but hasn’t been an issue for me yet.Also as a side note the hot pink one glows in the dark if it’s been exposed to light.
4,Honestly felt paying too much for the quality of the case. It's a very simple rubber case. The rubber is very thin and probably rips easily. I think the price is too much for the simple case.
5,Glued in the dark. Easy to find in my bag.
5,It looks like it did in the picture!
5,Works as listed. Love the color
4,The silicone works perfectly as a case for your AirPods and makes it easier to grip/spot but I’m deducting a star because the carabiner it came with broke immediately so I had to go and buy my own from a different brand.
5,This is the perfect AirPods case! The top cover piece is attached to the body which means there’s no chances of losing one piece (an issue I had with my last case). The silicon is a good thickness that will definitely protect AirPods from falls dings and scratches. I also love the purple it’s so cute.
5,The silicon fits snuggly and does not move. Great product!
4,It seems to be working great so far.  I’d buy another one if needed.  Not a bad product
5,Fit perfectly and does glow
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This case is super cute and I love that it comes with a keychain although it’s super cute there is a little spacing between the top and bottom but other than that it’s great!!
4,Beautiful color my favorite of them all is the Pastel Green.  It fits wonderfully over my 2nd gen pods and remains secure.  I haven't had any issues.  When you are out an about the added carabiner is a nice addition to attach your pods to a bag/purse etc.
4,The case has a small part where it doesn't wrap all the way around other than that it's a good case I recommend it
4,Hard to find reliable silicon air pod cases but its lasted me quite a while and isn't going anywhere
5,Muy utiles y protegen los airpods
5,Great product pretty color!
5,What a great product for my case  fit and finish are perfect.  You won’t regret get them.
5,Perfect case
5,For those who are looking for a sleek protective and especially good looking case with carabiner then this one is perfect at its price. I got the black color and in the pictures it also shows that I have the Matte rose gold metal guard cover on the inside. The case itself is a very matte black color which is a nice touch and the carabiner is a matte copper color just like in the pictures. I've actually purchased a lot of ELAGO products and they're amazing quality wise and customer service wise which I will touch on more below. You can refer to the pictures that I have attached as you read the rest of the review.Overall fit / finish: 8/10For the price that your paying this rating kinda is reasonable. I've seen many reviews about the top lid case not being sticky enough to the AirPods lid so that they come off every-time but it doesn't happen to me at all. There is anti-slip coating on the inside of the case and that's what keeps the case stuck onto the AirPods it seems to me as if individuals that complained about the "grippiness" of the case simply touched the coating on the inside of the case too often.With regards to the fit this is where I took off a point. Because the case is this plastic/silicon type no matter what you do there will be this small gap between the opening of the case which may trigger the OCD in individuals. To remove the gap you pretty much have to push up on the silicon case from the bottom up and it will remove the gap temporarily. In addition another place where I took off a point is with the silicon type case itself. Because it is silicon it will attract a TON of dust and it will stick to your case constantly. I suggest if you buy it then you should not put it in your pocket or where there is huge dust accumulation. Keep in mind that most other AirPods case companies that sell their case in silicon material will have equal and if not worse dust attraction so this issue is not an uncommon one.Company / Customer service: 10/10This is one of the main reasons that I choose ELAGO to buy many of my apple related accessories. If I have any issue even minor I can easily reach the customer service and they will reply instantly to address the issue. When I first ordered this case it didn't come with a carabiner so I contacted Elago customer service and within 3 hours I had a confirmation tracking number for a brand new case plus a carabiner sent to me.Conclusion:Pick this case as it will suit what you need to do. If you receive it and you notice a defect don't be afraid to contact ELAGO customer service as they will promptly fix and address your issues.
5,Fits very nicely.
4,Perfect fit nice case but my daughter didn't like the color of the carabiner. She uses a different one.
4,I like this color and overall product but it came with the small keychain and not the bigger brown one.
5,Good. Does the job. I’ve had mine for about 8 months now
5,I love this case
5,It's a simple rubbery case.  Great color - fully and safely covers my Airpods.  I like the hook too.  It's cheap and great.
5,It fits well and is true color as described. My daughter loved her so she bought this for her dad and he loves it too.
3,If the case moves in motion of any kind and the lid will come open and pods come out of case
5,Easy to keep clean and super cute!!! love it
4,I love this case and the clip is really great quality.
4,I like the case but the clip is very cheap. Broke  within the first hour.  Color is nice and fits tight.
5,Good buy
5,Pretty colors. Has a clip so you can hang on your purse. East to hook up and use. Love them
5,Great case helps me find the AirPods in my purse
5,The other cases from Amazon I’ve purchased have been flimsy silicone leading me to think all cases were like that. Until I ordered this one specifically for the pretty pale pink color. This actually feels more sturdy and better in quality it’s also not as hard to clean as I thought it would be
3,I have received a better quality one for a lower price so I was actually disappointed with how little quality this one had I like the color it makes my AirPods very easy to find but I wish it did have a bottom cover and fit my AirPods a bit better.
4,Se oxida muy rápido
4,The case is green and super pretty. However doesn’t have a spot to hold the hook
5,Love the mint green color. Inexpensive but good quality. Fast delivery.
5,LOVE the keychain it came with and the color is amazing.
5,Very durable
5,Just what I needed.  I love my case.
4,It was actually a really good purchase well worth it and a great price. The only downside is that it was silicone which means everything like dirt and hair or even crumbs stick to it and it’s difficult to clean off but of course that’s not the sellers fault. It’s protective and really cute!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My air pods don’t slide out and you Can see the green light! In love
5,I purchased this in green and it's super cute! It fits the airpod case well and doesn't slide off easily which I like! Seems like it's going to do a good job protecting the case.
5,
5,Mint green is my new favorite color and these are perfect!!! Always wanted a case for my AirPods and I think I’ll keep this one on it for a while. They’re super cute and durable! Worth it for the price!
5,it is strong it took a while for my chewing to break it.
5,Exactly like the picture -- got it for my mom for Mother's Day just perfect :)
5,I wouldn't recommend doing what I do. But I hang the case on my keychain and it works 100%. I've had this for almost 6 months now and it never failed. And I've dropped my keys a bunch of times as well!
5,I love the color and the texture of the silicone. The only think which I didn’t like was the exposed charging port but otherwise it’s super cute and functional :)
5,Great purchase!
4,I like this case however it dose not cover the whole body of my AirPods. There are a few little parts where they are not protected by the case. One other thing is that if you put the case in tour pocket stuff like lint and fuzz sticks to it. Other then that I love the case and the cute green color!
5,Simple case that looks good too. Love the color combo of the case and carabiner/ring. Fits well no gaps. I have it in my gym bag or clipped on my backpack and it stays pretty clean and no color fading. Does the job its made for.
5,Works great loe it
5,Glows blue and loons good
5,Good
5,Nothing
5,Color is exactly like the picture
4,I like it. One thing though that the bottom where the charger goes in isnt covered like my previous one’s.
4,This product was great lasted a good while but as always everything doesn’t last forever.
5,This. Is. A. Must. If you are looking at this product you are ludicrous like me and spent way too much money on AirPods. Which is fine because face it the AirPods are absolutely wonderful yet expensive. You don't want to lose those little beauties and despite what others say its not that hard to lose the things. This little sleeve will solve that problem. It has kept my case from getting scratched and beat up as well as helped me keep up with them. I can clip these to my belt loop to the inside of my pocket to the key holder in my book bag compartment and not have to worry about throwing another $159 down the drain. Because if your like me if you lose those AirPods you will be back at the Apple Store purchasing another pair.Once the sleeve is applied to the Airpods case its not easily coming off. I have not once had the rubber section come off of the top lid of the case. Also the clip and ring is not that cheaply made. Your not going to pull this thing out during a survival situation and expect it to sustain the weight of a small child but it may support the weight of a small yappy dog. The rubber area that the ring is connected to is rather thick. Its not going to break or rip easily if it were to get snagged.Buy this product of something similar if you own AirPods.
5,This case so far seems sturdy enough.
3,Good
4,Just like the picture shows
5,This is a beautiful case at a very reasonable price!
5,Perfect texture. Durable lightweight and I luv that I no longer have to hold the little flap open just to plug it in always felt it was unnecessary.
5,The yellow one looks really cute in person. And the matte material makes it look like a tiny egg omelette. 😂
4,The media could not be loaded.
4,It’s a cute case you need to put it in direct light for it to glow in the dark but I just use my phones flashlight. I love that it glows in the dark for times when I want to watch a movie at night and don’t want to have to turn on my lights to look for my AirPods. The only thing is that the top starts to become lose and fall off after a while but I think that’s the case for most silicone cases. Another thing I use the ring that comes with the case to put my house key and the metal against metal makes the paint fall off so the brown ring is more silver now
5,Good stuff for the price
4,I got the Black colored case with a bronze keychain which added a sleek modern look to my AirPods and everyday carry items. Clipping my AirPods to my bag or pants is a lifesaver as they can get easily misplaced or lost at least for me. If you have kids with AirPods this is definitely a must have accessory to give them. Trust me. It's a good stocking stuffer. The silicone protects the case well does not add more bulk. I didn't think a silicone case would look this great. I love the look of the AirPod case as it but this does feel like an upgrade. I got these on sale so it was well worth the price. Protect your case.
4,It does the job. I have had it for a week but i have not stressed it. The top didn't fit exactly but close enough forThe price. It does protect the case and that is the point!
5,I love this case! It fit perfectly looks just like the picture and I haven’t had any issues. The only thing that could be seen annoying by someone is the material and how it can get dirty easily but it comes off well also. 10/10 Recommend !
5,This case is perfect. It's like a hard silicone case that is cute and durable. I dropped it many times and nothing is damaged. You can still wirelessly charge them but you have to put them in the perfect position for them to charge. You can still push the button on the back and I didnt have any problems with the silicone hinge on the back either. The case is really easy to install and to remove. To remove it you just have to peel the top off and slide the bottom down. You can still see the LED light through the case too. It doesn't get that dirty and if it does you can just wipe it off. Overall this case is AMAZING and I am definitely  going to buy a silicone iphone case from this brand. Thanks elago!
5,It was perfect for what it is for. Bright pink. I love it
4,I personally got the mint-ish/olive green color which is pretty on point depending on the lighting. I’m very happy with the snug fit the clip is generic but overall effective for its purpose. My only complaint would be the back part that connects the top and bottom is a bit thin for my comfort and has a possibility of ripping over time. But considering how cheap the case is I’m really impressed and will consider buying again from this brand if/when it rips or breaks.
4,Everything fine except for the part where there is supposed to be an indent in the back for you to push the button for Bluetooth wish is kind of inconvenient. I could see some of the cases came with it and some didn’t on the review photos
2,The silicone or rubber got dry and the entire case just started to fall apart and peel everywhere. It also didn’t fit that great and was hard to get on and off. Lasted for not very long!
3,on the picture it had a hole for the keychain and the keychain was a circle but when it first arrived and I opened it it didn’t have a keychain hole and the keychain itself didn’t look anything like the picture. but everything else was good.
3,Tore up when trying to slide onto my case so I bough a hard case and like it much better.
3,Overall the product is good. The silicone seems durable and it came with a carabiner. However the case itself is missing a key ring to attach the carabiner to so I can’t clip it to anything which defeats the purpose.
5,Great product
5,Okay I love this color I got!!! it is everything. I am really hard on my AirPods cases and they always tear so I feel like I am buying these a lot and this one has not torn once and I have had it for months!!! I definitely recommend these
5,I wasn’t sure what what type of case I wanted. I looked at some of the more expensive competition but decided to purchase this after an online recommendation. I wanted to keep the AirPods slim but add some protection. Originally I didn’t want the carabiner but it’s a nice addition to put on my backpack when I travel. It also gives it some camouflage in black to not let it stand out as much. The carabiner gives it a little bit of color to help spot it in my car too. The carabiner gives it a little bit of color to help spot it in my car too. It fits well and looks good. This is after carrying it in my jacket pocket today. You’ll notice it does pick up some lint. A damp paper towel will remove the lint.
4,👍🏻 PROS ⭐️+ Very cute!!! I ordered the pink and in person it is a very soft liiight pink a lot lighter than the stock photo.+ Comfortable to hold the silicone is very smooth and soft which makes for a better grip too!+ Good fit! Read that others think it isn't a perfect fit but the case fits my AirPods without any gaps after coaxing the top and bottom parts of the case together with some pressure.👎🏻 CONS 💢- The carabiner feels very cheap and it arrived broken for me. Luckily for me I had no plans to keep it on my case but this may be a problem for anyone who actually wants to use it.- Since the case is purely silicone durability may be an issue down the road but given the price I wouldn't mind purchasing a replacement.📋 OVERALL ⭐️I would rate this case 4.5 stars minus 0.5 for the carabiner issue. All in all this case is really worth it for its price!
5,Always good for on the go and many colors to choose from
5,Nice simple case. It fit my airpods perfectly. The only downside is that the carabiner clip feels pretty cheap but the case is worth it.
5,Super cute and no issues what so ever!
5,It fits perfect and has good grip
5,It's a nice case it protects my airpods and that's what I wanted plus it's not too bulky so it's still perfect pocket size and the color is pretty nice to.
4,There isn't a dust cover which I didn't realize when buying and was quite disappointed about. Aside from that the case fits nearly perfectly and is the exact color I wanted.
5,Does what it needs to do. My son loves having it hanging from his belt loop for quick access.
3,This doesn’t fit exactly right. I’m a little concerned whether I can use this traveling or moving locations which I do for work. I may have to buy something else
4,I really like this case. It fits snugly but was still easy to put onto the Airpods case. The pink color is very light which I like. The flap that holds the top piece to the bottom and allows the case to open is very thin and I'm afraid it might rip. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because there is a small scratch coming from the keychain insert to the top of the bottom piece. The scratch does not go all the way through but it's a weak area and just a matter of time before it rips. I would return it and get a replacement but I'm going on vacation and want the protection of the case. I will buy another perhaps in a different color when I return. I'll update my review once I receive the next.Overall it's really cute feels soft and smooth and will provide protection.Pics attached showing the scratch color and the thin part that attaches the top to the bottom.
4,I used this for my AirPods ofc and they work good
5,Just got the case in the mail and will update if need to. At first was expecting to return the case because of a small gap at the front between the lid and body. When I was taking the case on and off to try for a better fit the lid would open and I think that potentially put stress on the hinges so I held the lid shut while manipulating the case afterward.I worked/massaged the case and now the shoe fits.Feels nice in the hand. Will see if and when the case stretches out or attracts dust.Cardboard box it came in was nice in the same spirit as Apple products.
3,Loved the color and fit for case is great but the clip is weak and broke within a week of using it.
3,I am a little disappointed I can’t clip it anywhere. The reason I got it was to clip it onto my purse.
4,Very cute
5,My Daughter loved it thank you.
4,(update at bottom) I work outside so I love having a cover to make sure the case doesn’t get an insane amount of scratches and the material gives it a grip so that it doesn’t slip out of my hand or slide around a table. Having the keychain is awesome too because I can keep the case Hooked on my side to allow quick access to my AirPods. My only issue is that the cover doesn’t completely wrap the case leaving a line where the case opens. It’s not the end of the world just doesn’t look as pretty as the advertised photos.(Updated) after 4 months I still have the same opinion on the material but the build is less than I hoped. After 4 months the cover ripped apart from the bottom half of the case. Im not too surprised since I'm moving around outside a lot so if youre an indoor person the case should definitely last longer.
5,Love the color! It’s very smooth and dresses up my AirPods.
5,This is a great fit on my airpods. I wouldn't say that this is going to protect it if I drop it but it will protect it from scratches or small dings.
3,I like this product if you are looking for a solid colored silicone case. I ordered 2 and both had the key ring missing so I was disappointed!
5,I am so impressed with such an inexpensive product. I use my AirPods on a daily basis for work but I kept misplacing them and they’d fall more often than they should.This case allows for me to still charge it. The silicone fits right over the case without any space in between. And the colors are attractive. The best part is the clip that comes with it that is sturdy and is fully functional.It was shipped in a small box and packaged well.I highly recommend this product.
5,perfect fit helps me keep track of them by clip on.
5,My daughter likes this case because the cap/cover does not get detached.
3,Cute color and hardware but item not as pictured. No place to connect the clamp!
3,It didn’t come with a silicone holder for the keychain to hang/attach to.
4,This case is very sturdy and a snug fit so your case will not slide out of it  Great for traveling or just snapping on your purse or belt loop
4,If you have any OCD tendencies skip this item. It fits a little funky with a bit of the white airpod case still showing. With that being said I don't mind much and really enjoy the texture/color!
5,Great color
5,Only problem was the little clip that can attach to anything it feel once but it didn’t break it’s great and the case is it a good price
3,The case itself is great but the keychain clip broke after one use
5,color is so cute! looks great
5,Love that the case allows a better grip of the AirPods. Also keeps the case from getting marked up and cleaner. The key ring also allows a great way to put the AirPods on a key fob for travel.
5,The carabiner did not hold up but the case is great
5,I live to color. Looks very sturdy
4,I really like this case for my airpods. it fits really nicely. If you are using this for daily carry then if is perfect it looks simple but fits with most outfits. I switched the carabiner with my personal one because I work in the delivery service so I need it to withstand frequent tugs or when it get caught when carrying items. Overall I recommend this if you want a case.Only con I work as a delivery guy and so when it gets snagged on something and because the case is rubber it occasionally opens my airpod case.
5,I like that it’s very smooth and it doesn't get dust stuck to it
5,Well worth it and it’s made well. And look nice
4,I recently lost my Airpods at the local WOB and thought I was out 150 bucks. It appears that I may visit there too often as the girls remembered me and saved my airpods for my next trip in. Unfortunately I had to move 2.5 hours away so I no longer am able to visit WOB :(. Without my bartenders looking out for my costly electronics when I become forgetful I needed a new plan and bought this case. I can snap this case on my keychain or my key ring in my timbuktu/backpack when I'm out. It does its job and I haven't misplaced them since. The silicon type material attracts hair and dust like a magnet though so watch out for that.If any Viera WOB bartenders are reading this - you rock and thank you.
5,Fits like a glove stays on my car keys and keeps everything in place. I will buy again!
5,me encanta y de verdad lo volvería a comprar es de calidad y protege mis AirPods
4,This has held up well overall and I like the clip that it came with. I use it everyday. After a couple of months I changed out to clip for a lobster claw like in a necklace because hubby and I kept mixing them up. The only complaint I have is that after 3 months of use the “hinge” is about to give out. It’s made If thinner rubber than the main body so it’s understandable but it will definitely have to be replaced once it goes because with it going in and out of my pocket everyday I’ll lose the top in no time. It is still good especially for the price I paid and it might not happen to you. Hubby’s still looks brand new but I’m pretty hard on my devices.
4,**Update: Increased my rating from 3 to 4 stars. I realized that I had to pull the sides of the case towards each other to 'close' the gap in between.Cute case but there was a small gap in between the 2 pieces. From the other photos that I see posted it seems like the two pieces are supposed to be touching when the case is closed. Not only that but the gap was bigger on one side than the other side. Minor disappointment but I got it for $7 during a lightning deal so not annoying enough to return it.
5,This was a great buy for everyday use. Love the colour it fits the case so well (it came with helpful instructions) and it’s durable as I’ve dropped the case a few times. The space for a cord at the bottom means I can easily charge it. Plus the key ring is ideal when in my handbag. It can be removed it not needed.
5,I was looking for a new color and realized I never left a review but I’ve had this case on my AirPods since September 2018 it can get a little dirty because of the material things get stuck to it but only inside my backpack if it’s just on my desk it doesn’t just randomly get dust stuck to it. It still looks perfect & I love the color. I have the purple. (: I am buying a new color from this seller.
5,glows a dark blue during the night and clear sparkle in the light. lid stays on nicely never comes off. i love this airpod case!!!
5,I love this! Shipping was super quick with prime 1 day to be exact. It has only gotten a little bit of light since I just opener it but it already has a little of glow. Can’t wait to see it when its fully glowing in the dark. The pictures reviews are pretty accurate so you get what you see. I changed the little rose gold hoop to a silver one since I didn’t like that color honestly. I would honestly buy again maybe a different color. This is also a great gift for someone with airpods.
5,it fits airpods 2 perfectly !! the case is very soft and easy to put on. the color is super pretty
3,The case came and I was pretty excited. When I opened it up it’s like what I thought it’d be like but when I put my AirPods charging case in it I was a little disappointed. It didn’t close very well as if one side was cut a little too much. The left side of the AirPods pastel green case did close well and cover up the AirPods but the right side didn’t. Though it’s fine I guess since it’s just $5.99 before tax.
5,Glows in the dark really well but because it’s silicone so the durability is alright since it isn’t a hard case
5,Bought this so I could keep my charging case on my water bottle at the gym. It does it's job perfectly.The case also prevents the charger from sliding around on tables/surfaces which is a nice bonus.
5,Very good product
5,Probably could find better but it’s good quality for the price
3,The case was okay but i mainly got it because it came with a keychain but it didn’t even have the keychain with it. So very disappointed but the case feels cool.
3,Good price case is fine but the keychain that would be holding my $100 ear buds broke before I can even put the earbuds in the case.
3,It's just ok.  The 'glow' is barely visible but does somewhat work.  It gets dirty really easy and looked a bit shabby in very little time.My entire AirPod case has fallen out of this a few times now.  Although this is not an issue with this case directly you might want to be aware that cases like these are not good to use on your belt or bag because it's way too easy for the top to flip open and the AirPods themselves to fall out.  It's happened to me often enough that I have to keep them inside of a bag or deep enough pocket.  I also have a case with a flap that closes securely with velcro.  I don't really like it because of the bulk and noise of velcro ripping open but it's the only case I trust to be outside of a bag or pocket.  I'd like to add that this case is still better than having no case at all on your AirPod case because the stock AirPod case is VERY slippery and will NOT stay in anything shorter than your grandpa's front trousers.
5,Love Love Love! The color is not as vibrant as the picture which is good i was going for a pastel yellow and it is a pastel yellow! I love it super durable and soft! At first when you slip the airpods in it will look like it doesn’t fit or they did a bad cut you just had to push the case further down as well as the top part and it will be a perfect fit! Such a great case!
4,The case itself fits AirPods case perfectly. By saying this I mean it is tight but not too difficult to put on. This includes both the main body and the cap.The only problem I have is with the carabiner. After you press onto the latch to open it the latch doesn't bounce back to position. If you forget to adjust it back to position by yourself things can happen. To me my AirPods case simply dropped to the ground when I was sitting in my cubicle. Fortunately it was my cubicle not on the street or some other random place. But be aware of that or you might lose your AirPods...
5,Loved the color affordable. So far I am happy with it
4,Four stars only because as time has gone on it has stretched out and no longer fits the top of my AirPods case. The glow is very bright and it’s been very durable thus far. I love it though and the glow is very helpful because I lose thing inside my bags all the time and it makes it easier to find more quickly (is attached to my car keys so it’s very helpful)
4,UPDATE:Okay I bumped up the rating to 4 stars as this is a good protection product for the iPods case it provides a good cushioning. Does not glow very bright but it does glow medium blue and sunlight makes it better to charge....................................I ordered the fitted rubbery case which has the inique Blue glow feature. However it hardly glows although I placed it under a bright lamp. Better under sunlight. However not sure really how long the charge lasts. If you dropped your pods in the dark I guess you could find them.It fits the air pods case.
4,This is Stan’s wife. My husband bought these for me as part of a birthday present AirPods of course and I just love the color. The skin is durable and I love that it personalizes the case as mine. The only problem I’ve had is that my 10’ charging cord doesn’t plug in to the case with the skin so I have to remove it but it does work with the regular cords.
5,I have had this specific case for my Airpods since September 2018 it's March 2020 and this case is still in such good shape. I travel a lot and they often float to the bottom of my bag are typically stored in the side pouch of my backpack that is exposed to rain and snow everything. I don't think there is a better case for your Airpods than these out there.
5,So cute
5,These are super cute and soft. I love them so much! So far they have held up well too.
5,After having this case for over a month it has held up great. I really like the silcone. It has made it so much easier to keep up with the case. The keyring isn't the best carabiner I have used but it is satisfactory.
4,the outside does a great job but the keychain attachment broke on day 2. I attached a D-ring and my own hardware and it is great. The hardware is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.
4,Cute and will do what I need it to: protect my investment. Pink was not exactly what I expected. It's a soft milky pale pink. Guess I was expecting more a deeper pearly pink like the photo. I did find that the top cover did not want to meet the bottom very well and after squeezing it together and pushing the main body of the AIr Pod case down deeper I found the top and bottom pieces of the protective case matched up. I like the carabiner option being able to clip it on even if it's inside my bag or purse is a bonus.
5,This is working great - I can clip it inside my purse and don't have to worry about it getting lost or slipping out unnoticed.  The white/glowing blue makes it easy to spot in my bag.  Seems durable enough but I'm not beating them up and they fit the case fine.  I wouldn't feel comfortable letting them dangle outside a bag or a backpack - some reviewers would clip them to belts or other insecure places?  That just sounds generally like a bad idea - if they don't fall off they are visible for thieves.  It keeps them secure and in one place inside my bag which is what I was looking for.
5,Fits perfectly. It also fits 90% of the way when I have my Tile Mate pushed down the front (you can see the top of the tile and a little bit of white from the AirPod case however it closes perfectly - side note: The Tile Sport is a bit big when pushed in there the Mate is fine). Really happy with this case the material is slip resistant feels comfortable in my hand / pocket AND it makes opening the AirPod case easier (was this a problem in the first place not really but this case certainly makes it easier). I'll be attaching it to the hook inside my workout bag (no more digging through everything trying to find my AirPods).
5,Love this case. Fairly thin and sleek. The color is gorgeous and the copper clip compliments it well. The fit is flush and stays put. Overall this is a great value and I couldn’t be more pleased with the purchase. Buy it!
4,Fits perfectly and color is beautiful. As others have noted due to the silicone material it attracts dust and dirt which is unpleasant.
4,fit my airpods well and looks super cute although i did get a different keychain ring than the picture but other than that it’s great
4,Pros:- Protects the AirPods case from scratches and some drop damage- The silicone case makes it easier to grip- The carabiner is very convenient to attach to your key chain or belt loopCons:- The mold/cut of the silicone case isn't 100% accurate (there's a small gap between the top and bottom pieces)- The silicone case attracts a lot of lint- The attachment point where the small ring the carabiner connects to is made of silicone too so I'm kind of worried it may deteriorate/break over timeOverall the price was right and I'm pleased with the purchase.
4,Case is okay at best
5,I have had this for 5 months I like the glow in the dark feature because i use my airpods in bed a lot and its easier to find them when i roll over.  It does pick up lint easy but it is also easy to clean off. After about 4 months the clip broke off but i use the ring on my key chain so its fine. After 5 months there is some looseness as if it has lost elasticity and I am going to repurchase another one soon because at less than $15 it is still worth it to make sure they are protected easier to find and easier to keep track of.
1,If there was no stars and I could still write a review I would This thing is horrible thin and broke as soon as I opened it not good product
5,I lost my first pair of AirPods because they must've slipped out of my purse while I was traveling getting in out cars and planes.  Now I can identify my AirPods just by touch in my purse by the silicone feel of this case.  Also it has a matching carabiner attached to the case that I can hook on to the inside of my bag or keychain.  I'm definitely ordering more of these as stocking stuffers!
3,it is bright bright red not the dark coral color it shows
5,It’s super cute! I love the jelly feel only bad part is if you have crumbs ANYWHERE lay it on it it will grasp is allll up. That’s expected though love it.
4,Good fit and it does glow in the dark. Only thing it doesn’t have a little cover at the bottom where you plug it into charge to block the dirt when not plugged in.
5,The hang case fits over the original Apple like a glove and has not shown any signs of wear or stretch months after purchase. The case does nothing to detract from the aesthetic of the sleek design as I have received multiple compliments from friends who have seen the case who own AirPods themselves. The convenience of having my case attached to my keys offers piece of mind and allows me to continue my long tradition of ‘keys wallet watxh’ in the morning without having to remember a fourth. As a note I am not using the provided clasp as I simply attached the case directly to my keychain.
5,I have had it for a couple of months now and it's great! I love the keychain portion it comes with it makes it easier to clip on my keys jeans or purse.
4,My case after a months is still in good condition. There are a few scratches on it but I brought it with me everywhere so I think the quality is quite good. The only thing is the case starts to slide down showing a bit of the AirPod case but you could easily slide it back up.
2,Don’t fit pods
5,I’ve bought several of these cases. They don’t slip off fit perfectly in my pocket and the colour is perfect.
5,Makes my AirPods so much more convenient. I've had this for about a year now. I used it to hang my AirPods to my keychain. the rubber has surprisingly held up very well as well as the ring. the only thing thats broken is the carabiner but those are easily replaceable. Love this. Didn't know what to put for water resistance since you're not supposed to get your AirPods wet... dont take this near water it has a hole for charging... but still a great product and a great price for it.
4,I like this product. It’s very convenient to put on your keychain and I preferred the glow in the dark one. I can see the silicone loop hole breaking later down the road but for the price it’s worth it.
5,At first I was unsure whether or not to buy this product because people stated that the cut wasn’t perfect and didn’t match up and when it arrived i tried it on my airpods and the case was at weird cut and didn’t fully cover my airpods case and i was ready to return it. However you need to adjust the silicon and stretch it to fit over the case which i would have never done if i didn’t watch a review video of another similar airpods case product. I really recommend it.
5,Looks good and protects well!
3,Love the color and it is durable however it is too small in the case.
5,it was for my daughter
4,Overall it's a great little case. I mainly wanted it for the carabiner clip however I wish I payed more attention to the additional photos. The main photo shows a silver/gray clip (which is what I wanted) but when it arrived it's more of a bronze color. Just wish I would have noticed that before since I don't really like the color of the metal with the black case.
5,Happy
5,This was great! It fits perfect on the case and its thick.
2,Not terribly durable and really just a cosmetic item. Does not seem to add much protection as it tore on one corner during everyday lite use.
5,Buen producto lindo color llego en perfecto estado y antes del tiempo prometido
5,I love this case it makes me feel better knowing my AirPods are protected! I love that it glows in the dark (the reason I bought it) it helps me locate it at night and it just looks cool lol great product exactly what I wanted !
5,good
5,So so cute the color is true
5,Granddaughter b/day present. Very happy with gift
5,Buen material y el envió rápido. Muy recomendado
5,I love my little case. Keeps my AirPods nice and clean and in good shape.
4,I was shopping on Urban Outfitters and stumbled upon an elago AirPod case for $12. I thought about checking on Amazon and I’m glad I did it was nearly $6 cheaper and came with a carabiner.I will say that the carabiner could be better quality it’s definitely not sturdy and could be broken easily.
5,I really liked this product it gives an extra layer of protection to my Airpods. However what I liked the most is that it has the attachment. That way I am able to clip them on my keys or bag and never lose them again. I also liked how the Elago Customer Service Manager  Jon Jeffers reached out and wanted to make sure the product was working well and delivered. Extra points for this! Will definately be buying more for the family.
5,I was a bit hesitant about buying these AirPod cases (bought a white and red one) because some reviews said that the lid part didn’t fit well. I decided to buy them anyways because they were some of the higher rated cases on Amazon. It takes some massaging but the cases fit perfectly and I couldn’t be happier. The cases are good for protecting against drop and scratches but they do collect dirt and other objects since the case is silicone based.
5,Met my expectation.
5,The color is exactly the same as the picture. Fits well.
5,Fits very well soft rubber
5,
5,I love my glow in the dark airpod case! When I lose it in the dark it is easily accessible cause I can see it glowing!! Very nifty and durable case. I travel with it quite often!
4,cute! not as glow-in-the-dark as i had hoped but it did exactly what i wanted: protect my airpod case & differentiate it from those belonging to my coworkers. and wasn’t too flashy.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 More than amazing. White in light. Glowy blow in night. It becomes more glowy when exposed to heat or sun sometimes it glow in room light. It protect the case perfectly. And the carbiner is pretty strong too I hanged my keys in it and hang it to the bag so I don't lose it and it became more easy to find it as you can see in pics. Never disappointed. Love it. It's a most 😍😍
5,This thing is super low profile barely adding any size to my AirPod case. The Blue Glow color responds to light almost instantly so you can expect it to glow when it gets dropped in a dark area. Smooth texture sturdy and the keychain feels robust. Knocked this one out of the park elago! It won’t be long till elago is in the Apple store if they aren’t already!!
5,I like that the cover on the lid is attached so it doesn’t fall off when I open the case. I love the carabiner to hook it when I’m on the go!
5,This still looks new doesn’t have the dirty look like that of the old Fitbit bands. Very sturdy.
4,Pretty cool.  However which I didn’t realize is that it hard to just stick your pods into your pants pocket because it’s rubber.  So I use it anymore
2,You can almost see through the piece that holds the lid to the case it’s so thin. I can tell it won’t last long with my teen but it was priced for what I got so I can’t complain too much
4,I got the product just today it’s a good sturdy case correction it does glow
5,Love it.  I changed the carabiner but that's just out of preference.  There was nothing wrong with the one it came with.  It's white when not glowing but it does glow a beautiful blue in the dark.  Makes it easy to find my AirPods at night.  It fits the case just fine - not too big & not too small.  I'm very content with my purchase.  I've attached a photo of it glowing as well as a photo of it sitting on top of my 13" MacBook Air.
5,My teen ordered this. She seems very happy with it and began using it immediately. Color is great. We'll see how it holds up.
5,Had been searching for an AirPod case with key hook and decided to purchase this one I completely love it. They keep the AirPods protected and I can easily put on my keys when i put them away in my purse.
4,I had high hopes for this but once u clean the case it doesn’t glow as much.
5,Stays on my keys great!
5,Love this case
5,
3,The carabiner was plastic.
5,This one is great! If you go to the specific brands store they have lots of different colors and styles
5,I’ve kept my AirPods functional clean and safe thanks to this case. It securely attaches onto anything and prevents the cover from getting stained. I purchased this before going on a trip to Europe and I’m so glad I did! It’s a must-buy especially after investing on these pricey wireless earbuds.
4,Love the gray color I got. I think it will protect the AirPods case. The carabiner is nice and it matches. Nice opening on the bottom for charging. Unfortunately the top piece on the bottom do not meet so you still see the white from the AirPods case.  Seems to be a common complaint with this case.
4,I love the case but isn't how the picture is shown above it doesn't have the keychain part which i don't really mind because i could just put it in my pocket but i bought these specifically for the keychain part...either way great product very good looking to have as an airpod case
4,got the glow in the dark one glows when exposed to lightonly complaint is that the fit could be a little better
4,I put this on and it does fit perfectly.  It is silicone and has grip for sure.  The bottom and top connect with a silicone little piece; i fear that will rip or tear. The carabiner is nice but the little ring that you are suppose to use with it seems fragile.
3,The reason I gave it 3 stars because it doesn’t fully cover the lip to my AirPod case and the back hinge part is very bulky. It has good durability but I will be buying a different case
5,doesn't slip off. doesn't stain
5,Great productsound quality is great.
5,It’s very soft to the touch looks nice and fit very good
4,Decent. The silicone occasionally comes off of the lid and/or pops the EarPod case open not too often but it has scared me. Earbuds have stayed in case when this has happened though thankfully.  They need to make one that clicks closed with a lock
5,Durable and I really like the color :).
5,they are a great buy. excellent fit and are great for people who drop stuff all the time. I bought several at christmas and see these cases all day long around my house on the person using their earbuds. i bought one for myself as well and extremely pleased.
5,great case
5,I use my AirPods a lot. So this is great way to keep them handy. They clip on anywhere so I’m never digging through my bag searching for them. And now that my AirPods are pink they are distinguishable from everyone else’s (I have accidentally walked off with someone else’s...more than once.) once the case is on it fits snugly and it’s not bulky.  It has a slot for charging. So no need to ever remove.
5,Really fits on the AirPods case well and seems  like it will do a good job of protecting it. I have no negative things to say about it!
5,I have been searching in stores for a case like this but they always seem overpriced ($20) and less quality. This case is soft but seems durable and sturdy. I love the keychain it comes with because I can just clip it on to my keys if I'm on the go. Also the material is easy to clean and never slips off. OVERALL worth it!
5,Got this product mainly for the keychain and ended up loving the case itself.It grips to the AirPods case so it doesn’t slide around when opening the lid. There’s also no ugly logo nor annoying flap for the lightning port. The case itself is smooth and clean.Only part I don’t like is the thin rubber hinge behind the lid. It’s flappy and doesn’t look durable.Delivery was quick and packaging was clean.
4,Love the color and feel of the product. It came with a great carabiner feels sturdy and nice color. It doesn't fit completely flush when its closed but its a very small slit. It can be removed and reapplied easily. I would recommend getting this product.
4,I purchased the nightglow blue case it glows really bright and very easy to find in my purse. Only complaint is the carabiner broke after a few weeks will just have to buy another to replace it.
5,The silicone case fits very well on my Apple AirPods Case. It feels sturdy and is easy to clean. I use the key chain feature to attach it to my purse for quick & easy access; no need to hunt inside my purse.
5,It’s a nice color matches my iPhone 12 mint green color
5,After a few months of use this case has been one of my best purchases from Amazon.The carabiner isn't the sturdiest clip you'll find but it's tough enough to hang the case from your jeans or even your key loop. The silicone really guards the AirPods case from scratches and it's very easy to distinguish your pair from someone else's.I would totally buy one again if this guy ever broke (which I don't see happening soon).
4,I feel like this will be a good product! I just received mine today but it was missing the connecting ring and hook on the package. There isn’t a way to ask for a return as well. I just want what is missing from the package.
5,I read mixed reviews on these but took a risk with buying them. And I am highly satisfied. After losing my first pair of airpods I was needing something to help ensure they don’t slip out of my pocket or bag. This thin well-designed snd griply vase did just that. Adds a layer of protection while keeping the sleek design of the airpods. I highly recommend if you’re someone who is prone to losing smaller items such as these.
5,I bought this case to keep it on my keychain and I love it! Keeps my AirPods case scratch/scuff free! Cute color too!
3,Buena relacion precio calidad
5,El  cover is very good I’m very happy with fit percent on the case  only the hook look very fragile so I can’t used to hold  I change the hook for other hook stronger
5,My daughter ordered this and it was exactly as described. She was very happy with the color!
5,Good
4,The case is nice to have but it gets dirty VERY easily. If you want to put it in your pocket I would think about getting a lighter color. I got black. Still does what it’s supposed to do so I definitely reccomend it for anyone trying to protect their charging case.
4,I love this case but the little ring attaching to the carabiner is a little flimsy. I almost lost my case a couple of times because it came right off. But the case is fantastic.
5,Great case for airpods! Fits perfectly and is as advertised. Nothing else to say than it is a normal working case!
5,I like the case and how it protects the AirPods from all dust in my pocket. The ring feels sturdy and secure. The case completely covers the AirPod case without any opening except the back part which is for obvious reason. The only issue with this is the case attracts a lot of small particles due to it's built material. You can see that in photo. Apart from that all good.
5,Beyond happy with this purchase. The same exact item is sold at Urban Outfitters and I had my eye on it for a while but then I saw it here on amazon for cheaper! Super functional too - I use mine everyday on my way to class or to the gym!
3,Purchased the clear/blue glow-in-the-dark case after the first couple hours being outside with the case it turned slightly yellow. Very disappointed that it didn’t stay clear at all. But the glow is quite nice and seems to “charge” quickly in that respect. The clip is nice to hook on a bag or belt loop.
3,I got this over a year before the review. This fit perfectly & 𐊦 love the glowing color. As for the material the back strap that holds the flap cover onto the rest of it will probably wear & peel off. After that the top eventually slides off easier with use & 𐊦 ended up losing it. It also doesn’t do much to keep the inside of the actual AirPod case clean where they tend to get buildup of what are probably slightly magnetic deposits that find their way around you. 𐊦 enjoyed this protector while it worked so caveat emptor.
5,such a BRIGHT glow!!! I re-bought this 4 times for friends it makes the best gift because people actually use it everyday. I prefer the glow to the black version.It won't protect from liquids getting inside the pods case though i don't see how anyone could even pretend it does. i love it it keeps the pods clean maybe it even provides a little protection when dropping them but liquids get in EASILY
5,Great case
5,I had it for a little over a week and ended up ripping the little flap that connects both parts together. Jonathan Jeffers is the best!! He only asked for a picture to make everything better by sending me a new one asap! Even if the product isn't the best customer support is something I can say is super great. Would definitely buy their other products and reccomend them.
5,super cute and i’ve had no issues with it :)
5,After having lost my AirPods while working I decided a case with a latch would probably be my best bet. I found the Elago product to be exactly what I was looking. I appreciated that it was glow in the dark (nightglow blue). The perfect fit took a little bit of very minor stretching (the lid area). That should be expected. Would I purchase this product again? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes.
5,Now my wife only misplaces this half the time. It's bright enough for us both to see it. Fits perfectly. Great to clip to key when in a bag so you don't have to dig around.
5,I got this because it was glow in the dark. It is really glow in the dark and it’s really durable. I dropped my airpods many times not even a single scratch. Same with the dust guard would recommend buying both if you’re looking for airpod accessories.
5,Like
5,Really good durability. Glows very bright only if you have it in the sun during the day.
3,It's a nice quality case but I got it because it appeared to be pretty clear since the image shows the charging light shine brightly through it. I got AirPods case personalized through Apple and I was hoping it would show with this case but it just looks blurry.
3,Works great with my other carabiner that holds my keys but after a week or two the included carabiner doesn't "hold." Now I have to attach the case itself to my carabiner but I usually put just the airpods on my wireless charger not attached to my keys so its somewhat of a hassle now. Otherwise works great is stylish and useful.
2,I put my extra ear pods pads in doesn’t close properly they fall easily fearful I will loose them
4,It’s a good case but tends to slip out of place sometimes. Otherwise love it.
4,but it attracts dust and lint like crazy. For the price I don't mind just gotta wipe it down. Otherwise a nice little protector and the added carabiner is great for making sure I don't lose them.
5,Packaging is nice. The case is made out a smooth and soft material. I like that it comes with an optional clip. It was very easy to put on. There’s a nice opening at the bottom of the case to charge it and a small dimple on the back to access the sync button. I also purchased the dark gray case and love it. Would buy again.
5,Exactly what I was looking for.-very soft matiral-not in the way when charging-perfect fit🙂 love the color.
5,This little case is great!! When I take it out of my pocket in a dark environment and people are like "Woah! That's so cool!!!" is funny. Makes you feel like you have something not everyone has. I've had the case for about a month and it's held up just fine! I would personally just change the carabinier to one of your liking! All in all 10/10!
5,Quality is great very durable great protection for my earbuds would highly recommend
4,It’s white so it does attract dust n dirt very easily... and the glow in the dark is really just a novelty doesn’t really appear to be very vibrant for that long but it does fit great and feels great and the hook works well!
5,This case is perfect for my airpods. I loop it onto my keychain using the carabiner and it ensures that I won't lose my airpods. I got the case in the yellow and it's also such a pretty color!
4,just wish the glow in the dark power was stronger
5,They are exactly what you expect. The rubber case adds a little protection against drops. It’s still white so it matches the AirPods but the glow in the dark feature is cool and can be helpful sometimes. What I like most is the clip I keep my AirPods on my belt buckle all the time now and I never really have to worry about them.
5,This is a great case and I love that it comes with the clip to secure it into my bag or pants.
5,*
2,the part that kept the top on broke and now it opens a lot
5,This is my daughter’s — she loves it!!!
5,It is a necessity to have a case with airpods!! I was constantly thinking I lost them after having mine for about a month without one. Once I got a case I was able to easily hook it to my keys or inside my purse where I know they’ll always be! It’s bonus that it glows in the dark
5,Easy to put on and works great!
5,Easy to put on my AirPods. Soft to the touch and the carabiner clip is perfect for not loosing my AirPods.
5,Great case isn't stretching easily and getting loose like the past cases I've had. The carabiner clip that comes with it is great and doesn't add a lot to the price. I'm always able to clip it to myself so I don't worry about losing it as much.
3,Quality product and fits great on the device. The three stars are specifically for the "midnight case" the description said it glows in the dark. It doesn't. This case is white and sure if you are literally in the pitch black it gives off a minimal amount of glow. But for the most part it won't glow very much. If you want to see them a night don't expect to find the case in the dark. Now I don't mind it in white so didn't return but if this is important to you don't order.
5,A really pretty color and durable
4,This is a great case for the money. Keeps the case secured and allows for a better grip. The clip is a great bonus as some people may want to carry it outside of their bag.
4,Works great and it fits really well!
5,Very good case considering the price. Has a perfect fit. Not as durable as one would hope. Lovely color pink (lighter than pictured by the seller). Would recommend this to someone looking to protect their AirPods from scratching and/or looking for a lanyard and travel friendly case.
4,Slides onto case easily but doesn’t seem to fit all that tightly. Caribiner is very cheap so don’t hook it anywhere delicate. Overall does what I needed it to do.
5,This product has saved my AirPods from scratches from falls on the floor multiple times and thus this product has already paid for itself several times over.My one complaint is that it is very easy for lint dead skin and dust to stick to the protector. Perhaps a color other than black would make this problem less noticeable. Still even with this defect would recommend.
3,The case was great when first purchased perfect even- HOWEVER the case does become entirely loose which is ig expected from a silicone case. better off purchasing a cheaper silicone case. 2.5/5 stars
5,the texture is so soft and looks really nice
5,Great product and perfect material! Nice color as described!
3,After 2-3 months the top ripped completely off.  It never stayed on the lid very well to begin with so it was more of an annoyance anyway.  Once it ripped off I still kept the bottom part of the case on to provide some grip to the AirPods case so its not so slippery.  All in all I guess its worth it but can only give it 3 stars for the lack of durability and the annoyance of the top not staying on.
5,This skin fits perfectly and i love that i can hook it to my backpack.  Sometimes when you're wearing airpods it's easy to misplace the case because you dont need it until youre done using them.  With this case the hook allows you to keep it close without losing!! Very durable and cool color
4,good fit just got two them so not sure how long will last
1,DoNot recommend. My AirPods slippedRight out.
5,I bought this for my wife and with the carabiner attached she can lock this in her purse and find it in a few seconds. It’s a lifesaver for her. The color and fit are both amazing. Please note the super cheap key ring between the Carabiner and the actual case is flimsy. You will end up needing to find a replacement.
5,Amazing case for the price. The flow is faint but good enough for me to see in the dark. Absolutely love this case and I’ve had it for about a month now and have had no problems. I was worried about the silicon tearing after a while but it doesn’t iven have a scratch. Love it.
5,Although the i love the case design of the airpods the white reminds me too much of dental floss. I wish they already came out with black airpods with a matching glossy case. But until then this silicone case looks fine. More grip and is a nice tight fit all around. I haven't had need of the ring clip so i took it off. Overall great job!
5,So soft and smooth! Not too thick but also seems pretty durable. I’m happy.
5,As soon as I bought my AirPods I knew I had to buy a case they scratch so easily. This case is great for the money but I feel like the silicone part that holds the clip is fragile and I’m scare of hanging it and it falling from my school lanyard.
4,super super cute but color kinda faded over time and it looks ugly now
4,Fits my AirPods case tightly.  Makes it a bit easier to keep all my accessories in one place.  Not all of the white case is covered in black though and some white does show in the back
2,I'm a regular client of Elago I love their covers on the iPhone and usually buy one or two versions for my phones since they have an excellent fit on each model. I was very happy when I found out they made cases for the airpods and decided to purchase one for mine. Upon arrival I was very disappointed to see the fit is not as they promote on their images instead both the top part and bottom part have leave a small portion of the cover unprotected (as you can see in my image). It's not the biggest deal ever but considering Elago is a well known brand with a very good record of covers for the iPhone (as well as other brands) I'm very disappointed on their take of the airpods case.My wife has a generic brand case for her airpods and those fit better than this.
5,I’ve used it for a week now and love it I have the 1st gen AirPods. I did change out the clip it came with to an extra coach tag that I had I think it looks nicer this way :)
4,This is white not blue. It still does the job and almost completely covers the case. I dropped mine 20 minutes after putting this on. 3 feet onto concrete and not even a scuff.
5,Love this. Helps me keep my AirPods attached to my keys so I don’t misplace them anymore. Has been working great! I’ve had this case for a while now and has help up great! Love the pink I was worried about the light color looking dirty after awhile and that hasn’t happened.
4,The silicon case for your airpods works great and feels great! The only issue I have is the clip is very low quality and won't close all the way sometimes. Other then that I recommend this case.
2,Mine broke in less than 2 months
5,It protects the airpods and looks cute what more could you ask for. It makes it easy to identify which is particularly great now that everyone seems to have these. The only issue is that dust and stray hairs easily get stuck on it but its easy enough to clean it off.
5,This product has already paid for itself in one day. It survived the concrete drop test when I accidentally dropped my airpods on concrete walking out of the grocery store. The airpods were taken out of the case and inspected and there were no dings or damage done to the airpods. They were fully protected by the case. I am a happy customer!
5,The skin is super cute (I got lavender the color looks just like the product picture) and nice to the touch. It fit my airpod case very tight and snug (not loose). I have seen some reviews stating that it picks up/stains easily but so far so good. Overall a great product!
3,Cheaply made
5,This is an essential case for anyone who has an AirPod. The case provides a nice textured grip to keep your case from slipping from your hands and I use the small carabiner to attach to hooks in my backpack to keep it from getting crushed by the other contents. Very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommended.
4,High quality materials pretty thick so I'd hope the protection will be just fine. Fits perfectly fine and the silicone is extremely non-slip. The carabiner is not very high quality though but it'll work.
4,Fits the AirPods case well and gives you a keyring for easy attachment to lanyard etc. Allow me to keep a Tile on it so I never lose them.
3,The hinge that holds the top to the bottom deteriorated and eventually detached. The good - I wore it hanging from my pant loop everyday and it never broke where the carribeaner attaches so at least that part of it is strong.  The fit is good and it protected the airpod case well. I bought a replacement since the price is good. At that price I can get two a year and feel ok.
5,Easy to put on and looks very nice!
3,This is a good product other than everything sticks to it because of the material
5,I love the glow in the dark feature so I can find the case easily at night since I tend to listen to music and podcasts as I fall asleep. The case appears to be a plain white case during the day.  Coverage is goodand I am pleased with this purchase.
4,Great
5,Love it
5,I’ve been using this for several weeks and absolutely love it. I have dropped my AirPods numerous times and this case has saved them for sure. I easily loose them in my purse so I’m glad I bought the peach color. Very easy to find.
5,I really liked these for the Airpods. It keeps them really snug and safe.  I wouldn't recommend it for fake Airpods because it doesn't keep the case closed.
4,Very durable. Use it to keep my AirPods on my keychain so easily accessible at all times. Giving one star off because the included carabiner is decent and durable but not of the highest quality.
4,Looks good feels good.
5,Very much glow in the dark and works high quality all around
5,Bought this because I lost my first pair :( so I wanted to add bulk to my pods to reduce the likelihood of losing them and I just love this little case. The color is true to what the picture shows and they fit my airpods perfectly
5,Goes perfect with my Apple Watch and iPhone silicone case just what I was looking for!! 10 out of 10 recommend
4,great fit and really nice. only thing is the top cover doesn't meet the bottom so there is a gap. Picture showed it touching all the way...tried adjusting but doesn't touch. Other than that small detail I love it!
4,Attracts A LOT of lint.Other than that it works exactly as described... Fits the airpods case well matches my phone case and I like the black and white look.
5,It works great I bought to the gray one which is on mise works fine if this back a glove the black one that I bought for my husband the top part had already pulled off of it so I would recommend is a great part product it works great if it’s a hose everything but it everything
4,I put a keychain on it because I tend to misplace things. I only had it for a bit but I really like it.
4,The. Case is good but it kept getting flayed and took 4 days when I choose 2 day shipping
4,We have a pet in house so sometimes I find that lint and dog hair get stuck on the case. Wish it was more flush on the hinge side but otherwise a good buy.
3,I receieved the wrong product as mine didn't come with any side part for there to be a clip attached but... Really cute color and good for protection. I've had it for a couple months and the lid part is losing its grip so it comes off very easily. I don't put it in my pockets I only carry it around in my hands so I'm very gentle with it. I'd probably repurchase this one again though
4,Great case - love that I can carry my AirPods on my keychain now. Glow in the dark only lasts minutes after being in the sun - get a different color.
4,Silicon texture is amazing it’s definitely perfect to protect my AirPods that as usual Apple products are expensive but are best. Don’t count on the ring that comes with it. It won’t last long
5,Super functional. I love the key chain. It sometimes attracts tiny fibers and hair so I clean it on a regular basis.
4,I really like being able to put my AirPods on my keychain but the cover quickly broke off and the black case has "dirtied" my white AirPod case.
5,Love the color! Great quality and came exactly as described.
5,I got the pink one and it’s the perfect milky pale pink I was looking for! Fits perfectly- you just have to wiggle it on a little bit. The clip hook is not the best quality but not a big deal since I’m switching it out for another keychain clip. Highly recommend this to protect your air pods!
5,I love this case! It’s super great!
5,I ordered this case because I felt like I needed something to protect my Airpods case. I chose this one because of the added carabiner. I love how I can just hook it on the inside of my purse for easy access. Overall it's a great value.
4,I wish that the glow lasted longer but it still works and protects the case
3,Doesn't glow too much nor for very long.I kinda expected it due to the blue glow (typically weaker than the green/yellows)I bought it to help me find my iPod case after Netflix marathons into morning; but quickly realized that the case won't actually still glow after so many hours in the dark.Update: after using for 1.5 years the material seems to be degrading. Even after cleaning the case is no longer clinging to the AirPod case.
5,Nice tight fit. The caribeener seems like it’s pretty firmly attached. I keep my AirPods attatched to my car keys so I can’t accidentally leave them at home or the slippery tiny case won’t slip out of my pocket! People complaining it gets dirty I guess...just buy the black one!
4,The back of it where the two parts connect is really thin so you have to be careful but it does glow really good
4,It is a good product but the thing to hang out on stuff broke in like 2 days after I got the product
5,I love that I can clip my headphones and know where they are. I find them less slippery and less likely to lose with this cover now on it.
5,My sister loves it! the color is just as described and it fits perfect nice and snug.
5,Super cute. I love it.
4,Love it. The metal is a little cheap feeling but the color makes up for it. Elegant cool nice.
5,I am happy about this product I dont have to worry about my airpods getting scratch. Outside is pretty soft feels and it fits perfectly. I dont have any issue with the top lid doesn’t really come off. Will def buy another color. I hope they will make a variety of colors for more options.
4,Great case. The AirPods fit snugly in the case and will not fall out. The clip is nice but the round attachment it clips on seems like it would break easy.
2,Looking for a basic AirPods condom? This is all the protection you need. But there are a few big Ifs and they're worth mentioning because there are cheaper options.* The top does not quite cover the AirPods so it doesn't fit the case the way its shown in the photos. At best there's a gap between the lid and the rest of the case.* The rubber covering the hinge is rather flimsy and is ready to peel off at any moment.* Also for some reason the metal carabiner is sticky. Not sure how this happens to something that's supposedly new.Maybe I just got a dud but the product design and quality control doesn't meet my expectations for a brand name item. I'll definitely approach elago with some skepticism in the future.
5,Exactly what I was looking for not too bulky. I attach to my gym bag or purse so they are easy to find. No more dropping them. Feels great. Used them for 2 weeks so far all good. Easy to clean. Definitely recommend especially for teens who keep misplacing or dropping the AirPod case.
5,Loved it!
4,Honestly I don’t give you guys 5 stars its not because the case doesn’t deserve it. But it’s because I want you guys keep on working to make the product even better
5,Perfect fit  love the color !!!!
5,The color is such a pretty pink and the carabiner is cute too. Oh my god you don’t know how much relief this thing will provide until you have one. It is so great I hook it on to my wallet and I haven’t had an AirPod anxiety attack since
4,Very nice case. Much higher quality than one I got on eBay. It's much thicker and the lid stays on. Doesn't glow very brightly but that's not a big deal to me.
5,My husband and I both have AirPods. We wanted something to differentiate between the two so I bought this case. Fits nice and snug and protects the case nicely. Love the color combo I chose too!
5,Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter. She loves it . The material is nice and soft. It looks durable. Once she’s had it for a few weeks I’ll know just how durable it is and make sure to update my review !
1,This case does not fit! Don’t waste your time having to go return them like me. So disappointing because I love the color.
4,I like it but the top portion does not cover the full cover of my AirPods. Other than that I have no complaints and the price is certainly good.
4,It’s great for the price! Love the keychain it comes with as well. It just gets dirty quick. Catches on to all dust
4,I just received the product but so far so good.  I’m hoping it will keep me from losing my AirPods
5,Awesome
5,Love these!  So easy to lose or misplace your air pods.  Ever since buying these they're clipped to my bag so I know exactly where to find them.  Good price too.
5,I love how sturdy it is and how easy it is to find in low light
2,IT FEELS GOOD I LOVE THE COLORS CONTRAST. I GOT 2  ONE FOR ME AND ONE FOR MY MAN. THE ONE I GAVE MY MAN WAS GOOD BUT THE ONE I ENDED KEEPING THE CLIP WASNT IN GOOD A SHAPE I CLIPPED IT TO MY WATER BOTTLE AND WENT FOR A WALK AND SOMEHOW IT FELL OUT AND I LOST IT WITH THE AIRPOD BOX. I THOUGHT ILL BE ABLE TO TRACK IT BUT I HAVE THE AIRPODS IN MY EARS AND IT ONLY TRACKS THE AIRPODS NOT THE CHARGING BOX. I BLAME THIS ITEM. BUT I ACTUALLY LIKED IT. MY MAN STILL HAS HIS AND ITS FINE. I MUST HAD A DIFECTED ONE.
5,I  accidentally ran across these while Christmas and thought they would be good for my husband's beloved air pods.  I  don't think he ever saw a case for them but he definitely seems to like it after several months of use.  No issues with the quality either.
4,I’m really liking it; however I figgited with the clip and broke it. It seems to break too easily.
4,It’s working well so far. I did have issues getting it on and having it cover the whole AirPods case. Love how I am able to hook it onto anything!
5,So pretty!  I do kinda wish it also came in a more vibrant pink now that I have a new phone with a new case... but the ballerina pink is really pretty!  Love the item.  So nice to have the clip to clip inside my purse to help locate it!
5,Fit is fantastic silicone is good quality. This allows me to throw my airpods on my keyring and have them everywhere I go. I like the glowing for locating the case at night. Overall A+ product highly recommended.
5,So happy I bought this. AirPods case is super slippery and this actually feels like the same quality as some 30 dollar ones TMobile was trying to sell me. Only wish it had a better quality carabiner clip and ring but it hasn’t broken yet.
5,my daughter likes the carabiner case to keep track of her airpods. The peach color is cute
5,Exactly as advertised.
4,It is as described.  Good product well made keeps the case protected but also nice to have the carebiner to attach the case to a bag.
5,Great case!
5,Definitely the best case I’ve ever bought for my AirPods these cases is water proove so u can soak the case in water and it won’t get damage when you want to clean it. (Note the case will not protect the AirPod from sub merged water)
3,it is ok I mean there is nothing surprising to expect its just a AirPods case. I don't get the logic behind the price tags though 9 dollars for a piece of silicone is much for me considering I just paid the same price for 3 fitbit watch bands and I also should pay for shipping cuz I don't live in US. -2 stars just for the price
4,Case doesn’t get as bright as I expected but that’s case does it’s job as a case
5,It’s great when it has been in the light for some time. It’s a really bright glow. Just like the picture.
4,Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!!! The silicone case fits the Charging case perfectly And keeps it safe. Carabiner feels cheap but easily replaceable. Overall a great buy!
4,Carabiner was junk.  It wouldn't close properly and would make it likely to lose my Airpods.  Luckily I have a spare small one.
5,So cute! came with a little key ring and a clip! glows super bright if you take it outside first
5,It is a great item. It perfectly covers the device and the clipper is a plus for this product. I do not have to worry anymore about my pods charger being misplaced.
5,I saw this exact same product in Anthropologie for $20 literally the same brand. I got an orange one for myself and a gray one for my boyfriend for traveling and differentiating who’s airpods are who’s.
5,Works beautifully to house my AirPods and the charging case. And the clip that is included here is great so you can always clip these to your jeans purse etc. Item is highly recommended to those of you who own Airpods so you have some protection for your investment. Price was reasonable as well.
5,It’s sooo pretty. The keychain looks very nice would recommend.
5,This is seriously so worth it y'all! I really needed something I could put my case in so I wouldn't drop it and this has exceeded my expectations! I seriously am so glad I bought it. I just attach it to my keys when I'm walking and listening. (Plus the pale pink is just beautiful!)
5,Fits snugly just like in the photo. I like that it makes them more visible so it's harder to lose and has that spot for a loop. It's nothing crazy but for $5or6 it was a good buy.
5,Fits perfectly. Keeps my AirPods from getting mixed up with my daughter’s. I love the convenient clip that keeps them from getting lost in my purse.
4,Fits great and gives protection to the case. Beaware pet owners animal hair sticks right to it!
5,Has held up being clipped to my jeans running and travelling through NYC subways during rush hour. Definitely passes durability test for me. The glow feature makes it easy to find in my bottomless purse!
4,Haven’t had it but a month so far it’s been the best accessory for the money.
5,really cool
5,I was looking for something like this where I could attach my AirPods to my keychain and not lose them. This case is perfect. The only thing I changed was I wanted a lock/release for the keyring so I bought that instead of the little carabiner it came with. .
2,Falls apart easily unsticks easily ultimately disappointing
5,This is the second case I buy this time for my daughter’s AirPods. I’ve had mine for over six months and doesn’t show any signs of wear loose color or loose fit. Highly recommend it.
5,i LOVE IT. my aesthetic is black so i bought the black one and it’s amaxing. perfect fit very durable. love it. have recommended it to my friends they bought it and love it too. LOVE IT
5,Works great would buy again.
5,I keep it on my key chain and works well . I made sure to take the small metal off and just used the bigger metal part. To make sure it was secure. The small metal seemed like it rip off if caught on something. The only flaw
5,Mine didn’t come with the clip but overall it’s durable and fits perfectly
5,Love this little thing. Keeps my AirPods case from slipping out of my Tenba Messenger Bag side pockets and it also camouflages it so most people don’t know what it is and are less likely to snatch it. Fits snugly and perfectly. Matches the iPad Smart Keyboard charcoal color really well.
5,I'm so happy I bought these. I recently dropped and lost my previous AirPods case... they're way too slippery! But this silicon case and the clip help keep them protected and by my hip at all times.
5,I bought this more so I don't lose my airpods. Since Its attached to my keys its less likely Ill leave it behind at work. I have no complaints except the rubber makes it a little hard to come out of my pockets otherwise its a great product.
5,I really like the color of the case and it does match the photo shown. The clip makes it easy to leave on my backpack and take it off when I want to.
5,This is exactly what I needed. It keeps my airpods with me at all times and I know where they better be. I haven't lost my keys in at least 20 plus years but my headphones would be in my jacket bag car or pant pockets. Not anymore. Useful product.
5,No more digging in your work bag for your airpods! This simple and convenient case provides protection AND an easy way to store and access.Quality-made and durable. I have been enjoying this product for about a month now and was the perfect solution.
5,This is the ONLY thing Elago got right! The hook and case PERFECT for traveling! Easy to apply and use. Dropped my case a few times and it holds up. Slick too! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5,I just got mine. It  fits my Apple air pods really good. I went with the color orange and love it!! Looks pretty durable too. We will see how it holds up.
5,This case was a gift for my daughter for her new AirPods. The fit is great and the price was much better than the one I got from an Apple retailer.
3,The quality is silicone so it gets dirty very quick as it holds dust. The glow is only for ~15 seconds after you get it away from the sun. Afterwards it stays regular silicon white. It’s durable but the glow was a bit dissapointing.
5,Product is well worth money spent on. Premium quality texture durable build and spot on fit for AirPod case. If you’re thinking of buying a case for your AirPods go with this product. You won’t be disappointed.
5,This case fits perfectly adds protection and a fun pop of color. It makes it easier to find it in my purse and I like having the carabiner to hook inside my bag or on the belt loop of my jeans.
4,Nice but doesn’t fit perfectly even after a few attempts to massage the material into place. It still covers and protects though.
5,It’s perfect for me because I kept misplacing my AirPods. I also like that this protects from falls and major drops. I love the color. It looks just like the picture. An excellent value.
5,Nop
5,I LOVE THIS! Best quality and the carabiner hook is key for making sure I don’t lose my beloved air pods while out and about. Now buying more as gifts- great color options too.
5,So much easier to be able to hook on your bag or on your jacket to be hands free! I love that the color allows me to easily tell it apart from my husband's case
5,It fit the AirPods case perfectly and it’s exactly as described!
5,Great quality!  The color is perfect.  Definitely would recommend.
5,This is perfect it fits just right and looks so cute. Plus the carabiner is great I can just attach it somewhere in my bag that way I don’t lose my airpods anymore.
5,Use this everyday love it. Unfortunately lately it seems as though the lid has stretched out a little bit and doesn’t stay secured to the AirPods case. I’m wondering if seller will warranty this product?
3,Purchased the Airpods case twice and the first time I purchased it everything was fine. However upon purchasing the item again the Airpods case did not come with the metal ring that allows the case to be connected to the carabiner. The seller also does not have a return or replacing policy either.
4,good
5,Super cute case it makes my life more convenient which is always a huge plus! I love the little key hook and the color is Millenial Pink! Highly recommend for anyone who is looking to keep their airpods safe & cute!
5,Great case and sturdy too. Only thing is I wish that the case covered the charging hole. Either way it’s a good product and would totally suggest it. Good price too.
5,Fits the old AirPods perfectly. Have been able to keep track of them thanks to the clip
3,Fits and protects well but it’s a dust and dirt magnet. Also I wouldn’t exactly say it “glows”more like a very faint hue of color.  The color of the carabiner is a poor choice as well. Burnt copper? With a “blue glow”? Really?
3,The case is just as I expected but I’m really upset that I did not get the ‘mountain climber’ clip that was pictured and I see on other reviews that some have received the clip. That is why I rated it three stars.  Other than that it’s a great case!
5,I was a little skeptical about this quality until I got it put it in and it fit like a glove. I usually lose my AirPods case somewhere inside my purse so the hanging clip makes it much more convenient to find.
5,It’s ok. Have it hooked to my Pants. Seems to be lasting good. Just worry how long until the hook rips from the clamp.I have it some days 12-15hrs a day.
5,Love this! I feel like it may keep dirt in a little. I have to take it off and clean it every once in awhile. But the ability to clip to anything makes this beyond useful. Will keep forever!
3,It is good item but I didn’t like that it is NOT perfect for AirPods 2 for the light connection and connecting button. And this item will be perfect if you shine the sun light on it. It will glow in darkness nevertheless it will not  have that glow
5,It was just what I was looking for.  Great product.
5,Fits perfectly over my case.  I chose the glow color and it’s so helpful when I’m trying to find it in my purse.  Love my purchase!
5,I love this. The color is easy to find in the dark and doesn’t slip out of my hand as easy. Makes it all tother different from the rest.
5,Perfect slim design.
5,I like the material and texture of the AirPod Case. It’s worth the price and recommend it to other AirPod users. It’s also very hard to lose with the hanging part.
5,I bought this because I constantly dropped my AirPods case and this protects it all the way around and doesn’t fall off or get dirty so I would definitely recommend this!
5,I love having this thing around because the case itself is so small but with the carabiner I can attach it to my keys and go.
5,What puts this case over others is the carabiner. Allows for AirPods to be clipped to belt loops. I misplace my AirPods a lot so this helps me out greatly.
5,The exact kind of case I was looking for. It’s not that overly grippy silicone. It’s soft and sleek. Doesn’t add too much bulk to my AirPods case. I recommend this brand.
2,Thinner material than others I’ve had (ppl may prefer that idk) but fit not entirely symmetrical. See photo
3,The case is okay but quality of beltclip at least for my item was faulty. The clasp for belt clip was loose and snaps open by itself. That is why I am giving 3 stars. May be  it this merchandise but they need to double check before mailing . Quality assurance matters otherwise okay for the price.
5,No slipping off my airpod case which is what reviews say in some of the “cooler” designed cases. Light pink hasn’t even gotten slightly dirty and I use them all day.
2,had it for 6 weeks. The included carabiner broke the first week I replaced it with another. It stopped glowing after two and just looked like a dingy white in the daylight. After 5 weeks I arrived to the office to realize the top had broken off of the case entirely and was not on. I had it clipped to my belt loop so somewhere in the two block walk through downtown Seattle the top just fell off. Thankfully the bottom was still attached as the carabiner is attached to that half or I would have been out a ($80) charging case and would have been more pissed than disappointed.
5,A great case it keeps it protected.
2,THIS ITEM DOES NOT GLOW AT ALL DEFINITELY NOT LIKE THE PIC.  I HAVE ANOTHER GLOW IN THE DARK (GREEN) THAT LIGHTS UP A SMALL ROOM. NOT SURE IF ITS THE SAME BRAND. THE CASE IS NICE AND FULFILLS ITS PURPOSE.  IF YOU PURPOSE FOR PURCHASING IS THE GLOW YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.
3,Everything accords with the description but the part that makes the top being stick with the body it broke on the first two hours
5,Looks and works just like the description and photos. Super cute and sturdy
4,Great case! But don’t buy the lighter colors. It gets dirty very easy.
5,It was very easy to put on my AirPods! I’ve had it for a cuple weeks and it looks like it’s new! It looks like it is $20
4,It’s fine for keeping your air buds in.
5,the quality of the case was good fit my airpods perfectly. i love it i would definitely buy more.
5,Good to get different colors for each person in household for easier identification. They fit perfectly and makes easier to grip cases bc of rubber material.
5,It fits the airpod case perfectly and now I have less of a chance to lose it! Plus the fact that its silicone helps protect the case from drops. Worth a $10 investment to protect a $160 product.
4,Cute little convenient case but the keychain is a little flimsy. I'm replacing mine with a more sturdier one.
3,I like the color and the feel on the skin but I find the hang case broken in three days.
5,Amazing I love it great too for in the dark so you can always find them! I would recommend this to anyone who has Airpods its a great way to keep them safe and to prevent loss or theft.
5,Love the blush pink case. It fits like a glove. Super cute. Not sure how durable is the silicone attachment to the caribiner thingy but only time will tell. I wish there more cases with designs.
3,Nice product received on time.However the peach color is more a fluo color which I hate - though on the site it looked like a nice nude. I paid 10$ so I won’t return it but i cannot say I’m very happy with my purchase.
5,Exactly what I was looking for  Wanted protection for my charging case attachment capability and glow in the dark so I wouldn't have to fumble for them on my nightstand at night. Met all requirements at a reasonable price! Two thumbs up!
5,Good quality
2,I like this AirPod cover a lot. Many covers have 2 separate pieces to cover both the top and bottom portions of the AirPod housing. This case cover has a connective part in the back at the hinge. My only complaint is that I received the product without the carabiner that is pictured and supposed to be included with the product. Fortunately I had a small carabiner which I can use with the product but it should have come with all parts/accessories included. That’s why I’m giving a 4-5 star product a 2 star review.
5,Was a little hesitant to pick this one up because I really wanted a leather case. Turns out the leather case was terrible and this one was much better. Very satisfied.
5,This is an excellent product.  Easy flawless transaction.
4,Beautiful peach color. Collects bits of dusts though.
5,My daughter loves it. Thank you for a great product.
5,This case is really nice. It fits like a glove around the case and you are still able to charge the case while this is on. I ordered one for me and one for the hubby.
5,the case is a really pretty lavender cover and was easy to put on my airpods! i ordered it yesterday and it came today for free.
5,The case was exactly as described.IT GLOWS in the dark. White case does attract lint but its not a deal breaker. Fit is good and precise.Carabiner is light and usable. Happy with the purchase .
4,Cool but the top broke off
5,Nice little silicon holder.  Apple needed to put some kind of lanyard on this...I can't believe they did not.This has the added benefit of giving some grip to the case.  I love it!
5,so cute
4,Provides protection from falls and great grip.
5,This is a stylish case and I'm very happy with the quality and style.
5,That it had an opening to charge while the case is on
5,Great color and does exactly what it’s supposed to do! Nice little protector for the AirPod case.
5,I like this color because it’s not so noticeable.It keeps my case very safe. It doesn’t bother me having it in my keychain at all. No complains.
3,I don’t know if other users are complaining but my AirPod case keeps flipping open when in the case. I can also see the piece holding the case together breaking. It’s a pretty cheap material. The key ring is small too. But this is a decent case for 10 bucks or so.
5,My 16 year old loves this item. She hangs them on her school's lanyard.
1,After a few weeks the metal part broke. Not worth buying!
5,It fits very well. Especially I saw many products of my friends do not fit well for the cap so uncovered very easily.However this one perfectly fits and is never uncovered while using. Good product!
3,The red is really nice but My case did not arrive with the loop to clip the Carabiner even though the carabiner was included. So there's not point in including it if you're not going to mail a case with the loop for it.
5,Great product and a great texture for gripping the case plus the key chain is supper nice for attaching it to my keys so I don't forget to bring it with me when I leave the house.
5,Great case for my air pods! Absolutely love it! I’ve already had this on for about a month and have had no problems with it at all. Great product and such a cute color!
5,I love how easy it was to slip the case on. I’ve dropped my AirPods case multiple times and the silicon case helps.
5,i am very happy about the ability to link my AirPods to keys so I can grab it all at once. This product is very durable
5,Just like the pictures. Recomend. I don’t use the clip so I’m being honest I don’t know if it is any durable but for a protective case it’s nice.
3,The color is perfect and the case is cute. You will need to replace the clip with a sturdier clip. Mine broke within the first use I wouldn’t trust it in case of risking the loss of your AirPods!
3,It’s a really handy thing to have but it always seems to get stuck and come open on its own.
3,Wrong case was sent to me. It didn’t include any hole to attach the ring holder defeating the purpose of sending the ring along with it. Case has a smooth/silky matte silicon feel. Grips enough to not slide off easily. Fits well.
4,The case would be 5 stars if there was a way to hold the optional AirPod strap.
5,Love that it holds my ear pods.  It also has a clip so I can clip it to my purse and not lose it.
5,Love everything about this! Easy to grip case and clip keeps you from losing them! my son wears his on a lanyard!
5,Just what I expected. Quality feels great and color was as I wanted. The grip is good I'd have issues with the AirPods sliding out my pockets regularly but with this case that is no longer a problem!
2,So I really like the case and the color but it was missing the ring on the side to attach the carabiner so I couldn’t really use it.  I mean it works as a case in general but I wanted to attach it to my purse backpack etc and I cannot.  It’s not eligible for return so I’m just stuck with it.  Don’t get me wrong it’s good quality just missing an essential piece.  Also just a side note I wish they had it in an aqua blue.
5,Use this to make case more sticky. Without the case the Apple plain case would easily slip out of my pants pockets. This helps make it more grippy.
5,I was pleased with how fast this product made it to me. Besides that the product itself is just as i expected it and looks good.
5,Writing this review about six months after getting the case it is excellent. Very good fit hasn’t loosen up a bit.
5,Great
5,Get what you paid for. Wanted something that covered up the case. So far they’ve lasted and still holding together after dropping them a lot of times.
5,Amazing quality!
3,Went down after few months like most others! should be stronger and more durable
5,I love the color!
4,Protection is great and so easy to carry with you.Clips on anything.
4,Works as expected and and it really glows overall a good buy!
4,Works great fits perfect.
5,I know it is cheap but it is a brilliant buy totally happy with it.  Will be getting pods for the mrs for Xmas and will get her one of these too.
5,This is exactly what I was looking for it’s perfect to clip inside my purse  gym bag or keys. It’s fits like a glove stylish and protects my overly priced AirPods.
5,Love the color! They are a great fit for my AirPods case and come with a connector to hook onto things.
3,decent case that keeps my airpods connected to my keys.after about 2 weeks the top flap got loose and now most of the time it dangles off. the bottom part still seems snug and i hope it stays that way.
5,Great way to protect AirPodsGreat way to have your AirPods stand out.
5,Like the clip to hang for convenience and added color from cover itself.
3,Case works fine & glows for a short time which is very helpful. I like the soft blue (versus green option). Case fits w a little pulling for the top.
5,I love the clip that comes with the headphones it makes it easier when I put it in my backpack or purse to find them right away! Would 100% recommend this product!!
5,I love that I can now hook my pods to my keys. This comes in handy for the gym.
5,fits good and air pods feel a lot more protected only thing is it catches any and all lint thats in your pockets or backpack so its gets dirty pretty easily
4,Very vibrant and cute.
4,Hook was cheap quality but the product was good.
5,Good fit and cute color! Looks just how I expected! Was a little disappointed to receive such careless packaging but was happy to see that the product was just fine!
5,Nice cover help to keep the airpod safe and can hang it anywhere. Also I chose a color which is shine blue on the dark.
4,The receiver like it.
4,It works and reasonable price.
3,The key chain broke off the same day I received it and there is a slight odor to it. The case also collects dust like crazy but otherwise it fits very well.
5,The color is beautiful the carabiniere is durable and convenient the silicone is soft and it is overall a great purchase!
4,Love the case
5,I clipped this to my key ring to help me remember to take them home from work.  I love it!
5,This is such a well made airpods case compared to my previous ones. I definitely know that these are going to last
5,very cute and vibrant color protects AirPods well and delivery wise it came on time
4,Good product. Durable material. Perfect for my 3 apple items.
2,I bought this case in February and it's been about 3 full months since. The case did the job as promised but the top cover is now so loose that it doesn't remain intact with the case. The part that covers the lid of the charging case has become very loose that it comes right off when I pick it up. It was good when it was new but I guess it just didn't hold up over time (3 months to be exact).
5,Fits perfectly  and easy to wipe off if something spills !! Also the clip is very easy to add to pants or backpack . Plus it looks great with any outfit .
4,Does the trick
5,A los pocos días de tenerlo se hablando un poco por eso considero que no es robusto
1,This was supposed to be part of the Christmas gifts for my daughter but turned out to be very delicate. The top part is connected to the base body with a paper thin material and it is not meant for use. Very disappointed with quality!
4,Good quality
4,Looks nice.
2,The case was nice at first but it turns very yellow soon afterwards
5,I love this product. Very good value for the price. Fits the AirPods nice and comes with a convenient clip.
5,Bought it as a case for my son in laws ear pod. He can attach them to his belt loop for portability
5,Awesome case doesn’t get stuck in pocket even though the silicone isn’t slippery and adds some grip. I’m satisfied with what it does and the way it fits my AirPods.
5,Just love it fits perfectly.  The glow is a beautiful blue in the dark.  Great shipping
5,It is very good quality but I could not find much use for it. Only good for hanging off of a backpack.
5,Looks great! Feels great. Allows me to attach to my backpack when traveling and to my belt loop when working. Love it.
5,I’ve been having this case since January and i would recommend this it does the job :)
5,Love this little guy! Helps me keep better track of my Air Pods and find them in my Mary Poppins of a purse when I need them.
3,Does not fit very well. Has gaps which I’m sure I’ll collect dust over time. I have had a case from the same company before which did fit perfectly.
5,It is functional. I hate elago because of their stupid dust guards but this product was okay.
3,Clip broke after a week. Waiting for a replacement to give a better review.
5,The case is great and arrived quickly. I recommend this for those with airpods..
5,This little case is stylish and perfect to hook on to your bag to travel with. It was easy to install.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Loved the case. The carabiner on the other hand was disappointing. I will not be using it to secure my $100-200 AirPods. It should not be something flimsy. But I still love the case!!!
5,I've used it for three months now and it's perfect no tears and it keeps my airpod case scratch-free. Would definitely recommend!
5,Looks so cute. Very durable and strong + i added a keychain to spice it up a bit
2,For what this item is it works... for a month. Changing the flimsy key ring it comes with to a more sturdy one it was fine and worked as it was intended. A month later the loop where the key ring is attached to ripped cleanly dropping the airpods and thus nearly resulting in the loss of them. The case overall is average; it easily attracts dusts and the like while being complicated on cleaning up. It also stretches pretty quickly losing it's firm hold over the airpods after a while.
5,The color is very very pretty... I love it... the hang is good too.... water resistance+easy to clean
5,The lid cover leaves a part exposed in the front which I didn’t like otherwise this is a great case
5,This fits the Airpods case perfectly! Excellent protection for the item and makes the case easier to handle - the white plastic case is rather slippery. Very well made product - love it!
5,I love this case!! It keeps my AirPods safe with the carabiner and that blue glow in the dark makes them easy to find in my purse. I highly recommend this product.
5,Nice rubberized case to carry and protect your Airpods case.  Like the carabiner as a way to hold and connect the case to something else.
5,Good quality great for traveling
1,Very cheaply made. Which stinks because this brand has other cases in the stores that are great so I thought this one would be good. However this case is very bad for starters the back hinge is so thin it broke almost immediately. In the picture it also shows an indent for the sync button and that doesn’t exist on this case. That was probably the most disappointing part of all. I will be returning this for sure.
4,Pretty good.
5,Love this case best one compared to others. Bought different colors I love them so much!!!!
5,Just as I expected. Not too bad cover for AirPods case.
4,Perfect case although no bottom but it's easy access.
5,I love this item
5,I love these I keep them on my key ring and the case is just as expected -- awesome. Thank you!
5,Nice case but rips after a while
5,nice
5,Super light weight and grips case to prevent slip out. I’d buy it again if necessary. Impressed.
5,Sim sleek
2,i ordered the pistachio looking color and it’s a pretty green on the picture but in real life it’s more yellow green. it also is a little too small for the airpods. the top slips off easily because there’s a gap. the top half doesn’t mean the bottom part.
5,I didn’t know if buying a case mattered but it’s definitley worth it. Having that hook attached makes it more convienient for travel
1,It is cheap and does not match the color depicted
5,I love this product!! Keeps my Airpods very safe and prevents little scratches on the case. Extremely useful for only $10.
3,Case is starting to get flimsy and I’m always nervous that my AirPods will slip out.
5,I like it - fits well and the color does not get dirty. Can be easily attached to my keys
3,I was really disappointed. The clip part of my elago AirPod case was broken and the clasp doesn’t work. It was such a disappointment.
5,Wish the glow in the dark lasted a little longer but still awesome! Doesn’t slip off my case
3,Doesn't actually glow in the dark lack of instructions for how long I need to wait for the glow to show. Will be returning and buying a different one. The fit itself is fine though.
5,easy to put on glows in the dark has a clip to hang it and protects the case.
5,At first I wasn’t too happy that it looked pure white but after exposing it to light for a few minutes- it looks really amazing and cute :) thank you!
5,I love my case exactly what I was expecting and recieved it so quickly!
5,Didnt fit just right but I mean I have fake airpods
2,Edit: changing my review from 5 stars to 2 because 2 weeks into using this case the carabiner broke and is no longer useable. I could have lost my AirPods since the carabiner attached then to my key ring. The case itself is great but don’t trust the carabinerI just bought air pods and wanted a way to secure them to my purse/gym bag. This case works perfectly and stays on my air pod case perfectly.
5,Love my new purple AirPod case. Very sturdy and durable. Happy with my purchase.
5,Buy it. Won’t regret at all. This is the best color ever
2,The day I bought this the clip part that is supposed to secure your air pods to something to prevent you from losing them broke. The cover for the air pods case is what I expected although the material is a bit thinner than I would like. However the main reason I bought this product was so that I could attach the air pods to my purse which I still cannot do because the clip is super cheap and broke instantly.
5,I love them but the top tore off at work. Glowed great easy access.
5,Highly recommend this case for anyone who owns AirPods. Solid protection against drops & being able to attach them to your keys or whatever makes all the difference!
3,Good case for the AirPod.  Only problem I have had is that the carabiner broke on the second day. Quality of the carabiner isn't great but other than that the case is good.
5,Exactly how I expected it very soft and sturdy I recommend
5,The color helps me to keep track of where they are! I like it. Worth the money
5,Easy to put on. Looks sharp. Keeps my AirPods safe. It does everything I need it to. I would definitely recommend.
5,I love that it keeps your EarPods from scratches and it’s easier to hold on to.
1,the case is good but it didn’t even have the hook like on the picture the thing on the side of the case to put the hook on
5,Great look to it with the brown metal clip. Fits perfect on the air pod case!
3,Love the concept and it worked for a few weeks but then the hook just broke and almost lost the AirPods ... poor quality unfortunately!
5,I bought a Black and Red colors.Black color is for My dad.He love it !
5,As described
5,I bought this case for my boyfriend and he loves it.
3,The case doesn’t line up where you open the AirPods. I don’t know if I got a defect one or what. The case is super soft though!
5,they’re awesome best case that i found and i love the color !
5,Love the case for my Ear Pods It can collect dust and other stuff from your pocket but pretty good other wise
3,Makes carrying the AirPods convenient. Barely glows as much as I thought it would. Works as a quick solution for needing a case.
5,Glows really good when i get home from work. Love it
5,Great for taking an extra thing out of ur pocket an it goes on with ease
5,fits perfectly. even with the case i am able to use my doc charger to charge. the included caribeaner is nice to attach it to my backpack or briefcase.
5,It does the job. And I feel like compared to other brands it looks more minimalistic and durable.
5,Perfect fit! Love the feeling of the case! It keeps my AirPods case clean dry and handy.
5,Very worth the money good quality and to my surprise the light color doesn’t look dirty over time
5,The perfect way to keep my pods charged all the time! I unhook them and attached them to everything Gym bag purse keys its awesome
1,How embarrassing that the ear buds were not in the case.  I received the product and gave it as a gift.  To my surprise it was empty.  I am requesting a refund.
5,does not bright enough all night like the moon.. but looks similar
5,Super soft silicone love that it comes with a carabiner so I can attach it to my bag and never have to wonder where it is!
5,Great color and quality. I wanted something that protects the case and had a way to attach the AirPods to my keys and this does exactly that.
5,This was a gift for my granddaughter as far as I know she loves it
5,Purchased for my grandson and he loves it. Keeps the finger prints and scratches less noticeable.
5,I love it 😍😍
5,Fits very well. Perfect to hang on the loop for jeans
3,The case itself has a perfect fit. But the carabiner broke within one week of light use.
5,This is amazing!! I love everything about it!! its perfect No Problems!!! I just wish it wasn't silicone and it didn't get dirty quick!!
5,Elago has some good quality products. Good soft touch material and sturdy.
5,Way sturdier than another case I’ve used! The hook seems more secure too. LOVE IT!
4,Fits perfectly and looks good
5,Very happy I got this! Makes it so I can keep on key ring.
5,I really loved it. Firm grip and fits perfect. Reasonable. I would recommend it.
5,Nice and good quality. Color same as described. I love it
5,I love it!! It is so durable and fits great I definitely recommend.
3,I forgot what a lint magnet this material can be my black case is peppered with white specs. Also the top does not fit properly. But its okay.
5,This case protects the air bud case and fits well. The clip is nice as well
5,If it wasn’t for this I would have lost my AirPods. I love it
3,I love it for the most part but the piece that connects the top to the bottom has broken and now the top piece occasionally comes off.
2,Doesn’t match the picture description it does not have the pairing button on the back.
5,Me agrado
5,Very handy on a backpack when on the move and in need of headphones.
5,A good way to remember to put away and keep safe.
5,Nice cushion pouch for EarPods and it’s easy to get the EarPods into case
5,I absolutely love it and it is exactly as it is advertised on amazon.
5,Perfect fit and a tight grip on the case. Smells a bit weird but other than that it is a great protective cover
3,Plastic pink cover doesn’t stay closed. Always flapping open makes me afraid that I will lose one of my AirPods.
5,This is a great product although it does get pretty dirty.
5,Fits the case very well. The ring is strong enough to be attach to my keyring. The silicone cover protects the case from scratches.
5,Exactly what I was looking for and I was not disappointed.  Excellent product fits snug (as it should) and best of all it has a hook!
2,Really like the idea of it glowing is why I bought it. I left in sun light all day once it glow it was very light. So light it was hard to tell it was blue.
5,Fits my AirPod Case perfectly and I can still put the case on the charger. I did change the carabiner to one I already.
5,These are great! They fit perfect. The clip isn’t the best but works for what it need to.
5,besides attracting dust and lint.  it protects the case and still looks good after 5 months of use.
5,Great case! Easy to put on and helps differentiate your airpods
5,Very nice! Good and pretty protection for my precious AirPods.
5,Great product much better than the last two that I had before !! very recommended.
5,These have been great!
5,Nice color and the quality looks pretty good!
5,Use every single day and really like it. My only wish is for more colors.
5,Love it! Keep it hooked on a ring inside my bag and I never lose them!
5,Love the black color goes perfect with my purse. Clip works well.
5,The best thing I have court is AirPods and the next best thing is this pouch to the airpods
5,I love the color and the product works very well
5,Awsome
5,It’s just like the image!!! And ships fast:)
5,Fits perfect. I've stretched it a few times to take the case out and has not lost its original form. Highly recommended.
5,Perfect case! Can hang onto the pant belt loop and keep you from losing your AirPods. Looks great too
1,Very poor quality. Does not look as pictured.
4,Good
5,Love!
1,Absolute crap. It's cut wrong and so doesn't fit the case at all.
2,I really like the case but disappointed that is has discolored. I keep it hanging inside my black purse and it appears the black has rubbed off yet it’s a cloth material and has never rubbed off on any other items I have. I do recommend the case just be careful with what color you get
5,The case fits well. Much better then the another brand I purchased before this one. The material feels better too.
5,I like the fact I can hook them onto my bookbag and go on with my day
5,Perfect for my AirPods  especially when I’m always on the go
5,Have this clipped on my backpack everyday. Great product.
2,The carabiner broke on the second day. I had it clipped to my backpack. I’m a first year dental student so I sit in one classroom all day (I’m not doing a lot of walking or swinging my backpack around). Scary moment when the AirPod case dropped to the ground and a classmate stepped on it. I like the case don’t rely on the carabiner clip.
5,Liked the product fits perfect and it looks really nice thanks
3,It works well but the material on it broke after two or three months. Can't be surprised though it is pretty cheap.
5,love the clip
5,got this for christmas and it’s super cute
5,Just what I wanted. I can hook it on anything which makes it perfect to make sure it is not lost
5,Really nice it fits perfect!!!
2,Hubby LOVES his earbuds but wanted a case for them so if they dropped it wouldn't damage his case.....These definitely do that HOWEVER they stick in his dress pants and jeans pockets which is totally annoying.  the O-ring looks a little flimsy so he is afraid that it could break and his beloved earbuds would be lost so now no longer uses them.....hence the 2 stars.NOT RECOMMENDED!
3,Got this case for my wife and a premium Catalyst case (twice the price) for myself ... this one is a value for the price
5,I love this cover for my ear pods I just hook it to my keys and it goes with me.
5,It fits perfectly and is made from high quality materials. Very happy and will be buying more products from this company
5,This is the best thing I invest in so I don’t lose my ear pods.
3,The keychain and key ring have already chipped and broke. Haven’t owned it a month
5,Fits my case perfectly. This protects the case nicely and also makes it much easier to grip. Great value!
5,The case fits perfectly on the airpods case and keeps it secure so you dont lose them or damage them
5,It’s good
5,I like the feel and protection this case offers. A good deal.
5,Just what I was expecting. Perfect little case for my air pods!
5,Very cute and functional i love it
5,This is so legit. Works perfectly fits nicely and is a great protective companion for your $160 gadget
5,Perfect fit!
5,Bought it for granddaughter and she is pleased
5,I love my new case for iPad the color is super cute!
5,Like fits like a globe good quality
5,Got it as a gift and they loved it
2,The silicone sleeve is nice fits snug on the case. However the carabiner clip broke within a day or so after sitting in my purse--unused. I worry that If it was clipped to my keys or on the exterior of my purse I would have lost my airpods completely.
5,Very good
5,Great product serves it’s purpose and great for the price
5,Perfect fit as advertised and the clip is very handy for belt loop or back pack. Secure.
5,Fit great and seems to be of good quality.
5,Great case protector as well as it's always convenient that they are attached to my keys.
1,It’s broken after 3 days
5,Hook it to your backpack and you’ll never lose your Air Pods charging base. A life saver.
5,I put this on a lanyard to wear around my neck.  It's a perfect system.
5,Case was shipped quickly and was exactly what we ordered!
5,Love it
5,Love it. Great product and great value
5,Great addition. Love the blue glow in the dark color
3,Worked for 3 months. Silicon gets loose on airpods. Tried double stick tape and everything. Didn't work. Was good while it lasted
1,Doesn’t have the side part for the clipIs different from the picture
5,Perfect fit. And love the uses. KEeps my airpods safe and easy to find.
3,Flimsy.  Cheap caribener.  Top of case detached within a few weeks
5,Very nice
5,Wasn't what I thought ended up returning.
3,They are functional but will rip easy.  The rubber material is very thin.
5,I love it! This is a high quality product for a good price. It fits perfectly.
5,Love it keep my AirPod covered.
5,Works good clip that comes with it broke 2days later.
5,AirPod case works great pray it doesn’t stretch
2,The case itself is super cute it glows in the dark it’s got gold glitter BUT it’s not made very well the cover doesn’t meet the bottom half when it’s closed and it seems to be cut crooked. The part where you would put the D-ring attachment seems like it will break off easily.
5,Wife uses these all the time and don’t fall off like others
2,It’s suuuuuper thin material. Don’t expect this to last much.
3,Hook broke immediately
5,case is nice and now the air pod case does not slip out of your hand...
5,Bought these for my boyfriend and he loved them!
1,It was a piece of junk flimsy wouldn't even close correctly. I threw it away!
5,Light weight and covers my Airpods perfectly.
2,Great as a cover protect from scratches fits snuggly into the earpod 2. However small bumps and drops would be the only protection the cover provides. Fluorescent effect is sorely lacking. The glow is both dimmed and outright failed to show up at the front side. Otherwise not bad. 6.5/10
5,Works as advertised. Fits the AirPods case nicely.
1,Item color pretty bland and the real reason I bought this item was for the glow in the dark feature with is still so hard to see in the dark. My wife who I bought it for took it off her AirPods and just went back to using the regular case she had before!!!
5,It’s the color that I wanted no other color
5,Great idea. Hooks onto my keys so always with me
1,Would’ve been nice if there was somewhere to put the clip through they didn’t think that one through  defective product.And brand name is not on the case either.And looks totally different.Definitely not the same product as pictured.
5,Great product exactly as described. No complaints.
5,I love it! You shouldn’t hesitate and just buy it
2,Bought based on the reviews.  Must be couons on a discount site somewhere because this is no 10.00 item.  So overpriced.  Fits poorly feels cheap both pieces of metal feel flimsy and insubstantial.The only redemption is the matte black looks good — because cheap silicone is hard to screw up.Total disappointment.
5,I have used my case daily for almost 2 months. Zero complaints.
2,Received the product but it didn't glow in dark room like how it's shown on the page or from other users' pics.The material felt smooth and nice except the connector part between the top and bottom was a little flimsy. So I returned it eventually.
5,It fit perfectly! It doesn’t slip out or nothing
5,Exactly what I needed. Fits perfect.
5,I haven't found anything wrong with the case.
5,Super bright in the dark
5,Good quality worth the money.
5,It is excellent for my Airpods' case
5,Fits good looks cute and good quality
3,Exactly as described. The glow stays for the entire night but accumulates too much dust easily.
5,Fantastic case! Keeps air pods protected.
5,Easy to place and protect the Airpots case!
5,Love this product.  Reasonably priced fit like a glove and works as expected.
2,It worked fine for 3 months but now the top is loose and comes off the top part of my air pods. This has caused my case to open several times on its own I’m scared i may loose my air pods if they fly out when it opens
5,Really cheap and really good quality
5,Good product
5,Great quality! love this little case!
5,One of the best Amazon finds!
5,Great case! Exactly what I expected.
5,Good quality and no complaints.
5,It's awesome fits like a glove and attaches to my purse.
5,Very good and worth the money
5,Awesome case to protect my airpods
5,Love the fit
1,This product is JUNK. Do not spend your money.
1,Horrible product. Don’t waste your money. Feels cheap and didn’t come with a keychain clip.
5,Love love love
1,The hain is always upside down. The only reason I got it so it would glow at night since I tend to loose my airpods a lot. So I would Deff not buy it ever again. I do not recommend
5,Fits well on case
5,This is amazing
5,Great quality and fit. Looks and works great.
3,it does not shine enough
2,The issue with the product was the included hook/clip for the case was already broken and loose. It was already broken when we receive the item. Im not sure if the seller will send a replacement for that hook/clip.
5,Great product and excellent customer service!
3,Case is ok. Stretches out pretty quickly but it works and it looks good.
5,The color
5,Great product would buy again
5,Great design and fit perfectly!
5,Great product I keep it on my keychain makes it very easy
5,Very happy with it
3,Case is awesome but the carabiner broke the first day.
5,I like the glow it fits my AirPods case well. Love the carabiner.
5,Love the blue glow!
5,Great product. If I didn’t have the caribeaner I would’ve lost them.
5,Awesome protection and looks good
5,Fit's great. to early to tell how long the the hook last

5,Quality was good
5,Fits perfect would recommend anyone to purchase
5,Perfect
5,very practical with a nice grip that doesnt slip on surfaces.
5,This fit perfectly and gives my AirPods a good layer of protection.
1,The cover ripped on the first back my daughter used it. It’s not durable or sturdy at all. Don’t waste your money. It’s cheap for a reason.
3,Cheap material and lets dust get into the pods/pod case.
5,For AirPods  it’s simple
1,It was cute but didn’t come with the keychain to hang it plus the case didn’t have the hole to hang it as well
5,it’s cute and fits well
5,Love it.  Perfect for clipping to my backpack
5,For my ear pord
2,Everything is good but it got dirty realley fast and lose the glow effect because of it soo not worth pay more for the glow.
5,Nada
5,It is worth the money spend.
5,Perfect. It’s awesome
5,Yes
5,It is perfect
1,I purchased and received this case last week. First the little strip that attaches the top to the bottom is extremly thin and it is obvious that it will quickly break. I decided to keep it anyhow. Once I put the case on my airpods it doesn't fit properly. There is a small gap on one side in the front so that the bottom of the case doesn't meet the top. I am returning this case and searching for a better quality replacement.
5,Just as described. Got in on time. Love it
5,Great product fits perfectly. Surely protects the AirPods case from scratches A+++++

5,Works great
5,We good
5,Good product

5,Love my case
5,Excelent
3,It work
5,I like it... fits the device perfectly.
1,I am not  happy with my AirPod hang case at all. I ordered this after I ordered a similar one for my husband. This one is made from cheap silicone and it picks up all types of lint and debris and looks filthy all the time. To make matters worse it does not fully close and is uneven so it only covers part of the lid for the AirPods.
5,Very good case for airpods
5,love it bring it around with me everywhere
5,Perfect
2,It does not provide coverage drom dust for charging port
5,Perfect fit and my wife adores it.
2,Looks nice easy to use. Downside is it gets dirty suuuppperr easy.dust gets in it easily. Metal par broke after a while.it can be replaced sinse it not attached
5,Very decent quality! Fits perfectly.
5,Great product
1,I was very disappointed in this product and doubly disappointed when I discovered they were not returnable.  They are made from flimsy rubber and provide no support for the AirPods. There is a carabiner with the product and I suppose the idea is to clip the product on to something. However this would not keep what's inside from falling out and getting lost. Save your money.
2,If you’re expecting a night glow blue just know you’re not getting that.  You’re getting a white case.  It has the faintest blue tinge not even noticeable to a casual glance.
2,I’ve had this cover for about a month and within 2 weeks the keychain broke and the the silicone cover for the top ripped off
2,Mine came defective with a scratch on the silicone so it looks broken. I’m afraid to have it near any moisture/ water just in case it really is broken
5,Cheap and good. I definitely recommend it
5,good quality
5,Fits great and allows for easy access
1,I wasn’t going to write a review because I was too busy enjoying the thought of not wasting time finding my AirPod case. Until the ring clip completely stopped latching causing the entire pod case and rubber case to disappear from my belt loop! BUYER BEWARE! This product is faulty and the clip is very cheap. I only had this for 2 days and now I have no AirPod to enjoy.
5,Nice looking case. Very durable. Definitely recommend
5,This fits​ perfectly with my airpods!
5,Just like the picture
1,Not well made.  Clip broke off within 2 weeks also lid doesn't close tight-always a gap on one side.
5,Item as expected very fast shipping
5,Perfect
5,Fits like a glove and looks great!
5,Great
5,The case works perfectly
2,For the most part this is as expected but I was hoping that it’d fit the whole thing and not have this gap. Wouldn’t purchase again but not sure it’s worh returning.
5,Works great.
5,Just perfect
5,Good for what I needed it for.
5,Loved this
5,Strongly recommend!
5,sleek fits perfect around the case!!!
5,Like it
5,Great way not to lose them.
5,Quality Product!
5,Great thing!
5,Great
5,Perfecto
5,WORKS WELL FOR ME.
5,Super useful.
1,The photo shows a silicone case with a white molded plastic inside unit that holds the earphones securely. THERE IS NO INSIDE UNIT. It's just the soft silicone case. It's not going to protect my headphones; hell it doesn't even close properly so they'll fall out the minute I drop this in my purse. Returning. Hassle. Boooo.
5,Nice product.  Great form and fit.
2,This was a terrible AirPod case it fit but collected dust and broke in 1 week
1,Made of thin cheap silicone-like material.  This case will not fit a real Apple AirPods self-charging set...as implied in the advertising of the product. The material is so thin I was afraid I would tear it by trying to put it on!  Very bad purchase!!
5,Nice quality! Case fits perfectly!
5,Great product thsnk you
5,Great fit. Love it.
5,Fits very nice! Very handy!
5,Protects air pod case nicely
1,Do not buy these!! They won’t fit and they don’t come with the key chain listed.
5,Perfect Fit for my AirPods
5,Great product
5,Very nice product well built
5,Great fit
1,The case didn't even last for a month it's now falling apart and faded.
5,very good
1,This lasted maybe a month. I wear it on my belt loop every day and the first thing that happened was the top became loose and will not stay on top of the bud case. Now the clip broke (spring is missing) and it is completely useless.  Save your money. This isn't worth it!
2,The clip broke and now I have to carry in my pocket. Or buy another clip alone. Apparently poor quality
5,Fits perfectly!
5,GREAT PRODUCT QUICK SHIPMENT.
5,Very good
5,Very good
1,Well I received the product immediately and actually wanted to return it as I had a reconsideration.  But unfortunately am unable to...as they don’t take returns.  So I said perhaps i’ll use it.  Went to put it on my AirPod case and it doesn’t even fit it’s too small.
5,my case fits perfectly into this.
5,grandson loved it
5,Fits perfect
2,Just had it for a couple weeks and the clip has already broke. One of the main reasons why I brought it was for the clip.
5,Perfect! Just what I need
5,Excellent product. Nuff said
5,Its good quality perfect fir
5,Works perfectly!
5,Love the glow!
5,Fit perfect
5,Perfect for care are you
1,Looked very durable but just didn’t fit my Air Pods
5,Perfect fit.
5,Ok
1,Recieved this product today the container doesn’t actually close the photos make it look like there is supposed to be a fitting inside the silicon so the earbuds won’t rattle around but that’s not what I recieved. The only thing accurate about this product description is that it’s a soft shade of pink.  These will be getting returned.
1,Two things:-This product did not glow in the dark (not even in a pitch black room could you see the slighest glow). It was plain clear.-It was cut so badly that it did not align when my AirPod was closed. It looks super cheap and bulky.What a rip off. I will be returning.
5,Awesome case
5,great fit!
2,The case does not fit the airpods correctly. There's an awkward gap where the opening is. I would not buy again kind of disappointed
5,Perfect
2,I’ve had this less than a month and it’s already torn apart. I would not recommend you waste your money.
5,Great product
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!
1,Bought this for my teenage son and he was super excited! He put the case on his AirPods and after two hours the case ripped when he opened the AirPods. This product does not have any durability and there’s no return policy. My advice is to save your money.
5,Love it
1,does not fit at all
1,The product is flimsy and doesn’t fit the case properly as some other reviews have stated. But the biggest problem is that the return policy sucks and the seller will not allow returns/refunds. I guess it’s because they know everyone would be returning their crappy product.
1,Very thin silicon case. No way this thing can protect anything only good for to be able to carry your AirPods on a hook that’s about it. Haven’t had it too long and the top portion has already ripped from the bottom 1/2 with normal usage.
1,This is pretty much just a "clear version" of the casing not "glow." I got these on purpose to help me locate them easier in my backpack and what not but as soon as i tried placing it away from light it is even more harder to locate. Definitely false description.
1,I used this for a while and it seemed to be cheaply made. However the other day it seems to have broken off of my keys and now my $175 AirPods are gone forever due to a poorly made product. I am now out about $200 because of this product. Thank you so much elago .
5,work as expected
5,Very useful
5,Works perfect!
5,Good
5,LOVE
1,Was pretty good at first but today (after 3 months)  I notice that the part that acts like the hinge has been slowly tearing and now is apart.  so now I'm concerned the top part of the cover will slip off and I'll lose it.  I'm going to have to order a different brand.
2,Apoco tiempo de uso la goma que protege la tapa comienza aflojarse y no la cubre.
2,Does not glow up at all
5,Does the job!
5,Perfect
2,Doesn’t come with the clip it states in the details of the product you are to receive.
1,Bad quality the little chain broke before i even put it on
5,Love it
5,Perfect.
1,This was an ad on Facebook and it appears to looks like a really nice material. It’s cheap! The quality of the case and key ring are poorly made. I tried to return this and it doesn’t allow me too.
2,clean it once every while but it just gets dirty too often
2,It’s beautiful case for the AirPods and great quality but the clip broke two days after I put it in my purse.
2,The skin for the pods are good but the key chain part broke within minutes of usage.
1,Clip was busted when it arrived. The top doesn’t completely fit over the case and it collects every spec of dust and dirt. Threw it out after a week. Pass.
1,Awful product that came in one piece had to cut it in order for it to open and came without the part to hook onto.  The charging port cover doesn’t cover charging port.
2,came with the bottom protector torn the top side remains nice
1,The item doesn’t fit right. It doesn’t line up in front and looks crooked. The top and bottom parts don’t quit meet and there’s a gap. I’m really disappointed.
1,Product does not match the picture of the product. The unit can not attack to the metal ring! As shown in the picture of the product. The top does not stay on the top of the case
2,It’s fine because the color is good.
2,Broke after 1 month
1,Shame on me for not recognizing this product is not eligible for return. What a joke!!!!! Probably the cheesiest product I’ve ever order from Amazon and that’s a lot. Do NOT waste your $.
1,Rubber does not fulfill the role of expansion cover in several weeks using.I really waste money.And it was an Amazon choice. I bought it with confidence but please return the money.
2,Missing the key part of the item
1,Not the best quality but at this price point I wasn’t really surprised. Should be ok with light use but wouldn’t trust them for protection.
1,It is horrible.
2,It was good for about the first month or two and then the case got really loose
2,Only had this for 6 months and it stared ripping already. Otherwise it worked great.
1,Clip broke after a week
2,Top of the case doesn’t fit.
1,It’s only a week since I used this product and the clip already broke. The case is great but now I have to look for another clip to replace the broken one.
1,My boys just received these for Christmas it’s January 5 and the clip already broke. Thankfully we didn’t lose the ear buds. We ordered in October so we missed the return window.
1,I absolutely love this product BUT two of them broke on me. =(. They say their product has a 1 year warranty but there is no way to reach out to them
1,Not happy! This didn’t fit my earbuds so I tried to return it but I am getting a message saying “not returnable”. I bought 2 so now I’m out $20.
1,Product worked great for a couple of weeks until it tore off of the carabiner. I bought this to protect my $150 headphones and instead it caused me to lose them.
1,This thing is just a rubbery casement – – the lid does not seal shut. So you can’t use the carabiner to attach it to anything because whatever you put in it will fall out. Useless!
2,Poorly made. Doesn’t cover the airpods completely.
2,My EarPods did not quite fit in the sleeve.
2,does not glow. but at least it covers my AirPod case...
1,Not at all what was expected. 0 stars if I could. Product does not work. Don’t be fooled
1,Rubber that keeps the top half and bottom half ripped the first time I used the carabiner . The AirPods slipped out of the case and fell ... lucky I saw them
1,it keeps slipping offf of my air pods ANOYYING
1,actual colour is different from images. lovely pink is depicted as a darker/contrasting tone in real life whereas i was expected a lighter shade of pink. disappointed.
1,JUNK! There are other ones on amazon that are the same price that are way better quality. The rubber is thin. The runner is uneven. Others have a piece that covers the power outlet.
1,The charger that I bought from you it keeps on saying that my Apple  phone  is not charging very well  I would like to return and get my money back
1,The case fits good but the top doesn’t stay on the AirPods case it self it keeps on coming off. It never was Stays on.
1,It doesn't close properly.And now i can't return don't understand why snd Amazon doesn't allow too return. 😏I don't Recommend it. 👎
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Does not glow in the dark
1,i loved the glow in the dark one for my pods ... only if the key ring didn't break on me :(
1,Lost my AirPods because the attachment was flimsy and it broke out
1,Doesn’t come with a clip.
1,I recieved a different item for this order. Please contact me. We are not able to do a return for it.
1,Sticks to all lint and my case had a little cut so it’s starting to tear right off and leaves marks on your AirPods case
1,Doesnt keep the dirt out as why is the resin for needing the case
1,I received a totally different item? I received AirPod earhooks and not an AirPod silicon case I’m confused?
1,The keychain part tore causing me to lose my AirPods.. kind of defeated the purpose.
1,The seam between the two half of the case broke within two weeks of regular use connecting it primarily to my backpack and occasionally to my front belt loop.
1,The case came in with a carabiner but nothing to hook it onto. There’s no plastic loop to hook it onto.
1,Clip is very thing and broke within minutes.
1,Clasp broke after only 2 weeks of use. Bummer.
1,The keychain/hook broke the first day its make really cheap😔
1,Product was good but lost my AirPods from faulty clip
1,I don’t like I picked black and they sent me a gray color
1,There is no place for the carabiner to go. It is soft though so thats a plus.
1,It doesn’t light up in the dark
1,Product broke within two months of use. I would not recommend it at all
1,The product color is white not blue.
1,Really bad quality
1,Arrived defective and NO RETURNS allowed? BUYERS BEWARE
1,Not everything in this picture was sent to me.
1,I think mine was defected it stayed well at the begging but later if fitted loosey with the case inside
1,It’s cheap rubber. It doesn’t close never had a problem with Amazon products until now. Do not purchase.
1,The plastic ripped after a little less than a week of use Very disappointed
1,product cheap and isn't good for head phones
1,Be warned this dies not work!!!!!With Apple pods
1,Not a good product. It doesn’t fit well
1,no product in the package
1,Terrible case. Collects so much dust and lint.
1,Very update I can’t return and it doesn’t fit
1,it's just white it's not blue at night
1,Cheap caribeeber clip broke after 4 days of use. Simply hanging on my purse. Unacceptable.
1,Bottom part fits perfectly but the top part is too small! Will be returning.
5,cute simple case
1,this thing does not glow at all!! don't buy!
1,the material attacks dust and you'll have to clean it almost every couple hours
1,Insert is missing so it’s useless
1,No fue lo q yo pedí
1,This item does not glow at night . I am very unhappy with that
1,Product came apart almost immediately. Had to return
1,Case broke off keychain after two days!
1,Too soft
1,crappy product broke within a week
5,It was a gift for my daughter and she love it!!!
1,No
1,Malo
1,The description is incorrect and not real
1,Product minus white inner casing
1,Doesn’t remained closed.
1,Super flimsy material cut out was horrible.
1,it does not stay
1,item came deformed. poor quality
4,This this great keeps the airpod case from sliding out of your pocket if you have short pockets and are sitting. Also the Apple case is slippery this gives you a grip on the case.
5,It came a day early! When I first put it on my airpods the top was uneven. But after moving it around I realized that it wasn’t placed on all the way. So when I pushed it down completely it was even! I’m very glad I bought this! I’ve been seeing this airpod case around Pinterest for a couple days and as soon as I found it on amazon i bought it! I highly recommend for any Airpods user to get this because I have many minor scratches on my airpods charging case and I wish I knew about this product sooner so that I could have avoided it. Would recommend to others! the pink color i purchased was very pretty and pale just like it was shown online. in a couple months i’ll come back and update if anything happens with it! idk how durable it is yet. Thanks Elago!
4,Good product maybe the washer could be stronger. Looks weak in case any push.
5,I use it all the time and in the evening when I'm in bad listening something it's so cool that it glows in dark I can easily find case without turning lite on.
5,I really like this case it definitely protects my AirPods. Also it’s not a heavy or flashy case it is a perfect amount of protection. I feel like my case is less slippery now so that’s a positive. Happy with my purchase.
5,I highly recommend. I’ve had this case for over a year. I use them everyday and I usually throw the case in my bag full of other stuff. The case has held up very well.
5,I love how snug my airpods fir in the case. The color is a couple shades lighter than in the picture bit the color is still as I expected. I like how subtle the brand name is etched infront. You’d hardly see it. Out off all the available cases online am happy with the simplicity of how this was made.
3,If you are looking for something cute and not long lasting this will work. Fit air pod case well. Can see lights through case. Has a translucent look.
5,These are so Awesomeness I would most definitely recommend I have been threw a lot of these kinds of headphones and these are definitely the best 5⭐s hands down!!!!!
5,I’m so glad I purchased one!
5,So convenient and easy way to carry it. Would recommend especially if it's for kids
5,Bought this for my wife to protect her new airpods and she loves it. The case is soft and clips to her purse so she doesn't have to add another thing in her purse. So far so good!
5,He loved it and wants more colors
3,I like the case for what it is but soooo disappointed in the color. I got the midnight blue  because I saw the picture and how awesome it looked but when I have it in dark places it literally doesn’t change to the blue color at all. Doesn’t glow like it’s shown in the pictures. It’s just a basic white case. I wish I didn’t get the midnight blue. Probably would’ve liked a different color. /:
5,Exactly what I needed to protect my AirPods. Thank You!
5,Great accessorie to have I’m was scared of losing them and with this case I’m comfortable and confident they will be where I left them. I can clip them to my backpack or bag even my pants.
5,Very convenient for being on the go love it!
5,I love this! Much easier to quickly find my AirPods when someone calls since I can clip them on my backpack.
5,good case good price
5,This makes it so easy to keep up with my AirPods. I keep it on my keychain and get compliments all the time
5,Fast shipping and fits perfectly. Hoping it helps keep these handier​ and not lost.
5,Fits nice and snug with AirPod case no issues closing or opening the lid.
2,Nice soft silicone material. Easy to put on. I wanted to be able carry on my jacket or backpack but the Carabiner broke after 1 week of use which defeated the purpose of why I bought it.
2,Have had this for a weeks. Loved it for the clip on the case. Worked great until this morning when the spring In the clip broke :(
2,Quality is good but unfortunately I received a defective product and had to return it.
1,So cheaply made. I only had this for two days and the hook broke. Don’t waste your money on this.
1,My biggest gripe is it is not a perfect fit. There’s a slight opening and not perfectly aligned like it claims to be.. it bothers me a lot because slight dirt or dust gets in there
1,Not as discribed there was no place to put in the hook whatsoever...Will return it
1,Does not shut properly not worth it
5,Haven’t had the case for too long but it seems very sturdy and I like the fact that the top cover is attached to the rest of it instead of being a separate piece like others are.
5,This cover is a perfect fit for my new AirPods. It offers enough protection without making the case bulky. The color is a pretty shade of light pink. Silicone does attract dust easily but it’s easy to wipe off.
5,Does the trick and looks great
5,I love my airpod case very durable and I've been using it for 2 years now! Would 100% recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I liked this case fits snugly and it glows in the dark which is pretty cool!!
5,Does the job! Silicone seems to stay on well so far! Not bad for the price
5,Love my little case the color is beautiful. My AirPods fit perfect.
5,I like it
5,I like this case very much I honestly don't see it glow much because it is always in my purse but it does glow. I made sure to try that as soon as I got it. I would recommend this item!
5,Love the color & quality. Doesn't slip off like other covers I've had.
5,It came fast and it’s a good quality case. It’s not made cheaply and it glows exactly like how the picture shows.
5,very cute! i love the color
5,Gives the case extra level of protection.
5,i love my lil airpod container it makes carrying it around so much easier and very accessible
5,Works as intended and the color is pretty. 😁
5,So cute! Great quality. Yellow is more muted than the picture but I like it much better. Super soft silicone. Perfect to put in keychain.
5,super cute and the color is exactly as expected. the only issue would be that as for quality the sizing is just slightly off and a little smaller so it doesnt cover the top part 100 percent. but not a big deal.  it also comes with a carabiner which is very nice
5,I’ve almost lost my airpods several times because the clip isn’t very sturdy if you’re buying just for the case I suggest this but don’t count on clipping it to something and having it stay! You will loose your airpods. Cute and durable case though. Worth the money for the case.
5,This thing is exactly how I hoped it would be and I already like Elago as a brand.PRO-TIP: if you want to really charge up the glow but you don't want the summer sun beating down on you while you do it the flashlight in your smartphone does a great job.Don't believe the other reviews saying this doesn't do what it's supposed to; this product is 100% what it says it is.
5,Great product looks great
5,The silicone nicely protects the slippery earpods case from slipping out of hand and against dropping damage. The red silicone makes easy to find about the house.
5,Travel easy to find in my purse
5,Lovely color!
5,Great case. I was surprised it was rubbery and not hard.
5,I love the color it’s so cute!!! Worth the money
5,Perfect for identifying your air pods from others.  Durable & cute.
5,La calidad es buenísima y linda. Practico para llevar a dónde quieras gracias al gancho con el que viene
3,Going back I don’t think I would buy this just because I personally don’t want the silicone texture. I have two dogs and their hair stuffed to the case. I would get something that’s acrylic. But I love the color
5,I love everything about it. It’s really soft and study. The case fits perfectly no gaps anywhere. I highly recommend it.
5,I bought this for my 15 year old for her iPods.  They are a perfect fit on the charging case and she is able to now attach it to her backpack where she won't lose them.  Bought her a second case in a different color just so she can accessorize.  If/when her favorite color changes I'm sure we will buy another one.
5,nice color and fits my airpods perfectly. i can’t see the light shine through though but idk what that means anyways. overall i love it
5,Bought this for my daughter so she can actually keep up with her AirPods. The color is beautiful and the silicone is silky soft. It has a nice solid jump ring and clip. I’d buy it again!
5,Love this case!!! Better than I thought it was going to be!! It’s fits my AirPods like a glove!!! The impressions where you lift the case aren’t *perfect* but in my opinion if you aren’t looking for it you wouldn’t notice. Slim and I love the option of a clip! And the color was spot on to the photos I saw!
5,Love the color and that it came with a small carabiner to attach to purse!
5,It lasts a long time and it’s very bright. Would recommend.
5,This was a purchase by my 17 year old daughter. It has held up well and looked good doing it.
1,Broke of the keychain
5,love that this case comes with a keychain piece so i can easily carry my case with me. also the latch connecting the bottom piece to the top is great in making sure the case stays on sturdily. the color is also super pretty very sagey.
4,I liked these. The only thing is the plastic peice that connects the top and bottom breaks easily. Other than that I like the clip and the color looks exactly how it’s does online.
5,Love this item for my new AirPods. I love the color and texture of the case and it fits perfectly.
5,I really love this case and it helps protect my AirPods very well. As well as looks cute.
5,Bought this cute green case so that matches my laptop case and love it. Plus it came with a clip so I could easily attach it to my keys :)
5,Perfect for teen girl.
5,me encanto
5,This case feels really nice and the packaging was nice too I would definitely recommend 🤟🏼😫
5,Love this case and helps me never lose MY pair
5,It’s a very soft case. And I really love the color. And it doesn’t prevent the AirPod Case to snap back. I just really really love it.
5,Did fit well and will really protect ur ipod case.
5,Fits perfectly durable as described! Super cute.
4,Definitely should buy
5,Great product my daughter loves it
5,
5,My daughter loved the color and the key chain comes in handy
5,Very durable and cute! I love the white as it matches with everything and anything! It is very light weight and is good quality! The material is thick and secure and no worries if your AirPods falling out! Also it’s all one piece so makes it 12/10 would recommend!
5,Gift
5,super super cute!! was able to attach to my lanyard and keys so easily with no problems at all. the only issue is sometimes the inside of the case will get a little dirty but it’s easy to clean. otherwise this is perfect!!
4,It’s good but you can tell not gonna last
5,Fits AirPods case perfectly.
5,Product was cheaply made never put it on my AirPods it does glow in the dark though
5,But for Christmas gifts and they were pretty
5,I like everything about this case. It does everything it is supposed to protect your AirPods from scratching and nicks. The one gripe I have is that it collects white dust lint and other things pretty easily. This isn't really hard to get off so it isn't really a problem.
5,Very pleased great quality!
1,I will not order this case again. This case holds on to everything. Lent dust hair everything
5,Love it. Its durable and great color.
5,Perfect! Just what I was looking for
5,Got this protection for my air pod and it works extremely well!! Love it now I can toss my air pod around the house without worrying about damaging it. Lol
5,Very nice color and easy to take anywhere.
5,Durable
5,It's a great AirPods case for the price. I accidentally dropped it when I was trying to take a picture (oops) and it turned out to be ok. I love the bronze look of the keychain that was included. I wasn't a fan at first but I gave it a few days and it actually looks good. Gives me steampunk vibes and the case & keychain both feel good in the hands.
5,This is my second AirPod Case; the first one was not as well made and the top always felt a little loose. It’s finally gave out after three months.This time I bought one from Amazon and I’m so happy with it
5,I’m always digging around my purse for my AirPods (and dropping the whole case and mixing up my AirPods with my bf’s) so I needed a way to easily reach store and identify my device. Works great easy to grasp when clipped to the upper inside portion of my purse.
5,Good product. My old one came apart so this was a good replacement.
5,This brand fits like a glove! We each have one for our AirPods. Easy to put on and perfectly designed to fit! Very pleased!
5,Was worried the color would be different in real life but I love it!
4,Everything about the product is great! It fit my case really well and does a great job at protecting it from drops it does get dirty a bit fast because of the silicone material stuff sort of sticks on it so I recommend washing from time to time with just water. Except the glow in the dark it does glow in the dark and can be very bright but the case has to be left in the light for the case to glow in the dark. The first picture is just how it regularly glows in the dark after a day of carrying around the second is the case put into direct light for awhile.
5,Just what I needed
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,I loved the color and it was so easy to put on but not as much taking off which is a good thing😂
5,Very cheap cute works like any other case :) good purchase.
5,Keeps my case from getting scratched and the clip makes me feel more confident that I won’t lose it.
5,Perfect addition to my air pods!! Easy to keep track of
4,今のところ問題なく使用できています。もう少しピチッとしていてもいいかなという印象です。
4,The case for the AirPods is well made with thick durable silicon material that feels extremely premium and smooth to the touch. My main complaint when I first put on this product was that the upper portion of the case failed to fully cover the lid of the AirPods; however you simply have to pull it down and it covers the whole thing basically. I quite like it and the carabiner was a nice touch and felt premium as it was made of metal as well. Nicely packaged too.
3,the case is nice looking and does a good job protecting the airpods.  I was very happy and would have given a 5 except the small rubber ring that you put the hook through ripped and now I need something new in order to hook up to me keychain.Disappointing.
4,This case is cute.  Comes in a lot of colours and seems durable.  I dislike that every dust particle in the atmosphere sticks to the case and it can be tricky to slide the case up all the way to the edge... but once it’s on it’s on.  I’d probably buy this again to be honest matching the case to my phone is very appealing to me.
5,Great case. Been using for the better part of a year and bought a second one for my girlfriend. I really like the soft glow. Its not bright enough to be a bother but really helps find them in the dark and lasts a long time after being removed from the light. I’ve never attached them to anything with the carabiner and don’t know that I’d trust it but otherwise great
5,I have been using this case for the last two week and I am happy with this purchase. Initially it took a bit of adjusting and sliding the top portion into place in order to completely cover the lid of the AirPods case. After a few minutes the two portions met seamlessly and have stayed in place ever since. The clip is great for attaching to keys bags etc. I would definitely go with this model versus the one without the clip. The silicone material is about what you'd expect from silicon in that it gets a little dusty but easy to clean off. All in all for the price this is a great little case to protect your AirPods case.Note: The item is pictured with a rose gold carabiner clip and like others mentioned mine came with a chrome one. Personally I feel the chrome fits the colour of the dark grey case better so I wasn't bothered by this.
1,This item BARELY resembles the item advertised in the photo. What I received is the flimsiest piece of silicone garbage that honestly a box of tooth floss would better than this because that is sturdy and oh yeah actually closes shut. This item does not close because whoever designed it made the lid the exact same width as the body so you can't close it unless you jam the lid inside the box due to the flexible silicone. Oh and there is nothing to nicely keep your airpods suspended in the box. All you have is a shell so they're just going to be loosey-goosey in there not to mention probably fall out because the lid's flopping around. All in all this is a TERRIBLE product and I do NOT recommend!
5,The case fits nicely. Being somewhat translucent the LED on the front of the AirPods 2 case can shine through. The included keyring and carabiner is a bonus as it allows me to hang it from a backpack or on my jeans. I guess my only con would be that the silicone attacts dust easily but it's not a deal breaker. Overall great case.
1,The case catches too much dust while kept in your bag and ends up looking and feeling dirty all the time.
1,Worst Product ever  bioke day 3 of using it and my AirPods hit the ground and I lost 1 . Would not recommend buy at your own risk
3,I bought 2 of these. One for my girlfriend and one for me. My girlfriend's pair was perfect but mine was all messed up. It was probably a manufacturer's defect but my case was very messed up. The case was not cut properly. Even when I put it perfectly on my airpods it is still slanted
3,Está linda y cumple su función pero no traía el llavero que viene en la foto y está un poco chueca cubre más los AirPods de un lado que del otro.
2,The case is alright and durable but I have a huge issue with these - it makes the lid of the Airpods' charging case really prone to just flipping open spontaneously (I have it attached to my keychain). I've had multiple times where an Airpod has fallen out as a result and I almost lost it. I've come to a point where I just don't trust these anymore and I've had to buy one with a better design that includes a clip.
5,This little case is cute!  I bought three different colours for my kids so that we could tell the cases apart. No fighting over whose is whose!  The case fits perfectly over the Air Pods case and the clip is helpful to clip onto any bag. Love this little product.  Price is reasonable especially when you need to buy multiples.
3,I really like the quality of this case. It’s thin and fits well it’s exactly like what’s shown in the picture (I got the grey). The downfall is the hinge bulges out so when you open and close the case it actually can’t open all the way as the hinge of the case gets in the way. I wish the hinge wasn’t so “bulging” so that the case can open fully.
4,This is the second elago case I’ve purchased for my airpods. I like how the silicone case is a perfect fit for the charging case and the material feels soft. However the carabiner that attaches to the case broke within a month of using it. Might be better off buying the case without the hook instead.
5,Very happy with this product it fits my airpods 2 perfectly with all ports and buttons accessible. The case doesn’t seem to want to slip off either. The clip is very useful and secure. I didn’t think it would but this case actually glows in the dark - and quite well too! Nice blue colour when glowing!
4,The colour is very cute and it protects your airpods  how every the packing came looking like it was opened and the case it self seem to be a little small as I had trouble making it fit properly.. but other than that it’s really durable and it comes with a keychain
4,Doesnt look like the picture in amazon ad but gets the job done. Fits perfectly not bulky
5,Item is exactly as described.  We bought two.  One in pink and one in red.  both fit our AirPods case perfectly with very little fiddling to get things lined up.  Very pleased.  Now it is very easy to tell them apart!
5,Well made compared to other cases I have purchased on Amazon and returned. The material is strong the case isn't as thick but well protective. The clip is strong and the area where the clip is attached is strong. Invest!
5,Been using it since I got it. Easy install and the fit was perfect. It's very pretty in the sunlight. Haven't tested it really glows in the dark though.
4,The case slips on nicely the top part is a BIT short but not enough to really notice unless you're looking closely. The clip is convenient.
5,Bought it for my mom and it has survived everything from being dropped a hundred times to being run over by an SUV!
2,It doesn’t glow. And it’s not as nice as it looks in the pictures. Well made. Don’t know if it’s durable yet I’ve not used it for long. It’s ok.
4,Le quedó sin problemas lo único que no me agrado es que no la cubre completamente los audifonos
5,Awesome airbuds better than paying $200-  work amazing they don’t block out all noise but work good enough in gym.
3,Works pretty well looks mostly as shown. The carabiner is not copper/rose gold as the picture shows. It’s chrome.
5,the cover itself is excellent the keychain link probably could have been designed better. its bulky and impacts on being able to open the lid properly but is cute and I use it all the time.
2,I ordered the purple one and it gets dirty too easily and fits very snug. I also have one in the dark grey but its a much softer silicon and doesn't catch lint.  Also you can't return which sucks
5,Product was exactly as advertised and arrived sooner than originally expected. It fits the AirPod case perfectly. I bough it a a gift but would buy one for me as well.
1,The case did not fit my AirPods it was too small. The quality wasn’t the best. You ge what you pay for.  Sent it back for refund and it was refunded very quickly back to me. Great service just not great quality product.
2,Purchased this for a Christmas gift however I concerned about the "sturdiness" of this item.  It seems a little flimsy
5,My daughter ordered this one and she said it is a great product.  She says it was worth the money
5,GReat for my 12 year old grandson. Protects ear pods while charging them. Also he hangs them on his belt loop to prevent loss.
5,100% compatible with earpods. ( Apple compatible 100%)
4,Glad I bought this already dropped it a few times and feel much safer having it in a case plus the clip helps me remember to bring them to the gym
5,Muy buena calidad quedó perfecta
2,This product was advertised to be glow in the dark. However mine came and it goes not glow at all or whatsoever. Total disappointment since I bought this product for its glow in the dark feature
3,It pulls the case open... maybe it will stretch a bit over time
3,I like this product i think its good and protects my airpods but i found it to be a slight bulky and it also collected a lot of dust. My airpods already collect an amount of dust but with the case it collected more. The top I found to be a slight to small and i had to pull it over the the top of my airpod case more. All in all the case works and it protects my airpods.
5,Still using every day
5,I can hang it inside my purse so the case is always with me and easy to get to when I want to put them away. Getting this for presents for anyone who has EarPods
5,I didn’t realize the case also  glowed in the dark  Which was really great if them adding that feature. Nice  sturdy case with keychain worth every penny.
5,Great quality. Love it!
5,No dislikes product exactly as advertised
5,Good product.  Helps keep something small from getting lost
5,Packaging is clean and nice product fit the AirPod very well and feels very smooth.
4,The keychain part of this case broke fairly quickly but the silicone case is durable and good quality.
5,Perfect.  Love the colour and fits perfectly!  Not too expensive and a great brand love it.  I love the clip it come in handy
3,A durable silicone case. It lasted a year for me or so. The fold between the top and body of the case ripped after a year.
5,Fits perfectly and looks great!
5,This product is sooo worth it. It’s very sturdy and cute. I love the colour that it has and it’s a good thing that you can attach it to you keys. Recommend 100% if you need a good protecting case!
5,Vraiment bien
5,They are a great alternative to the Apple 🍎 brand at a better price point.
5,Era lo que necesitaba practica y a buen precio
5,it works good
5,Very good I like it
5,Glows in the dark so I can find my case when I fall asleep with my airpods in
4,Nice fit. Just wish the lid portion didn’t move around so much.
1,When I initially got this it was fine but just a couple of weeks in it started loosening up and now the lid flops around and is effectively useless.
5,Exactly as shown
1,FOR MY EARBUDS... DID NOT FIT... PLEASE NOTE THERE IS NO RETURN ON THIS ITEM... SO IT WENT INTO THE GARBAGE.. VERY SMALL
5,Superbe objet en bon état  shipping rapide! Merci
5,Nicely done and good finish for the price
4,Exactly the same as description and picture. The carabiner became loose and broke after 2 weeks tho.
5,Great quality very well made exactly as advertised  love the little clip on the end - would definitely recommend!
4,El color no es como lo muestran pero igual está muy bonito protege súper bien los airpods
5,Other than collecting dust which is normal for silicone cases. The case is pretty and it has a good fit. Highly recommended!
5,Exactly as I had expected. Thanks!
5,fit perfectly the hinge works great despite some of the reviews...does exactly what it's supposed to do and the loop/eyelet appears to be solid.
5,Really good product. I bought two from this seller.
2,The real product doesn't look as nice as the marketing images!
5,Pretty solid product I basically use it everyday. Although the price is a little higher than other brand but the quality worth the dollar
4,L'étui en tant que tel est très bien mais le petit porte clé à brisé rapidement
5,Fast shipping.
3,Ok product
5,Great product great value
5,Perfect fit and the quality is great
4,I Brought this for my daughter's airpods.  It fit ok.
5,The casing is smooth and easy to handle. With the carabiner I hang them onto my keys/bag so it'll never get lost - overall great product!

5,Great product. No problems with it
5,Parfait
3,The overall package was worst. But there was no damage to the product.  Also it didn’t fit completely and there was a tiny gap which is bothersome.
5,Non sono solita scrivere le recensioni ma questo prodotto davvero merita.Parto col dire che ero molto indecisa su quale custodia acquistare tra le tante Marche e modelli acquistabili qui su Amazon. Alla fine ho scelto questa custodia di elago in grigio scuro con moschettone è perfetta e ha superato tutte le mie aspettative.Lo stile è impeccabile molto semplice e deciso.Il colore è come in foto e lo spessore credo sia perfetto: non è ne troppo doppio da ingigantire le airpods ne troppo sottile rischiando con un movimento brusco di strapparlo.Consiglio questa custodia con moschettone perché è super comoda e personalmente essendo indecisa se prenderla con moschettone o senza nel caso non avessi bisogno del moschettone non è ingombrante quel cosino sul lato della custodia.Inoltre leggendo le varie recensioni avevo il timore che la custodia non calzasse perfettamente. Tuttavia inizialmente così mi era sembrato una volta messa ma alla fine dopo aver studiato un paio di minuti la situazione ho capito che bisogna solo metterla bene spingendola un po’ per sistemarla perché il materiale all’interno fa in modo che la custodia non scivoli via o che si sposti.Un’altra cosa che avevo letto nelle recensioni è che molti utenti hanno sottolineato che il tipo di materiale essendo in silicone catturasse molta polvere e pelucchi soprattutto se si pone nella tasca. Infatti mi aspettavo proprio che fosse di un silicone un po’ appiccicoso. Ora avendo quindi acquistato questa custodia questo problema non mi si sta presentando anzi il materiale è molto liscio e morbido e per farvi capire al tatto sembra come il materiale delle cover della apple originali per iPhone.Il moschettone mi sembra resistente al momento spero d’altronde che non si rompa..Ci sono però due cose che ho notato:1. Il “cinturino” posteriore che unisce le due parti della custodia mi sembra troppo sottile ( credo che dalla foto si noti) quindi ho paura si possa rompere;2. Rispetto alle foto dove viene presentato il prodotto e alle foto delle recensioni degli altri utenti ho notato che nella custodia che mi è arrivata manca nella parte posteriore il “dettaglio” del pulsante delle airpods per attivare la ricerca e l’abbinamento Bluetooth con altri dispositivi (guarda foto per capire meglio) avrebbe dovuto essere in basso. Ho comunque dato 5 stelle anche se manca questo dettaglio non ho problemi a premere il pulsante delle airpods e lo sto anche  preferendo così com’è.Detto tutto questo lo consiglio vivamente. Non ha nemmeno un costo così elevato e per meno di €10 non mi aspettavo un prodotto così fantastico onestamente. Ne comprerò sicuramente di altri colori e modelli di elago
4,
4,Good quality the clip feels like it’s going to brake in no time though
1,Very disappointed that I didn't receive a product that they advertised.  No keychain attached or even the hole to put a keychain.  At first I thought it was a mistake so I returned it and then ordered it again and received the same product as the first time.  So I had to return it again.  A lot of my time
4,No me di cuenta cuando la compre pero me hubiera gustado que tuviera protector para la parte de la carga como tienen otras fundas de la misma marca
2,I re-bought this product after the old one stretched out too much for my airpods (it’s inevitable since the case is silicon). The quality has significantly decreased compared to the older one (with the dark grey clip). The materials are noticeably cheaper and the new clip feels rough to the touch. The clip also broke less than a week after purchase. You would expect brands to innovate and make better cases as time goes on but it seems elago chooses to go the other way deteriorating the quality of their products after building a clientele and therefore abusing client loyalty. Thoroughly disappointed.
1,I just got these in the mail today and their not quite what I was expecting.. it’s defintely not 100% like the picture.This hang case doesn’t fully cover the AirPods case where it opens and closes. I tried to pull the material and readjusting the case in the cover but haven’t had any luck. Im afraid I’m going to break the cap off.The hang case material isn’t smooth in this one area on the top where it’s visible. I’m not sure if this is elago standard but I’m most likely returning this back
1,This is not what I ordered. I specifically ordered this item because it had a clip on it.  The item came and there is no way to put a clip on it
2,The clip broke straight off which is disappointing because I bought it specifically to hook onto my bag but the silicone cover is good and colour is nice.
5,I bought this case as soon as I purchased my AirPods 2nd Gen. Over a year later the case is still in good condition and intact and I take my AirPods with me EVERYWHERE; they will easily end up at the bottom of my bag in pockets attached to my car keys etc… and the case has endured all of that. Couldn’t recommend it more!
5,Tal cual esperaba muy bonito
1,i went to elago because of its name but this one is a disappointment. hardly protects the case. not easy to remove. at this price this was a bad decision. please dont buy
2,The little hook that comes with it broke in day two. Very poor quality.
5,I absolutely love this case! It's super cute and durable. It fits nice and snug around my AirPods case so that's great! The quality is really good as well! I would definitely recommend It to others :)
5,Me llego en perfectas condiciones tal cual se ve en la imagen.
5,I absolutely love this accessory. It saves me from having to look everywhere in my bag for my EarPods while receiving a call it gives me a good grip on them when I’m holding them. And it has travelled half the world with me for the past 6 months!
3,Silicone cover is good but the key chain is inferior quality. Overall rating :Average
4,Good materialSnug fitLittle expensive for silicon cover but doesn't matter once you use it
5,Love it fits snugly to my airpods case
5,Good product have no issues. Looks sleek on the AirPods and it protects from scratches and dirt on the outside.
5,The date of delivery is early that i expected. It came before christmas which is very good because it says that delivery would be 3/1/2022.
3,Product fits but I bought the red and it’s quite a bright almost orange colour rather than the deeper red shown here.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Does not look at all like what I ordered .... specifically ordered this for the key chain so it was a waste of money and useless to me.
5,So cute!
3,too expensive for what it does...glow's not that bright.
1,Worthless
1,Did not get what I ordered. The only thing I received was the silicone case and no keychain tag. And the case overall is flimsy.
3,A bit disappointed that I received the glow in the dark blue case instead of the regular white case that I ordered. Otherwise the case fits nicely.
5,Producto impecable textura de alta calidad acabados perfectos color gris lavanda justo como lo quería
1,Vraiment déçu même pas la même chose
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Products are good. But fitting became loose in just 5 months 👎
5,Great quality love it!
1,Not as advertised.. didn’t come with the keychain and it’s cut very odd and doesn’t line up.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Received the product today and it is just as same as it is shown in the display very aesthetically pleasing shade and the quality is also great!!!
5,Nice tight fit to the case.
1,Not as durable as it looks.  They hook dropped off after 3 days
5,It fits the Airpod case! The colour is exactly as picture
5,Love it!
5,When I first got it I was not sure the case would fit but it dose and it’s so cute and goes with all my outfits and the clip is very useful. Would definitely get something like this again
5,Exactly how it appears
5,可愛く気に入ってます
4,色に惹かれて購入しました。しかし、カラビナ部分が初日で壊れてしまったためそこの耐久性は低いと思います。カバー部分は無事でした。他のカラビナで代用して使っています。
5,Ho acquistato questa custodia per AirPods in quanto cercavo un confezione che proteggesse il design bellissimo delle cuffiette marcate Apple dal rischio di graffio.Ho scelto questo modello in quanto vi erano ottime recensioni e volevo che la custodia si adattasse perfettamente al portacuffie.Ho ordinato la versione total-white con il moschettone color rame e mi è arrivato molto in fretta. Il primo inserimento mi ha dato l’impressione che il case avesse un effetto ventosa con la custodia e rispondesse molto bene con l’apertura e chiusura.Effettivamente dopo molti mesi è ancora così ma purtroppo la gomma attira non poca polvere e sporcizia che saltuariamente va a posizionarsi nella parte interna del rivestimento superiore (facendo a volte staccare la custodia dal case) e nella apertura posteriore dove si trova la cerniera in acciaio del case Apple.In ogni caso credo sia sufficiente tenerla in un posto protetto (come si farebbe con il solo case Apple) e pulirlo quando la polvere si insinua così da evitare questo difetto.Il moschettone invece mi ha sorpresa positivamente. Lo utilizzo ormai SEMPRE con il moschettone agganciandolo ad un passante dei pantaloni quando sono in giro così da avere il case sempre a portata di mano se mai dovessi togliere le cuffie. E’ una sicurezza in più e l’anello di rame è molto più solito di quanto sembra!Assolutamente consigliato!
4,Il prodotto è ottimo la cover mi sembra di un materiale resistente e spesso per proteggere le AirPods. Il pacco è arrivato molto velocemente il prodotto era imballato in una piccola scatola in condizioni ottime.Inizialmente ho avuto difficoltà a montare la cover in quanto credo a causa di un piccolo problema di fattura non riusciva a rivestire completamente la parte superiore della custodia delle cuffie. Dopo un pochino sono riuscita a far scivolare correttamente la cover e adesso aderisce bene. L'unica cosa che voglio dire è di fare bene attenzione non so se è un problema solo mio a chiudere correttamente le AirPods perché potrebbero rimanere aperte a causa della cover. Nonostante tutto comunque sono molto contenta di questo acquisto lo consiglio!
4,Il rapporto qualitá presso di questo case per Apple AirPods é decisamente buono alla fine dei conti con poco piú di 8 euro si possono proteggere e tenere al sicuro le proprie cuffiette che avendo un valore molto elevato é buona prassi proteggere e tenere al sicuro. Questo case LO FA le protegge e sembra assorbire bene anche eventuali urti o cadute (non piú di tanto peró eh). Si tratta d'altronde di un leggero strato di silicone che avvolge il case. La parte posteriore é esteticamente curata e fatta bene cosa che non riesco a dire tanto per la parte anteriore.. Come si puó vedere dalla foto infatti é difficile ricoprire bene fino ai bordi il cappuccio superiore se non stando li a cercare di mettere con estrema cura e minuzia (dovendo anche appunto tirare questo silicone per stenderlo cosa che si vorrebbe anche evitare di fare per evitare di strattonare troppo il cappuccio del case originale).Nonostante questo semplice e tutto sommato trascurabile difetto estetico mi sento di consigliare questo prodotto soprattutto per chi come me tiene attaccato tutto il giorno le AirPods ai propri pantaloni grazie al moschettone pronte ad essere estratte nel momento del bisogno!
4,Ho acquistato questa custodia in silicone di Elago per le mie AirPods di prima generazione. Il prodotto si presenta ben realizzato il colore (rosso) è molto bello e accoglie perfettamente il case delle cuffie. Avevo già una custodia ma questa di Elago a differenza della precedente è un “pezzo unico” nel senso che la parte superiore ed inferiore del copri-case sono unite e questo nonostante sia meno bello da un punto di vista estetico impedisce di perdere il pezzo superiore come mi è successo con prodotti di altri marchi. Comodo il moschettone fornito in confezione.Spedizione di Amazon perfetta e consegna come da tempi previsti.
5,Ottimo prodotto e ottimo prezzo. Calza benissimo la custodia per AirPods 2 ed è facile da mettere e estrarre. Permette di premere bene il pulsante posteriore e il led anteriore è comunque visibile attraverso il silicone nero della cover. Io personalmente ho tolto l’anellino di metallo che unisce la cover al moschettone e ho unito i due direttamente come in foto. Lo trovo un oggetto molto bello e utile in quanto oltre a proteggere le AirPods il moschettone permette l’aggancio di esse al passante dei pantaloni così da non occupare spazio nelle tasche. Consigliatissime ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
4,I had difficulty putting the case on at first because it's a very tight fit and it was difficult to make the top part and the bottom part flush with no gaps. Once I could get it on it was a perfect case. It is a really nice colour just what I was looking for. The carabiner is rose gold/bronze I would have preferred silver but it's not the end of the world. The case attracts more dust than other cases I've had in the past but this is only a minor flaw. Overall a very good case!
1,Its a cheap 50 rs cover
5,まず色が気に入りました。そして耐久性もよく安心して使えます。また別の色を購入しようと思ってます。
4,Looks and quality seems to be pretty decent and good. Price is a bit on the higher side.
4,Good product..same color as shown..jus the side clip is missing..which is not mentioned in description..so 1 star less..else a must buy product
4,Il prodotto è buono copre bene ogni parte della custodia anche in prossimità del coperchio. Il gancio mi sembra fissato saldamente alla custodia. Il materiale è buono ma attira polvere e pelucchi che restano attaccati.
4,Buon articolo ben realizzato ottimo prezzo
3,This case is really expensive when it comes to the quality of the product. This shouldn’t cost more than 150. I doubt it will last long more than 3-4 months.
4,Al momento dell’arrivo il prodotto non ha presentato nessun difetto o imperfezione. Molto comodo il moschettone!Unica pecca è che una volta rimossa la cover per una prima volta la parte superiore tende a levarsi con più facilità (anche se basta letteralmente un secondo per rimetterla a posto) perdendo quel senso abrasivo che da appena si applica la cover (probabilmente sarà solamente a causa dell’usura).Si illumina al buio esattamente dell’azzurro/blu rappresentato (non ci sono problemi!).
5,It fits perfectly and gives a great look protecting your AirPods too but I'd give it a 3 star rating in terms of value for money as its quite alot to spend on a cover. I got it for ₹799 lavender colour.
4,Le produit est conforme à ce que j’ai commandé après à voir dans le temps pour solidité et élasticité.
5,I really like the look and feeling of the case. Because of the rubber it can quickly get a bit dirty but it's not a big deal.
5,I purchased this mainly due to it having a hook on it as I was frightened of losing the actual headphones without them being in a case. Therefore by purchasing this it meant I could attach them to my keys which has worked brilliantly. It is also good having the rubber case which was easy to install as it stops the actual case of the headphones getting scratched. There are cheaper cases on the market however like I say I needed the hook on this so I don’t loose them.Arrived when it was meant to and all in all a great product. I would perhaps suggest another colour other than white because this gets very dirty; although you can just wipe the dirt off.
5,Me encanta es muy suave y agradable al tacto.
5,This exceptional case is easily fitted the air pod case simply slips in without much resistance the snug fit allows me to take the case to gym without my air pods falling out. The smooth silicon also means that when the case is in my pocket it does not scratch my phone in addition the case adds some grip to the case; consequently my air pod case no longer falls out of my product for example when i am at the gym. Finally the handy clip is extremely useful as this means that i can clip it onto my bag without having the need to worry that it may go missing!
3,
4,Die Silikonhülle an sich ist super sie schützt das Case hervorragend. Durch das Material bedingt hängen teilweise Krümel und Fusel daran aber das ist erträglich.Der Karabiner allerdings gefällt mir gar nicht dieser ist rostfarbend lackiert o.ä. und diese Schicht ist überhaupt nicht haltbar. Schon nach kürzester Zeit sieht der Karabiner unschön zerkratzt aus. Also entweder anständig beschichten oder ganz lassen!Die Stabilität des Karabiners wiederum ist gut.
4,Custodia bellissima da vedere L'unica pecca è che è un po' difficile da mettere sia nella parte inferiore che nella parte superiore
5,Molto bello al tatto  semplice e facile da istallare . Con un buon spessore  giustamente fa un po’ da calamita per la polvere . Non trovo utile il gancetto laterale  se lo si mette in tasca si rischia di strapparlo
4,El producto es lo esperado. Aún sin ser de Apple encaja y protege correctamente os airpods. Además es muy útil el enganche.
4,Ottima cover per le AirPods premetto di averne provate tante ma nessuna mi aveva dato una sensazione di sicurezza come questa. Molto utile anche il moschettone che permette di attaccare le AirPods alla vita non il massimo della solidità ce da dire però utilizzabile una critica che posso avanzare e che a l’inizio e un po’ viscida ma dopo una settimana di utilizzo questa sensazione scompare.
4,Non gradisco molto come veste la cover da dietro
3,The case is really nice pity mistakenly I bought the case for the AirPods instead of AirPod pro. I need to return them but I will pay £3.99. Too much
4,Très bon produit malgré un jeu minime au niveau de l’ouverture.
4,Muy práctico para proteger y transportar.
5,Davvero comoda e robusta non il solito silicone.L’apertura del coperchio è perfetta come se non ci fosse la cover e le cuffie si aprono benissimoIl lembo per il moschettone sembra robustoIl color Salmone È davvero figo.Al tatto è confortevole e anti scivolo ma non come il solito silicone pacco che si incolla a tutta la sporcizia di un altro livello!Ha superato le aspettative perché mi aspettavo qualcosa di più scadenteDa premiare anche il packaging della marca Elago.Avete un cliente in più
4,Comprato per la mia ragazza aderisce perfettamente alla custodia airpods evitando fuoriuscite o imperfezioni. Il materiale in silicone ha uno spessore sufficiente a proteggere le pods da cadute accidentali. Ottimo compromesso qualità prezzo.
5,Ich habe mir die Hülle direkt gekauft als ich einen Tag meine AirPods hatte da ich so Angst hatte das sie kaputt gehen. Die Hülle ist sehr wabbelig also nicht hart aber das wurde in der Beschreibung des Artikels ja auch schon genannt. Die Hülle hält super und verrutscht nicht. Das auf und zu machen der AirPods funktioniert auch super. Das einzige was mich ein bisschen stört ist dass sich in der Hüllen beim  rauf machen sehr viele Fussel reinsetzen die schwierig sind zu entfernen. Ist aber nur innen also sieht man sie nicht.
4,Item is an asset for extra protection for apple Air pods and come in in a sele tin of colours
4,Really good little product.Doesn’t glow in the dark. Even if you shine a torch at it and then put it in pitch black there’s the tiniest glow. Also the material tends to pick up bits quite easily (like pocket lint) but it works and keeps your AirPods safe and I always know where they are now!
5,Calza alla perfezione e non ostacola l’apertura.Piacevole al tatto.5 stelle nessuno difetto rilevato.
4,Ottimo prodotto dalla scatola potrebbe sembrare la classica cinesata invece la custodia in silicone è di ottima qualità perfettamente aderente alle mie AirPods ods ed è dotata anche di un utile moschettone.Ottimo anche l’effetto di luminescenza al buio. Consiglio questo case a tutti.
4,It's a nice case but after a couple of months of using it started to become loose. I like the little metal hook which makes it easier to attach to things and to find easily in your bag.
5,Una funda que encaja perfectamente con la caja de los auriculares de silicona mate y suave. Creo que los protegerá de golpes roces e incluso de caídas si no son muy grandes. También hace que al cogerlos se sientan más seguros en la mano pues evita que resbalen. Desde luego yo me siento más seguro llevando los auriculares con la funda. La mia es roja bastante bonita. También me parece útil el enganche para poder sujetar la cajita a algún sitio. Eso sí hay otras fundas más baratas o que incluyen complementos esta no. No sé si variará la calidad
4,L'ho preso come regalo.Devo ammettere che è carino e comodo.Nel suo piccolo fa il suo dovere e copre interamente la custodia degli auricolari.Forse l'unica cosa sulla quale non farei affidamento è il gancio. Il problema non è il gancio ma la gomma che in quel punto è molto delicata e quindi ce il rischio che in qualche movimento sbagliato si rischia di perdere gli auricolare.Consiglio di tenere sempre in tasca senza gancio.
5,Ho acquistato questa custodia per proteggere il case delle AirPods da eventuali graffi (in tasca con le chiavi o monete) e cadute accidentali.Devo dire che sono rimasto pienamente soddisfatto aderisce perfettamente al case e la superficie gommata gli garantisce un ottimo grip ma come è naturale “attira” a se un po’ di polvere. Inoltre grazie al foro del quale è dotata da la possibilità di agganciarla ovunque (zaini fibbie ecc) mediante un piccolo gancetto anch’esso compreso.Unico piccolo e praticamente insignificante DIFETTO il fatto che proprio questo gangetto sia estremamente fragile e dopo solo 3-4 utilizzi si sia rotto. Ho comunque dato 5 stelle perché ho ritenuto opportuno valutare la custodia in se piuttosto che un accessorio che tra le altre cose è facilmente sostituibile
5,Prima di iniziare ad utilizzare le nuove AirPods2 ho aspettato che mi arrivasse questa cover in silicone. Sono un maniaco della perfezione e ne avevo assolutamente bisogno. Credo che non avrei potuto acquistare un prodotto migliore. La custodia in silicone infatti protegge a tutti gli effetti da graffi e urti. Lo spessore è giusto e non ingombrante ed è tutto molto resistente. Avvolgono il contenitore wireless alla perfezione e si adattano bene su tutta la superficie. Al tatto è morbido e piacevole. Inoltre trovo molto comodo il moschettone incluso è leggero e non da fastidio e può essere usato a parer mio per prendere e riporre velocemente le airpods dal loro case. Approvato!
4,I’ve had this since November 2018. It’s lasted 6 months of daily use on London Underground and at work. Now the lid does not stay on. The grip and quality is great and fully protects the AirPods case. Carabiner I find the most helpful feature. Definitely recommend
4,Comprata più per precauzione che per reale necessità. Sono abbastanza maniacale nel tenere gli oggetti ma considerando la custodia di ricarica degli Airpods che si graffia solo a guardarla una custodia in gomma è necessaria. Fantastica la si può attaccare col pratico moschettone alle chiavi e tenere tutto insieme senza la paura dei graffi.Ovviamente essendo silicone e lasciando spesso il tutto in tasca attira polvere o residui ma una pulizia rapida e veloce ogni tanto permette di lasciare il prodotto pulito e privo di graffi
2,Material is cheap and totally not worth 😢
4,Molto comoda da usare moschettone carino e materiale buono l’unica pecca è che è abbastanza facile da sporcare
4,In großem und ganzen erfüllt die Silikonhülle ihren Zweck. Anfangs war es schwierig sie anzubringen und es kommt vor dass sie nicht richtig sitzt und immer ein kleiner Spalt zwischen den oberen und unteren Teil gibt
5,Elago non conoscevo questo marchio e ne sono rimasto felicemente sorpreso. La custodia si presenta molto bene fatta per bene e da una bella sensazione di qualità al tatto. È disponibile di vari colori e il gancio è molto pratico per poterle portare sempre con se. Spedizione Amazon rapida e precisa
5,Gestern Abend bestellt heute Nachmittag angekommen. Super schnelle Lieferung!Hatte Angst dass das Material Staub fängt und es nach Plastik riecht aber das ist nicht der Fall. Auch die Farbe ist genau wie auf dem Bild dargestellt. Am Anfang muss man bisschen rupzupfen bis es endlich passend sitzt. Aber einmal drauf bleibt es auch (hoffentlich) so. Ich wünschte nur es hätte eine Kappe für den Ladekabel-Anschluss aber auch so wird es passen. Ich fühl mich jetzt viel sicherer und noch perfekt dazu kann man den Karabinerhaken ab und dranmachen. Da fühl ich mich noch sicherer. Toll!
4,Das Material von der Silikonhülle ist sehr ansprechend. Leider schließt die Hülle nicht richtig mit dem Case von Apple ab und der sehr ansprechende Karabiner ist bereits nach der ersten Benutzung defekt gegangen. Die Feder schließt leider nicht mehr.Nachtrag: Durch einen tollen Service wurde  das Produkt ersetzt. Es ist alles prima!
5,This little airpod case is a must have if you own some fancy airpods!I bought this to protect the case but what I have managed to achieve with this thanks to the keyring attachment is take them everywhere with me on my keys so they are there whenever i need them.The case has been massively sturdy and durable amongst rain etc.
5,This well made and very good value for money. Would buy again.
5,SPEDIZIONE: Spedita il giorno stesso dell'ordine e arrivato con un giorno di anticipo Amazon non si smentisce mai.PRODOTTO: Arrivato ben imballato la cover di silicone è davvero ben fatta resistente il silicone è di ottima qualità il nero è effettivamente nero (cosa non scontata). Le AirPods calzano dentro benissimo non rimangono fessure e la sensazione una volta tenute in mano è di sicurezza estrema qui si aggiunge il moschettone che torna molto utile se si va in giro con uno zaino e da un ulteriore sicurezza.Concludo dicendo che un prodotto di questa qualità acquisisce ulteriore valore osservando come il logo Elago sia inciso molto bene senza sbavature e mantiene il design minimale della custodia.Consigliatissimo!
3,I think I ordered the wrong size. Very hard tofit on to my AirPod case. Given up.  Thought only one size.
4,Pratica e semplice applicazione. Protegge per bene gli AirPods. Prezzo onestissimo.
4,Bought this for my father whi loved it would of gave 5 stars if it wasn’t for the small ring attachment that attaches onto the clip time will tell if that lasts. The case looks sturdy with a great look fits perfect on AirPod case.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The finish and quality is amazing the product seems sturdy and it fits so amazingly on my AirPods case. The key-chain is also very classy and of good quality. Altogether the cover gives a luxurious look.
5,Sembra un piccolo pulcino! La custodia arriva protetta in una scatolina il materiale é davvero piacevole al tatto e le airpods risultano ben protette da eventuali cadute. Moschettone bello solido
4,Perfetto per AirPod 1^ Gen. Resistente e bella.
3,Dal punto di vista della protezione questa cover è corretta e corrisponde alla descrizione. Si installa facilmente e rapidamente non ostacola la funzionalità della custodia di ricarica degli AirPods.Il "problema" consiste nel fatto che la luminescenza (slow in the dark) è fondamentalmente inesistente. Era una delle caratteristiche che ricercavo e la sua assenza ha provocato un certo disappunto. Anche dopo una giornata quasi intera di esposizione alla luce poi al buio non si avverte la luminescenza descritta. Peccato: in queste condizioni risulta essere solamente una cover in silicone biancastro... (se l'avessi saputo avrei scelto un'altro prodotto che offrisse questa caratteristica oppure un colore differente)
3,broke after 6 months other than that its great it does pick up dust tho
4,Die Hülle gefällt mir sehr gut. Sie schützt die Airpods optimal. Oft trage ich die Airpods jetzt an meinem Schlüssel damit ich sie nicht ständig suchen muss. Leider ist nach 3 Monaten die Hülle für den Deckel ausgeleiert und hält nicht mehr an dem Originalcase. Trotzdem würde ich sie immer wieder kaufen.
4,The silicone case fits well. Color-wise the pink one is a very light pink quite cute. It is a bit thin and probably will get broken very soon but considering the price I am quite happy for now.
5,Fabulosa es todo un puntazo que brille en la oscuridad ahora cuando busco en mi bolso lo encuentro enseguida además yo siempre olvidaba donde había puesto mis AirPods y ahora los llevo atados a mi móvil así que me resulta muy práctica y cómoda esta funda. Además ajusta perfectamente y no se sale de la caja.
5,ma che bella che è! ho fatto un regalo e appena l ho vista me ne sono innamorato ne comprerò almeno 3 per cambiare i colori che dire ragazzi su amazon si trova tutto a ottimo prezzo e qualità per non parlare del fatto che ti arrivano a casa il giorno dopo!
4,Buon prodotto facile da mettere e anche molto elegante. Il prodotto assorbe molta polvere e bisogna pulirlo spesso.
3,The lid part doesn’t really attach to the airpods and pops off all the time its not a tight fit on the top but every where else is good also pocket lint sticks too it but can be easily cleaned
4,Für den Preis Top!
4,Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt und im Gegensatz zu anderen Produkten passt die Hülle.
4,Die Case ist ordentlich verarbeitet und erfüllt ihren Zweck allerdings sieht die weiße Version nach kurzer Zeit schon sehr schmutzig aus
5,Product is as shown in the picture. Its absolutely value for money. Colour is as shown in the image.Excellent product.
5,This product fits perfectly on airpods case with a nice feel to it so should protect the case from scratch and scrape. Would recommend
4,Genau was ich mir vorgestellt habe nur was das ganze noch besser machen würde: ein eingebauter Stöpsel für den Staubschutz der Ladeding
4,Molto carino calza perfettamente. Esteticamente perfetto e anche al tatto la qualità è ottima.Il gancio è comodissimo per poterlo tenere a portata di mano
4,Comodo perfetto per le airpods
4,Die Hülle passt perfekt in die Silikonhülle. Sieht gut aus und so soll es sein. Der eine Stern Abzug ist das man die Pods nicht so laden kann man muss sie aus dem Silikon nehmen und dann erst geht es. Liegt an der Stärke des Silikon das Kabel kann nicht greifen. Aber sonst Kaufempfehlung !!!
5,This is perfect for my AirPods the case fits perfectly and doesn’t slip off. It’s tight enough that I don’t have to worry about exposing the shell underneath so no scratches!
4,Ho comprato la custodia rosa bimba con moschettone insieme.Molto pratica anche se per metterla bene con i bordi che risultino allineati ci ho messo tre tentativi.Il colore rispecchia le foto del prodotto ed è molto comoda da agganciare a qualsiasi cosa.Esteticamente carinaForma topMi sono trovata bene
4,super utile
5,Must Have!Bin begeistert von dem kleinen Ding 😊Erfüllt einwandfrei 2 wichtige Punkte: Das Case ist geschützt und ist nicht mehr so „schlüpfrig“...die Hülle fühlt sich super an!!2. Es wird mir nie mehr passieren (ein Klassiker bei mir) dass ich meine Headphones vergesse da ich sie jetzt am Schlüsselbund trage!Einziger Verbesserungsvorschlag....Da das Case von vornherein sehr leicht aufgeht wäre es super wenn man die Hülle verschließen könnte...mit einer kleinen Klettverschluss-Lasche o.ä.!!Einzig bleibt natürlich abzuwarten wie widerstandsfähig sich die Hülle im Alltag zeigt...sprich ob/wann der Schlüsselring reißt...und die 180- AirPods futsch sind sollte man es nicht merken...
5,Feels nice and fits snugly highly recommended for Airpods case.
5,Era un regalo y acerté. La calidad de la silicona es buena tacto suave y se ajusta fenomenal a los Airpods fácil de limpiar con un trapo húmedo y después de casi un año el color sigue siendo el mismo y el mosquetón es muy útil. Producto recomendado para cubrir los Airpods .
5,Pratica e molto economica grazie al moschettone in dotazione evito anche di perdere le airpods!
4,come da specifiche
4,È quello che cercavo
4,Protegge bene la custodia degli Airpods la uso da diversi mesi e è perfetta portandola sempre in giro nella borsa pensavo che si sarebbe sporcata o sciupata e invece è perfetta
4,Alles ok.
4,Calza a pennello al contenitore degli Airpods e lo protegge oltre a renderlo meno scivoloso. Comodo il moschettone anche se realizzato con un materiale abbastanza scadente. Non conigli odi usarlo per appendere il tutto in un luogo troppo esposto ma è ok se come me volete agganciarlo in una borsa o zaino in modo da renderlo facilmente recuperabile.
4,Prodotto ottimo protegge da graffi e attutisce in buona parte le cadute materiale di buona qualità e fatturaPer il momento una delle migliori case che ho provatoUnica pecca che c'è un mezzo millimetro di spazio vicino all'apertura dello sportellino ma nulla di troppo visibileUn consiglio che potrei dare è quello di dargli una carica elettromagnetica per fare in modo che pelucchi o polvere non si attacchino alla custodiaPer il resto nulla da dire.
4,Ottimo prodotto. Buono rapporto qualità prezzo. Protegge adeguatamente la custodia degli AirPod da cadute accidentali
4,It’s alright.
5,Leicht super bequem. Gut verarbeitet. Preis sehr OK. Was brauch man mehr.
4,Ottimo prodotto è in silicone e copre abbastanza bene tutto il contenitore delle cuffie...l’unica pecca è che viene difficile inserire interamente la custodia.
4,Questa cover per le cuffie apple aripods è molto comoda.Si infila il box contenente le cuffie nella cover in plastica morbida e grazie al moschettone compreso si possono attaccare dove si vuoleLa tenuta è buona.Aspetto a mettere la quinta stella per vedere quanto tempo durerannoPer il momento sono soddisfattissimo dell'articolo
3,Purtroppo non posso rendere il prodotto perché ormai l’ho spacchettato mi sono accorta solo dopo una settimana (non avevo ancora in casa le AirPods) che la cover non riveste perfettamente la custodia delle AirPods nel senso che tra il “corpo” e il “coperchio” restano 2/3 mm di spazio.La custodia quindi non  resta perfettamente protetta e lo spazio che si vede anche esteticamente sta abbastanza male.
4,Custodia molto carina. L’ho appena messa quindi non so come si comporterà nel tempo ma per ora non fa alcun difetto.Unico contro che ho già notato è che attira i pelucchiAggiornamento: dopo neanche due giorni il moschettone si è rotto e l’ho sostituito con una cordicina con cui mi ci trovo ancora meglio. In ogni caso ottimo prodotto
4,Non copre perfettamente la scatole si sporca molto facilmente. Ma nel complesso carina
5,All well but price is 200 to 300 extra
4,Nice fit. But the glow doesnt last long? U will have to constantly make sure it gets sun light everyday which is a shame. But i like how its a blue glow and not green.
4,So wie es sein muss.Danke
4,Fängt etwas staub ein aber kann wieder mit einem Feuchten Tuch weggewischt werden.Sehr dick schützt gut.
5,Me encanta
4,Bello effetto
4,Utile
3,The case fits beautifully on the air pod but the case can get dirty very easily and it picks up dust. The chain has now become loose after a couple of months in use.
3,Cute colour and works but doesn’t fit 100% - there is always a gap at the opening however it is a very small gap. Thin silicone cover so protects from dust and scratches. Love that it has a keychain so can be attached to bags etc.
5,Das Produkt hat trotz dem geringen Preis meine Erwartungen mehr als erfüllt. Die Silikonhülle sitzt an dem Case sehr gut an und auch der Verschluss schließt gut. Auch die Farbe ist wie auf den Fotos!
5,It’s an open and shut case. It does what it’s supposed to do and makes the AirPods case a lot easier to hold and more difficult to drop.
5,This case is one of the best I have used. Protects the AirPods in the best way and not super expensive.
5,Comodo e il moschettone è perfetto per non perdere le AirPod
5,Ho già recensito una cover elago simile ma il moschettone di questa alternativa in grigio é molto comodo e resistente potrete appenderle al passante dei vostri jeans o alle vostre chiavi e vi sembrerà di non averle.
5,Es hält wirklich gut und sieht sehr schön aus. Man muss ein bisschen fummeln bis es richtig sitzt aber dann passt es wirklich gut
4,Well priced and fits round my AirPod case well. Adds protection from scratches. I have the glow colour - clear in the day and glows in the dark which is a nice touch.
3,Couleur qui correspond a la description l’etui est résistant
5,Se adapta perfectamente a los ipods. Muy buen diseño y muy funcional. La volveré a comprar sin duda.
3,Sicuramente un prodotto utilissimo per chi vuole proteggere la propria custodia dei suoi amati AirPods. Il silicone sembra di buona fattura e con un piacevole soft touch al tatto. Utile la possibilità di collegarlo ad un moschettone (incluso nella confezione) ma personalmente non utilizzerei con il rischio di perderseli per strada.Sia la parte inferiore che superiore della cover aderiscono perfettamente alla custodia degli AirPods ma...  la superiore quando si chiude la custodia rimane leggermente scostata dalla parte inferiore (vedi ultima foto).
5,Soft nice silicone. I changed the clip to a stronger one. It does get dusty sometimes which is kinda gammy but you just wipe it away with your finger
5,Prodotto molto semplice ma allo stesso tempo efficace l'ho acquistato perchè la custodia delle airpods risulta molto scivolosa quando la si appoggia e oltretutto se non si hanno tasche è difficile trovare una collocazione per portarla in giro. Con questa cover si protegge da urti si evita di far scivolare in giro la custodia e si ha la possibilità di agganciarle dappertutto (cintura borsa portachiavi ecc..). E' molto ben fatto ed è molto fine esteticamente (acquistata bianca).
5,Am delighted with the case. The silicone gets covered in fluff a lot but that is the nature of silicone and usually comes off when I blow at it :)
5,Got protection for case
5,Die Hülle sieht sehr schön aus. Schöne Farbe. Sie passt gut auf die AirPods drauf und ist auch leicht wieder abzumachen. Einen Sturz hält sie auch ab und der Karabiner ist sehr praktisch. Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen
5,Prodotto bellissimo.. impossibile perderlo
4,Ottima custodia ovviamente il silicone tende ad attirare polvere e sporco ma con una veloce pulita torna come nuovo. Voglio segnalare che il moschettone che avevo in confezione differisce come colorazione rispetto a quello in foto. Non è brunito ma bensì grigio.
4,Arrivata con un giorno di anticipo va bene per gli airpods seconda generazione. Il led si vede se scegliete colori chiari la mia è rosa.
2,The top broke off in less than a month :( I bought it because it was a case with a keychain that I could keep my earbuds safe. Now it’s just a keychain
4,Ferme parfaitement et protège bien le boîtier. Le mousqueton est pratique pour accrocher le boîtier afin de ne pas le perdre. Correspond bien au descriptif. Je recommande :)
5,Sehr schön. einfach die i Pods rein und los geht’s. Farbe entspricht genau der Abbildung. Preis /Leistung top
5,Comprata per proteggere le mie Airpods aderisce perfettamente  impossibile da togliere (letteralmente). Unica pecca che non vale 4 stelle ma comunque 5 è la mancanza della protezione per l'ingresso lightning. Stra consigliata.
5,Good case value for money
4,Das eigentliche Produkt gefällt mir sehr jedoch ist bei dem Karabiner direkt am ersten Tag das federglied rusgerutscht und jetzt schließt er nicht mehr
4,Prodotto conforme alla descrizione unica pecca forse la plastica che a volte tende ad aggrapparsi alle pareti della tasca rendendo difficile tirare fuori le airpods
5,Ho acquistato questo prodotto dopo aver provato anche un case simile ma di plastica rigida. Tra i due non c'è stato paragone questo infatti essendo di gomma è leggero copre interamente la custodia delle AirPods e attaccato alla fibia dei pantaloni non si sente mai addosso. Ho preso un gancio a parte perché cadendomi quello incluso si è rotto al primo colpo. A parte questo il prodotto è fantastico.
4,Il prodotto è carino calza perfettamente ed è arrivato in tempi perfetti. L'unica pecca è che il moschettone con cui l'ho comprato si è rotto dopo pochi giorni e ho dovuto sostituirlo con uno che avevo in casa...
5,È esattamente quello che cercavo: buoni materiali e finitura perfetto incastro con la custodia degli airpods ottimo moschettone per non perderli (sembra abbastanza resistente) e una volta inseriti gli airpods potrete caricarli senza problemi grazie al l’apposito foro e anche l’apertura della custodia non è ostacolata in nessun modo.
4,la custodia svolge bene la sua funzione.  si inserisce facilmenteProtegge il case da graffi o cadute accidentali.Peccato per il moschettone che si e' rotto  dopo solo 2 giorni.per il resto la consiglio
4,Protects the pod case nicelyEasy to fit on the pod
4,Prodotto molto carino e semplice lo consiglio a chi vuole una "cover" per le proprie airpods diversa dalle solite
4,la custodia in oggetto è costruita molto bene ed è di una comodità assurda infatti grazie al moschettone in dotazione la si puo agganciare ovunque e portare sempre appresso le airpodsprotegge sicuramente le airpods da cadute e da polverela consiglio vivamente a tutte le persone che ci tengono alla cura delle loro airpods
4,Custodia con fiutino perfetto ottime finiture e design fluorescente ma non troppo marcato in modo tale da esser comunque discreto se portato. Consegna veloce e seller disponibile e cordiale
4,カバンにかけれて便利。カバンの中で迷子にならなくなった。一年つかっているがくたびれたり伸びたりということはない。ただカラビナが弱くて、大きく開くとバネ？がバカになる。（簡単に直るが面倒くさい）でもこの値段だと相応かなとおもっています。
4,arrivato velocemente siccome è un regalo di natale lo proveremo il 25 dicembre :-)
5,Perferct for what I needed. Clip hoop at the side is nice and small (but solid) especially when you consider the size of the clip hoop on some alternatives. Was a little hard to get perfectly cos the rubber was clingy but this is actually a good thing. Now that its on it fits snugly and stays in place! It doesnt move around requiring constant adjustments.
4,Custodia protettiva per AirPods molto bello da vedere protegge le AirPods da urti e graffi. Impedisce un po’  l’apertura della custodia in quanto non fa funzionare il sistema a calamita ma nulla di rilevante.
3,Ottima la custodia non si può dire lo stesso del moschettone (motivo dell’acquisto di questo articolo) che si é rotta in tempo 2 ore
5,Di buona fattura calza perfettamente e si applica con facilità. Il packaging "accattivante" lo fa sembrare fin dal primo impatto un prodotto superiore rispetto al prezzo effettivo di costo.Non posso pronunciarmi sulla resistenza nel lungo termine ma per adesso (in uso da due mesi) non ha dato problemi. Molto comodo e carino il moschettone ovale e la fluorescenza è utile per trovare al volo le cuffie anche in una stanza buia!
5,Der Artikel wurde schnell geliefert. Das Preis- Leistungsverhältnis ist gut. Der Artikel ist wie erwartet. Über die Langlebigkeit kann ich noch keine Einschätzung abgeben.
4,Il prodotto è buono e protegge molto bene gli AirPods
5,Prodotto di buona qualità e funzionale soprattutto se si portano spesso gli AirPods dentro borse o zaini.
4,Posso usare gli EarPods come portachiavi e averli sempre con me e protetti. Piccolo neo: la cover nella parte superiore tende a spostarsi credo sia un problema comune a tutte le cover di questo tipo: un piccolo pezzo di biadesivo ha risolto il problema.
5,Die Hülle ansich ist gut aber die Öse an der der Karabiner befestigt ist ist sehr schwach. Er war leider nach ein paar Tagen weg. Ansonsten hat die Hülle sehr gute Passform und istsehr stabil
3,Leider ist der silikondeckel schon nach 2 Monaten von der silikonhülle an der Falz abgerissen - wahrscheinlich ist dies die Gebrauchs-Schwachstelle.Hält trotzdem nach wie vor. Optisch einwandfrei.
3,Bien. Color igual que en la foto. Lo unico que con el tiempo la silicona se da de si y se separa sola de la tapa de la caja de los airpods. Por lo demas ok
3,It broke after using it for a couple of weeks
3,Ho acquistato questa custodia per AirPods avendo già provato ad acquistarne un’altra in precedenza sempre Elago (in particolare duo case Body Rosa-Italiana/Top-Blu corallo Giallo).Allora il materiale é ottimo non ci si può lamentare ed é per questo che dò comunque 3 stelle però io l’ho restituito per i seguenti motivi:-il gancio é debole-rimane un lieve spazio aperto lungo l’apertura degli AirPods che a persone precisine come me può dare fastidio.
5,Acquistato un anno fa per le mie AirPods.A distanza di un anno non posso fare altro che consigliarvi questa custodia.Svolge la sua funzione benissimo è pratico e comodo e protegge  le AirPods da ogni tipo di graffio o urto.Il moschettone è utilissimo.Dopo 1 anno durante la notte vedo ancora che si illumina !Davvero un prodotto ottimo; acquistatelo !
4,Fatto di una gomma morbida e resistente allo stesso tempo. Comodo il moschettone per portarlo sempre con se. Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo.
4,Fatto molto bene  ottimo silicone  il Moschettone Aggiunto fatto bene  il colore Nightglow Blu deve assorbire molta luce per essere visto  ma l'effetto è molto bello .
4,Carinissima e comodissima. Ripara le mie AirPods e grazie al moschettone le aggancio alla zip interna della borsa per averle sempre a portata di mano
4,Bello al tatto e alla vista. Copre e protegge benissimo e in più è proprio bello da vedere!Materiale di qualità nonostante il prezzo molto accessibile. Unica pecca che attrae un po’ lo sporco che rimane attaccato.
5,I’m sure I would have lost my AirPods by now if it wasn’t for this little case.  It’s easy to spot the case and also there is a clip for attaching to buckles
5,Es muy suave y resistente. Además tiene un precio realmente asequible.
3,El producto es lo que esperaba. Solo lo he usado unas horas. No entiendo el comentario de la gente sobre que es difícil de poner. Mi problema ha sido otro. El mosquetón es malísimo. Ha durado lo que se tarda en abrirlo 2 veces. Siendo una pieza menor y poco importante (se puede conseguir en cualquier sitio) lo valoro con un 3 porque el resto parece que es bueno y la presencia también.
3,El color de la funda es un pelín más chillón que en la foto pero igual es bonito y queda bien así que eso no me molesta. El tacto es suave y protege bien el airpod. El problema es la anilla que después de usarla 1 semana ya se rompió. Pero ya me lo esperaba por los comentarios.
4,Mi è piaciuto molto il gancio che è comunque di piccole dimensioni. Ciò che non mi è piaciuto è il materiale fa attaccare la polvere
5,Tolle Hülle. Schützt vor zerkratzen und liegt aufgrund des Materials gut in der Hand. Der Karabiner ist super um siebtem Beispiel im Rucksack oder einer Tasche zu befestigen um unnötiges suchen zu vermeiden. Passt genau!
4,Migliroabile ma molto comoda entra perfettamente sia in Aripods 1 che nelle 2 colore fluorescente non efficente funziona solo dopo averlo ricaricato TANTO alla luce.
3,Great for looking after my AirPods but the clip part is quite weak so I had to buy a different 1
5,Love!! So cute
5,Stupendo proprio come in foto e molto comodo visto che lo si può appendere anche al jeans .
5,Looks good size is correct
5,Super case 🥰
5,Artikel wie beschrieben bin sehr zufrieden gerne wieder!
5,Super. Mega Qualität. Glitzert mega schön und leuchtet im Dunkeln sehr hell. Einfach nur top. Macht die AirPods zu einem Hingucker
5,Muy bien era para mi hija y ella esta muy contenta ahora no va perdiendo su cajita ya que la puede enganchar en un sitio y asi la encontrara jajaja. Muy buena compra protege muy bien la cajita y estamos contentos y lo recomendamos.
3,Soddisfatto a metà l’involucro x farlo aderire così ci ho dovuto  perdere un po’ di tempo e di sforzo .ma dovrebbe aderire del tutto !!! Comunque protegge la custodia
4,Per ora fa il suo lavoro. Molto utile per non perdere i preziosi auricolari Apple. Non sò quanto ancora resisterà il gancio perché sembra un po’ deboluccio ma per ora è ok.
5,I'm using this for my airpods. It's really nice. I'm glad I purchase this.
4,Il gancio si rompere
5,Very nice must buy🤩
5,Bought as a gift she loves it nice protection.  Feels good. Looks good.
5,Perfette è bellissima si illumina come da foto
4,It’s good. Fits well. Good cover.
5,Süße Farbe & gutes preis-leistungs-verhältnis
4,Ottimo articolo ben fatto e piacevole al tattogomma morbida con comodo ganciosoddisfatto
5,Feels nice fits perfectly Clip is very weak but it does the job. 5/5 would buy again... if I needed to which I won’t since I already have one... why do people say ‘would buy again’ anyway...
5,Me parece que es un extra super recomendable. Lo unico que la anilla que viene con la funda es muy endeble con lo que no recomiendo jugartela llevandolod colgados del pantalon
5,Ich finde dieses Produkt äußerst nützlich. Die in anderen Rezensionen beschriebenen Probleme treten bei mir in keinster Weise auf und das Produkt erfüllst seinen Zweck und schützt meine Airpods nun schon seid 2 Wochen ohne Umstände. Gerne wieder!
4,Mia figlia ha gradito molto la custodia molto “gommosa”.
4,Buena calidad y diseño pero me han enviado un color distinto al que pedí.
4,Un ottimo rivestimento: aderisce bene e il moschettone è molto utile
4,Materiali buoni e design ottimo: Elago è un brand molto serio che ormai conosco da anni.Solo 4 stelle e non 5 solo per il prezzo troppi 12€ circa per un "pezzo di gomma".
5,Prodotto molto comodo e funzionale. Esattamente come nelle foto. Materiale molto confortante al tatto. Protegge del tutto le cuffie e il moschettone risulta comodo per il trasporto e per agganciarlo all’interno di zaino o borsa. Prodotto consigliatissimo
5,Ottimo prodotto bello pratico e il moschettone lo rende davvero comodo non me le perdo più in borsa...!..unica pecca è che il silicone che al tatto è piacevole si sporca facilmente soprattutto si impolvera ma niente di così rilevante da non dargli 5 stelle anche perché protegge molto bene le AirPods.Ottimo Amazon per la spedizione.
3,Key hook soon became broken and case a little saggy so not great.
4,It’s quite soft and fitted with my airpod.
5,Es para lo que es así que cumple su función a la perfección.
5,Love this! It fits my AirPods case perfectly and is very protective and shock-absorbing. It has a very sleek design and id really recommend this product
5,Fits really well. Some have complained about a bit of gapping; yes there is a 1mm or so gap big deal. It looks absolutely fine and offers the protection to the case needed.
4,Fanno il loro lavoro prodotto dalla buona fattura. Il moschettone sembra un po fragile ecco perché 4 e non 5 stelle. Consigliato? Si!
4,Super Produkt nur leider kein Schutz am Ladesteckereingang. Ansonsten super hochwertig
5,Prodotto acquistato in seguito ad altre esperienze con altri prodotti.Nonostante sia fatta in silicone non risulta trattenere eccessiva polvere quando è in tasca e non pratica resistenza vista l’aderenza del materiale: grande pregio e qualità per un prodotto del genere.Al tatto è piacevole ed il moschettone con cui viene venduto è pratico e di buona fattura.Consiglio
1,Hi the product delivered is not the same. A replacement has been initiated as there is no refund. However I’d like to ask you for a change of product instead. PS: I’m writing here as the support isn’t working. Please send the one mentioned here: elago Clear Airpods Case with Keychain Designed for Apple Airpods 1 & 2 (Neon Yellow) https://www.amazon.in/dp/B083DLS44W/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabc_44XEM14YQEWHTRWCW90X?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
3,Lo stile è veramente molto bello.La qualità del gommino in silicone anche da uno stile in più agli airpods(che sono già fighissime) almeno però così so che si proteggono.La cosa che non mi è piaciuta è che il gancetto dopo un giorno di utilizzo si è rotto.
4,Man kann die Kopfhörer so gut in der Handtasche festmachen und muss nicht immer suchen. Auch am Hosenbund kann man sie gut befestigen
5,Pensavo fosse un po’ più spesso ma comunque mi sembra una buona custodia pratica e comoda
5,Top Case mit super Verarbeitung.Es braucht etwas Feingefühl das Silikon in Form zu ziehen da es exakt sitzen muss damit der schiefe Eindruck ausbleibt. Aber wie die Bilder hoffentlich zeigen lohnt die Mühe. Dicke Empfehlung.
5,Nice snuggly case. I love that it goes everywhere with me along with my keys without having to keep track on one extra item when leaving home. Need big pockets if you use it with keys though.
5,Il colore è carinissimo e la custodia aderisce perfettamente alle mie AirPods. Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo rispetto a ciò che si trova nei negozi. Consigliata.
5,Fits like a glove great soft silicone material and a really handy clip. love the colour and the logo isn't ugly or domineering either. Very happy :)
5,Daughter loved them
4,Buon prodotto calza bene e buona fattezza. Protegge bene....l’unico neo l’anello del gancio lo vedo un po’ debole....
5,Item came in on time and the design colour and accessory are very nice! They fit the airpods perfectly and seem very hard to break for now. No dust collected so far so happy days.
4,Ottima custodia non metto 5 stelle in quanto il moschettone e veramente di scarsa fattura si rovina molto facilmente.Comunque ne consiglio l'acquisto.
5,Sehr gute Versrbeitung
5,Davvero carina e funzionale calza a pennello! Protegge la custodia dai graffi e dà la possibilità di attaccarli a qualsiasi cosa grazie al comodo moschettone anche al passante dei jeans. Molto pratico anche per la ricarica grazie al foro in corrispondenza dell’attacco lightening. Ottimo prodotto buon rapporto qualità prezzo (preso con offerta lampo a 764€)
5,Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo.Buon spessore della gomma molto resistente e comodo.Molto bella la colorazione bianco glow.
3,Il prodotto è sicuramente valido soprattutto per la possibilità di aggiungere un moschettone dico aggiungere perché quello in dotazione è di scarsa qualità si è rotto dopo 3 giorni
3,Il prodotto è fatto veramente bene misura perfetta e calza perfettamente. L'unica pecca è dovuta al materiale che purtroppo attira a se tutto cio che avete in tasca di conseguenza è sempre molto sporco e anche difficile da pulire. Tornassi indietro prenderei quello in alluminio si righerà ma almeno resta pulito
5,La medida perfecta fácil de poner y de limpiar color rosa pastel tal y como se ve. Perfecto
3,I put the case on and it literally broke.Would not suggest buying it!
5,Its a good product small and has a lot of grip. Its really sturdy so if i were you i would buy it.Only 9 euro's. EPIC!
4,Fatta bene ottimi materiale. Nero tende a sporcarsi se lo si tiene in tasca..... ma comunque si pulisce facilmente!!!
5,Great! More expensive than what you can otherwise fine but it works better than the cheaper ones.
5,Top Schutz für meine AirPods.Passt einwandfrei leuchtet im Dunkel angenehm und man weiss sofort wo sie liegen.
5,Consiglio questa cover in quanto senza in pochi giorni le airpods si sono graffiate con molta facilità. Aderisce molto ben nella parte sotto mentre in quella sopra non rimane sempre attaccata quando la si mette in tasca. Nel complesso per quello che serve e per il prezzo è perfetta l'illuminazione al buio fa il suo dovere.
5,La custodia Elago aderisce perfettamente è di spessore adeguato a evitare danni da cadute accidentali il materiale della custodia è di ottima qualità e il moschettone è davvero comodo per poterle appendere se necessario.Consiglio l’acquisto senza ombra di dubbio.
5,Brilliant cover love the colour grey and the colour clip coming in very handy. Brilliant in my handbag not getting scratched
4,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. Consiglio.
4,Carino ma mi aspettavo qualcosa di meglio !
4,Funda correcta. Se adhiere bien al estuche de Carga de los AirPods cosa que no parece al recibirla a simple vista y tacto una vez puesta queda muy bien. Protege bien.
3,La cover funziona bene non scivola e quindi ottimo non fosse per il moschettone che una volta in tasca si è spostato in avanti il perno che fa leva e si è rotto grande nota dolente soprattutto per quasi 10€ di cover
2,Die Qualität nicht wirklich der burner und die Hülle sitzt nicht mal richtig für den Preis etwas lächerlich .Das beste noch ich habe keinen Karabiner bekommen obwohl in der Beschreibung steht das einer erhalten ist.Sonst ist sie Rutschfest also es ist wirklich schwer die Airpods Case aus der Hülle zu entnehmen was eigentlich noch gut ist.Lange wird die Hülle bestimmt auch nicht halten.
5,A bit costly but is worth the price as it’s grippy and fits very well on the Airpods 2. I would recommend this to anyone out there looking for a great Airpods case
5,Die Hülle leuchtet zwar nicht besonders hell nach jedoch ausreichend hell um das AirPods Kästchen im Finstern sofort zu finden. Zuvor musste ich immer Licht einschalten.
3,Buon prodotto utile per proteggere la custodia delle proprie AirPods. Di giorno è di colore bianco quando c'è poca luce è fosforescente color celestino. Non aspettatevi il blu acceso come nella foto del prodotto.Infine il moschettone seppur comodo si rompe facilmente. E' capitato sia a me che ad un mio collega. Consiglio la sostituzione per evitare di perdere le airpods chissà dove.
5,Se adapta muy bien  los protege y la textura hace q no resbalen salvándote de algún susto y puedes con su mosquitos cogerlo a llaves  cartera etc la verdad muy recomendable
2,Come alti clienti anche a me dopo 2 giorni si è rotto il moschettone. L'avevo comprato per questo quindi sono rimasto deluso ed ho chiesto subito il reso ma poi ho deciso di tenerlo per evitare sbattimenti sostituendo il moschettone con un altro che avevo in casa in quanto la cover in sè mi sembra di buona fattura. Effettivamente la sporcizia si attacca facilmente ma allo stesso modo si toglie in 2 secondi con una spugnetta umida. Ad ogni modo non lo ricomprerei.
5,Super man braucht keine Angst haben dass es abreißt und dass man es verlier
4,Cover utile bella da vedere e funzionale.
5,Alles wie beschrieben. Super! Ich habe die Silikonhülle erst kurz. Daher kann ich zur Haltbarkeit und Robustheit erstmal nur 4 Sterne geben.
3,I ordered the Black and received the dark grey. Other than that it’s a brilliant case
5,Sta perfetto sulle mie airpods e mi è arrivato anche un giorno prima
4,Fiat ottimo cala agiusta dopo un piccolo aggiustamento tirando un po’ la gomma...ma poi perfetta. Resa estetica gradevole in abbinata a custodie di silicone simili di iPhone e iPad...
5,La cover è in silicone e dà sensazioni di materiale premium. Avvolge completamente la custodia delle airpods lasciando scoperto solo il connettore lightning.Se illuminata diventa blu fosforescente (solo la parte frontale).Riguardo al moschettone oramai la uso da un mese e non ho notato fragilità particolari. Quindi direi acquisto ok
4,Veloci nel servizio e articolo perfetto
5,Perfetto e conforme alla descrizione.Resistente di misura adeguata e davvero di qualità superiore rispetto ad altre custodie similari anche più care.Ottimo lo ricomprerei senz’altro.Acquistato nero molto bello anche perché il moschettone è in metallo marrone.Anche la spedizione è stata puntualissima.
2,I received my order in amazing time - thank you seller. However i specifically ordered a black Airpod Hang Case and received a grey one packaged as a black unit :/As per the attached image i took a picture next to a black stapler in order to see the big difference is hue.Thank you seller but colour are not as stated!
5,è un ottimo prodotto semplice e utile per proteggere gli AirPods. va bene sia per AirPods 1 e 2.Come sta scritto nella descrizione non ha un foro per il led esterno degli AirPods 2 con la custodia wireless.Non protegge dall'acqua.
5,Cover molto carina
4,サイズもぴったりで、デザインもシンプルでかっこいいです。傷にも強いし、おすすめです。
5,menomale che ho comprato questa fodera protegge è comoda e si può attaccare ovunque.ben fatto
5,El ajuste es perfecto y el mosquetón ayuda a enganchar los airpods a un llavero o mochila y así minimizar el riesgo de perder la caja. Genial para gente olvidadiza que no sabe dónde va dejando las cosas
4,Molto più sottile delle concorrenti peccato manchi la protezione per la ingresso della ricarica
5,La cover in gomma sembra ben fatta il gancio è di qualità scadente ma non è quello l’importante. La colorazione “Nightglow Blue” per essere attivata ha busogno che la cover sia esposta a sorgenti luminose per “caricarsi di enrgia” da sprogionare poi al buoi.Lo trovo molto utile per trovare le airpods durante la notte
3,Ottima cover. Comoda da appendere in borsa in quanto le AirPods sono facili da perdere. Peccato per il moschettone rotto quasi subito. Ne avevo uno a casa e l’ho sostituito poiché la cover è molto comoda.
5,Bellissimo case per AirPods 1ª generazione. Antiscivolo grazie al materiale (gomma) e impossibile da perdere se agganciato al passante dei pantaloni (ad esempio). Davvero un ottimo prodotto
5,Excellent product and fully protects by Apple EarPods - wish I had brought them sooner
5,Perfetto per AirPods
5,Oltre a proteggere da graffi consente grazie al moschettone di essere attaccato stabilmente senza correre il rischio di perderlo o dimenticarlo. Il colore è veramente gradevole così come il tatto
5,The colour is sight catching the grip is also great. I would recommend this case to anyone who want there Airpods to look good even in a case.
2,bisschen zu klein für Airpods 2.... frage mich wieso :-)und saugt leider am silikon selber sehr viel staub auf...
5,Muy bien cumple su propósito. El color es muy bonito es agradable al tacto y se ve que protege bien la carcasa de los airpods.
5,Sehr cooles Produkt
4,保護ケースとしては、通常使用する分には問題ないと思います。カラビナも付属しているので便利です。蓄光性はそこそこだと思います。私は普段はバッグの中にしまってしまうのですが、しまう前に光を当てる事ができれば暗所でAirpodsを探すのには苦労しません。それでも「ボンヤ〜リ」なので「ピカーッ！」てのを期待してる人にはおすすめできません。シリコン製なのでやはりそれなりに汚れます。
5,The best feature of it that it illuminates in the dark so it won't get lost.
5,utile custodia per apple airpods. di buona fattura. La uso da più di tre mesi la qualità della plastica è buona trovo utile il gancio per appenderla ai pantaloni. prodotto nel complesso consigliato.
5,Had an Elgao AirPods case already but wanted the hanging ability. Took a punt on the glowing one. Really pleased I did! Just looks frosted in normal light glows a lovely blue when dark.
1,ここについてくるカラビナはゴミなので使わない方がいいです。ズボンにつけていたのですが、いつのまにかなくなっていました。
1,I would like a refund...FALSE ADVERTISEMENTIt doesnt even glow....The whole reason why i bought it is because a thought it would GLOWas shown in the DESCRIPTION?!!!
5,Die Hülle passt perfekt und schützt somit die empfindlichen Kopfhörer bzw. die Box vor Kratzern.Können sie bis jetzt uneingeschränkt empfehlen.
4,Ottimo prodotto.... il moschettone è durato 36 ore ma non credo sia importante
5,Brilliant worth the money because it hasn’t split yet and it doesn’t feel cheap love the clip but it’s working well
3,Dopo qualche giorno di utilizzo normale il moschettone si è rotto la cover invece è ottima il materiale è comodo al tatto e calza bene
5,Custodia ottima in tutto e per tutto nulla da dire tranne forse che tende ad attaccarsi la polvere visto che la consistenza è simil silicone ma non e assolutamente un problema una soffiata e via la paura!
5,Bisher super sieht nicht nur gut aus sondern bewirkt auch seinen Zweck
5,Sieht gut aus und schützt die Airpods
5,🔝
5,Alles ok.
3,Hook is not good
5,Prodotto ottimo e comodo. esattamente come me lo aspettavo sia il materiale sia il colore.
4,Il silicone pensavo che era piú morbido
5,Ottimo prodotto la uso da Natale 2018 e devo dire che è assolutamente essenziale prodotto dall’ottima finitura calza perfettamente e in tasca non da fastidio mi ha già salvato le EarPods da qualche caduta pericolosa.  Cosmgilaita
5,Perché spendere 10€ quando ne puoi spendere 2 per una cover cinese? Semplicemente massima qualità dei materiali non attrae polvere aderisce perfettamente alle Airpods gancio di qualità varietà di colori e versione fluorescente!
4,lightningケーブル差し込み口の穴がぴったりで良い。フィット感も問題なし。
5,Custodia ben fatta protegge ottimamente le AirPods. Possiede anche un gancio a moschettone utile per il trasporto (cintura zaino ecc.). Il punto forte di questa custodia che si illumina dopo aver ricevuto i raggi del sole quindi anche di notte è ben visibile.
5,Es muy practico y bonito.A la vez que proteges los Airpods queda muy bonito y es muy practico porque lo puedes colgar en cualquier parte del bolso o mochila y así es facil encontrarlos.
3,Prodotto come in foto. Unica pecca arrivato senza moschettone che avrebbe fatto sicuramente comodo. A questo punto non lo ricomprerei.
5,Bellissima cover per le cuffieComodissimo il moschettone che ti permette di appenderle dove vuoiProtezione assicurata
5,Super Schutz für die Airpods! Den Karabiner finde ich auch sehr praktisch so muss ich nicht immer lange suchen in meiner Tasche.
3,Il prodotto è molto comodo si adatta bene a i miei airpods!
5,Che dire un ottimo prodotto e si adatta in pochi secondi e protegge in modo ottimale tutte le superfici che potrebbero graffiarsi con facilità... indispensabile  poi spedito da Amazon.it  superveloce come sempre !!!
5,Passt optimal Farbe wie abgebildet.
3,Il coperchio si apre sempre il silicone raccoglie tutti i peli/polvere che ci sono nelle borse o tasche. Per il resto comodo per riconoscere le cuffie se ce ne sono altre in casa. Comodo il moschettone
2,There is some false advertising on your product I bought this item to huck it onto my bag which I have the carabiner but no huck on the case at all to put the carabiner onto but other than that the case works completely fine as it should do
5,Fa il suo dovere protegge dagli urti aderisce bene e non è troppo spessa (è abbastanza sottile).
3,Leider war der Karabinerhaken schon nach ein paar Tagen kaputt.
3,È davvero un buon prodotto. Protegge bene calza a pennello alle AirPods. Unico difetto la gomma raccoglie ogni tipo di sporcizia dalla tasca.  Brutto a vedersi.
4,正直シリコンケースだし、うまくフィットしないとかスリットがピッタリ合ってなかったりするんだろうと思ってたけど。その点は心配なかった。触れた感触もいい。強く引っ張ったらカラビナとの接続部分ひきちぎれそうだけど、総合的にみて満足。
5,Molto bella esteticamente dopo mesi di utilizzo ha ancora una presa eccellente sul guscio in plastica delle airpods. Poi il moschettone è molto utile ti permette di attaccarle un po ovunque
5,Ottimo prodotto  già la seconda volta che lo consiglio ...sono molto contenta di Amazon una azienda seria ti viene sempre incontro se c’è qualche problema mi fido al 100x100
4,il moschettone mi è stato riferito essere poco pratico.
5,Ottimo prodotto! Fatto bene! Amazon top come sempre!
5,è tutto come atteso
5,Bien terminado encaja perfectamente.
5,Love the glow in dark blue... Fit pods really well and is very tactile... Good price and great to attach to keyring. Arrived super quick
5,Really good product. Fitted well and protects my AirPod case.
3,Il prodotto è complessivamente buono: bella custodia che si applica alla perfezione alle airpods. Tuttavia il moschettone si è rotto dopo circa 24 ore. Per questo solo 3 stelle.
5,Funda perfecta para trasporta Air Pods por módico precio. No carga pero así no los pierdes
4,夜、寝るときに音楽を聴こうとする際、すぐ見つかるので有難いです。発光具合も強すぎず弱すぎずな感じで寝る際の睡眠妨害にはならない程度でいいです。カラビナは安物なので家にあったものと取り替えました。
1,La fubda es bonita y bien acabada pero el ganchito no cierra y se cae todo el rato desde el primer día
4,La protección de silicona es un buen protector añadido para los airpods aunque no acaba de ajustar perfectamente a la caja de los airpods
5,Buona protezione in silicone x AirPod
3,La he comprado y cumple su función pero el rojo es diferente mucho más feo y chillón
5,Tal y cómo se ve practica y cómoda protege de los golpes y facilita el transporte de los airpods. Un acierto
5,Ottimo prodotto mi piace molto l’abbinamento di colore del moschettone con la cover
5,Si adatta perfettamente al case e permette comunque di utilizzare il pulsante posteriore.
5,Très joli s'ajuste et se retire comme il faut
5,Ok
4,Ok
5,Sehr passgenaue Silikonhülle für den zusätzlichen Schutz der AirPods.
5,produkt passt super schneller versand:))
5,Genau wie auf dem Foto sieht super aus rund um zufrieden!
5,Genau wie beschrieben
4,Ottimo acquisto
5,Gut
5,Super schönes Case & es sieht wie auf den Bildern aus !
5,Sehr funktionales Produkt
5,Das case ist sehr elastisch und leicht auf die Box zu ziehen.
5,Muy bien se ajusta perfectamente. La única pega es que se ha manchado con el roce y es imposible quitarlo del todo.
5,Bin vollkommen zufrieden mit dem Produkt schlichtes schönes Design und ein praktischer Karabinerhaken.Nur weiterzuempfehlen (:
5,Hülle für meine Air pods Kopfhörer. Kaufabwicklung und Produkt super
5,Prodotto bello e resistente agli urti peccato che raccolga un po di polvere ma basta soffiare un po’ e va via.
3,Buono
5,Spedizione incredibilmente veloce come sempre amazon come sempre imbattibile!Ordinato domenica pomeriggio alle 17 consegnato il lunedi' mattina alle 12.. che dire strepitosi!Prodotto di facilissimo utilizzo ricopre perfettamente il case.
5,Ottimo materiale morbido al tatto senza attirare polvere e sporcizia. Avvolge perfettamente la custodia si ricarica delle Apple AirPods.
5,Miglior colore illumina al buio. Non ingombrante e ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. La luce di ricarica si vede benissimo e il gancio sembra abbastanza resistente.
5,L'ho regalato amico figlio è molto soddisfatto. Da raccomandare..
5,La uso tutti i giorni mi è arrivata addirittura prima delle AirPods molto carino il design unica pecca il moschettone si è rotto dopo 2 giorni
5,Bellissima cover/protezione per AirPods. Corrisponde perfettamente alle foto. Veste bene materiale molto bello al tatto e abbastanza protettivo utile il gancino per il moschettone bello il colore. Il top sarebbe stato una parte apribile e chiudibile in corrispondenza del buco per caricare.
2,Ottima la qualità Ma purtroppo non arriva fino alle giunture ... il cappuccio manco entra... non ho le air pods ma hanno dimensione e grandezza uguale alle originali (ho potuto confrontarle x dirlo) e peccato davvero...
5,Calza perfettamente ed il gancio è comodo l’ho comprato solo da due settimane ma per ora resiste bene. Visto il materiale attira un po’ di polvere ma non abbastanza da creare un problema.
5,Sehr zufrieden mit der Hülle die Kopfhörer sind nun geschützt und immer in meiner Nähe
3,El producto es correcto y cumple con lo esperado sólo le doy 3 estrellas porqué lo solicité en color negro y me ha llegado en color gris no lo he devuelto porque me urgía utilizarlo
2,Cumple su función estuche protector se adapta bien....Un tiempo más tarde la funda está cogiendo holgura sobre todo por la parte de la tapa y al final muchas veces se queda la caja de los Airpods abierta y se descargan...De nueva muy bien pero al poco tiempo no se comporta como es de esperar no ha dado tiempo ni a que me canse de verla
5,👍
5,Ok
5,Esattamente ciò che mi aspettavo e cercavo. È semplice ma utile come cosa e soprattutto il gancio lo adoro perché posso portarmi le cuffie in giro senza rischiare di farle cadere.
5,Ok
5,Ottima cover. Ne vale la pena spendere qualche euro in più per questa cover poiché a differenza delle altre è di ottima qualità e aderisce benissimo al case degli air pods. Consigliatissima.
3,Troppo sottile non si chiude bene
3,Do 3 stelle perché sarebbe comodo avere la chiusura della porta per ricaricare così si evita che si sporchi.
2,Bella esteticamente e al tatto ma dopo un paio di minuti raccoglie più polvere e sporcizia di qualsiasi prodotto sul mercato con queste funzioni. Quindi se avete finito lo swiffer è ottima se no optate per una in pelle o in plastica dura.
5,Produkt entspricht der Erwartung Lieferung war genau im Termin
4,Praticità
5,Pratico e funzionale
1,This says case not case cover so very misleading.
1,My son just received his elago AirPods case. The delivery was very speedy but the item not fit for purpose. I am not sure if this item is faulty but the lid does not close and there is a large gap. Very disappointed.
3,Purtroppo mi aspettavo che fosse veramente fosforescente invece si vede appena appena per il resto ok.
5,Il materiale in silicone morbido al tatto è facile da pulire. Inoltre permette una bella presa essendo antiscivolo. Comodo anche il morsetto da applicare in borsetta.
5,ist sehr starker silikon. also dick und kann nicht schnell reißen. zufrieden
5,Bis jetzt alles toll.
4,regalo apprezzato
5,On time and as described
5,Per un prezzo così piccolo questa custodia per le AirPods è tutto ciò che si può desiderare. Buoni materiali estetica e funzionalità. Consiglio!
5,Passt genauwie beschrieben. Sehr zu empfehlen
5,Ben fatto
5,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo rispetto anche ad altri oggetti simili sul mercato. Trovo molto comodo il moschettone. La cover aderisce perfettamente alla custodia evidando che scivoli ovunque perché gommata. Consigliato
4,Ben fatto
5,Un accessorio ben fatto ed utilissimo soprattutto perché le cuffie così come sono non hanno ganci. Adesione perfetta. Acquistato un anno fa é come nuovo!
5,Molto comodo
5,bello. rende le cuffie più maneggievoli e meno scivolose. io ho scelto il bianco che ovviamente tende a sporcarsi ma ne ero consapevole quindi mea culpa.
1,I purchased this item as it had a keyring on the side.  On the outside of the box the cover had a keyring.  The product inside does not have a key ring.  I left 2 messages and no reply.  I had to buy another produce which I am very happy with to ensure my airpods are safe.
5,Works very well. Only flaw - collects dust
3,gancio rotto dopo 1 giorno
5,Excellent product.. great fit and quality. For the money you cannot go wrong.
4,consigliato
5,Brilliant
5,Genial! Encaja a la perfección es suave al tacto y el color melocotón es precioso!
5,it does what it offer and it does it right.
4,Molto buona
3,Purtroppo il moschettone è di pessima fattura ed ho perso i miei AirPods 😭
5,La custodia calza bene la custodia delle AirPods fa quello che deve fare una custodia ottima l’idea del moschettone
5,Good quality!
5,Pratique couleur pastel.C’est ce dont j’avais besoin.
5,Great item keep it on my belt loop gets dirty but washes easily
5,Excellent product to keep air pods protected
5,Ok
5,Great product like the glow in the dark blue
5,Me gusta mucho buena calidad.
5,Custodia perfetta per AirPods originali. Il gancio é comodissimo per le borse delle donne per evitare di non trovarli. Calza perfettamente ed e molto bella anche al tatto
5,Arrivata il giorno di consegna garantita.Molto bella e aderisce perfettamente alla custioda delle airpods! Molto comodo anche il moschettone
5,Gute Qualität schnelle Lieferung alles Top
5,Come da titolo bella e utile in quanto si illumina al buio facilitando la locazione delle cuffie. Unica pecca: il mollettone è un poi scadente ma dettaglio trascurabile.
2,Prodotto acquistato in offerta lampo pochi giorni fa niente da dire sulla sua funzionalità è in silicone bianco semitrasparente con cappuccio che si adatta perfettamente alla confezione delle AirPods. Unica pecca ma di fondamentale importanza se lo acquisti x questo: quelli che si dovrebbero illuminare al buio NON si illuminano!!
5,Great product & uber quick delivery
5,Just what I wanted.
3,La custodia fa la custodia ma la fluorescenza al buio è praticamente nulla. il gancio/moschettone è di scarsa qualità.
5,Ho acquistato per collegarlo al cerca oggetti. E' ben fatto e la custodia è poco più grande del prodotto. ben fatto e carino anche il moschettone. lo consiglio
2,Ich habe diesen Artikel gekauft und dachte das er leuchtet oder flurezierend ist.Nix leuchtet. Die Hülle ist weiß und leuchtet vielleicht wenn man ihn farbig anstrahlt.Das sollte man wissen ansonsten ist er passend und gut.
5,Zm besseren Transport und zum Schutz sehr gut!
1,This is made of the most flimsy material. The hinge is barely holding on I’m sure with a couple of times opening the case the lid would come off. Also the lid did not completely cover the top of the case so wouldn’t close. Seller please arrange a refund
5,Se adapta perfectamente. Es bonita y de material de calidad. Volvería a comprarla sin dudarlo. Para mí una compra de 10.
5,Risolve il problema del rischio perdita e consente di averle sempre a portata di mano io le tengo sempre attaccate allo zaino. Gran comodità!
1,Looks cute. The ring/carabiner broke really quickly. The top part which covers the flip  part of the case always slips off. Serves its purpose which is to identify my AirPods from my partners. If I was buying again I’d spend more and get higher quality case.
3,I gancio si è rotto subito
5,Molto ben fatti  calza alla perfezione le AirPod  buon materiale e colori belli
5,Lo fácil de colocar y los acabadosUn arnés venía roto
5,soluzione ideale per evitare di perdere le AirPods in un batter d'occhio. La possibilità di inserirle in un portachiavi o di agganciarle con il moschettone è davvero di grande utilità!
5,Ottimo prodotto arrivato nei tempi previsti (molto rapidi) ed esattamente come in foto ed in descrizione.Acquisto consigliato :)
5,great product fits the purpose perfectly
3,La custodia é carina e comoda ma l‘ho trovata a metà prezzo in un altro sito
5,Lo practico y sencillo de poner y sobre todo lo que protege a la caja de los Aipods
5,Consegnato il giorno dopo l’ordine perfette condizioni e si adatta perfettamente alla custodia delle AirPods. Gancio comodo per non perderle in borsa! Consogliatissimo
5,カラビナの強度もちょうどよく安心感もあり、つけ外しもしやすい届いてみてわかったことは本体の白いところが隙間から少し見えることくらい、気にしなければOK
5,Ottimo articolo arrivato in tempi brevissimi
5,livraison rapide belle boîte de présentation bon emballage produit conforme et très doux au coucher je recommande
1,Dalla descrizione sembrava un prodotto eccezionale. Non solo una semplice cover ma un qualcosa di design colorato fresco che poteva dare un tocco di allegria.Il prodotto è utile; sicuramente è un guscio di silicone abbastanza spesso quindi idoneo a proteggere la confezione delle airpods da eventuali urti e cadute. Ma la qualità costruttiva non è soddisfacente. Guardate le foto che ho allegato non calza per niente bene! Il silicone non è stato tagliato correttamente e lascia una sensazione di scarsa qualità. In più la linguetta sul retro unico pezzo che permette di tenere uniti il “cappello” superiore al resto del corpo è davvero deprimente… Alla fine per 899€ ci può stare? Secondo me no.
5,Prodotto migliore della descrizione  è perfetto come precisione costruttiva (aderisce perfettamente) e come qualità al tatto... ottimo prodotto ed ottimo venditore ... recensione top anzi se ci fossero 6 stelle le metterei
5,ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. E' perfetto per salvaguadare i PREZIOSISSIMI ( visto il loro costo...) air-pods.
5,Comodo elegante
2,The clip fell of the first day. Not really good quality
5,Luv it.
3,Non aderisce perfettamente . Ritardo nella consegna
5,posso dire che aderisce in maniera perfetta e in questo modo si evita che possano scivolare inavertitamente
1,Got it today for a present and box came dirty and looks horrid now. I cannot give it for a gift
5,AirPodsのレビューで、「静電気でケースにホコリなどがつく」という事だったのでそれを参考に買わせていただきました!とってもいいです(*｀ω')b暗いところで光るのも結構役立つし、カッコいいですね😎👍
2,Leuchten tuen sie nixht wirklich und der Karabiner quietscht beim öffnen und schließen.
1,カラビナありました。すみませんでした。
1,Do not waste your money!
1,The carabiner in the photos is a gold/bronze colour but in person it’s actually grey. Not happy. Also the case is see through it’s not white as the photo seems.
5,Tal vez un poquito caro para lo que es..pero es comodo se adapta bien y cumple su funcion
5,暗い環境でもほんのりと形がわかるので便利です
5,Spedizione veloce  svolge bene il suo lavoro ...bel prodotto  pratico e bello da vedere
5,Consegna avvenuta entro i termini.La custodia è ben fatta e praticamente ritengo che sia un oggetto necessario per chi ha gli AirPods.
5,ケースに傷が付くのが嫌だったので購入しました。フィット感も問題なく、とても重宝しています。
1,Disappointent totally in this  it’s an empty shell no white outer shell for the air pods to be kept safe  u can not close it waste of money
2,Il prodotto in se è ottimo ma do due stelle perchè in una settimana ne ho ordinati due neri ma entrambe le volte mi è arrivato grigio anche se sulla scatola c’è scritto black...
5,Me encanta la funda. Ajusta muy bien y es muy práctica ya que se puede comprar.
5,👍👍
2,protects the case but attracts all the dirt and fluff from pocket
3,蓄光能力はかなり低いと思います。買った日の夜、光るのを楽しみにしていましたがほとんど光らず、蓄光タイプじゃないのが送られてきたと思い、返品しようか悩みました（笑カラビナもちょっと信頼できないかな・・・外れて落としそうでカバンなどには取り付けられません。ケースカバーとしてはよく出来ています。
5,Top è il secondo che compro giusto per cambiare colore ogni tanto
5,Ottima custodia per AirPods molto comando la sto usando ormai da parecchi mesi ed ancora come nuova consigliata
2,Il moschettone si è spanato dopo 5 minuti il resto okServizio Amazon top
1,Die Hülle ist schön. Der mitgelieferte Karabiner war leider schon defekt. Nach 2 Wochen wurde trotz Zusicherung immer noch kein neuer versendet. Habe nun die AirPods verloren da sie an dem defekten Karabiner waren.Nicht zu empfehlen!!!!
5,Gut Sehr
5,Bella e comoda. Protegge bene la custodia degli AirPods perché non è scivolosa e il moschettone aiuta a non perderli
5,Great quality
5,Prodotto ottimo gancio non molto resistente consiglio di cambiarlo subito. Nonostante questo fa il suo lavoro.
5,Perfette la custodia fa il suo lavoro egregiamente. Comoda resistente e devo dire che il mollettone è molto utile.
5,Va muy bien para la proteccion de la carcasa de los auriculares ya que evitas que se rompa
5,Beh che dire la consegna sempre puntualissima il prodotto è molto comodo al tatto e si adatta perfettamente non crea problemi all’apertura per tirare fuori gli auricolari acquistato consigliatissimo.
5,Great.
5,Super pouzdro
1,Perfekt
2,Per quanto mi riguarda il rapporto qualità prezzo non è conveniente e non si illumina al buio.
3,半年ぐらいでフタのところが伸びてパカパカになってしまいました。
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Extremely flimsy!Not worth the price can’t be used as the joint has torn!
5,Molto bello il materiale in silicone resistente e fosforescente. Calza a pennello. Ottimo
5,Il prodotto è arrivato nei tempi previsti e si adatta perfettamente agli airpods. Perfetto
5,Comodo gommato si può agganciare facilmente a borse zaini o altro grazie al gancio integrato
5,Comodo calza alla perfezione ed è di un buon materiale.. lo consiglio!Spedizione arrivata con un giorno di anticipo
1,Hülle kam mit zwei dunklen Flecken auf der Rückseite an und sie ist ein Magnet für jeglichen Staub Fusseln und Dreck
5,Ottimo prodotto. Pur essendo in silicone la polvere si attacca molto meno rispetto a cover simili. Il gancio è comodo e regge bene la custodia.
5,Fighissima! Riesco a trovarle anche al buio! E poi proteggono la custodia da urto e cadute.Comodissimo il gancio puoi appenderle ovunque!
1,Trotz Prime kam das Ding 10 Tage später als geplant. Amazonpaket war halb zerstört. Minuspunkt.Zum Produkt: nichts anderes erwartet. Ist ganz süß. Ich glaube aber dass es ein Schmutzfänger ist. Bin gespannt wie die Abnutzung sein wird
5,Davvero un ottima custodia. Protegge ed è anche piacevole al tatto.
5,Il prodotto è all’altezza di quello che mi aspettavo. Comodo e carino
1,It didn’t fit over the actual AirPod case properly it was just made very badly
5,Utilissima la fluorescenza sopratutto la sera quando li cerchi nella borsa :)Il moschettone anche quello risulta utile ma non lo uso sempre.buona fattura nel complesso
5,Molto utili e la qualità è buona. Nulla da dire rapporto qualità prezzo super.
5,Come descritto. ottima qualità. Come prevedevo la colorazione del gancio si toglie dopo poco uso.
5,Bonito y protege bien .
5,Alles wie geschrieben
5,Il rapporto qualità -prezzo è ottimo .copre perfettamente la custodia delle AirPods.
5,Non molto da dire. Aderisce bene ha un bel grip io non uso il moschettone.
3,carina
5,Perfect fit
5,Prodotto di buona fattura come da descrizione.Calza perfettamente con gli airpods. Acquistato per altra persona la quale ne è rimasta pienamente soddisfatta.

5,Ideal y muy práctico
5,parfait!
5,Very good
1,The silicon case doesn’t even cover my AirPods case properly. You can tell it wasn’t made properly
2,El rojo no es el de la foto. Es un rojo intenso tipo ”Ferrari” dos días en entrenar pese a ser cliete Prime mosquetón débil cogido a una argolla más débil todavía(un alambre) y precio excesivo para ser un trozo de goma.
5,Condita

5,Molto bella esteticamente e attutisce gli urti
5,oggetto comodissimo e finalmente molto utile una bella invenzione!!!!!
1,Sono costretta a fare 1 stella. Non si può vendere un prodotto così la comodità di questa cover è proprio il moschettone. In queste condizioni perde completamente la sua utilità.
5,Calza molto bene le AirPods e ripara dagli urti. Molto comodo il gancio
1,Purtroppo questa custodia non è adatta per i miei air pods sono di una sottomarca ma il coperchio rimane aperto a molla. Mi spiace tanto perché è veramente un bel colore!

1,購入してかばんに付けていただけにも関わらず、カラビナが壊れて(ガタガタになって)付けられなくなりました。落としたり引っ張ったり等はしていません。ケース自体は気に入っていたので残念です。
1,el caparazón la tapa al poco uso deja de sujetar y se abre solo. el material es de los que te limpia todas las pelusas del bolsillo del pantalón.

5,😁
5,ottimo prodotto
5,Perfetto
1,Malgré que je respecte les critères demandés pour poser un commentaire Amazon refuse de diffuser mon commentaire je vous invite à regarder les photos elles parlent d’elle même
1,au bout d'une semaine la fixation du mousqueton s'est cassé. le boitier en caoutchouc me sert uniquement à retrouver plus facilement les oreillettes au fond du sac. sans plus!
1,aucun témoin led
1,inutile!!!
5,Nice
5,Love my little pink case! Fits like a glove & grips so well I’m not concerned that it would slip out. Handy clip allows me to clip it into my bag or pant belt  very handy.
5,Me gusta como protege siendo tan ligero y de bonito diseño. 100% recomendable !!
3,Too expensive
1,I have tried to contact via amazon and no response. Clip won't stay closed so it is not working.
5,TUTTO OK
5,Vale la pena.
5,good little protector from scratches and small falls for your AirPods case. Really snug fit feels good to touch and great for transport with the hook thingie. :D
4,Se me hizo un producto bueno pero siento que la calidad del broche metálico que trae no es la mejor es frágil y no creo que resista mucho.
2,Unfortunately the item was missing the carabiner which was described as being included within the description.
4,I love the color and how it feels to the touch but it doesn’t fit quite well. it’s a little smaller on the lid but it does the job.
5,I had previously bought a silicone case from this brand for my AirPods 3 and loved it so I got one for my 2s as well. The color is super vibrant and the silicone is soft making it easy to put the AirPods into it. Not disappointed ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,Si brilla y le quedó muy bien me encantó
5,It was easy to place and it is in good condition
5,Super good quality
3,It didn’t come with the keychain which is one of the most important parts of the case
5,Es de muy buena calidad y muy suave. La argolla le va muy bien!
5,Buen producto se ve lindo en persona
5,Es muy Resistente
3,Cute color material is smooth and easy to put on. But you get what you pay for also it did not come with the clip it shows in the picture
5,It does glow in the dark and quality is superb.
5,Muy buena calidad y si viene unida la parte superior a la parte inferior de la funda
3,Product is well made and fits great but it definitely doesn’t glow  in the dark
5,Está muy bonita y el material es bueno.
4,S’ajuste et s’enlève facilement allume dans le noir comme prévu tient parfaitement et protège. Le seul hic: les mousses et poussières s’y accumulent et collent dessus.
5,Such a nice colour! The feel of the material is really nice! I would definitely buy again
5,Very convenient to carry around. Charges perfectly and the color is just beautiful 😍
1,Unbelievable difficult to clean this product. I have bought Elago products before however this AirPods case is just not easy to clean.
5,Excelente producto y relación calidad-precio. Se siente muy resistente
5,Compre la funda para los AirPods después de haber comprado la funda del iPhone del mismo color y la misma marca. Son muy bonitas y resistentes aunque pueden ser un poco sucias. La textura es súper suave.
5,Value for money! Amazing delivery from Amazon
5,Me gustó  la calidad excelente y muy resistente.
5,Llego a tiempo tiene una muy buena calidad y excelente precio.
5,Una excelente opción para el precio muy estilizado y de buena calidad.
5,Work as described and good price! Used it for a year already and still no damage
5,I liked that it would glow in the dark a blue but not too strong. It is good for me at night because I usually can not find my case but with this case its easier to see at night.
5,Looks good after a bit of fiddling it fits perfectly and snuggly.
5,Exactly as pictured loved the pink case
5,Sono molto soddisfatto del prodotto. Ottimo materiale e ben rifinito calza a pennello. Il moschettone appare solido e resistente. La spedizione è stata super veloce.
5,Molto comoda e il colore è uguale a quello della foto
