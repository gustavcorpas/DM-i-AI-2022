5,I decided to get this system because I have heard a lot of good things about it. I wanted a system that is easy to install yourself.  It is easy. The outside view looks so clearly doing the day and at night. I'm able to control the system with an app on my phone which is a plus for me. I wish I could view the cameras on my echo show. That would be a plus if I could. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs a security system.
5,I have this product for a property that does not have Internet connected and it works really well I have it also for rental properties while they are vacant and it is a good alternative to keep them safe and then move the kit to another property
4,I have motion entry in multiple locations and camera inside and out.  Everything has worked well in the few months I've been using it.  I haven't had a need to contact them so I don't know how the support is.  Everything seems to be made of quality material and it couldn't be any easier to set up.The main reason I chose SimpliSafe is the ability to still work without a wifi connection or power outage.  I don't have anything negative to say about this system so far.  I imagine I'll add more sensors and cameras as time goes on because everything has work so well.The cost of the plans per month is very reasonable.
5,Easy to install. I had one question so I called their tech support. Best customer service I have experienced in a while. Very happy so far.
4,Was easy to setup and connect to using my network setup can check cameras using the SimpliSafe application and notification of motion detectors on my cell phone just what I required.
1,I was quite surprised at all the components I either couldn't get to work at all or had recurring intermittent problems with given all the great reviews on Amazon & independent reviews that consistently rate Simplisafe as better than Ring which I now have. I had my Simplisafe system for one week before I returned it and ordered the Ring system & in that one week I spent about 10 hours on 8 different calls to their tech support before I quickly decided that's enough of this nonsense. My original outdoor cam & it's replacement Simplisafe shipped me could not maintain connectivity 10 feet away through a door wall to my deck from the Simplisafe base station & their recommended wifi extender which I knew I didn't need but bought anyway at Simplisafe's tech support recommendation. How many people using outdoor wireless cams have a location only 10' away from the base station & Netgear $25 Simplisafe recommended wifi extender??? And even under those circumstances neither camera could maintain connectivity. That's where the pure trash comes into my headline. In addition in one weeks time my front & garage contact sensors failed 3 different times pure trash components my motion detector & remote keyfob only worked intermittently too. I don't leave many reviews anymore because I don't have the time but this Simplisafe system was so bad I wanted to warn others. When I got my Ring system I could immediately tell the components were a very noticeable higher grade. My Ring Outdoor wireless camera connected immediately & stayed connected even on my first floor when the Ring Chime Pro which is their wifi range extender was upstairs & I've had zero issues with any of the other components. The Ring system does cost about $200 more than comparable Simplisafe components & it's worth every penny. In addition the Ring system has total & surprisingly (to me) Echo/Alexa integration features I have an Echo Show 8 that if the Ring wireless outdoor camera detects motion the Echo show immediately displays the live camera instead of Simplisafe's camera view only shown on your smartphone through their Mickey Mouse app. Simplisafe is only capable of being armed/disarmed through Echo products that's it nothing more. Simplisafe makes you log in online & use your smartphone app to access all settings/features. Ring does it entirely with either online or smartphone app not both at the same time. With Ring's Pro Plus monitoring (which is only $200 a year if paid annually instead of $240 @ $20/month also gives an outstanding feature I wasn't even aware of before I just a couple of days ago got the Show 8 & Echo 4th generation Dot either of which offers this feature independently from the other. It's called Alexa Guard Plus and is included at no extra cost with the Ring Pro Plus subscription. One of the features of Guard Plus is you can say "Alexa call emergency" and seconds later a live individual is talking to you through the Echo device asking what is the nature of the emergency? and dispatching police/fire/ambulance as necessary. Alexa has their own emergency dispatch separate from Ring's. The alarm doesn't have anything to do with Alexa dispatch. That single feature alone to me is a reason to invest $200 more in the Ring system. In addition when you install the Alexa app in your vehicle you can handsfree arm/disarm your Ring alarm. And the Alexa/Ring integration has a number of other features. So in conclusion based on my experience (even all the Simplisafe tech support people I talked to were amazed I was having so many different issues just trying for a week to get their system working) the Simplisafe system is complete trash and the Ring system not only functions without a hiccup has a degree of Echo integration I find amazing. I hope my review causes anyone who reads it to buy Ring. My only criticism of the Ring system is Amazon makes it too difficult to know what accessory components are available because they're not all in one place not even in the Ring Store or as available accessories when selecting a base system which has caused me to return components I didn't need to return and miss components on my original order I wanted.
5,Only real gripe is the sound the indoor camera makes when you open it up in the app toddler hears it and stops what he's doing. :)The outdoor camera is fantastic if a bit pricey. The point of entry sensors are super easy to install with tape built in no need for screws! Work great on windows and doors!
5,Purchased the 10 piece bundle.  Installation and setup were very simple and hassle free.  Everything works as the descriptions say it should.  "Professional monitoring" for this system at $27/monthly is roughly 30% of what I was paying that other company who's name begins with the letter "V" who reneged on their contract multiple times and who's "customer service" is in Guatemala (this week).  I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and will be adding more sensors and cameras in the future.  If you've been considering a Simplisafe system purchase fear not!  You can do this.
3,The system is very easy to set up and use.  However the outdoor camera battery life is disappointing.  Simplisafe advertises multiple months of battery life between charges.  I have the outdoor camera and solar panel and still only get 2-3 weeks of battery life.  This is with the motion detection turned low and I only receive a handful of alerts.  For all intents and purposes the outdoor camera should not be considered wireless because you will need it plugged into a power outlet.
3,Easy to set up. Came with almost dead batteries in the keypad. The base receiver goes offline and can't be reset remotely. Second or third time this has happened.
5,The simplisafe system works great but it did not start off great. When I received the system the base station was not working correctly but I wasn't worried  Simplisafe has some of the best customer service.After working with their customer service they determined that I needed a replacement for the base station. The young lady that handled my customer service issue was fantastic. She made sure my replacement arrived before leaving out of town for the holidays and shipped it 2 day FedEx. She also called me the day it arrived to make sure everything was correct and in working order. The system works great now. The indoor and outdoor cameras work very well. I was surprised at how well the outdoor camera works. Motion detection is great along with image quality. System is easy to setup and I've had no issues since getting my replacement base station. System is working perfect.
5,Excellent product I love how simple it was to install
3,I love my system ONLY because it works great for door and window security!  I can RARELY access my camera when I am away from home and I was told my 5lb dog would NOT set off the indoor motion sensor. The indoor motion sensor is only effective if my dog and I go somewhere and my camera is great for selfies albeit very expensive ones!
4,Easy to setup and use. You will need to sign up for monthly monitoring to take advantage of all features.
5,A friend recommended SimpliSafe to me and I love it. Took me 15 minutes to install the motion sensors door sensors key pad and key fob. No screws needed it comes with sticky pads on the back of all the sensors! they also provide extra sticky tabs with the kit. I feel so safe with this system in my house. At the time I was in the middle of moving and currently living 2 states away I could arm / disarm my house from hours away. Love love love this system. I would 100% buy again.
5,Really great value
2,The entire system was easy to install and setup however the camera quality on both inside and outside cameras is awful. They are soso in daylight however at night totally useless. I returned and decided to stay with ring for the camera quality
1,I purchased this product based on consumer reports testing (very high) and customer reviews. What I never realized was the fact that only one person can have control of the app.I downloaded the app onto my phone assuming my husband would also be able to download the app and use his own credentials to log into and control the system. THIS IS NOT THE CASE!! He had to use my credentials and then I had to tell him the validation code that was texted to me.I thought that this was surely a mistake and went to reddit to see if others had the same issue.. and they do.I'm |..| this close to taking everything down and sending it back. Absolutely RIDICULOUS that Simplisafe didn't create a multiuser app platform. Only single people are going to use this system?It may not seem like a big deal but the system automatically logs you out after 30 days. So if I'm traveling and my husband is logged out he can't log back in until I can provide him the code that is texted to my phone. Meanwhile what if something happens and he has no access and I'm unavailable? An UNBELIEVABLE security failure. The more I type this the more I'm convincing myself that I need to send it back.I had given it 3 stars as a started to write this review but now I've changed it to one. No matter how good the system is... what's the point if the app is so lagging in basic functional features that all other systems seems to have?
5,SimpliSafe easy to setup easy to use and when you are done settling up you have a feeling of being safe and secure
5,The only complaint I have is the sticky tape on the motion sensors didn’t hold up. I had to buy something stronger.
5,I like how simple and safe the set-up was and Customer Service was there every step!!
5,So far so good. Love the ease of setup!
3,Sound so bad
5,Great tech support and customer relations and  well suited  for the uncertainties in today's world it's nice to sit in a coffee shop in a big city and be able to watch what's happening at home hundreds of miles away .
5,Super easy installation
3,all works as advertised except outdoor camera has wifi issue at least. i have it sitting with indoor camera both next to router and it doesn’t work reliably. indoor camera is fine. i’m looking for something else for outdoor
5,Easy to install
3,Unfortunately nit able to adapt to our home. You must have 2.4G and we have 5 G wifi
5,You put a sign stick in box for yard but not the sign. Why do that. Was easy to set up considering I started after I finished painting a room. A few more things to finish setting up.
2,I downloaded the SimpleSafe app and read 'should I pay for 24/7 professional monitoring'. After I read the the reasons why I should I read this [ without a paid subscription your simpleSafe security is nothing more then an automatic loud noise machine to scare off burglars if they break in].  Can't use the cameras or even the phone app for alerts . I decided to go with a $60 system that alerts my phone without a mention of any paid subscription. there are plenty of wifi cameras low priced no subscriptions to alert your phone.
5,Love this security system. So easy and quick to install. Cameras work great and can pick up even the slightest movement outside if you’re looking for that kind of security.
1,I have had the system installed for a week now but I continue to lose both outdoor wifi camera and indoor wifi camera connectivity after 24 hours. A reboot on the cameras seem to clear the issue but I am not yet confident that I can leave town on vacation and be able to count on this system. The armed blue status light stays on so be aware if you plan to put the base station in the bedroom. The installation took me two hours due to the cameras inability to connect to the wifi network. I have excellent network service here at home so I am continuing to monitor the system. This is my new home and I had very good luck with my wired Amcrest DVR camera system in my old home.  I really wanted to purchase more indoor and outdoor SimplySafe cameras but Power Over Ethernet better than these wifi cameras. I am planning to install that identical wired system into this new home but I wanted to try Simplysafe first to get an idea of the performance.
5,Easy install Great price works great optional  monitored system
1,I did not have the chance to check it how it is works because the base was already register by another one account How is possible ?? they are sell a Home "Secure" system and you can register your base devices by another account without any MFA (Multiple Factor Authentication) I made a call with SimpleSafe support and they simple answer that someone register it by mistake maybe typing a wrong number like 8 instead of B. What!!!. And that was the answer from them say and no other option just to replace the device. The cruciality here is that it is possible to register the base devices by mistake and without MFA.... Wooooow!!!So really bad :(
1,Outdoor cameras will not connect. Says “unexpected error occurred Contract support.” This system is junk and I will be returning it. Cost $800 and linking an outdoor camera is a headache. It also won’t link up with Alexa like it’s supposed to. Stay away!
1,The worse product experience I’ve had and when it comes to safety no chances can be taken. You are gambling with your family’s safety if you use this. The base goes off line and when I called support they said it needs to download firmware and won’t be working for 48hrs! The camera also stopped working so they sent a replacement. It was an incessant cycle of replacing this or that. Nothing about this system is safe! Save yourself the agony stress and most of all don’t compromise your family’s safety with SimpliSafe.
1,The app is NOT compatible with IOS specially if you’re not in the USA. So now I have a security camera set that I paid almost 450 dollars for that can not set up at home.
1,We had to recharge the outside camera every three days🙈Really not a good choice for outside surveillance!! Very disappointed!!!
4,The system was easy to set up but before buying a system with an outdoor camera there are a few things to consider.1. You will probably need a wifi range extender for the camera to work reliably. My camera worked fine while in the house but couldn't connect most of the time when it was outside. I added a wifi range extender to get a reliable connection.2. The outdoor camera is not very useful without the ability to record the activity when motion is detected and recording is only available if you subscribe to the self monitoring (cheapest) or interactive monitoring (most expensive) plans. The standard monitoring plan does not support recording so if you want video recording it forces you to either self monitor or purchase the most expensive plan.The overall system does have good configuration options so you can tailor the behavior to your specific needs. Additionally the outdoor camera can be configured with activity zones to prevent nuisance notifications for traffic passing by on the street.
4,Everything works great. The only thing is if you dont pay for the simplisafe service you wont have nowhere to store the camera feed. You have to pay for their service in order to save the camera feed.
1,The biggest thing any alarm system should be is reliable. The Simplisafe system isn’t. Don’t Buy.
5,I wanted a new security system to replace the one I had in my home.  I shopped around online and saw the SimpliSafe commercials on TV. I read many reviews regarding the pros and cons of this DIY system and concluded SimpliSafe was the right fit for me. The unit arrived nicely packaged. Installation instructions were clear and easy to understand and backed up by video help online. Paring up the sensors and cameras to the base station was a snap...all worked as advertised. The phone app is easy to use and all the system info I need is readily available on the app. I purchased a Key FOB to turn the system on and off when we leave the house to avoid "racing the clock." Be advised it has limited range...about 20 yards from the house...but it does the job. SimpliSafe offers a 30-day free trial of monitoring and I signed up. I have continued with their monitoring service at 50% less than what my previous service was costing me. I am happy with the system and recommend it as a cost-effective means to add security to your home.
5,Equipment setup in minutes.  Easy monitoring.  Camera quality is really good.  Motion detection is as advertised.  This line is very scalable.  The wireless set makes the combo easy to scale.
5,It works!!! So easy to install and works great. I love using my phone to turn it on and off wherever I am!
3,Simplisafe has basic integration with Alexa etc. However what is not clear when purchasing is that you must have a $27.99 monthly subscription for the integration to work. Very misleading.
5,So far so good. Currently in my personal trial period before canceling existing expensive monitoring alarm system. Had no problem installing.  SimpliSafe seems to have very flexible monitoring options at some very good pricing points to select from. Very impressed overall so far.
4,This is great for peace of mind! While I've got a doorbell camera I wanted more of a whole-home system to give me some reassurance and this is great for that. It comes with 10 different pieces so you can have security throughout your home and I love that it's all one system that communicates together. Setup is relatively simple and you've got some nice options. There are minor things that bug me occasionally but this is a good system overall.
4,I've tried a few systems and this one was fairly easy to install compared to the others. Works as it should. Nothing super amazing but it does the job. Cameras have usable definition- you can make out faces with them. The alarm hasn't had any false alarms. Overall it's a good budget setup!
5,This SimpliSafe 10 Piece Wireless Home Security System with Outdoor Camera provides something that very few products can which is the peace of mind that you and your family are made just a bit safer than you would be without this protecting your home and loved ones.Will this stop someone who is set on entering your home to either harm you or steal from you? Certainly not and very few products outside of firearms or other lethal forms of protection will. But this and all security systems work as a deterrent so that an opportunistic thief or would be home invader will think twice and consider whether it is worth the risk.I find this to be not only an effective deterrent but also an effective source of information for different things going on around your house I had a friend staying with me and in the room they were staying in I would be alerted to an entry sensor and motion sensor around the same time every night. When I asked him about it he told me that he was going outside to smoke before going to bed which is fine since we're both adults and are free to do as we wish but also made me think better of my friend because he was being honest I know since the outdoor camera was able to corroborate his story.The cameras aren't as good as my personal favorites (Wyze Pan Cam) but they are more than adequate simply because they are clear and can alert me to motion better than some other cameras I've tried. I will say the night vision is particularly good and has better range on these cameras but since I had IR lights installed to provide clearer lighting for my previous cameras the benefit wasn't as noticeable until I turned off the additional IR lights. There is an additional night vision mode but I haven't used it other than to test it out because of how quickly it drains the rechargeable battery.I use a mesh wi-fi setup in my home and after reading reviews that mentioned spotty connections I was sure to move a mesh node closer to where the outdoor camera is installed and I haven't had any issues with dropped connections outside of once when the power went out which required a reboot that solved the connectivity issues. I did have to separate my 2.4 and 5 ghz networks since this is only able to connect to 2.4ghz.One thing I wasn't so jazzed about is the fact there is no way to save video files locally either through a DVR or even a microSD card both of those features would be hugely appreciated for people like myself who already have a cloud storage and home server set up that could do the job without having to pay an extra cost for service to SimpliSafe for cloud storage.Overall I'd say this is the best consumer security kit that can be setup and installed without a professional installer and provides a robust and unmatched level of security and flexibility that no other system can really match yet. I highly recommend this set up and it is an excellent value for all that you get in this kit. 5/5 stars.
5,SimpliSafe has sold components of an indoor security system since 2014 but only recently (fall 2021) added outdoor security cameras and one of those cameras is now included in this SimpliSafe kit.SimpliSafe's new outdoor camera works in conjunction with a SimpliSafe hub. The hub is included in this kit along with four door sensors two motion sensors a keypad an outdoor camera and an indoor camera.The price of the kit is currently $385 but the outdoor camera alone is currently $170 on Amazon so the kit's contents are considerably discounted from the individual item cost..SimpliSafe is the Wirecutter consumer review site's highest rated homeowner-installed security system. Though SimpliSafe offers a variety or relatively inexpensive monitoring plans you do not need a monitoring plan. However if you want stored access to video you will need to spend at least $10/month for a video storage-only plan. SimpliSafe monitoring plans run from $10/month for nothing more than thirty days of online storage for video from up to five cameras to $15/month for 24-hour monitoring with contact first to you then to emergency services including a cellular connection in case wifi goes out to $25/month for an interactive plan which includes monitoring and and unlimited recordings for up to ten cameras and the ability to control your system remotely. The interactive plan also allows the monitoring service to view through your indoor camera to see if there is an actual emergency before calling police of fire in order to reduce false alarms.I won't comment more on the hub or the monitoring service at this point since it's been around for some time and is well-reviewed in many places. But the video cameras are new so here are my thoughts on them:1) You can't use your NAS to store video from these cameras. They connect wirelessly only to the hub via 2.4ghz wifi. The SimpliSafe cloud is your only storage option.2) Camera comes with a Li-ion battery inside which powers the camera for 3-6 months before needing recharging and is easily removed for charging.3) Wide 140-degree field of view.4) 1080p5) IP65 rating--sealed against dust and water jets6) Good motion detection. Able to define active areas.7) Two different night vision modes. One is the standard IR black and white which lights up to 30 feet away. The other uses a spotlight to capture color views up to ten feet away--though this one eats up battery life much more rapidly.8) Video can be watched (real-time only) from the phone app without subscription.9) Well-built camera. Camera attaches to a nub/platform attached via a screw to your house by magnet. Use it outdoors and you will want to put it up high so that the camera isn't just stolen10) Camera is charged via a mico-USB cable. Can also be attached permanently to power via a micro-USB cable. SimpliSafe sells a 25-foot cable for such use. An optional solar panel recharger is also available to be mounded near the camer.Now a few negatives:1) Connections can be spotty and problematic. Need good wifi.2) Five-to-six hour recharge times.This is a good system. You need to decide if you want to run storage through an NAS or pay for the cloud. If you're willing to pay for the cloud this is the system you want. If you have a NAS and want to store video there look for another system.
4,FAST FACTS:PROS: Easy to set-up great app lots of different sensors available awesome tech. supportCONS: Outdoor camera is glitchy.DETAILED REVIEW:SimpleSafe's 10 piece security system comes very nicely packaged and protected.  The instructions (both printed and in the app) are straightforward and easy to understand.  The sensors apply using 3M Command strips and are easy to place and remove when necessary.I placed the door / window sensor on each of my exterior doors.  The type of trim around the doors doesn't matter as the sensor does not need to line up perfectly but just be within 2" of each other when closed.  The motion sensors I placed in the upstairs hallway and the dining room.  The indoor camera I placed in the living room and the outdoor camera I placed on the corner of the house.  The keypad I placed by the door to the garage.  Lastly I placed the main hub in the kitchen.The app walked me through adding each sensor to the system and it took me about 1 hour to get everything up and connected.Once up and running the system is very easy to use.  You can arm it in HOME mode which monitors the door / window sensors but ignores the motion sensors and indoor cameras.  You can also arm it in AWAY mode which monitors all sensors.  The app will send you push notifications and / or text messages when it is armed / disarmed or there is activity.The indoor camera has an automatic shutter that closes when in HOME mode or OFF mode to protect your privacy.  The indoor camera maintains a reliable connection and has great picture quality.  The outdoor camera however has many connectivity issues.  Sometimes it won't connect to the system.The keypad is easy to use to arm / disarm the system.  You can also do the same with the app and Alexa.I had to call tech support when I ran into an issue with one of the door sensors and I was able to get through quickly and the rep. was helpful and friendly.All in all... a great system but it's not perfect.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 1. Setup is very easy that is absolutely true.2. I am taking advantage of the one free month of professional monitoring to see if it feels worth it. If I was in an actual emergency situation with a break in having no professional emergency response seems kinda pointless so I am giving it a try. I have done research on this company before choosing this system. I had already decided I wanted to try it out and was hesitating pulling the trigger. I am using the simply safe app exclusively and I'm already thinking of adding a few different sensors to the suite like temperature or wetness.I havent had connection issues as of yet. Whenever I want a live feed I can get one in about 30 seconds. The resolution is moderate i have it on the moderate setting and I could put it on a higher resolution but I don’t this this is the most clarity in a camera possible probably limited by it being wireless. There is a couple seconds lag in the broadcast but I can talk through the camera no problem.  I am still trying out the system but so far I like it.All modes can be customized-Home mode- just windows and door sensors are armedAway mode- all gadgets are armedOff- none armedUpdate- 11-20-21Having some issues with the outdoor camera. If it’s sitting unused for a while with no motion triggers it seems like the camera goes into deep sleep and basically doesn’t wake up. I was flailing in front of it and getting no motion alerts. After waking it up with the app it started giving alerts again but this is obviously a problem. During the night the camera connection dropped all together and I had to wake it about 4 times before it responded.9/11/22I am paying for the professional monitoring. Once when I walked my dog in the morning not thinking about it I set off the alarm and the police actually came within minutes. So yes this really works in this response can be very fast.  the problems I was having with the outdoor sensitivity of the camera seem to have been rectified by software updates. I think that there has been three of them since I bought the system.Occasionally I get false alarms on the outdoor security camera usually caused by some kind of shadow. Twice I have gotten false alarms on the motion sensors inside the house and there’s definitely once was caused by a pet but another time was unexplained.
4,I ordered this ten piece Simplisafe Home Security set for basic DIY home security. The set includes four door and window sensors two motion sensors an indoor camera an outdoor camera base station and security keypad. I attached one of the sensors to my front door and one to my patio door and the app allows you to set a chime when those doors are opened. Next I set up the indoor and outdoor cameras which were also very simple with following the in-app prompts. The indoor camera is wired and performed flawlessly while the outdoor camera runs on battery and has had minor issues with the camera disconnecting and not detecting motion although this is not an every day occurrence.The setup was an absolute breeze compared to some of the more old-school security systems all done through the app I used the Android version but it is also available for iOS. Setting and turning off the alarm is as simple as can be which is possible through the app or the included keypad. There are three modes off on and home which will trigger the alarm in different intervals of time (you can also tweak this in the app settings).One of my bigger disappointments is the functionality of the system if you do not pay for a monitoring or camera plan. The basic functionality will work but for example you can not view recorded video unless you watch it live the system offers no on-board storage. Overall this is a great system that was easy to set up and offers tons of room to grow with additional add-on sensors and accessories. I just wish that it would offer more with the free version.
2,One door sensor it says device not responding and another says the door is open when it’s not. The base station is very close to then and they are installed correctly. Started doing this after the 3rd day. it was fine and we didn’t change anything. 20 percent of the battery on the outdoor camera is already used too. I’m sending it back.
5,This is the best security system without having fees or contracts that I have come across. I have tried 2 or 3 other systems and the door sensors are worthless or the window sensors will go off even when nothing happened. It makes for a stressful experience when you are away from home. Since installing this I have had no false alarms and it is extremely responsive when the sensors do go off during testing. The SimpliSafe app is also well designed and does not have too many bugs that I have noticed at this point! I would highly recommend this it is a bargain for everything you get in the box!
5,Please read before buy.I am using Ring system in my small store. So I tested this system in my house.Honestly speaking there is not much difference between these two systems. Instillation is very simple and convenient. I have been using it over a month without any issue.The thing that satisfies me the most is the camera. It recognizes people clearly even at night. And it never bother me with wrong motions.After a month of use the camera in my backyard corner still has half of the power left. SimpliSafe KeyFob is very easy to use. Basically I use this to operate system. The door sensors do the job well and stay well ( my ring sensors are easy to drop)The plans:$10/month for  a video storage-only plan$15/month for 24-hour monitoring with contact first to you then to emergency services including a cellular connection in case wifi goes out( I use this plan）$25/month for an interactive plan which includes monitoring and and unlimited recordings for up to ten cameras and the ability to control your system remotely.Here are some installation suggestions.Please make sure your network signal is strong enough before you buy it. If it is not strong enough I suggest you use a bridge. Otherwise the outside camera will not work smoothly. You can first use your mobile phone to test the network signal at the place where you want to install it. Below 3 bars you need a bridge.Put your base in the middle of the house to ensure that each sensor is within a reasonable range. If your house is too big you may need two bases.Please don't forget your password. If you can't tell them the correct password they will send the police over. The police will charge after the first 3 visits.
5,We had one of the big name companies install a basic security system in our house 10 years ago but rarely use it. It really only monitors the doors and doesn't include any video - yet the monthly cost is exorbitant.  I'd seen ads for SimpliSafe and decided to try it out.  It was very simple to set up!  Even better though is the customer service. There was no "hold" time and my call was answered by someone incredibly knowledgable with the product easy to understand and extremely friendly.  It was so fast and easy to get all of what I thought were stupid questions answered!  I felt much more confident about my system after talking with the representative too.  10 stars for customer service!We've been using this now for about 5 days and have been very happy with it. The alerts work great.  The only tiny issue I've had is that my front door camera is a little too far away from my router so we're going to have to put a repeater in closer to it. Occasionally my internet service drops to the door camera and I can't open up the live view for a minute or two until it is able to reconnect.We are super happy with this though and will be ordering a couple more parts (smoke detector and another indoor camera or two) and then will be cancelling our big-name service.The cost of the SimpliSafe monitoring is definitely affordable for even the most expensive level of service -- which is still nearly half what I'm paying for just door monitoring with the big-name service!  Plus you can add up to 10 cameras and more sensors without adding any extra monitoring cost unlike some other camera monitoring services.We're super happy with this SimpliSafe setup.  This particular box came with a really good amount of basic sensors and cameras for any average size home. We definitely recommend this!
1,I tried to cancel order half hour after I ordered it . Great price lighting deal . Never opened box
5,This is my experience with SimpliSafe without paying for the monitoring service. I like the variety of elements that come in this kit including the base station durable remote cameras sensors and motion detectorsIt was very easy to set-up by firstly choosing a centralized location for the base station (the white vertical device). Using the app allows you to name your device locations (family room front door etc). and it walks you through how to set-up each component—very easy process.The wireless outdoor camera needs charged before use but it was easy to install on the house as long as its within your wifi range. The magnet mount is neat so the camera can move at any angle for your best possible view.I like being able to arm/disarm the alarm from both the app and the keypad. The alarm sound itself isn’t piercingly loud but it’s definitely noticeable attention-getting and threatening for anyone trying break in. When the alarm goes off I get a push notification on my phone making me aware to check out my cameras and see what’s going on (like when I come home and forget to disarm it first) whereas if you paid for monitoring you’d get live assistance from the company as part of your service.One thing I couldn’t figure out was the Alexa integration but that’s not a huge deal to me so I didn’t mess with it any further—just worth noting from my experience.Overall this is a 5-star product considering the quality-made components excellent camera pictures ease of use and quick-acting alarm (it’s very responsive to motion when it’s on guard). It’s a great choice for securing your home.
1,We've owned this system for 2 months now. Where do I start?1) Our camera drops offline constantly and our extender has to be rebooted each time before we can get it back online. I have to check it constantly to keep it operational.2) The battery on the camera doesn't last very long.3) Support is weak. The reps are not trained well and currently I am waiting over 30 minutes to get a rep to help me with my camera problem. Again.4) It lacks basic features like automatic arming and multiple user profiles.My daughter is very happy with her Ring system.
1,Simplisafe is simply garbage. The system is easily tripped and the monitoring center will happily call the local authorities to your place to verify if something happened.As great as that sounds if nothing happened then you’re likely to get fined by your county for a “False Alarm” fee. In my opinion it should NOT be this simple to dispatch police without permission and if there’s a better alternative to this setting that should have been better highlighted during my setup process in-app. Or at least help us be aware of the risks associated with more high security options for the system.I got fined twice: once for my pets while i was away (despite putting the motion sensor high as instructed) and another for one of my visitors who entered my unit earlier than I anticipated when I was at the movies.And get this: Simplisafe also failed to let me know that I had to register my system with the county. This requirement varies by location but it should be important to have new customers be aware of this first (if it applies) before allowing them to set up the product. Otherwise you end up paying $200+ in fees which is a costly “mistake” & makes this a more expensive investment than Ring.I called recently to sort this out and was told initially that I can get paid for my false alarm fee. Then I get told that by their criteria what I described was a “user error” (Which is a polite way of saying “it’s your fault”) and that they will decline my request for reimbursement.I cancelled my subscription despite getting 3 free months of my Elite subscription plan but I declined it knowing that I’d basically be paying for a live surveillance system without dispatch. This is free from what I understand.Don’t bother with this company and their system. It may be the more affordable option but when it comes to good ole’ customer service and helping you in times of need they just blow you off give false promises and punish you for their terrible product experience.
5,This system was easy to set up and includes everything that my old security system had.  I had a security system through my cable company.  This takes a bit to get everything installed and going but once I got everything in place it was easy to activate it.  It comes with all the pieces that you see in the listing.  The ones I wanted the most were the window and door sensors.  I like the inside camera and it works well.  The outside camera works well too but it has some lag to it.  I am happy with it so far.  It works exactly how I had hoped it would.
5,Simplisafe is a well respected brand and one of the first companies to develop an a do it yourself security system at a reasonable price. This kit comes with 2 motion detectors the keypad their newest base unit an indoor camera an outdoor camera and 4 door sensors. Of course Simplisafe offers a litany of other add ons and sensors you can add to this set but this is a pretty darn good start. I am particularly impressed with the outdoor camera. It produces high quality images even at night. It senses motion and it allows you to speak to someone in front of the camera. Very solid! Unfortunately as I write this the outdoor camera is on backorder and not being sold individually and I need one more. All in I was able to install the entire system in about 45 minutes. The Simplisafe app makes the whole thing a breeze. You don't need to buy it but Simplisafe gives you the option to have remote monitoring like a more traditional security system. The best package costs $25 a month with no contract. I would love to see integration with some of the more popular home integrations like Google Home for instance but it isn't available at least currently. For just over $300 this system is an inexpensive easy way to get some peace of mind and added security. Their add ons seem to be reasonably priced as well. Recommend!
5,Overall this has been easy to use and effective and we feel comfortable with this product.
5,The best thing about SimpliSafe's defense system is that it is very easy to set up No drilling or wiring required.you need to use half hour to configure and set up customer support is great and instructions for use are provided.  Another advantage of SimpliSafe is that it is a fully configurable system. If you think you need a camera you can easily add one to this system and you can also add additional sensors!Whether you pay the recommended 24/7 monitoring service or just decide to use it only as a scare-away-burglar device it is a great system.
5,This is a wonderful set. I am replacing my old Arlo and Wyze cameras with SimpliSafe. It's going to take some time getting used to this new system but I can already tell it's a bit more advanced than my previous equipment. I love that everything is bundled into one. I'm a fan of the app (I feel like the Arlo app has gotten worse over time so I hope Simplisafe doesn't do that). And the door sensors are wonderful also. Overall this set is a winner.
5,I’m really pleased with this system so far. The extra sirens can also be used to hear door chimes and more. Easy to set up instructions are detailed and logical. The cameras are of great quality. You don't have to purchase a plan you can use the whole system as is. Great customer support. No regrets.
1,My biggest regret and purchasing the system was not reading the reviews online first because it has not worked properly since the moment it was installed. I’ve been working with customer service for mom and they keep sending replacement equipment but all of it is still faulty. And when the alarms go off they don’t know how to properly disable them so we keep getting visits by the local authorities. This was the worst purchase ever made in a security system
2,Most systems have cameras that include a SIM card to record videos and most up to 24hrs so that an event can be reviewed. The Simpli safe camera gives you a notification however by the time you receive it the event is quite often over and you don’t know what happened. This is designed so you will purchase the monitoring service for a fee.If you don’t want the extra fee for monitoring I suggest getting another camera many of which are just as good and give you the aforementioned capability.
1,Upgraded five months ago to this new generation system. Cameras do not stay connected and if you connect one of the exterior cameras up to simply saves on solar panel it will immediately fry the camera. Connectivity with the sensors is completely hidden mess as well as the notification center calling you with any issues. Do yourself a favor and go through a DT or another reputable company. This system exists only to make you think you have security. What it actually does is create a tremendous liability.
2,We are currently using another monitoring company for our home but wanted to check out this system to compare the two. I will definitely be sticking with our current company (COVE) because these outdoor cameras are absolute junk! The motion detection works less than half the time and it takes forever to wake up the cameras. Design wise they are nice but they definitely need A-LOT of work. Overall I wouldn’t not recommend this system if your mainly looking for outdoor monitoring.
5,I got my SimpliSafe wireless home security system yesterday. It took approximately 1/2 hour to get it up and working properly. I never knew something could be so easy! This is a true wireless system. No need to wire each camera to a power source. Now I can forget about those expensive equipment and monitoring fees that I have had for the last 3 years! That's what I'm talking about!!
5,Having terrible trouble getting wi-fi to work but system is working otherwise.  Got to go to Teck support.
5,Setup was extremely easy! All good and works fine. The only issue is that the outdoor camera takes a few tries to connect. But it always captures outside movement.
5,it is as "simple" as the ads say it is to install
5,Many power outages in my area which makes the system inoperable.
5,It works as needed.
