4,They are what they are. I am very careful with my cords and they seem to last twice as long as the rest of the families cords but they still don't hold up very well with daily normal use.  They're basically like every other cord out there or that you see at the local gas station super store but at least they're priced half decent on Amazon as opposed to at the gas station.  You can get the 5 pack for what you'd pay for 1 there or at a big blue box store. I have never bought a higher priced higher quality charger cord and that may be why I just assume they're all junk.  I di know Anker makes good products and my boy Cory at Aquarium CoOp is gonna come out with his own built to his specs so I'll probably buy up on his cause I know he'll at least source decent materials and they'll be as earth friendly as they possibly can be. I know he likes Anker products so I imagine it's gonna be as good or better for a bit cheaper or at the same price point.  Check him out if you happen to read this review and are also into fishkeeping.  Great YouTuber businessman all around down to earth good hearted dude. Even pays his employees a liveable wage of 20 bucks an hour to start and provides benefits. Not bad for working in a retail fish shop.  He's much bigger than that but that's where he started and he honestly loves the hobby and does so much for people to enjoy it successfully.
5,I go through these things with some regularity but these are holding up very well. I am on my third cable in a year which I consider completely acceptable especially since one of them met its demise due to a cat gnawing on the usb end of the thing and my stepping on and bending the other.  Cable number 3 has not had external damage (yet) and is fine so far... :)I have two left in backup so that should get me through another year...and then I will reorder another package of these.
5,My Samsung chord was on its last leg after about 2 years of use and I couldn't get a consistent charge. I honestly got these cables because of the colors and they don't disappoint in real life. They also support fast charging (tested by attaching to my official power block and successfully fast charging my phone and tablet). 10/10 recommend.
5,They came quickly! I like that there are a lot in one pack and the variety of colors is nice. It charges well no complaints. I only wish I ordered a longer one.
4,and I hope it doesn't play out negatively long run... They're very tight to plug into both a  charge block and the C port in the phone. I'm  hoping it doesn't hurt my charge port long term.
5,I like these cords alot. They are well worth the money. I feel like they charge at average speed. I would definitely buy these over any expensive charger.
5,My son always breaks our charging cables so I got these. They work great for a great price!
5,Just what we needed. sturdy cord good charging speed. No problems look great and perform great!
5,Colors are great cords are stiff and stay bent when unwound. Outside of cord is nicely woven.Doesn't charge as fast as original cordabout 40 minutes longer to charge.
5,I have not tested them for sturdiness conductivity or the other thing that was stated in the star options.All of them are still working after a couple of months with no problems at all. They were nicely packaged and the colors are what I expected.Best wishes
4,Yes it does it job like it says. Do recommend it.
5,These chargers are great. Long cables fun colors and long lasting. I've purchased them 3+ times. (Sometimes lost sometimes damaged by kids). But always the ones I order again.
4,I like the charging power unfortunately it's not very durable and I have to replace it after a few months
5,Does exactly what we need. Kids like them- no straws to clean and worry about.
5,Charging cell phones. Excellent price and awesome colors!
5,Great rapid charging! I have a different color for each device.
5,My grandkids are very rough on chargers they pull the cords and they break. These are holding up great and charger fast!!
5,Overall really good
5,Great price and pretty quick charging. I needed some that were longer and these were perfect. Now I don't have to worry about moving my 1 lone charger around.
5,Very worth it
5,price
5,Get set of colored chargers. As a big family everyone's stuff is color coded so when something comes up missing - it's easy to identify if someone else took it. Loved that these came in so many colors while still being affordable and high quality. Also purchased another pack of typical chargers and a pack of USB wall plugs - all matching colors. Highly recommend! (Only one star off for charging ability because they aren't "fast charging" but they still worked great!)
5,Cables arrived quickly as described.  They feel sturdy no issue charging devices with them so far.
5,Works great. Thank you.
5,Colored cords made it easy to finds what's needed for the moment.  The mobile heads have been amazing  no more frayed or kinked cords. Less electronics waste and good charging.
5,Love the length of the cable cord it's very very durable and charges fast.  The PRICE is more than FAIR.
5,Thanks
5,Very heavy duty. Fit good and tight in phone.
4,Not much to say charges phone
5,My girlfriend frequently loses chargers so this pack will come in handy. She doesn‚Äôt mean to lose them they apparently run away. So far they work perfectly! Every time she finds them she gets excited all over again! If you love someone with ADHD you understand this perfectly. She recommends!
5,increible
5,Charging power is very good!!
5,Great cables as advertised have held up great.
5,Value for the number ordered
4,Worked perfectly for my s9 which is why I brought it but I'm not sure if the perfection last for the s22 which is what I have now.....1 day it worked the next day giving a little problems so my question is does anyone know if it works for the s22??
4,Like the longish braided cord. So far so good. Awesome fast charging. Seems very durable.Highly Recommend!!!
5,Great chargers!
5,Lasts long charges fast.
5,These cables and beautifully colored if you want to designate them for different items in the home at a centralized charging station. They charge fairly rapidly too.
5,Good charger
5,You could never go wrong with having too many chargers üòÇ strong chargers good quality üëåüèΩ
5,Broke after using for about a month
5,fast service and exactly what offered and what I got
4,When plugged in phone displays message "slow charging cable".
3,Works great for a while but then device says..you are using a charger with low charging ability. Good enough for kids to use for a bit the ends end up showing wire eventually
5,Nice
5,Works well for fast charging but not very long! After a few weeks this one usually gives up and only normal charging is possible. Love the colors and cords! Never any problems with them besides the side were it connects into the phone becomes loose or looses consecutively after a few weeks.
5,For the cable I was using. Plenty long enough and solid connectors.
5,I love these USB charging cords.  They're still going strong.
5,My kids keep taking mine.. so I order these and im never without :) fast charging!
5,Just what I needed.
5,Would buy again these are just what I needed fast charging
3,These do not fast charge and break quickly.
5,They are long enough for me to use and I love the different colors. The cord is protected well with the threading outer core so it's safe around my cats as long as the cords don't get chewed. The charging is fast as well.
3,Seemed like a good deal but they are weak at the ends. They broke connection shortly after purchase. Ok if you‚Äôre doing a stationary charge but if you‚Äôre using / moving your phone (bending frequently) they do not last.
5,Great and easy to use
5,Ive had to buy so many cords because my kids some how destroy them so fast but these have lasted the longest! Definitely recommend these for anyone with kiddos that get a bit rough with cords!
4,These chargers work great for however long you happen to get out of them. Two chargers stopped working after a few weeks. One charger only works if you plug it in a certain way. The other two work fine for now.
3,It does work for fast charging as I expected but it works as intended.
5,I bought one set of these when I purchased a new vehicle (with too many usb charging ports) and they have been fabulous so when I purchased a power bank so that we can all charge our devices in one location and needed new cables these were my first choice!
4,Does the job
5,I am very pleased the length is enough to go from the plug to my bed so i can rest with my Phone while it is charging.  Cable feels very durable. Recommended!!
5,I hope they are very sturdy I can't keep my kitten off them lol.
5,This buy was perfect! I put one in every room and the length is terrific! I have a plug far from my bed and now I can roll around and sit up in bed if I need to with this charge chord being so long! TERRIFIC
5,I knew what I was ordering and these are pretty decent quality. I like the length
5,Great product nice colors. Fast charges my Samsung Galaxy Note+ phone just fine. No issues at all.
5,These fit many items that need USB.  Very handy to have around. Durable.
5,Nice colors
5,I had got some like this before and with in a few weeks it was broken. These ones have been holding up great. And I love that it comes with so many.
5,After several months these are still holding up and work good! No complaints.
5,Work wonderful and different colors. Sturdy cord fast charge and great value
4,These are perfect chargers. The knitted style cable makes them extremely durable.
3,Okay
3,4 of the 5 chargers I received a month ago no longer work.Charged my phone very slow.
5,I like the assorted colors and length! So far they have met my expectations!
3,One of the 5 cords stopped working in less than 3 weeks. Another cord right out of package wouldn't fast charge (tried multiple power boxes). Left with 3 cords that are doing ok. Wi update if further issues
4,Every cord in this oack has gone to needing played with to get to charge after few weeks they get bent in same area n stop charging when cord is plugged in to get power to reconnect need to move it around till starts charging again have gotten better from 1$ cords except in length
5,They work great and last for a good while.
5,This is a great charger for those who need  a quick charge. Does really well with my Android.
5,Good quality
5,Can use my phone while it's charging without bending my cord.
5,Seems to be pretty good
4,Works
5,This was a great product for the money.  Giving some friends it for a gift.
5,No issues fast shipping and charges my devices. They last a decent amount of time and hold up
5,We have 3 dogs. The oldest and the middle like to walk by tables and knock things off with their tails. The youngest is still a puppy and thinks my charge cords look like threats that must be destroyed. 3 months in with these cords and they are still working great. The youngest has tried her best to get one but we've managed to catch her right away so far. We do not have even one tooth mark where the coating on the original cables would have broken. Highly recommend for that durability alone but the fact they are so long is very helpful.
5,I've had a lot of problems with other cables getting hot breaking easily not charging quickly or at all... these have been really good so far. They charge quickly have held up in my travel bag and I like that they are longer than other cables - some hotel rooms have limited charging ports and outlets making it difficult to keep the phone within reach. These cables make that less of a problem. Pleased with my purchase.
5,I cannot speak to their durability too much as I've only been using them a few weeks but so far so good and the multi-pack makes me not too worried about how long they will last as I have spares. I have found this style of braided cord charger to be more durable than the standard kind however.
5,Fantastic colors and strong cord. Long enough to stretch across room and strong enough to pick up phone by the cord when attached.
5,I've ordered these a few times. My kids break chargers all the time and this has been my go-to for ordering new chargers
3,I was happy and sad to see the charge connection on my new Samsung phone was changed to one that is oval.  No more fumbling with the cable in low light to match the flat side to flat side.  The bad news is I needed to buy a few more cables to mate with my USB wall chargers and the phone's new port.  If you are in the market for colorful and long cords to charge your phone these are for you.  If you are OK with agonizingly slow charge times these are definitely for you.  To charge my new Samsung phone from 25% it takes close to 3 hours.  With the cable that came with the phone under one hour.  I thought having longer cords would be helpful.  Wrong.  They get in the way no matter where they are.  Sadly these are destined for the garbage.2/4/21 After purchasing another set of cables for charging I came to realize the cables reviewed here may not be at fault.  The new cables provided the same prolonged charge time which could very well mean the wall plug adapter with standard USB connection might be the bottleneck.  Mea culpa.  The question is whether the USB-C connection on both ends is the way to go versus these cables and my old USB-A adapter.  Looks like I will throw some more money at this to get it right.
3,Work well for a couple months then begin to twist and unravel by the ports messing up their function.
5,Love these cables. The colors are bright and oh so pretty! I feel pretty oh so pretty! Okay so the purple cable has light blue metal thingies that don't really match but who cares?! Still pretty. Did I already say these are pretty? Love the variety of colors and the length. I now have these in combination with the fast-charging blocks in all my computer/travel bags and in various places of my home. Nice product and I'd buy definitely buy again/more . Gitchur own!
5,Sturdy and durable charging cables great colors also thanks!!
5,I love the chargers..they pretty decent size and they work for me ..i recommend
5,The color helps you spot them easier.  They are rather sturdy and charge quickly
5,Good product
4,For the price it's not a bad buy at all. Wish it was a bit more durable but happy with it overall.
5,It was a good deal
5,Definitely worth the money. I've had them for over a year and they still work great
5,Good buy
5,Good for the price
3,The charger cable looks great but most of them in the pack do not work well. They charge extremely slow or they don't charge at all. I've had only one last for almost a year.
5,Good quality ! My dog wasn't able to chew through these ! Super happy with them!
5,Overuse good and charge fast.
5,The length is great.
5,These cables are great! They charge my s20 note quickly and are a great length. Great buy!
5,These chargers are great I got them September 2021 and it's now February 2022 and they all still work and in great condition. Very happy
5,Clear information abt fit.
5,These chargers are great.  They charge efficiently and are durable.
3,Slow charging
5,I have used these cords everywhere. One for the car kitchen bedroom living room and work!
5,Handy bought to replace old cables and for extra in go back charges phone and games surprisingly fast holding up well in outdoor studio
5,Great product durable & good colors
5,I was skeptical about this when buying‚Ä¶wondering if our iPhones would give us an authenticity error for accessories‚Ä¶but they‚Äôve been working for about 6+ months without any issues‚Äîeven the 10 foot wire. Also no one is debating which wire is theirs due to the variety of colors. Great purchase.
5,The cords are thick and seem to be made well.
5,I waited to use them for a while before commenting in them. For myself and my family these have been very useful. They work as well or better than other cables we have purchased only they're longer and far more durable than the others. Myself I'd prefer just a solid black color but other than that I'm very pleased.
5,I bought these for my whole family each person got to pick thier color and it works with our Samsung phones perfectly. We clean out ports out regularly but still get error messages all the time about slow charging with other chargers. Not so with this one other than the original cord samsung sent this one is the only one that has worked perfectly.
5,Its a very cord last for a long time
5,It charges fast!!
5,My phones are finally charging.
5,Great purchase charges fast
5,Good quality - fits well solid build nice length
5,Everyone has their own color no more missing chargers or disputes over chargers. Great length.
3,They're definitely not bad. They're long and help hold a charge. The USBC tends to bend after some time but it definitely takes some time to get to that point.
3,The power cords stopped working about a couple month use. Very frustrating. Having to replace cords yet again. Going to go with a different brand.
5,I was pleased that these charger cords truly are vibrantly colored.  They fit well in our androids and the charging is very speedy!
5,When you have 5 kids and they all use the same kind of charger. What do you do???? Buy this pack of charger cords!!!! No more fighting or thefts since they are color coded!!!
5,Very thankful for this product because my factory charger was no longer functional.
5,I bought these for every room in the house  They charge fast and are sturdy.
3,My brand new phone put on the charger for 9 hours and it's only 97%  one of them quit working completely already and the rest take 12 hours to charge your phone
4,It's weak though as far as quality goes the wires and pieces  bend so easily I dont see them lasting long at all
4,cables are well built. no complaints so far.
5,They're very sturdy can reach to the back seat of the car and middle of the van. Pretty colors and charges pretty rapidly
3,I like the long cords and they are colorful. They work at least so those are the positive things. However this is the second time I have bought them and they are not fast charging as claimed. I have a large battery so it still takes awhile to fully charge but my phone will tell you if it is turbo charging. It is not. My turbo charging cord that came with phone charges it in 2 hours. These take 4 to 5 hours. Yes the wall charger is a turbo charging piece. It's the one that came with my phone so I know it is the cords. I wanted something longer than my original cord. They don't last as long as they should either which is why this is my second time buying them. It says it has a warranty but I don't know if I have to return all of them or not and a couple got stolen when I got carjacked.
5,I bought these as backup cords. Figured they would not fast charge as they are off brand. To my surprise they actually fast charge! We are very pleased with these cords and their lenght.
3,These cables are not fast charge. How do I know? Because my phone and tablet say whether a cable is simply charging or fast charging. HOWEVER seller responded to problem immediately and we resolved it.
5,Exactly what I needed so I didn't have to be tied to an electrical outlet so far so good seems sturdy and reliable
5,It works and worth the money plus plan on buying more in future because can‚Äôt have enough chargers
5,These work and have good flexibility. Durable as a braided cable should be.
5,Very  durable great price
3,Already have 2 of the cords stop charging!!  They don't last very long.
5,I like it
3,Everything is good except the fact charging part they are definitely not fast charging but I would purchase again
5,It's good to have extra charging cables. These fit all of our needs.
3,Not very flexible. Leadiing one to believe that they not very sturdy
4,I love this product and the price fits its versatility. I like the fact that it is different colors so I could give them to my children without fighting over which one belongs to them. It was very flexible and thick to prevent it from ripping and tearing apart. I could use this for many different things and it works on all my products that required a c charger. I will definitely buy again for my family.
5,Heavy Duty awesome
5,I love the length much better than the cords that come with phones. Nice thick quality braided and the length is great. Nice colors for every family member
5,Needed more then one charger so I saw these and they do what it says. Works fast and great.
3,3/5 of these were broken when they arrived. The two that worked were as expected.
5,I really found this to be a good value! Would recommend.
5,No breaking - robust
5,We use these for our Galaxy S9+ phones and they've been working well for several months
5,With 3 active teen\20 somethings in the home extra charge cords are crucial for us to stay connected. I ended up buying multiple packs so each kiddo has one in their room and in their car. Very helpful for this busy family.
5,This thing started smoking and burnt me. I can only think if I wasn't close and didn't catch the smoke. There are no exposed wires or anything
3,3 out of 5 cords did actually charge . One cord died after a few months.
5,These fast charging cables are a great value. The cables are indeed fast charging (you must use a fast charging plug to appreciate this feature). The usb-c fits snugly in my phone port. The cable colors are vibrant are 6 feet long as advertised and are durable.
3,The main issue I have with this product is it reports on my phone that it is a slow charging product that I need to use the original cord if I want my phone to charge faster and I did notice that my charge on my phone is at a slower rate using these cords.  Other than that they seem pretty decent I wish that they would charge correctly but other than that even slow I guess some charges better than no charge
5,Got them for the kids stocking stuffers they love them
5,They do the job. People who see them compliment my charger cords.
4,Great C  charger cords colors are nice too. Only thing is one didn't work üòï ( pink color) other then that would recommend
2,Works for a short time then shuts down by the phone plug always gives out.  I have had 1-3 weeks per cable breaks off at phone port
3,I bought these a little over 7 months ago and several of them have started to die already.
5,I had these charger cords a few months now before I review them. They are perfect the length is good they fast charge. I recommend them 100% especially if you have kids with the fire tablets. My 3 year old have been using it for months now and there's no slowing down on the charge or damage to the cord. All my colleagues want them so I'm in the process of ordering more.
5,No cons whatsoever I am currently using these for charging various bluetooth speakers.
4,Value for the money
5,Love the flexibility of the rope like cord as I have kiddos that are not so careful with their charging cables. I was a bit skeptical when I purchased not having very high expectations because these were so inexpensive. But they came packaged individually were extremely well made shipped quick and have worked incredibly well for us. I would buy again and highly recommend!
3,These seemed like good charger cables until we started seeing messages on our phones telling us to check the cable connection and charger whenever we plugged two of them in.
5,Every parent knows how fast kids lose or break charges right!? These charges are good quality never had any issues. They are long enough to plue behind big shelves or headboards with plenty of length left and they come in different colors so you can tell who's is who's.
3,Doesn't fast charge my Samsung Galaxy S9 - great price for 5 and charges slightly faster than typical cord but not fast charging!
5,Just what we needed.
5,Works well durable and I love the colors!
5,I feel that I got excellent quality cords that were just what I wanted for a very fair price.
5,great price
5,It's so nice to find a C charger for my Samsung.  This isn't as fast charging as the one we get with new phone purchase ..but for the $$$it definitely is welllll worth it.
2,I bought these usb charging cables in January 2022. Two months later in March one of the cables  stopped working. Now it's May and second one has just suddenly stopped working.  I'm very disappointed in this product. They  looks pretty and seem sturdy  but they don't work for long. I don't recommend these charging cables.
5,I was surprised to see the high quality of these charger cords.  I am so happy to finally not have to move my charger around and can use all of the obsolete usb port charges that I have around.  It made my life so much easier.  Also able to use in the USB port in my car without having to use an adapter.
3,Didn't work
5,These cables are durable and charge devices well! I have been using only 1 cable from the pack of 5 for over a month. Usually cables break fast for me as I am tough on them. Luckily I have 4 more in case the 1st one breaks on me. I highly recommend this product! Perfect value.
1,Yes they work fine - at first. Yes the cord itself is sturdy. They just stop charging after several weeks and the USB-c connection to the cord is not very sturdy. I bought this 5-pack in July 2021. The last of the 5 just died in May 2022. If you‚Äôre home with plenty of spares not a problem. For travel these are almost guaranteed to fail when you most need them (when you‚Äôre talking to the embassy or airline about your lost luggage and your phone is running out of power -  THAT‚Äôs been my luck with these cords). You get what you pay for I guess. But if you NEED a charger to work for more than 6 weeks and not leave you suddenly having to scramble to buy an emergency replacement do NOT waste your time with these.  I seriously do not understand the high ratings on these.
5,These survived an incident with my cat deciding they were a toy so they seem to be pretty sturdy.
5,Good price good leangtu really sturdy multicolor
3,Some of the cables were bent. I've purchased these in the past and they worked well. These came bent at the piece that you insert into the charging port.
5,They're good charging cords but when I got them I didn't get all 5 I got 4 they forgot to put the green cord in. I did contact Amazon's customer service and they did give me a credit for $3 but I did want that 5th cord. They are good cords though and my whole family likes how they can still be on their devices comfortably because they're so long. =]
5,Great buy.If you need a couple of good chargers get these ones. üòäüòäüòä
5,Sturdy.  Good quality.
5,Like the longer size as the ones that came with my phone and kindle. LOVE the new connectors as they can be connected in the dark.
5,Seem strong and material is good.  I will see if it stands up to my bfs rough using.
5,They worked well
3,Only 1 out of 5 chargers actually worked. 3 of then never worked and the other only worked for a day. The cords feel sturdy and they fit in the charging port nicely I had Hugh hopes! Super disappointed.***edited to add the company was very kind offered me a free replacement or full refund.
5,Fast charging..sturdy and excellent quality
5,These fast charge and are dirt cheap they do get messed up after like 3 months but for the price and quantity you get they are great
5,Love the colors.  Too bad it's only usable for a cell phone.  Once the cell phone is no longer in use/replaced for a new one then I will have 5 charging cables I can't use with anything else.
3,Its not a fast charger as advertised
5,This is a good product and fast charging cable.
5,They work great.
5,Various lengths for any location - car office bed side...Well made.
4,Pretty good
3,they dont stand up very well but when new they work well
5,Truly durable and definitely a great value for my money!! These ALWAYS work for us! I've gotten two sets so I can have cords in our cars as well as throughout the house. I love these cords. They are my favorites!!!
5,Brought these because of the good price and surprisingly they have held up very well. Was tired of cords only lasting a few months and after having these for a few months they show no signs of going bad. Still plugs in great and charges well.
5,If they could just make them stop disappearing (granddaughters) they would be perfect.
5,Great quality great price!
5,Love these. I use them in my car at home at work and the value is insane. I love them so much. Will definitely be purchasing this brand again.
5,I am very happy with this purchase. I love the different colors and most happen to match the colors of the rooms in my home so it is easy to keep track of them. Very sturdy design. I would definitely purchase again.
5,Love the freedom with this...
5,Excellent fast charge cords. I bought 5 for the price I would have paid for one of the cords at the convenience store. I love the colors too! I can tell which family member the cord belongs to simply by color.
5,Good tight fit into the phone and the ends are very sturdy. Been using them for a few weeks so far so good!
5,If your looking for type c affordable chargers then these are the ones for you!
5,Perfect everything.
5,use for my android tablet and phone
5,this product solved a ton of charging issues
5,Great fast-charging durable and good value for the money.  I like the multi colors for keeping them in designated places.
5,Just bought these.  Can not comment on durability.
5,so far so good
5,Liked the colors and the substance.
5,I love them because of the length and flexibility  of them.They last longer then any other charging cords we have used.
4,Very good
5,I'm happy with how these cables work - and happy with the color variations.
5,I love these chargers and they do last and the price wow amazing!
4,JUST RECIEVED THEM ONE OF EACH COLOR . HAVE NOT HAD LONG ENOUGH TO SEE HOW THEY LAST.
3,These are cheap I've had one that lasted a month while my husband has one that lasted a week. They will do if you aren't expecting long lasting quality.
3,Some of the cords worked great others didn't last very long. Overall it was worth what I paid for in the long run.
4,Love them
5,Amazing quality for the price
5,Great for the price
5,Super durable and well made. Holding up to young kids. Oh by the way... if you need anything else they look great too!!
5,Came early work great wonderful quality
2,I haven't had them long enough to know about durability or sturdiness but they won't charge my phones
5,Great durability
5,Multiple durable phone chargers at a great price!
5,Our son collects charging cords-especially colored ones. Excellent price for durable working cords
5,Just what I wanted. Cords in every room to charge the phone.
3,I love the different colors and the nice length. They do charge but I would by no means say it is a fast charge.
5,Great product! Sturdy good connection charges fast and I love the 6‚Äô length! I will buy this product again.
5,So great that they all have disappeared.
5,Plenty long.Seem strong. Cord is wrapped for durability. So far so good !
2,They lose the ability to fast charge after about a month ; then they go to very slow charging as the cord becomes unusable
5,I like these cables because they are flexible but very sturdy. I also like the different colors because it make it easier to track the cables from the device to the computer usb port.
5,These chargers are great! They are a great value and it's nice that you get a few different colors. Each one seems super well made and had no issues charging my phone tablet and connecting my Wacom to my computer.
5,I've always received exactly what was on the site  quickly and exactly what I neededüëç
3,quality is B+ but output is a solid C
5,Second time buying will definitely buy again.
2,Only 2 out of 5 i got worked out of the box refunded.
5,Great quality
5,So far so good ... although it is a little early to rate durability and sturdiness ... but they are doing what they should
5,Need more of these.
5,Great chargers they fast charge and very reliable. I bought this package for everyone at the house since we fight over them all the time now everyone has their own color.
5,Nice colors
5,Best they are really good they perform beautifully and they're fast charging I like that thank you
5,These cords are totally worth the money which really isn't that much... We now have one for each family member and a spare...
5,Love the twine. Seem really sturdy. We'll see how long they last
5,I Would recommend...definitely worth what you pay..
4,Love the different colors
2,I was lead to believe these were supposed to be fast charging. Instead they charge very slowly.
5,Great for charging but had to get a new phone right after I ordered these and they don't fit my new phone....lol!
5,Had just the amount I needed.
1,Tried three of the five cords. None of them worked..... Plugged into my charger with an old cord instantly started charging. Complete lack of quality control the manufacturer should be ashamed. Save your money and buy something else. This junk is getting returned.
5,Good quality and now no one has to search for a cord
1,I ordered these cords for our 2 cell phones and my tablet all with "c" charging ports and they only work on 1 phone. Im soo disappointed!!
5,They seem to be sturdy dont bind and have a nice fit. Me and the family are happy with them.
5,Excellent value. I love the long braided cords
5,Doesn't charge fast..nice to have one in the house car at work etc but you get what you pay for
5,I like the variety of colors and so far they seem very durable! If they don last I‚Äôll update this review but I‚Äôve only had 2 weeks
5,Charges fast nice long reach lovely colors and flexible it ticks off all the boxes.
1,The item description said these were fast-charging up to 3 Amps. My wife left her phone plugged in took a nap discovered her phone was barely charged. I used the Ampere app to measure the actual charing rate.These do not charge at 3A. They barely hit 1A most of the time. I tried all the cables in different outlets. The charging speed ranged from 490 mA to 1300 mA. Also they do not charge the same symmetrically but dependent on plug orientation. If you measure unplug turn the plug around and measure again you will get a different number.Don't waste your money. I'm getting a refund. Stick with a name-brand.
5,Good price
5,5 to a box very good purchase for the price
5,Love the colors.

5,So far so good!  Perfect lengths and loved colors can be divided amongst my children so everyone knows whose is whose.  Would buy again.
5,I would buy them again if i needed to it comes with 5 and the cords are super long and have turbo charge
5,So far some excellent micro and USB-c cables. Price cannot be beat.
2,I was really excited to get to try 3 flavors and at a decent price. To bad the lip balms weren't as good as they sounded like they would be
5,Very happy with these USB cables. Very durable and just the right length.
5,Works great and it's great that these are the longer charging cords for when you need them

1,Normally purchase these charger but this set didnt last very long as soon as we would use one it was only good for a few week and then it would stop working. Very disappointed
5,just as good as the original samsung chargers .
5,The sturdiness of the cord.
3,They only last as long as the normal ones you buy in stores. Nothing like the original cords that come with the phone.
5,Great length and durability
1,3 out of the 5 chargers have stopped working within days will not purchase again and will not recommend to others.
5,Very durable.
5,Best aftermarket charging cords around.. Very flexible and durable.. You won't be disappointed..
1,Pretty colors but junk charging cords. Definitely NOT fast charging even with a Samsung fast charging box. Barely charges at all. The worst I've bought so far.
5,Get what you pay for.
5,Worth the buy
5,These are great. Longer cord. Bright colors. Fast charge.
5,Great product awesome deal
5,Love these charger
5,Cute work great
5,Very fast charging
3,Great value but pay for what you get. My chargers all have the plastic usb portion coming off.
5,Great
1,It didn‚Äôt fit the plugs
3,Break to fast
1,I wasn't impressed right away It wouldn't connect well.
1,I thought the chargers would last much longer than they did
2,We tried multiple configurations and these just did not work.  They did ship quickly and arrive nicely packed but just did not work for us.
2,3 broke on the first 3 months
2,They are sturdy braided cables but charge your phone at a snail's pace
5,Perfect for my tablet
5,Gets the job done.
3,Cables work as expected.  Ordered a 5 pack but only received 4 in the packaging.
5,Good quality for price
5,Very durable
2,They were fine at first.... But they stopped charging after a few months of use
5,Good
5,Good chargers last a long time!!
5,Very happy with product
2,Would not charge my phone but It did charge my PS5 controller
1,Chargers stopped working quickly after regular use.
5,üëç
1,These charge SLOW. Definitely not fast charging as described. They are durable and what seems to be a decent quality cord but the power is absolutely terrible.
5,Durability
2,I ordered this for someone else but he is not happy with the product. It shows that it fast charging but it was not . It‚Äôs broke easily. But I can say may be because it‚Äôs cheaper than other may be that‚Äôs why.
1,I‚Äôve owned Apple products for over a decade and this is literally the slowest cable I‚Äôve had OEM or aftermarket. It arrived quickly it was well packaged so it‚Äôs no reflection on the seller or servicesbut the product itselfI feel like my iPad would charge faster w wire stabbed into  potato  And I know you can‚Äôt do rapid charging without the usb-C on both sides. So I‚Äôm not expecting anything other than a reasonable charge speed.  At first I thought it just didn‚Äôt seat properly. It wasn‚Äôt  the battery percentage was barely rising. I decided to use it while it was plugged in ....current charge level stayed at 21% for almost half an hourHard pass
1,These are terrible they don't charge right out of the package but because I didn't use them right away I'm outside my return window.
2,They're nice and the colors help keep the family from losing someone else's since we assigned them. They work. Definitely NOT FAST CHARGING. In fact my phone says slow charging.
2,I Want an additional fast-charging option.  This ad says fast-charging but I get error msg for charging too slowly.
1,So I have the fast charging block that came with my phone and the cable did not work at all. It just drained my battery. I was at 50% last night and when I woke up about 8 hours later my battery was almost dead even though it said it was charging. My block works with my old charger so I know its just the cables that do not work well.
1,Bought these as I needed new chargers. They're not fast charging. I can place phone on charger and charge overnight. Wake in the morning and phone will have only made it to 60%. Not satisfied
1,Didn‚Äôt last the whole pack was useless and not charging my phones within a few months of getting them.
1,Using this with a Galaxy S21. The cables charge but don't do fast charging. Also a few of them started to fail (they would only power when the cord was at a certain angle meaning the internal wiring was not intact anymore). Not happy with these at all.
2,We bought these because there were several in a package and it was a good price.  Sadly not all of them worked.
2,Needs to be more flexible at the USB so they will not break. So far 2 out of the 5 doesn't charge my phone now.
2,Mist doesn't work.  Durability =0 sturdiness =0Value don't buy won't last
1,I bought these not expecting them to be "great" but that they'd at least last a while if I took good care of them. None of them work anymore and it's only been like 2 months since I purchased them. My fiancee and I are the only ones who use them the cat doesn't mess with them. They just simply stopped working. Maybe just a one-off instance but I now have to buy more charging cables again.
1,Like half of them worked when we first got them a month or two ago. Now none work.
1,Absolute junk. More than half would not charge my phone right out of the package
2,2 of the cords do not work.
2,The cords seem durable & sturdy however they are not fast charging at all.
2,The description online said they were compatible with my phone but they are not so I am returning them.
2,Low quality breaks easily and half of them only charge on one side..
1,Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable
1,Straight out of the package and 4 chargers do not work right. Plugged one into my phone the next day i wake up and start going about my day for my notification about low battery. Went through three and just decided not to try the rest. So frustrating.
2,Several of the cords will power the phone but not charge the phone
2,Not bad for the price but these are not fast charging as advertised.
1,These look nice but after just a few charge cycles they've all stopped working unreal!
2,Takes a long time to charge
2,Only 2 out of 5 fast charge  besides that work fine
1,All the charging cords broke after a week of use.
1,I really needed these to work but none of them did
1,I wouldn't give it any stars at all.  Charged my phone as usual  the cable overheated and melted on the phone  it was impossible to remove  I had to get a new phone.
1,The top metal pieces just came right off not very good quality
1,One of the chargers was broke before I even got to use it.
1,It is not a "fast charging" cable. I have tried all of them. None of them work. They charge. But takes hours. Not fast charging. It does not pip up when I plug it in.
1,The chargesers looked really sturdy and durable nicely made. The problem was chargeing instead of charging it drained my battery. I could literally just watch the battery drain. I tried different ones from the box. They all did the same thing
1,Value is less than advertised for a fast charger.Cute but useless.  I have regular matching cords.  I paid for fast acting cords.Totally disappointed.  Waste of my time and money.
1,Don't work defective
1,Didn't  fix my flashlight emergency  radio.
1,We loved these at first but they only last a few weeks before all of them stopped working. Very disappointed.
1,Is not fast charging. Have tried In several different usb ports & plugs.
1,These work. But one of the cords began to smell strongly like it was burning so I had to throw it away.
1,2 broke the first day. One still works 2 weeks later.
1,Just opened plugged into my brand new phone and it won't keep my phone charging. Very disappointing.
1,These worked well at charging but they have ALL broke in 2 months. waste of money.
1,They slow charge or do not charge devices at all
1,They are very slow charging they are not fast charging!!!!!!
1,After 5 days all of the cords stopped working.
1,2nofnthe 5 worked. The rest work when they want. To a good value at all
1,Cord stopped working within 4 days of use!! Not worth it!! Cheap and not durable!!
1,Don't buy. These cords don't last long long.
1,First few months chargers work fine. They became defective after 3 months. Don't purchase this junk!
1,Item does not work
1,Doesn't push enough juice
1,These do NOT fast charge.
1,Not fast charging
5,Good buy
5,They have been worth the value for money so far. The durability and sturdiness seem great!
5,These work great and they were really long. They survived being chewed on by a feline. I recommend strongly.
5,These re great for our family of 4 with 5 phones. I use them to charge our Samsung Tabs iPad Pro Note 10+ and Nintendo switch. They are versatile and I just love the length. I do fear that they will eventually stop working as most with this amount of length do due to the wear and tear. however I feel like these will last quite a while. They have been great for my two children who always seem to have dead devices and want to plug and play at the same time. I initially noticed that my devices would charge quickly with these devices and I"m hoping that this behavior will continue. They seem to be quite durable and thick so I"m hoping for the best.
5,When you live in a house where EVERYONE has the same brand of phone you're constantly looking for your charging cable.  It gets old and annoying.  How do you solve the problem?  With these Teeind Charging Cables! Honestly they work great!  They charge fast and now everyone has their OWN color and ending the battle for charging cable dominancy makes these worth the investment!  I had one left over for my car as well and so now I can easily keep my phone charged while on the go!  Great quality and great price!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Pros: - 5 - 6ft long USB C cables - Variety of colors - Plugs seems pretty sturdy - Fast charging speed (charged by Samsung S20 from 12% battery to 100% in about 45 min)Cons: - Cables are really stiff which causes pressure on cords so will see about durabilityI ordered these USB C cables to have more around the house so I don't have to drag my cords around.. I can have one in different locations.  I was able to charge my Samsung S20 which was at 12% battery level and it only took about 40-45 min to be fully charged.  It may have taken less time.. That was just when I remembered to check on it.  I feel that these USB C cables are just as good as any other out there and are definitely worth the money.  I would recommend these to others.
5,Over the years I've had a lot of charging cables and while they all have worked it is the longevity that varies.  If the cable snags somewhere you might find your cable no longer works.  The best cables I've used over the years are ones like this with the braided fabric.  I strongly encourage spending the few extra pennies to upgrade to the fabric.Also I enjoy the colors.  I wouldn't say they serve any purpose but I like the look.  I'd rather look at something colorful like these than a drab black or stark white.Recommended!!
5,Like everyone else i suffer from a constant lack of chargers. I took the plunge and bought this huge set and let me tell you it solbed all of my problems lol. These are not your average low end cables no thesd are definitely fast chargers compared to the gas stations one i have. The quality seriously impressed me simply because the price is sooooo low. You get a nice color variety snd one of my fav things is ths length. They are veryy long making it super comfortable being in any position you want while your phone chargers. Buy them ghehre perfect and they shipped almost immediately.
5,I guess I'm rough on my cords because they tend to stop working after fairly short periods.  But these seem to hold up far better. I like this pack contains different colors to help identify components easily.  I will buy again if needed and can recommend you may feel safe ordering these too.
5,These are great USB C to A cords (or one could consider them USB A to C).  They're wonderful for chargers connecting to computers and are both long and durable.  The price is great for the number and length. I also like having different colors as that can help with organizing cords.  Overall very excellent cords that I would recommend to anyone needing USB C to USB A cords.
5,These braided cables are great! They look nice they work great and the braided fabric adds a helpful layer of durability. These have worked great. Very pleased.
5,LOVE these types of chargers. They all work great keeping strong super long. These are not going to be breaking anytime soon.
5,These are a great deal and have good length to them.  I like the selection of colors as well.  We were replacing a bunch of old charging cables we had laying around and these are a great replacement.  I love that they support fast-charging and they are flexible and durable.  Would definitely recommend!!!
5,I have to admit I was attracted to these  fast-charging USB-C cords because of their bright colors but they are also solidly built will last a long time.  I can charge my phone from my computer or newer charging block without having to rely on plugging into the old-style USB-A block. I love them.
5,Nice set of cables so that you can have cables in every room in the house.  Even though they are not marked as USB 3 these cables do do fast charging.Highly recommended
5,These are legit fast charging cords which is always welcome. Some "fast chargers" simply are not but have no fear these colorful and well made cords get the job done in a fraction of the time. Very impressed.
5,These make the most solid connection I've seen - primo cables. They fit the 2020 Kindle and Bose 700's better than the OEM.Much better than expected.
5,I love the multipack with different colors so each person in the house can have one and you KNOW which cord belongs to who. Good quality works well.
5,Great set for my 2 kids a boy and a girl so they both get colors they love! These work well and fast charge. I would recommend them!
5,so far I like these especially the length.  I have a new Amazon Fire tablet and a new phone both of which use these "C" type charging cables.  So this helps to be able to know which cable belongs to those items.  Plus I have been in the hospital a few times lately so the nice length will help me keep my phone charged.  And I like the different colors easy to choose from the regular black cables that charge my headphones etc that are not type "C"
5,I have free range rabbits who eat them so I go through a lot of them. The problem is the rabbits not the cords. üòè
5,They work! Decent deal for a batch of 5 and the colors are super nice! So far no issues with the cords. It's nice to have a few extra chargers around and the length is nice
5,This is great for protecting eggs and accessing them safely.
5,feels like the wire will not crack like other cables have.
2,Don‚Äôt last very long.
5,Useful for yravel
1,They charge super weak and slow and they also didn't last long I wouldn't buy these but I guess u get what u paid for.
5,Bought for brother
5,Love the different colors...cords are thick
5,Great extra cords.
5,Love these charges! Great quality!
5,Totally worth the money they are amazing!
5,Excellent
5,Fast charging for my Android.
5,Love these. They feel durable and work perfect with my Samsung phone. Just what I wanted. Good feel good size and good price. 5 stars
5,Great deal!  These work very well and the colors are great!
5,I've been struggling with the USB-C connection on my Samsung Galaxy S10 smartphone.  I got all the crud in the phone male connector.  These cables USB-C female connector connects more firmly than the OEM cable.
5,I really like these cables sturdy and an awesome value.
5,Far more better than the rubber adapters. Sturdy last lobe and charges fast.
5,I loved that the cable is long
5,The cables are long flexible and colorful. They charge my phone quickly. The colors help me remember which cable goes where.
5,Like the colors. Nice length. Great price as well. Like them alot.
5,This cables are awesome and really last much longer than any I have bought before. They also deliver to their claim of "fast charging"! I just bought this set again because my son bit the tip and destroyed 3 of them. However the other 2 are still giving me more bang for my money!
5,Like the colors. Holds up well.
5,Awesome length and charges fast. I love that they sit flat with the phone.
5,Works as expected
5,I've only uses a couple of times but works fine and have the braided shell that seems to last longer for me. Great to be able to get a bunch of them as backups as my old phone I went through cables like TP! The C -style connectors seem to be far better and since they aren't directional you can plug them in either way without thinking you had the minis the right way only to discover it wasn't  then risk damaging the plug in the phone itself internally which is why my old phone died.  I just bought these for backups  so I still haven't tested but the 1 but it's nice to have a bunch of nice long cables available at home should my originals ever quit (& I know from experience that eventually they do!)Thanks for the fast delivery and great product!
5,Really great price for 5 of these USB Type C fast charging cables. Appear to be very durable. Now we have so.e for both vehicles!
5,Cannot seem to have enough cables. Easily seen easy to find against dark surfaces. Very good quality and price.
5,Great choice..fast charge for tablets phones etc..definitely recommended
5,After going through 3 charge cables in a year I decided to try the braided ones. These are excellent! They are fast charging and a great length. I have some to share and don't need to tote one upstairs anymore. The next time I need to buy a charging cable I will buy these!
5,My phone took all night to charge. Now with this cable it only takes an hour to fully charge.
2,Cheap price and pretty but they charge super slow.
5,I use for charging my S22plus. Also the kids I babysit for use to charge their tablets
5,I was hesitant that they were gonna be decent chargers. They actually charge pretty close to fast chargers! Highly recommend
5,These work great for charging my phone quickly! 5 colors! Cords are sturdy! No problems so far
5,So many things to charge have to keep buying more cables LOL This is a good value for the money and we never run out of cables now.
5,Correct connection  but will not charge at all. DisappointingUPDATE!  ! Love the durability and colors. The length is also fabulous!
3,I got these specifically because they are fast charging but my Note 9 and my brothers One Plus 6T doesn't charge fast (I lose charge actually). But they are long durable and sturdy.
5,Great
5,Awesome for our trip. Long enough to keep kids tablets charged in the back seat!
5,I bought it because my charger died and i am pleased with this purchase!. It came very quickly and was exactly as described if I ever need another I wouldn't hesitate to repurchase these
5,Great quality. Nice length for reaching from walk to couch. Nice looking too!
5,We use these for our chelle phones & the kids chrome books. This is the 2nd time I've purchased. Since some of the kids lost theirs. Myself & my husbands charger vords lasted a really long time. I would definitely purchase these again. They are long & sturdy!
5,good deal
5,Great product great value. Quick charge vibrant colors.
2,I love colors so I really liked these cords. Each one of the cords broke shortly after use. Most from the phone dropping on the floor and the charger snapping at the port. 4 of the 5 cords all broke at the same spot while connected to the cellular device.
5,Love the length the colors and the price of these cords. Great customer service with fast shipping. Thanks!
5,Very good
5,These are worth buying if you need them.
5,bought for a new house as we had more outlets. they have held up very well so far. they charge equally well to my prev chargers. would buy again
5,Good for used for.
5,They are great for the intended purpose. I would buy them again.
5,new phone replaced all my charging cords at home work car edc go bag they work as marketed good price
5,They came in when they said it would and they was what they said it was.
5,Even though I probably have a 100 "spare" charging cords none of them fit my new Paperwhite. Of all the 1000's of choices on Amazon I decided on these AND THEY FIT!  I like the wrapped cords over plain plastic and these fit the bill. The connectors or heavy duty too. I'm very pleased.
5,These are decent to charge your phone with and I would buy again
5,This product is fantastic.  I should've bought this a long time ago.
5,They work with data transfer/charging to PC and with my wall chargers.And that's what I wanted.They are different then my Micro USB B cables I'd purchased before needing a Type C.I hope they hold up as well but I really enjoy the variety of colors.
5,I did not realize that charging cords deteriorate over time - and now with mobile companies cheaping out and making us buy our own chargers even with the exorbitant prices we pay for our new phones this set saved the day.I thought maybe my phone something was wrong with the hardware on my phone  which is only a few months old. Good price too!None of my cords were charging fast anymore. These cords immediately worked!
5,Charging cables are made wellI have no complaints
4,Oh I love this! For the past few months I've been needing a new charger or 3 and I kept forgetting to look on here and get one and I finally just bought this 5 pack and they're the perfect length that I love the different colors they offer!
5,This is my 3rd time buying these cables. They last long. I think the last time I purchased them was 2 or 3 years ago. I still have cords that work from that purchase. They do wear down after so long and stop charging. But that is to be expected over time. I also love the length of the cords. I can place them all around the house. The braided cords help them last longer. N they do charge pretty fast.
5,I've owned and purchased alot of chargers for myself and kids over the years so I can tell if they are gonna last awhile or a little and these seem good quality good length good ends and nice colors. I wish I'd found these sooner and bought these
5,These are wonderful.  My husband is constantly taking my cords to work and not bringing them back. I ordered these so that I can have spares as well as I took one to work for my desk and gave one to my son for his phone. They are very long and work perfectly. I think I'll order another pack to put away for later.
5,Very nice wanted longer charging cable exactly what I order and colors are pretty too
5,Great product !!! Very sturdy and durable.
5,We tend to go through a lot of chargers in my house so to be able to buy in bulk is awesome. The cords last for awhile will repurchase
5,Nice
5,Good quality good deal.
5,These were fantastic because we were able to color coordinate everyone's chargers. My kids love that they get their own charger in their favorite color so I rarely have to remind them to charge their tablets! Perfect for phones and tablets. I would definitely recommend this product!
5,Love these charging cords. Very sturdy and long had one for over 3 yrs and just now getting  new ones. Multipack is great i have one for just about everywhere.
5,They charge pretty quickly and I love how long they are and I love the colors!
5,Forever  losing chargers and these were perfect
5,The items just arrived yesterday. I tried them last night and they performed just as expected. Seen study and should last. If not I'll edit my review in the future.
5,Its worth it. Sturdy. And charges fast.Its worth getting. Plus got a deal on it. Couldnt surpass. My wife keeps losing them lol.
5,I love how long and fast (no pun intended) these are.The only thing it that the tip started bending after a month I take it out of the phone trying not the bend it but it seems to bend anyway.
5,Perfect
5,I buy these charger cords maybe 2 times a year... just to replace the ones that stop charging or begin charging slow.. doesn't happen happen often... but these are great cords to have around the house and to travel with.. they are speed cords so whatever your charging will be charged within 1/2 hour.  Will keep buying...
4,I wish they didn't look fall apart so easy.
3,They charge pretty fast with with a fast charger plug.. And one of them 1 of them I only use twice and and I stopped working
5,I buy these frequently not because they go bad but because they develop legs and walk away. Very fast charging (as fast as USB port will allow) multiple colors are nice too.
5,Let's face it charging cables don't last but a year or so but these cables last twice as long.They're a great value for the money too.
5,These are great so far!
1,Very slow charging and the connector to the phone is not tight. I regret making this purchase.. I would return them but I am unable to drive rite now :(!! I have to get my phone or table in a certain position seeing a connection and then don't touch even then the charge time is VERY SLOW!!!
5,I love the different colors so the kids don't steal my pink one.
5,Cables good length and nice looking solid feel - charging at high turbo charge capacity all
3,I got what I paid for very low quality
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Cell phones
4,Not the best quality but good bang for your buck
5,Works well with Motorola and Samsung fast charging just like it says
5,So in regards to my picture. Blue cable on left is this product but I wanted to show my other cable.The first day I got this product I dropped my phone with the cable in. It snapped. Not shocked but I've dropped the one on the left and never broke. The cable is fairly thin and feels a bit fragile.Will only be using it in less "traffic" areas. I keep chargers everywhere due to 6 people having phones in our house.
5,Durable and charge great!  I like they are all a different color so noone has to question who they belong to
3,I got these do to the review and the first cable with in 2 days started to flicker charging. The second one is overheating and my phone is only at 46%.
5,They work really good
5,So far so good! Upon arrival  all chargers were in working order..and still are. I'm the past  when I've ordered a pack of chargers  there was always at least one that didn't work. I like the different colors too.  It helps  the family not argue over which charger is theirs.
5,Super durable cords.  Definitely 5 star product
5,Very nice bright colors! And theres a color for everyone in the family.The cables seem sturdy and well made and absolutely support fast charging.This is an excellent value at the price.
5,Great type c cable nice quality ! Will buy again.
5,they worked good.
2,Im really happy with them .i like the lenth of it
