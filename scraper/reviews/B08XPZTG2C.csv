5,The box it came in looked deceptively small - almost returned it on sight! :)But once unpacked the unit is a decent size for home office. Operating it is very smooth - much quieter than the Aurora I've been using for the last 8+ years (RIP). The handle is a very thoughtful feature allowing much easier emptying of the container.Here's to hoping it gives me years of hassle-free service!
5,I use product for home use. Best product purchase so far.
5,Works well but is pretty loud. It’s a shredder so I don’t expect it to be quiet. Good price for this product.
4,I thought the handle on the time was there to carry it but it’s for lifting the top off so you can empty the bin.  It’s heavy to remove but other than that it is easy to use.  It makes the same noise as any other shredder.
5,Like it’s reliability no dislikes
5,This is perfect for my little office area. Not as big as my old one that wore out. Noise level is acceptable. Easy to empty. Just take off the top and pour into plastic bag.
5,Excellent design.  Smooth operation.  Top handle makes emptying much easier.
5,I have had many shredders over the years but this one is by far the best one I've ever owned.  It's very strong cuts amazingly well.  I like the "auto" feature so you can keep it on all the time.  Works very well!!!
5,It was so small compared to our old one I almost sent it back.  Decided to give it a try and wow!  So glad I did. This little shredder is amazing.  Smooth quiet and efficient.  Excellent product at a great price.
5,A very efficient unit
4,They don't mention in the description of this shredder that you need to purchase the shredder lubricant sheets.  It is suggested to use after a 30 minute shredding cycle or a couple of times a month.
5,Owned for a month and have no complaints. Not too loud capable of shredding at least six sheets at a time with no problem. Has a handle on top to lift shredder heavy but underneath is a large receptacle. Might have got lucky finding this machine out of all I looked at. Hope it lasts.
5,So happy I actually gotten this shredder. It really cuts the paper in very small unreadable pieces. I had an issue with my shredder after a mth of purchasing it. I emailed the company which information is right on top of your shredder. I even let them know I would mail the faulty one back to them and they actually responded that evening/morning due to the time difference and stated because I'm still under the warranty they'll send me a new one right away. You're under a 1yr warranty once you purchase & keep your order number & date. I received my new one within 2-3 days. Thanks so much Bonsaii
5,Of all the shredders I looked at this was the perfect one for me! I don't need to shred a ton of stuff for work  or anything and this one is perfect as it's not the most expensive top-tier thing but actually works well unlike cheaper shredders! It's a little bit loud but not in a way that's bothersome. Just in a way that you might expect of a shredder lol. Def easy to use and shreds really well. If you don't have a huge ton of stuff to shred all the time or just live in an apartment this is an awesome everyday value shredder.
5,Let it rest after 20 to 30 min.
4,This shredder is much better than the little C237-B that one didn't even do credit cards burnt it out in a week. This one much better. would have giving it 5 starts if it shredded CDs better and no issues with credit card or paper
4,It broke after about 100 CDs I spaced them out but it couldn't handle that many still got more to cut.
3,Noise level acceptable. One dislike both in the card shredder port and paper port. The triggering mechanism needs to be expanded or there needs to be several triggering mechanism.  Because often if item doesn't hit that exactly. Shredding will not commence.
4,Good for daily mail shredding doesn’t jam can reverse easy too use . For the price worth it just can’t go crazy I do like 2 folded letters at a time  prolly could do a-lot more if I bothered opening them
5,Very quiet and convenient and easy to use.
5,I have had a ton of paper to shred as I clean out my house which means when I shred I am almost continuously feeding paper into this shredder. It's not designed for this type of duty  but as long as I give it a beak after 15-20 minutes it keeps on going. It does screach at times now and credit card pieces sometimes get stuck in the credit card cutter but it keeps on shredding. It is very important to keep it oiled and I am pretty diligent about it. I would certainly buy it again.
5,shredding of sensitive personal papers
5,I find it a little noisy but bearable. It's light and easy to move around. It does what is described. Good value product.
5,Our old shredder broke and we needed one right away. This one came the next day. It's fast and doesn't jam. Only issue with it is that the cuts aren't as small as our last shredder which makes us consider that it isn't as secure but otherwise we are satisfied.
5,This shredder is amazing - it shreds multiple sheets at the same time with power to spare. It even shreds old credit cards and will shred documents with staples. The transparent view port makes it easy to see when the bin needs to be emptied.
4,this shredder seems to be very good
3,I regret purchasing this its extremely slow at shreading I have had trouble with it the second day I had it I am sure I will be purchasing a different brand with in this year sorry to say I don't recommend this particularmodel/brand.
3,This shredder clogs up easier and you can only do 2 pieces at one time. As long as your paper is not thick or you have a lot to shred it is perfect for small jobs. I would suggest getting a heavy duty for big jobs.
5,So far works well  I havent tried all features
5,We bought this shredder to replace one that got stuck. What a difference! We were surprised at the small size but when we used it “wow”. It is quiet fast and very easy to empty. The price was good too.
4,Shredding many old documents and other misc. Material.
5,Does a better job than the one I have which costs three times as much like.
5,I like that ideal that I can use it for all types of shedding the see through panel and the size of the shedder's container.
5,So far so good. Took down a pile of documents in no time. Love the way it shreds the paper. Worth the money.
5,Good Heavy duty
2,No matter how pages it you feed paper will not completely feed through.
5,It is a little small although pretty good for home use!  This is a very nice little shredder and it works great!
5,Reasonably quiet with lots of power
5,Too noisy
2,It was doing great for 1 month and then half of it broke.  I can still shred on the right half but that's it. Dont recommend
5,I love it it does everything it was advertised to do
5,Great for home office use. I’ve had this machine for 9 months and have been using it daily. No problems so far.
5,Inexpensive and well made! Quiet compared to other brands
5,HANDLES A LOT OF PAPER BEING SHREDDED. VERY QUIET.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Very good product even stops automatically. Recommend just for home use small very compact.
1,I hardly ever write reviews.....I'm pretty sure I have had this less than 30 days (or Just Over)This thing clogs up when using the same branded lubricant sheets... UGH!!!
5,It performs exactly as advertised.
1,After only two days of use the shredder was literally smoking - and not just one puff of smoke either!!  It appeared that it was on fire somewhere inside the mechanicals. The smell was toxic. I am no longer going to use it as I am afraid my office building will ignite.  I did not overload it with too much paper at one time or put anything in the shredder that did not belong.  I have ordered a new shredder from a different company and this one will go right in the trash as it dangerous to use!!  Buyer beware!
1,I've bought 3 and everyone has stopped working after20 minutes these are junk!!!!!!!
1,After the 5th single sheet you have to stop and clean it because if not you start to see smoke from the track. So unhappy
1,Delivery was wonderful however day one of usage and the shredder stop working. I didn't bunch papers I fed one sheet at a time. No staples or windowpane envelopes and the thing just stopped working.  I was looking forward to getting rid of years of paper. What a disappointment! I called the company the rep said they could identify the item by the product number which was odd.  I'm calling Amazon will update this entry.
1,This shredder will not shred more than 2 papers at a time and over years after 5 minutes. Terrible product!
1,compost don't think it will last very long. I have purchased many products from Amazon and this is by far the worst
1,Item came in completely defective the slidder button on top was broken and the shredder itself had no power at all. Needless to say I was very disappointed.
5,I like that it is quiet & powerful.
1,It starts smoking after minimal use. Overheat light does not come on. Paper jams up on one side even if the container is empty the overload light does not come on. Top is very heavy and bulky hard to handle. I've only had it six weeks and past the point of no return.
5,Very quiet and runs smoothly when shredding and it's reasonably priced.  The container that holds the shredded paper is a perfect size for home use and offers many great features at a reasonable price.The trash container is windowed with a large enough capacity that prevents the need for frequent emptying.  The hinged handle on the shredding mechanism allows for easy separation of the unit from the trash container when the shredded contents are discarded.  This simple feature is far easier to maneuver than my prior in-home shredder's trash basket that was designed as a pull-out drawer that constantly got itself caught up on the shredding blades whenever I had to empty the contents.  The Bonsaii shredder is great little machine and I love it.
1,Worked for 3 days. Stopped powering on. Called the number on the sticker and they were not able to help.
5,This is a very basic paper shredder. The shredder sits on top of the waste catcher - to empty it you just lift the shredder portion off of the bin. The bin is clear so you can see when it needs to be emptied.There are no pull out trays. The shredder is fairly small. It is a good size for personal use.The top of the shredder has 2 feed slots. The smaller one says it is for CDs. You can can also run envelopes through it but be aware that the small slot shreds into thick continuous strips instead of small 2-inch bits like the larger paper slot. I included a picture showing the different shred patterns. Both shredders can be used simultaneously.You can toggle the shredder between continuous on-forward  auto-on and contious - reverse( used if you need to unjam) and off.This shredder says it has about a 5 minute continuous run time before the overheat sensor turns on and the shredder will need to cool off for 40 minutes. I have a lot to shred so I tested this - I was able to fill the shredder twice before the overheat indicator turned on.It's s not too loud and does an efficient job at shredding. The cool down time is a bit long but it's a small shredder so I don't expect it to be handling megs loads of paper.Overall very nice.
4,Works great. shreds stack of papers with ease and cross cuts them for added security. overall it is not too loud but i wouldn't run it while someone is sleeping or anything. Great price pint and an equally good machine. would gladly buy again
5,I was tired of manually tearing paper documents so I decided to order this shredder.This product works great. It is very heavy duty and in seconds it shreds documents. This shredder has a 12 sheet capacity per shred. The waste bin is very spacious which is nice for the monthly "paper shred days". This shredder has many features. The noise level is decent as well. Removing the waste is very easy you just lift the electronic part with the handle and dump out the waste bin at the bottom.I recommend this product for office and personal home use. 5/5 from me!
5,So far no complaints. This shredder is significantly quieter than my previous one. With the old one I'd never attempt to shred more than four or five sheets at a time. I like that I can shred twice as many sheets with this machine than I could with the other one. Paper jams and overheating have not been issues either. The CD shredder for destroying sensitive digital data is a practical feature of it also.For those of you keeping score here's the breakdown:Design- AConstruction- ASize- APracticality- AEase of Use- AOperating Noise- ASafety- AValue-  B+Overall Grade: A

5,I've wanted a shredder for personal and business reasons for quite a while and I couldn't be happier with this one! The basket is a great size larger than some others that I've seen in this price range. The shredder did great tearing through thicker cardstocks and small booklets without complaining or even slowing down. I'm so happy with this!
5,This is a fantastic shredder! I love that it’s not massive like my old one and it works excellent chews right through paper. I only put paper through mine because I compost all of it. This fits very neatly under my desk and is never in my way. This is well worth the price its well made it’s quiet fast and easy to use and empty. I’m very pleased with this shredder I didn’t realize how bad my old one was till I got this one. Love it! Recommend

With ease and single sheet paper fast as lighting I added a short video showing you the shredder in action while shredding thick mail packetsWith staples no issues with staples or paper clipsThis shredder also shreds CDs CCs and soft plastic it also has a over heating light and a reverse button if it ever jams up. I couldn’t get it to jam I tried to jam it up but I failed all the safety features work  I like the reverse button and the over heating light  it’s very maneuverable has a handle on the head of shredder that you can carry it to room to room or office to office the tote is 5gallon trash can  🗑 with a see though window to see paper pileI recommend this shredder
5,This is a great paper shredder. The bin is big enough for 5.5 gallons which is approx. 250 sheets. This shredder can take up to 12 sheets of paper per time and it can also shred CD credit cards paper clips and other things as well. Great quality and durability.

This one had a basket to catch the paper unlike our old one. It shreds pretty quickly and also think papers. I have my kids working on shredding papers and it's safe enough for them to operate without me standing over them. Its very easy to set up and use for home or office use. I don't think it's loud when it's in use.

It was pretty straight forward and it went to work right away. I expected more noise but it was pretty minimal. We had so much to shred waiting for this device and now it’s been almost 48 hours of continuous shredding and it’s looking like it’s here to stay. Great product well made good quality no complaints.

This is something that has a place in any house. They’re not just for businesses. I use this for old bills or mail for that matter. This can shred up to 10 pieces of paper at a time which is awesome. This can also shred discs. It’s got some weight to it but it is easy to move around. The shipping was super fast as I got this in the mail within a day. What’s not to love about that. This is a great value and a product that I would highly recommend.

5,I liked the price and the carry handle. It has low noise levels too.
5,Delivered quickly and works very well. Completely satisfied and would recommend.
5,Product works awesome very happy!
5,I keep it in the living room and after the mail comes in the afternoon can shred unwanted mail right then and there and fell good knowing my junk mail isn't floating around.
5,No issues.  As described and delivered promptly.
5,The shredder died after the first fifteen minutes of use. Up till then it shredded paper and credit cards with ease. After several emails and attempts to get the shredder working again the company offered to replace it. The new unit works great.Through email customer support sent detailed instructions on how to operate the shredder and the upshot is that limiting the amount of paper to 6-8 sheets does the trick. I also limit running time to five minutes and then let it cool down for at least fifteen minutes or longer if I am not in a hurry.This shredder is more than adequate for my home office and I would recommend it especially with the excellent customer support.
1,There was nothing wrong with this product. It was too small for what I needed. I'm not the best with measurements but they were clearly noted. I just didn't read them well. The return process was super easy!
5,Easy to use. Worked great on a big stack of papers. No problems. Should of got this sooner. With so many similar products lucky to find something that is worth the money.
5,Only had the shredder for a few days and so far so good.  It’s fairly quiet shreds efficiently and does not take up a lot of space.
5,My mom shreds…a lot…this was perfect for her. She has arthritis in her hands. Easy to empty!
5,This shredder works well and is easy to use.  Much quieter than my old one!  The motor sounds like a vacuum cleaner.
5,Great value for the money. Eats CDs too!
