5,Just got the 32GB Aiworth MP3 player today and after a couple hours of playing with it I am stunned how good this little device is! The Bluetooth 5.0 output is solid strong and sounds fantastic much better than the average Bluetooth players I've had before. I dumped more than 11 GB of my MP3 files into it in about 15 minutes then linked it to my Bose QC earbuds and later to my Denon BT receiver amplifier - and it sounds great on both! No dropouts stutters or funny sounds for the past 2 hours just pure music. Even the FM tuner auto-tuned 28 stations where my Denon AVR-S960H's FM receiver can only manage to find about 7. Then I linked the FM audio via the BT link (using the included wired earbuds as an antenna) to the Denon and this $40 device sounds better than that 850-dollar receiver!  My house sits in a 100-foot deep valley near a creek at least 25 miles north of the nearest FM transmitter so my radio reception has always been lousy noisy fading and weak.I put almost all my MP3 music collection on this thing and it's so small and light you could carry in a light weight seersucker shirt pocket and hardly notice it!  The interface has an intuitive and low learning curve. It has a nice 2" x1.5" display that is easy to read and understand. Very nice design and high quality which is so hard these days to find for 2 or 3 times this price.However within 10 minutes after I got it out of the box I managed to lock it up it was still on but wouldn't respond to any buttons. Don't know what I did to do that but I noticed a tiny hole next to the USB port stuck a tiny wire into it and it shut off. I turned it back on and it has worked fine since. I thought oh well I've done a factory reset and that I would have to reload all the songs but I didn't lose a single bit!So far so good this one is a keeper and I plan to take it with me and my Bose earbuds everywhere I go!
4,I bought this item because I have the Aiworth voice recorder and was impressed by the quality. This MP3 player leaves me a little less impressed and I'll explain why if you're interested. But the bottom line: 4 stars because it is stylish functional and as good as any other at a similar price point.If you want my quibbling details read on!First marketing this as a small lightweight player is off the mark. The old SanDisk ClipJam and modern clones of it are *much* smaller (see photo) Calling it a “touchscreen” is a bit misleading: see the icons on the screen? Well you don't navigate by touching them.  Instead you just use arrows to plod along to your destination.Unlike with most other players there is NO onboard memory but they DO give you a 32 GB TF card which you can also swap out if you want more. Unlike some this will support up to 128GB card so you could have a bazillion songs.The body itself is a big plus: it is lightweight sleek and looks and feels nice in your hand. I was really put off by the sticker on the back which marred the tactile appeal and at first I was afraid to scratch the device removing it. TIP: I found that after soaking the sticker with Goo-gone for 10 minutes it came off easily and cleanly.  That's a good thing because the aesthetics of the device make it stand out.The player come with Bluetooth 5. But what are the real world advantages? That's  not so clear. You can’t transfer files or charge via Bluetooth so what good are the “faster speeds?” In theory it will transmit over greater distances (say 200 feet versus 400 feet) In theory Bluetooth 5.0 also enables a cool new feature that allows you to play audio on two connected devices at the same time streaming to two different pairs of headphones or speakers. But my research tells me that you get that advantage ONLY if your headphones or speakers are also Bluetooth 5. So can anyone can confirm this functionality?In general I'm  not sure why this (and other players to be fair) add needless extra features which only make for icon clutter. For example: there is a radio but that only works with wired headphones not your bluetooth connection. And do you really want to watch a video on this? (Well only an .avi file because it doesn’t support more modern formats) Or read a book? (Well only a text file because it doesn’t seem to support .epub or any other real ebook format) That said the voice record and alarm features could be handy.But let's face it we bought it as an audio player and for that it performs well but again with caveats. It will play almost most every format you want with the notable exceptions of both AAC and the lossless ALAC format (too bad Mac users!) Ability to play FLAC is a big plus if you want audiophile quality. They tout the onboard DAC (digital to analog converter) and that is considered an upgrade. But is it Wolfson or Cirrus DAC or something else? Who knows? And will your ears hear the difference especially playing mp3?A big FAIL and a basic one is a lack of “shuffle all songs” feature especially with mega-storage. Why??  This matters even more because the  playlists feature is worthless: they must be tediously created song by song. The player does NOT support importing iTunes playlists of course. Sadly  it does not seem to support the standard .m3u file type for playlists which can be easily created.At this point you probably wonder why I give it four stars. Well I’m imagining many users don’t care about all these points; they just want a good looking functional player.  If you are interested this is good one especially if the caveats I noted don’t matter. Happy listening!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I need to say when I first got this device I hated it. My music player before this was an old gen 2 iPod and I wanted the interface on this to be exactly the same. I'm an audio book guy and I immediately noticed that when I turned off the device then turned it on later it didn't remember where I had last been listening. BUT then I found the 'Last played' item I could select off the main play menu and that problem was solved. Now my thumb selects 'Last played' without any conscious effort. The second problem I had was that the buttons are VERY sensitive and when I would get it playing and drop it in my pocket something would get pushed and I would lose my place again. BUT then I realized that the right side button locks the keypad out and you can safely trample all over the keypad with no worries about messing up whatever is playing. The third problem I had was I didn't think there was a shuffle function. BUT then I found that there is but that option is only available WHILE A SELECTION IS PLAYING. Get something playing push the menu key (button with 3 horizontal lines) and shuffle is an option.But here's what I really love about this thing: the battery. For years I've used 2nd or 3rd generation ipods. I loved them for being so functional and lightweight but you can't buy them new so every time I bought a "new" one the used battery was always a crap shoot. I got so tired of the battery being dead on my iPod that I decidedly to gamble on another product. The battery on this Aiworth is fantastic; I essentially never think about charging it. I just grab it and it's ready to go. It's almost true to say that whenever I plug it in to load up a new file that's all the charging time it needs.There are a couple disadvantages: 1) the screen is too dim. When you're outside in any kind of sunlight forget about doing anything that requires seeing the display. 2) There isn't a scroll-to-the-point-in-the-file-you-want like there is on the iPod. Instead you have to use the fast-forward/rewind buttons to find the spot you're looking for. The longer you hold the button down the faster it goes so it doesn't take that long to get to wherever you need to get to but just not as nice as the iPod. 3) Occasionally the max volume isn't quite enough to hear an audio book clearly like walking on a street with lots of cars zooming past or using a loud lawn mower but it's not bad at all. 4) The bluetooth works but the signal appears to be weaker than the signal from my phone. I can use wireless earbuds with my phone and walk all over the house but for wireless earbuds to work well the device needs to be very close (i.e. hanging around my neck). Also it is a little heavier than the old iPods but not enough to bounce around in my running shorts where I put it when I run.Here's what else I like. 1) As I said above the buttons are super sensitive but I've come to really like this. It makes for smooth and fast navigation. 2) There is a built-in speaker that is quite a bit louder than I expected it to be. This comes in handy for playing something for others to hear which is a feature you don't often get with a small player. 3) The voice recorder is potentially super handy although I haven't really used it for anything yet. 4) The radio is another fun feature but also not used much.Like anything else the navigation takes some getting used to. Hopefully the video is useful in giving you an idea how it works. Highly recommended if you want great battery life and an overall very functional player.
3,I am happy to find ANY MP3 player of apparently solid build so I don't want to be too harsh -- I want to be constructive and hope the manufacturer takes what they have reads the feedback and redesigns the user interface so I can give them 2 more stars and be a really happy customer.  (And they can sell a lot more players as the word gets out)When trying to navigate this thing as a new user you have what appears to be "iphone"-type buttons at the top -- but the real buttons are below that -- often invisible unless you push enough places until they light up.  Bad enough.. but the buttons below don't actually correspond very well with what is above and what is above is a tangled mess which places "play radio" in the #1 spot so you will find yourself over and over again caught in "radio hell" ...  which really is hell because the radio doesn't appear to work except to generate static.  And WHAT PERCENT OF USERS BOUGHT THIS TO BE A RADIO ANYWAY????  I suggest the radio and pretty much all the specialty stuff be put in a sub menu which can't be entered very easily while trying to just do something normal ... like replay change song or change volume.I'm going to leave my feedback at that.  I'm a new user and I hope I can keep this thing and figure out how to work around the weirdness (I have no hope of ever understanding why the UI is this weird to begin with).I am coming from a Sansa Clip by the way:  Approximately 1/4 the face size and approximately 1/10th the screen display size but probably 10 times more intuitive and easy to navigate.So there is a lot of room for EASY and VAST improvement in the User Interface of this thing. It is not like there is no prior art on what a good UI should look like.  It should be EASY for whoever manufactures this device to revamp the UI to clean up the issues.  The sound quality and build and other things all appear to be pretty solid.PS It is nice that you included a leatherette armband strap.  I suggest you drill one more hole at the bottom big and obvious enough for the headphone jack to come through?  I looks like I have to drill my own???----update: Ok I've had a few days to figure out better how to navigate it - which mainly comes down to avoiding all those idiot buttons on the opening/welcome screen that are at best for advanced tweaks and as I implied before are of approximately ZERO value to the typical use of the typical user .  At least I think I am a typical user.I have some more SPECIFIC suggestions/complaints for the manager (which may also give potential buyers something more to think about):(1) The controls are on the bottom with the display on top.  It is brain-dead to have the control lights go out BEFORE the display lights.  When you turn out the lights on the controls you actually make it impossible to do something as simple and common place as pause or replay or skip a song.  If you want to save power it makes more sense to turn out the display but leave the buttons visible.(2) The control buttons go black in 30 seconds - apparently to save precious battery.  Meanwhile the idiot display at the top keeps showing you nonsensical dancing lights which you can't control because the controls have effectively been deleted.  THEN the controls get completely locked up in a few more seconds as the top display also turns off.(3) In order to regain control you NOW have to push and hold down the side physical power button.  IF you can find it.  Of course if you are driving or riding a bike or even running you probably can't find it without stopping and looking.  And what if you are using the protective armband case? Well you almost certainly can't find it -- and if the armband is strapped on your upper arm you really really can't do anything without taking the player out of the armband or the armband off the arm or the player out of the holder. So what is the point?Some might say I am being harsh but you really only need to try to use this thing by feel and common sense to really get clear how poor this is from a functional design standpoint. You could hardly make a worse user interface if you tried.On the other hand looking at the alternatives maybe this really is the best choice out there right now in terms - again - of sound and build quality. Oh and ease of adding and editing music (works on win and linux I will try mac shortly).Please manufacturer improve the user interface!
5,The Aiworth 32gb mp3 player is a pretty solid value. It comes with a 32gb microSD card already but that is in fact upgradable in case you want more storage space. It reminds me of the last gen of the Sony MP3 Walkman but with a much sleeker and more functional approach. It’s impressive what you can do with this unit: listen to mp3s via headphone & built-in speaker record listen to and tune radio stations (with headphones attached) stopwatch calendar read TXT files watch AVI files… all with Bluetooth support. It’s not a smartphone nor does it claim to be so don’t expect a touch sensitive screen. It has light-up buttons below the main screen that allow you to navigate around and make your selections.Note: If you remove the sticker (as I did) you get a super sleek black bar of electronics… that is very easy to forget which way is up.The screen is small so reading a full book would be challenging at best but it is legible and the fact that you can store some passwords is kind a slick feature. Likewise video file viewing isn’t terrific but the fact that you CAN means if you are in a place that doesn’t allow smartphones or your phone is dead it’s a nice backup to be able to slot in your micro SD card to this unit. Also at times it looks like there is a graphic equalizer bumping in sync to your music but it’s more of a repeating image so don’t expect an accurate visual representation of your music.Adding in a mass of songs and having it shuffle around works and it can also take your songs that are organized into directories and play them back sequentially as well. It’s funny to think of how much I used to agonize over playlists before… especially now that we have access to on-demand streaming services. However I found traveling and losing cell service means the Aiworth player is my rock-solid backup if I need to pull out some of my favorite music.I was unable to import any kind of playlist (m3u etc.) from my main computer so the only option was to do it on the device which is a bit clunky. This has been the case though for pretty much all of the mp3 players I have owned over the years (all have had proprietary playlist creation) so I can’t really fault them for that.There was mention of an alarm feature in the instructions but every time I tried to make it function it was either too quiet or failed to go off but thankfully I wasn’t in need of that.Connecting the unit to a Bluetooth speaker is quite easy and having that feature makes this a great second device to keep in a bathroom synced to a speaker in case you wanted some tunes while you shower.Another reviewer mentioned that the volume can be too low in a noisy environment and I can kind of agree but I tried a few different sets of ear & headphones and found that ones that were more firmly in your ear canal worked fine for loudness. Using on-ear and over-ear options both were loud enough for me. Basically if your earphones have rubbery wrap around them you should be set. Also it’s underrated that it has a built-in speaker. The speaker won’t win any awards but it allows you to hear sound stored on the device. It is a great way to record someone and then play back for them what they said quickly or share a song without having to share earphones.In addition to being able to play back audio files (and it does this well with the addition of the configurable equalizer to suit your audio tastes) you can also do recording very easily. Sliding the side button puts you into record mode and you can choose the quality settings and away you go.I had it fully charged from dead in about 1.5 hours and got about 7-8 hours of playback before it was dead again so close to what is advertised.It’s a good value at regular price and if you can find a discount it becomes an even better value. It plays MP3s well and it has a nice list of other features it does too so it is one to consider.
4,First things first: if you’re trying to use wired headphones with this don’t plug them in completely! The connection will be HORRIBLE if you do I assume because the MP3 player thinks you’re trying to use the headphones as an antenna even if you’re not using the radio function. Plug them in until they’re snug but not fully flush against the player and they’ll work fine.Also throw the provided headphones in the garbage they’re as awful as you’d expect.Alright on to the actual review.I bought this to keep myself from going insane during my long shifts in a noisy lab/factory because we’re not allowed to use our phones on the floor and the radios we have barely work. I didn’t expect a whole lot from this but it’s actually a pretty nice little MP3 player. The UI isn’t anything fancy but it’s easy to read and navigate. The most annoying thing is having to use the buttons to scroll but that’s not too bad. Also the player will turn off super quick if you’re not using it; the default setting for that is like 2 minutes but you can change it in the settings menu.The speaker quality is better than I’d expected but still not great but honestly I don’t know why anyone would use the built in speaker when you can connect Bluetooth to this instead. The Bluetooth works a lot better than I expected though I frequently have problems with my headphones but I think a big part of that is because my headphones are cheap and shitty. Usually when they’re acting up I just have to go manually select them and hit connect or restart the player if that’s not working. A little inconvenient but not horrible.The battery life is great. It charges super fast and it lasts quite a while! I though they were exaggerating about how long it lasts but I work 8 hour shifts and use it the whole time and I’ve yet to have it die on me. I usually charge every other day but that’s more because I want to add more podcast episodes rather than because the player is fixing to die. It’s yet to die on me or even come close.I listen to more podcasts than anything so for those of you also interested in listened to podcasts or audio books: the player WILL remember where you left off but only if it was the last thing you listened too! Also if you do like I did the first day I had this player and accidentally skip to the next ep instead of fast forwarding it’s a pain to scrub back to where you are. You have to have the episode playing and then hold the next/fast forward button down. It’s a slow process but once you get used to it it’s not too bad.I’d say the only real con about this MP3 is that it scratches super easily. The first day I used it the screen was covered in scratches just from being in my pocket with nothing else in there. They don’t obscure the screen when it’s on but it is annoying to see them whenever the screen is off.
4,Before ordering the MB08 I downloaded the "manual" which is a typicalminimalist document that requires some decryption skills to understand. I alsodownloaded the latest(?) firmware and upgrade "Tool" from their web site...easyinstallation. Asking what the difference was with the latest firmware yielded noresponse.By the time I received the MB08 I was quite familiar with its operation andwent about testing it after its charging cycle.The FM radio frequency display is barely readable as it is in a small red fonton a dark background. Yet the "MHz" part is much better. Why would you wantthe most important part of the display to be so small? Notifications are also inthis tiny red font. The radio recording feature is good as is the reception but"Support" says that "firmware cannot fix the problem of radio display". Surelythis would in fact be a very easy and important firmware fix.The playback graphical display has nothing to do with the audio being played. Itis just random and a waste of CPU time. This space would be better utilized toprovide a larger display of the track information.Although the option for Mic or Line-in was in the recording menu I couldn'tfind the Line-in port. There was no mention of it in the "manual". After moresupport communication they finally told me  it was the headphones jack. I advisedthem to update the "manual" to mention that the headphone jack is also theLine-in jack (page 4 item 10). Of course Line-in recording cannot takeadvantage of the "Monitor" function. I tried to monitor using Bluetooth but noluck with that nor with the built-in speaker. Otherwise the Line-in recordingfeature worked fine.The ear buds sound quite good. The arm-band pouch seems to be a tight fit for theMB08 but is otherwise functional.Hoping that the "latest" firmware might be of benefit I tried to use the "Tool"to download the firmware but the "Tool" couldn't detect the player. To cut along story short after more communications with Support I was able to downloadthe firmware to the unit. It takes very specific and timed steps which wereinitially omitted. So now two thirds of the display on my unit was blank(white). After more Support comm. they promptly sent me another firmware filewhich fixed the problem. The player appeared to be just the same as with theoriginal firmware.For me the A/B function is important and works fine but there is a userselectable limit from 1 to 10 repeats then it continues to play past the Bpoint. I would prefer no limit or at least a maximum limit of 99. It should beup to the user to terminate the function by tapping the Play/Pause button.The Playback Speed feature is a nice feature which I was also looking for whenselecting a player to buy. It works fine.I installed a 128GB micro SD card in the unit and it worked as expected. I hadtransferred many files and directories to it beforehand and the unit was able toplay the videos music and text without any problems. I saved the supplied SDcard in case I needed to return the unit.While the technical support was very responsive it took determination to getthe answers that could have been provided earlier in the communication. The MB08is a nice player with the features I needed but I am still puzzled about the FMfrequency display given how all of the other players I looked at had a veryprominent frequency display.
4,Sounds good but screen is very difficult to see i daylight. Very small screen and very dim. I have almost 1k songs on it and have learned to just turn it on and start playing on shuffle without much difficulty. If I want a certain song to play it would be much more difficult and I would not want this unit. I can Bluetooth to my bike or a Bose speaker or connect to my pickup with an aux cord and they all sound great.
4,I've been using this MP3 player for over a year now. It's still working just fine though it's worth noting that I take good care of my electronics. Battery life is good. Bluetooth works well for the most part (occasional glitches but nothing that disconnecting and reconnecting doesn't fix). Some plug-in headphones work with the jack better than others; I've found that the no-frills wired earbuds do a better job than ones with mics. A standard auxiliary cable does fine to play in my car and the Bluetooth works pretty well for that too. I haven't used the recording feature or most of the other tools (just the stopwatch occasionally which works as expected).I have two frustrations with it that are leading me to see what other options are out there. First only the bottom half (the buttons) is touchscreen. I think I would prefer either real buttons OR full touchscreen; this is a strange hybrid of non-tactile buttons and a screen that is view-only. It makes it very tedious to navigate through a large music collection. I've been faithfully transferring my MP3s from computer to computer since the 90s and after marriage my husband and I merged our collections so I have about a bajillion albums and songs at this point.My other complaint is related to the first one. As I said I have a large music collection but I'm not an audiophile. My stuff is mostly in 128 kpbs. This player has plenty of storage but the indexing can't keep up. I can load my entire collection onto it but the player can only "find" and let me access 4001 songs. Which granted is a lot. But I have a bit more than that and would ideally like to keep my whole music collection together rather than having to pick and choose what makes it onto the player. Often the indexing software won't "read" the whole artist name either; sometimes all of the artists whose first name is "John" get thrown together into the first artist's folder which makes it hard to find the others. Using MP3tag to fix song metadata helped but it's still not perfect.At this price point it's a great player but I am looking into other options that will hopefully have either a full touchscreen or real buttons and/or the ability to manage a huge number of files.
3,First I got this to play in situations where it can get noisy relative to the volume I like to play music and where setting it once and leaving it alone is relatively important.  Also I use wired headphones for more reliable performance and to save on battery charge (including having the phones needing recharging).The good news is that it performs adequately under these conditions.  There is a relatively faint ticking noise in the background which is intrusive if you are listening critically to music in quiet conditions but only a minor issue listening in noisy conditions.  The bass is limited but fine for where I use it.  I have seen many dings for limited volume but put bluntly anything much past "10" on the volume could damage your hearing in time.  (Not to mention risking getting a headache on it plus not being able to hear around you when you need to.)The "5000 songs" is misleading.  I got to around 4000 songs on it and the display simply displays "4001" when I try to add more songs.  The card still had space on it and the issue persisted when I added a 128 GB card which should store between 15000 and 20000 songs depending on the average length.  With so many songs it will be difficult to tell if more than 4000 songs can be accessed at once on this device.  If not then even out of 32 GB something like 2.5 GB of this is simply wasted.  And it is cumbersome to directly access a song in the middle of the list--no way to scroll by alphabetical or numerical order.The device is still too new to determine reliability during its life.  I don't expect it to last forever because of the non-replaceable LiIon battery (nice waste of resources since a replaceable battery would have meant only the battery and not the player ends up in the landfill).  At least the music is stored on the card which is tricky to remove and insert (and can be transferred to another player) so you lose only the player and not your whole library once the battery goes bad or the whole player stops working.As the unit is glass it is quite fragile and should be treated with respect.  It will crack if subject to too much impact abuse and since I do not wish to trash this unit I do not know whether or not it would render the player unusable or simply be an eyesore.  I also do not expect it to function after a good soaking because of the holes in it for the headphones the USB port (it takes a micro USB plug) a record button and the power button.  (And I keep it protected in the event of rain with a case designed to offer water protection against splashes).Instructions are relatively intuitive.  It is easy enough to set up and a simple quick press of the power button will disable the touch buttons so you are not accidentally tampering with the playback.  (And another will light it up so you can check which album or song is playing and adjust the volume.)  Pressing and holding it for about 2 seconds shuts it all the way down or powers it up from a dead stop.  And the battery charges in one go--usually an hour or so after 6-7 hours of continual use on volume setting 10 and using wired headphones.  It is easy enough to change the language--and I set mine to German (as I am trying to learn that language plus someone not authorized to use it would have a miserable time trying to figure it out).With these caveats and that I do not know whether it will last the 4-5 years I expect the battery to last I recommend this if you are using it in relatively noisy environments or where you do not wish to ruin your hearing.  If you wish to listen critically to complex music at 120 dB and in quiet areas no I do not recommend this.
4,Not as slick as my old ipod nano but hey.. it does the job.  I guess.  Cheap and functional what more do you want.
4,I'm glad I bought it but it isn't without issues just still worth it to me for $40. It'll play most formats but if you have Flak it's a 50/50 shot whether it'll play and won't do AAC/M4U. I had to convert a lot of my audio files to straight mp3 for them to work. Menus aren't too intuitive and if you only want this for playing mp3's theres a lot of fluff features that just clutter the menus.But overall it's easy to use and does it's job well. Battery life is GREAT and it charges in minutes. Wish it used USB C but that's a minor gripe. I like that you aren't forced to use special software to upload music onto it but if you prefer software that could be a downside. I like it though loading it is like loading a flash drive.
3,My teenage son was getting frustrated with his iPad and iPod because the Apples Library would advertise music with inappropriate covers (immodestly dressed women). He asked me to find him something else. We ordered this device and we were so excited at first. He was able to have complete control over what he saw and he didn't have to worry.But he has told me of two problems which are making it very difficult to use this mp3 player and he has gone back to his Apple devices though he asks me to sync them to the Apple Library so he doesn't have to see things.The first problem is that when he tries to put songs on the mp3 player he is told about half the time that the format is wrong. Whereas when he puts the same songs on to his iPod it handles them fine. He is pretty tech savy and taught himself how to use the software that comes with the mp3 player to convert the formats but he said he still isn't able to get about half of the songs to work.The second problem is that the mp3 player doesn't have a seamless transition between songs. He has several albums where songs fade into each other as part of the song. But the mp3 player has a long pause in between every song as the software is struggling to transition. This ruins several of his albums and even cuts off the ends of the songs sometimes.
3,I am an MP3 freak!  I have over 4000 CD's and love to rip them to MP3 players per genre where I can set the player on shuffle and listen for hours.  Currently I have about 60 MP3 players so I know how to use them.  This was my first Aiworth MB08 32G player.  It looked good out of the box but after ripping to it I quickly realized it wasn't what it appeared to be.  There is essentially no sound.  I've over the settings menu numerous times after setting the volume control as high as possible and when I plug it in and play it the sound is just barely heard with my receiver volume maxed out.  I've looked and looked for some other sound control that I might be missing but I find nothing.After reaching out to the manufacture I was pleasantly surprised by their willingness to resolve the problem.  They immediately sent me another player and it works fine.  Time will tell if it will last but I do appreciate it when a seller cares enough to rectify the problem.  Apparently I received a lemon which can happen with any brand...I suppose.  I must say I've never had an issue with SanDisk.  Anyway I'm upping my overall rating to three stars that being that I had the problem and had to turn to the seller.Bottom line the manufacture stands behind their product!
4,Amazingly fast delivery - expected it in a week or so and it came in two days. Customer support for me was superb. Friendly knowledgeable. sent me several videos and took me through all the confusion that goes with being an old guy with a new high-tech toy.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because on day 2 the left sound channel went silent and stayed silent. Customer support was quick to say just send it back. So I did and got another identical player from them and a week later the replacement is working fine. I really like not being limited to 16 GB the way we were with the old ipod nanos. I've already put in a 128GB card loaded in almost 3000 songs from iTunes and enjoying it immensely!-----Now it's a couple of months later and I like it more and more! The battery lasts forever - I play it about 8 hours a day through wired earbuds and the battery easily lasts 3 days - that's 24 hours MP3 playing time at least. It works great with my Bluetooth headset as well. The touch buttons are extremely sensitive so one has to be careful when navigating through its system. It has a "shuffle" capability almost. It does shuffle but after about a day the same songs come around again. Since I have over 3000 songs aboard right now I am suspicious that it shuffles to create a sub list or a limited path through part of the song files and sticks to that. My remedy is to just frequently shuffle so I'm not deducting any stars on that account. It seems to be rugged and is just a joy to use. I like it MUCH better than my worn out iPod Nano which it replaced.
4,This was a gift for my Dad- his review is below.I received this MB08 MP3 player as a gift for Christmas. I wanted something that I could put my library of music on since Google play music is no longer. I am old enough that I go back to the days of records and have been through the full progression of 8 tracks cassettes CD's burning and uploading the CD's to the computer putting everything on I Tunes and then transferring to Google play music then to YT music. I was tired of having my music held by a third party app that I had no control over and just wanted something simple that would hold my music. The user manual did not include directions on how to load the music on the player so I just connected the device to my computer opened my music folder on the computer and dragged and dropped the whole folder onto the device folder. The file transfer took a few minutes and to my surprise everything transferred just fine. I figured out most of the functions by a combination of looking at the instructions and working the device. The instructions are not communicated in english very well and it takes some interpretation and thought to figure out some things. The Bluetooth hooked right up to my speaker and the internal speaker sounds good on its own. I was able to use the auto search feature for the radio and picked up most of the local stations which is nice. The album pictures downloaded onto the device but they are in a separate folder and some display when the album is playing some do not which I don't understand. Also there are three playlists labeled playlist 1 playlist 2 and playlist 3 and it doesn't appear that the names can be changed or more playlists added. I tried to put all of my Christmas songs in one playlist and the playlist would only accept 100 songs. After I downloaded my music and was looking at other reviews I read where one reviewer said that she put her music in folders on her computer and then copied each folder onto the player and just uses her folders as playlists so that would be an option for those that want multiple playlists or want more than 100 songs in a playlist. I plan on contacting the company to discuss the questions I have and verify the playlist issues that I mentioned. This is the first MP3 player that I have owned but overall I am happy with it and it does what I wanted it to do plus has a radio which is a plus for me. I am giving it 4 stars because I am disappointed in it not allowing modification of the playlist labels and not allowing for the creation of more playlists and not displaying the album art on some of the album's when playing.
3,Well it seems if it gets too hot... it just stops playing and decides to start recording .WAV files. Tucson AZ it gets hot. No way to exit it either. Have to power off and back on. As of today it no longer works. I turn it on and all it does it start  recording .WAV files. Recording my voice and what not. Again no way to exit out of it or anything. All I can do is "pause" the recording. Charging it right now with a paused recording. A week ago it would not turn on and did an old iPod trick. Holding power and some buttons. The audio is also really really low. Ear Buds is fine. Anything else pfft. Got 3 months out of it now it is just a brick. Was only used in my car and kept in my pocket at work.
4,ok
4,Once you are acclimated to the user interface and watch a few "how to" videos available on YouTube and specific to Aiworth this MP3 player works really well and has good sound.
4,My son wanted a little player he could take to camp - it must have a huge capacity bc he downloaded hundreds of songs and hadn’t reached a limit. Good buy.
4,This little music box is pretty awesome! I've gone through several and this one met enough of my expectations for me to give it a "thumbs-up".Great sound and an exceptional battery life. I use it for approximately 2.5 hours a day and only have to recharge it once about every 3 weeks.There are a few let downs. It does not really have a touch screen as mentioned in the product description but not a huge negative for me.I like to sort my music by genre in separate folders. Although I have the setting to repeat all it will play all the songs in one folder and then moves on to the next folder instead of repeating from the same folder/genre. If I use the shuffle setting it does shuffle from the same folder.I mostly use it while commuting on a motorcycle and the volume is just fine with noise canceling earbuds. Volume setting goes up to 31 and I use it on 11 and that's plenty loud.During the great freeze of February 2021 we were without power for 3 days and I was able to listen to the radio continuously/non-stop for 2 days. Great battery life.My experience with this mp3 player has mostly been positive. I have not needed to contact customer support. They did offer a $30 Amazon gift card for a 5🌟 rating but did not actually deliver on that offer. I still recommend this little box.
2,The company offers a rebate ($30 Amazon gift card according to a card in the box) in return for a 5 star review but ironically in the process of reviewing I decided it would be better to just return the item than deal with all its quirks. Also who knows if you will actually receive this rebate? A big "if" for writing a shill 5 star review!Some pros:-It is nice that it has a built in speaker but it's not like the speaker sounds great enough to rely on that for general usage in my opinion. Good for previewing songs or letting a friend hear something quickly.-.m4a files did play for me on this device when selecting songs individually and in shuffle mode though the file type was not listed in the description.Some things that bugged me:-I uploaded numerous folders to the file system thinking navigating folders would be convenient. Strangely the folders are sorted in the order you add them to the device not alphabetically so if you add a zillion folders it's hard to find what you want. I couldn't find a way to change this.  I worked around this by uploading individual A-Z letter named folders in order and then added artist named folders to those folders. Inside each letter folder the artist folders are still listed in the order they were added but at least each inner folder list is shorter.-The radio didn't play at all for me without headphones and with headphones stations I know play clearly on other standard radios had horrible reception. It is nice that you can save radio presets but why bother with such bad reception?-The visualizer for each track does not correspond to the music playing; it's more like a repeating .gif just there for fun?-ID3 tags didn't work for me during song playback (it just showed the file name) so sometimes since I had so many music files that I don't always remember the deep cuts I would be at a loss for what was playing. I could not find a way to look at the file location or info about the song to get an idea what it was. There is an option to play all from the artist but I would have to leave the my "shuffle all songs" to do that and I was like whatever man I guess I'll just live in mystery for now? (since I'm usually using the player while I'm in the middle of something) Strangely you can look through the Music section by artist and album so the ID3 tags must be working to a certain extent there?-Using headphones there was a strange digital static during quieter moments of a song playing. I tried a couple headphones and it was the same. When I used the fast-forward button during a song I would hear a fast-forwarded version of that static. I'm guessing it's there when I use an aux speaker but when I do there's usually more ambient noise around that could be preventing me from noticing.-There is an Equalizer option but there isn't a way to adjust the equalizer that I could find. You can only choose "off" or an option from a list of presets. So if you can find a preset that optimizes your music that's nice but otherwise not so useful.-The button lights are really bright and there wasn't an option to lower the button brightness only turn the button lights on or off.At first I thought I could deal with these quirks in order to have a convenient mp3 player to use around the house but after listing these quirks I'm like "Why would I want to put up with this everyday?" If you can make use of some of the other features that I don't care about like the recorder and if those features work than this might be more useful to you. But as for me... returning!
4,Pros:1. Long battery life: I kept it playing for half-day and never experienced battery out.2. The storage is quite big.3. The recording quality is perfect when I used a 3.5mm male-to-male headphone jack connection to my computer to record game music; and the recording is also good in noise cancellation when not using line-in. Its recording quality combined with the long battery life and big storage make it useful to record any seminars/classes.4. USB connection is fast enough for computer to play songs stored in this MP3.Cons (none of them a major issue but may cause some small degree of inconvenience):1. Its build-in speaker seems loss some sound tracks so some songs may have distorted voice. But when I play with its headphone or my external speaker the problem goes away.2. The user interface looks like a touch screen but actually not. It is just a matter of resuming to old-time habit.3. Another issue is its Bluetooth connection. To connect to my Toyota Camry via Bluetooth it does not remember the auto-pair must delete and pair again and typically takes 3 - 5 trials to succeed in pairing. So I have to use USB or headphone jack to connect to my car.4. Its playlists is useless (only 3 lists and has limit on total number of songs also no easy way to batch add/remove songs to/from playlists). The work-around is connecting the MP3 to your computer and organize its stored songs by folders (in Windows Explorer). Then in this MP3 I can play all songs in one folder - The folders are now as substitutes of playlists.
2,I buy a lot of mp3 players and store old radio shows on them. I do not care too much about features but I look for quality since I take these everywhere I go and cannot afford to be stuck in a hospital 1000 miles away from my home and have the player go belly up. That is what happened to me with this mp3 player recently and  I will not buy one again. I went to Cleveland Clinic from Nashville and got stuck there for 40 days after complications from surgery.  I do not watch TV but listen to these old radio shows I have archived for years. My dad started his career in high school in radio and as a kid growing up he got me hooked on these great old shows. Everything was going OK with this player until one evening after the nurse brought in my IV feeding and I settled in for the night. I turned the player on and all of the electronics on the screen went haywire and I could not get anyplace. It was a long night without it let me tell you. I left it plugged for 2 days trying to discharge it hoping I could shock it back into reality and "nada". When I would turn it on it would boot the the startup screen and then all of the icons would  jump all over the place and I could not get anywhere. Fortunately I had my shows on a 128GB mini sd card and my wife ordered me another brand and had it shipped to the hotel she was staying at. I had bought this brand in the past and it was far better quality and even cost less. I had not way to return it to Amazon until i got back home and it was too late to send it back. I trashed it. I won't buy this brand again.
3,Nice little device. I purchased it to listen to audio books. What doesn’t work for me is that there are no volume buttons. The volume is on a touch screen that has to be activated by pushing tue power button. Also the shutdown time max is 5 min. I listen to books while at work and have to answer calls these may last more than 5 min and when the device shuts off it also disconnects Bluetooth devices. The interface is not user friendly. Every time the screen goes dark you are taken back to the Home Screen and have select what you were listening to before or end dark. When getting into the “song” listing screen the first option is always all songs instead of last played. If you choose all songs you will start at the beginning of the list and have to search for your “song”. That being said always make sure you select last played the 2nd option.The battery life is very good easily last up to 10 hours longer than most ear buds. Sound and Bluetooth quality is very good as well.
3,I specifically got this product to be my music player since it didn't have the ability to go on the internet and i like to shut off the internet for months at a time to be more productive.Pros-good battery life It really does feel like i got at least 20 hours of play time or more in this thing.Sound quality seems okwas only 40$came with arm band (which i never use but still nice)Cons-1- The bluetooth wireless feature is really bad. I tried to connect apple airpods gen 1 to this and it loses connection very easy. Don't even try to put this in your pocket it gets choppy. Compared to an apple ipod which has a very strong connection with little to no problems.2- The touchscreen is actually really annoying. I would end up accidentally hitting buttons by holding it wrong and sometimes buttons get pressed inside my pocket. The ipod had a better system of pressing a lock button which prevents you from hitting buttons by mistake.3- Changing songs is really slow. and there is no A-Z skip feature that ipod and the sony walkman i owned before the ipod had. If there is a skip feature than it's not immediately apparent.On my music players i sort music in the "ALL MUSIC" section using the first 3 letters to be the group/album followed by the song. So if it were say Linkin Park id do LP Breaking the Habit. So on the A-Z screen all the linkin park songs are grouped.This mp3 player doesn't let me jump letters and on top of that it takes about 2 seconds to switch songs. The ipod instantly skips. This makes it really hard for me to scroll down on my list of 2000 songs.I haven't been organizing my albums so i got a bunch of stuff in random folders that were defaulted.So i have been using this with the shuffle option and on some days would walk to get food and shuffle one song at a time every 2 seconds only to get halfway to my destination.But aside from that 40 dollars for a 32GB mp3 player is a really good deal. Back in the late 2000s my 16gb sony walkman was like 90$ at bestbuy.I'd recommend just spending the money on a ipod gen 7. It's like a smaller iphone that has seemless bluetooth pairing a camera connection to the internet Free texting (sort of) to people who have phones over a wifi connection (which most stores are getting wifi these days so it's a really nice communication device that doesn't require monthly cost.
3,I wanted to get a new music player with larger capacity for a long car trip.  I picked this one because it had a good set of features and most importantly supported Ogg Vorbis.  It is advertised as a touch screen interface but it is not.  The front panel has a display screen and 8 capacitive touch switches below it.  The side has a more traditional power button and a recording switch.What is good:Physical size is good nice rounded corners.  Good memory size but because all the storage is on a removable storage card you can easily and inexpensively upgrade it by plugging in a new SD card. The sound quality is good.  It can also play mp4 movies. Capacitive touch switches are unlikely to wear out.  Adding files to the unit is very easy.  If you plug it in to your computer it appears as a USB flash drive.  You can put files in pretty much any way you want in whatever sub-folders you want. When you unmount (i.e. "safely remove") the player it automatically scans all the added files and puts the tag metadata in an internal database so you can find the songs by their tags.What is not good:Capacitive touch switches mean you have to look at the unit to use them there is no tactile feel at all (this includes the volume buttons) If you don't use the unit for a few minutes it turns off so you have to turn it back on.The song display is actually quite badly designed.  Most of the screen is taken up with an animation that looks like a graphic equalizer display but is not.  It animates at random and is animated whether or not the music is playing.  So the only useful information is crammed into a band 1 cm wide at the bottom of the screen with a TINY font while the vast majority of the screen is taken up with a useless animation.Other notes:it's really important to have the metadata ("Tags") on the files updated if you want to be able to find them.The thing has bluetooth connectivity but I couldn't get it to work with the bluetooth system in my car.  Probably was meant to be used with speakers or headphones.So I like the unit overall but the interface is not great.
4,Love it.  Great lite mp3 player.
4,It sounds good when we hook the auxiliary to the SxS radio but can’t get it to Bluetooth in. Controls on radio won’t skip songs on player
4,Overall I think this is a great product. The sound quality is good the volume is sufficient. The user interface is very easy. There is plenty of storage for songs and ebooks. The one criticism I have is that the screen brightness is too low in daylight. I can barely see the screen when I am outside during the day in the shade even with the brightness setting all the way up. Otherwise I think it is a good purchase.
5,I love that I can plug directly into my usb port in my car!
5,Great mp3 for the price and the product delivered on all of its features not very durable as is nornal with electronics and the headphone jack did break after a year of use.
4,First this payer is much better than an older player I had. The sound quality is very good with the ability to adjust using the equalizer. I wish this had a touch screen. Instead you must navigate using buttons.The screen is a good size but the song title and any other text is much smaller than it should be given teh screen size.The instructions are nearly worthless. There is nothing telling you how to import music. When I plugged it into my computer there was no "Music" folder so based on another review I created one and imported music to it which worked fine.You can't rename the 3 playlists (based on answer from Aiworth support). Kind of ridiculous. You can create new ones via your computer in "Folder" folder and place music in them.You can't delete a song you are listening to. That would be a nice feature. Instead you have to find it in the "Folder" folder to delete. That's time consuming.The player had about 50% battery and I decided to charge it. It took about 75 minutes to get to 100%. That seems long.I'm still getting used to using it. Most features are easy to use. I wish they would fix some of the things I noted above and it would be a great player versus a very good player.Support was decent. I waited a little more than 24 hours for responses to 2 questions.
5,I have tried this item and the other kind with the touch screens and the 4" display. You know which ones they are.This one gets my vote. It is lighter easy to use easy to get used to.First comment: The fast forward and reverse through a tune is significantly faster with this player than the 'other kind' that I tried. A plus factor with audio books and long songs.Second comment: Forget about using 'playlists.' Please stop whining about this issue. The solution is to go to the Folders section and use the directory structure ON THE SD CARD to organize your albums and playlists. Do this on you computer figure out how you want things to look and copy your files into the  directory structure you create on the SD card. The player will play all the files in order in the directory.You may have to add numbers like "01_" and "02_" to the beginning of the file names to get them in proper order. Use a freeware file renamer program it is fairly straightforward. If you make an error it is to the COPIES on the SD card; your original source file names are intact.Final thought. If you add files later to the SD card the order displayed by the player will place them at the end of the listing. Annoying. SOLUTION: Insert a different SD card (a blank one may be best) boot the player then turn it off allowing the player to recreate the file listing database with a blank list. Then remove the (blank or whatever) SD card and re-insert your original. The player will recreate the listing againand your files should now appear like it is supposed to.
3,I'd done a lot of research into buying another mp3 player. Not that this was a big expenditure I do it with just about everything I buy.  It was the sound that made this player  a deal breaker with me. A couple of folks had commented that the volume limits of this player were too low so I was forewarned going  in that this might be a problem. Since I was going to be mainly using this in my vehicle I figured the volume issue wouldn't  be a huge hurdle. My problem was the sound quality.  After I loaded a few gigs worth of concerts on board I took it for a spin. The first thing I tested was the external speaker. The sound was hollow and tinny - again not a  complete deal breaker. The external speaker was nice to have but not the primary reason I bought the player. However  when I plugged in the included ear buds  (which are actually pretty good)  they just reflected the sound that came from the external speaker - hollow and thin. I then did a comparison using the same concert file with my wife's tiny Ruizu player which actually blew the doors off the Aiworth player. The volume was louder and the soundstage was much richer and fuller on the Ruizu. My wife said the Ruizu player sounded like being inside the concert hall while the Aiworth sounded more like the sound you hear standing outside the concert hall. A bit of an exaggeration but fairly apt none the less.  The other main difference was the ways the players read the file info. Her Ruizu read through the meta data and displayed the tagged file name for a song (along with showing the track info stadium and year of recording while all the Aiworth player displayed was the track data like what disc and track number was being played.  This feature would probably never bother you if all you listen to is commercially recorded and sold music but if you like to listen to live shows it's a pain in the bum. I'm returning this player and trying one from  Arungo.  I'm not expecting FiiO quality sound from a sub $50 player but it should be at least as good as my wife's $25 Ruizu player. Those folks know how to do sound right. If this next player fails the comparison test I'll be moving on to their line of players to see if I can find one better suited to my purposes.
3,For the price this device is okay but the user interface is pathetic.  The touch interface is annoying because it only applies to half the screen.  What's worse is when the device screen goes blank (to save battery life) you have to touch the screen - which performs one of the functions like play or pause.  It's quite annoying.  The buttons of the touch screen are at the bottom and you can only navigate the interface by tapping up/down/left/right.  So doing things on the device is a choreI bought this for a friend and didn't spend much time with it - only to set it up.  So I don't have an opinion of the sound quality or the build quality.  However ... one comment on the latter.  I've seen a number of reviews for this and similar products which reference the weight of the device and correlation it to the quality of the build.  The 2 don't always to hand in hand.  The Chinese have been known to add lead weights to devices to make them heavier so that people will believe it's better build quality or material than it really is.  I don't know this to be the case with this device - just wanted to point out that weight may not be the telltale people think it isBTW - the USB cable is SHORT.  Probably only a foot at most.  Also it's micro USB which is a pain in the butt.The radio function required the use of headphones - as an antenna.  Kind of a pain for Bluetooth headphone users.  Also - if the headphones are plugged in I presume you can't listen through the device's built in speaker (which is lackluster) or through an external Bluetooth speaker.  I can't confirm this because as I said I only spent about an hour using the device.FYI - the device has no internal storage.  The 32GB is in the form of a micro SDXC card.  This means if you opt to purchase a larger card to use with the device you won't be adding to the 32GB you'll be replacing it.
4,Had it a couple months now. Does the job. Easy to navigate like a sansa but it definitely lacks bass. Its not my Sennheiser headphones bass comes thru nicely from my samsung phone. I like that the screen is bigger than my sansa and its got a removable sd card. Seems like the build is solid still reccomend a case. I havent tried playing videos or reading documents on it. If sansa never stopped making their players with those 2 features i never woulda changed brand but ive got a big music collection and the tiny screen is a pain. This is the same price. Really wish they made sansas like they use to but this will do. The battery life is truly excellent no doubt. Having music on me is more important than a phone and playing music on the phone drains the battery too fast
4,This is worth the money but kind of annoying: (1) If you don't place a  book mark and it powers down it doesn't know where it was in the file it was playing...so it starts at the beginning. (2) If you have a long file (e.g. mine are typically 1-2 hours) it takes way too long to fast forward...and you don't know how far to slew. It would be better to power back up in the state that it shut itself down.If the manufacturer is reading this have a two step fast forward/reverse speed. Go at the speed you have for 3 secs or so. Then go at 5 times that speed until you let up the (touch screen) button.And for some reason the touch screen is just the lower 1/2 of the screen. The upper half where you choose functions and setup is not touch sensitive. You touch icons on the lower half to navigate.I don't know how much they save by doing it that way. It must be substantial.
3,The interface is terrible. It’s not touchscreen. Can’t import playlist. Half the songs don’t show up in music so have to find them in the folders. You can’t see the screen in daylight. It overheats easily and then decides to stop playing and start voice recording….which only way to stop seems to be power it off.
5,Really good for the price and the fact that you can load ALAC and FLAC files on this along with MP4 is simply amazing.
5,One day in early 2022 my Zune HD finally died for good. It had gone thru a couple surgeries to upgrade it's battery and drive but it finally departed to sit at the right hand of the Great Audiophile Above. I anguished over the selection of a replacement. Another Zune; with no support from the maker? Maybe another expensive player from a well-known brand? I looked high and low-fi but settled on this one. I admit it was the look that got my attention but the good reviews convinced me. Well I gave it a whole month using it at least 4 days a week up to 6 hours a day. I don't say this lightly: it has been a more than adequate replacement for my Zune. I await a lightning ⚡ from above. Now like many players it helps to have decent headphones but the eq selection allows you to find a sound that fits your musical style. The battery life is fantastic. I was pleasantly stunned by the fact that the battery was still full after the 1st 6 hours of usage. Even scrolling through my 900 plus songs for a certain one didn't drain the battery. I could go on but I'll end with this: if you're looking for an inexpensive player with good sound and great battery life I recommend this one.
5,Good gift
3,Bought it for the memory storage but it has issues. You just about need a microscope to read any error message. If you are playing a playlist and then plug into USB it will change playlists on you. Same for Bluetooth from Aux. Every other MP3 I've own played songs alphabetical order. This one plays music based on track # then alphabetical. If the device overheats it will switch to audio recording.I wanted to like this product but my previous device worked better even with the smaller memory.
3,I use my cell phone to listen to audio books and podcast through a bluetooth speaker at work but it tends to run down my cell phone battery and I started having problems with the port when I try to transfer MP3 files.  I searched for MP3 players with bluetooth capabilities and I decided to go with this one because it was the most appealing and was Amazon recommended.Pros1. has long battery life.2. easy file transfer.Cons1. screen is dimly lit2. doesn't have memory feature when player shuts down.3. temperamental fast forward keyI have a difficult time reading the screen in lighted rooms even though I have the brightness turned all the way up.  When the player shuts down you lose the place the MP3 stopped playing no memory feature.  When you try to find the spot you last listened using the fast forward key it tends to jump ahead to the next MP3 or two if you don't keep it depressed long enough.  I find it hard to believe with todays electronic technology they can't make an MP3 player with features that are just as good or surpasses the features on a cell phone app I downloaded for free.  I really wish I could give this little device 5 stars but it just falls short on features that earns it 3 at the most.
3,I purchased this for the Bluetooth 5.0 because of even if it lacked security a device connected capable can. Plus the file range is good and it is not expensive. Well before I turned it on while in the box a Samsung phone saw it and used it as a bridge device. I didn't even know until I tried turning it on. It had recording from devices in my home. So I deleted the recordings and tried it out and. And it was good the interface is simple but I couldn't find anything on updates so what you get is an MP3 interface from 2009. The file system the same like an old MP3 player you have to manually set the folders on the card to organize the music. Thankfully I tried it with Windows7 windows media player and it saw it as a SanDisk player and can organize and put music in it. Sadly not the card so it takes time for setup. As for the files I tried Amazon digital music and it played it fine. The head phone jack I'm afraid has a low volume level and require headphones with volume controls. That alone would be fine but the music is just out putting so enhanced audio from the jack needs a pair of headphones that does it. And those kill the battery fast. But the Bluetooth is a different story the quality is good. It connected with everything fine and all the buttons register so once connected any headphones with controls work. But it does get warm and when it reaches a certain temperature it can't see the card and freezes. The battery about 5 hours on average. So good device but I gave it to someone gift. I couldn't keep it because whatever that Samsung phone did kept causing devices to pair and route to or through it. Bottom line it's okay and keep Galaxy devices away from it I have no idea what it did to it but 3 months later it lingers. I wrote this review because once again after deleting it from everything it connected to today my Kindle is connected to it.
5,This is the Mp3 player I have been waiting for. All the buttons one needs are on one screen; Forward Reverse Play stop and volume. Other Mp3 players make one go through a confusing set of screens to do simple things like increase/decrease volume. Downloading Mp3s to an SD card was simple and uncomplicated. 5 stars.
4,I was really impressed with this MP3 player.  Did not use the voice recording feature but bluetooth functionality is decent.  Connects to devices without issue but the sound quality is lacking.  The battery life is really good lasting about 4-5 days on a single charge.  MP4 video quality is not the greatest but overall plays well.  Even with good quality headphones the sound quality is not the greatest.  Music plays and sounds decent but for the money this device is not bad.  If you have MP3s around still you can load up a good number of them with the internal 32GB storage card.  Overall I was impressed with this device for the cost.  Recommended if you're looking for a cheap MP3 player.
3,This unit is not easy to use. It requires many clicks to navigate through the system to find what you need to do. This is not a touch screen. It has a toggle switch and you have to click 'Enter' after every operation or selection. There is a very short return window so if you don't like it return it immediately or you'll be stuck with it like we are.
5,I bought this mp3 player for my mom who doesn't like using phones for such things. I loved the interface on this device and it was really easy to set up and show her. If you need something strictly for music I definitely recommend it.
5,After reading the reviews I was expecting something of average quality that was difficult to navigate expecting that I'd get what I paid for. But when this thing arrived I was impressed! It feels very sturdy in the hand and it's very easy to navigate through the menus.I was able to easily upload a couple hundred songs in only a few minutes. I had some concerns in that my laptop runs Linux but the process of adding music was just a matter of dragging and dropping in folders which is pretty universally compatible.The speaker is meh about the quality of a cell phone speaker but it's still nice to have.The music quality with headphones though... I was NOT expecting the songs to be that clear and crisp! I was listening to a bunch of the songs on my laptop first to make sure they were the right ones and then I listened to those same songs on this player (same headphones and everything) and the songs sounded BETTER. Some of those songs were old so they sounded all tinny on my laptop but they sounded like they'd been remastered once I got them on this MP3 player!Also a lot of the songs I added were of different volumes but this thing seems to have made an attempt to correct for that and all songs play at about the same volume. Some of the super quiet songs are still on the soft side but it's very obvious that it's been boosted. It makes it so much easier because now I don't have to change the volume between songs.The controls are pretty straightforward and remind me of the controls of my old MP3 player which was a Sony.My one complaint is that the buttons glow super bright and it hurts my eyes. There's no option to dim the light behind the buttons only to turn it off and once the light is off you can't see the buttons at all. I just wish the buttons dimmed using the same setting that dims the screen's brightness. But that's my only complaint.Overall this is a very impressive MP3 player especially considering the price! I look forward to adding much more music to it soon!
3,Dark screen. No "click" buttons. You must be focused to use proper button. I did not make Bluetooth connection with the speaker. I tried 2 speakers. Radio did not locate any station. Nobody is making today decent MP3 players. Serious companies give up due the cheap Chinese competition. And that is our fault.
2,There are just too many things wrong with this unit to give it more than 2 stars.I suppose the sound quality is acceptable although the volume doesn't go high enough in certain situations.The real problem is the user interface and button functions which are whatever the opposite is of  user-friendly.  When playing anything the screen goes dark and the touch screen buttons de-activate after a short period of time forcing you hit the start button again before you have access to any functions ..... then there's a long delay between when you hit any of the function buttons before the unit responds.That makes you sometimes think that you missed the button so you hit it again and seconds later realize you've hit it twice and now have to work backwards.There's no practical fast-skip function if you are scrolling through file folders e.g. trying to get to the p's in an alphabetically aligned folder so you have to slowly slog through the entire alphabet ..... same thing if you're listening to a lengthy file like a long podcast ---- there isn't a genuine fast-forward function to get to a spot later in the program (there is a button for it but it moves slowly in 1 minute segments and takes forever) .....I would also defy anybody to use this device without having to look down at the screen to find the proper buttons (or even know if they're activated) which is a big problem when walking/jogging or driving.My previous unit a Sandisk had issues of its own but was at least MUCH simpler and far more user-friendly.  I suppose for the price you can only expect so much from this Aiworth but even at under $40 I found it endlessly frustrating and not worth the trouble.Summary - try something else.
4,The battery life is the best thing about it. This was the second cheap MP3 player I bought from Amazon.  The Bluetooth is spotty but it works. I don't know if it's the MP3 player or my other devices. Not a big deal. I'm a wired headphone kind of guy.The buttons on the MP3 player are funny. They work but they're not awesome.I expanded my memory to 128GB. It charges by micro USB.The sound quality is good and loud no distortion but the EQ is weak. It doesn't change enough. Every EQ setting should be different.I would buy again and recommend to a friend. But there are cheap MP3 players on Amazon charging by USB C with better EQ. You exchange more bass more mids more treble for less battery lifeChoose wisely
3,The songs/files I receive this error on (see images) playback fine with no issues when i'm listening through headphones or the built in speaker.Only when I try to playback through my JBL bluetooth speaker do I get the error messages.The only answer I found online related to this issue is essentially this Mp3 player is incompatible with my speaker."It’s got to do with the MP3 player and the extensions of the files that it uses as a post to the big files expected by the other Bluetooth device. Essentially they’re incompatible. They will not work together." -https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/TxBKNQ9912MZN8/I have no other complaints about this device.
4,I like this MP3 player but there's a problem.  As a Bluetooth device it has worked very well so far.  However when I connect the MP3 player with a cable connection there's a problem.The socket connection in the MP3 player isn't built correctly.  If I don't physically hold the cable at the player to one side or the other I get monaural sound.  It isn't the cable because I tried several cables with the same result.  One of the cables is not your standard cheap cable provided with the MP3 player it was a reasonably expensive cable.It seems obvious to me the company didn't manufacture the cable connection very well because I saw a similar comment for another buyer.  Too bad more care in manufacturing needed.
4,Read some of the other reviews and I think it’s a nice device. The interface is a mix of old school (touchy buttons) with some feeling of tactile screen. Don’t be fooled this is not a full tactile screen as others were expecting. The device has enough juice and capacity for what I needed for and it’s nice to have the wireless connectivity to my headphones. The menu is not complicated nor is the interface that many have complained about it really? Play with it don’t wait for the device to read your mind. I was able to transfer music directly from my personal cloud to the device connected via the micro usb cable and using my iPad no issues there.The construction of the device seems top notch and it’s pretty light. It came with headphones that looked like apple earphones micro usb cable and also an arm band if you are into those things. I didn’t use the manual at all to set it up since it’s pretty easy to navigate. I wish the radio function wouldn’t be dependent on the cable connected as antenna but oh well haven’t found a suitable option yet. Lastly the device has a speaker! Not that I will be using it but it has one.I like the radio function although I wish there was a better way to have an antenna built in I don’t like having to connect a cable (either the headphones or other cable like) to get the signal in. Other than that simple to use simple interface and nice capacity.Can’t give 5 stars (at least not yet) because it’s too early in time to see how the battery will behave or how long the device will last under my tenure.
2,Technically this player works: it plays the music files you put in it. Other than that it’s a bust. The UI is very picky (sometimes it responds sometimes not) and there’s a high degree of latency (a delay in the time you press the selection button to the time the unit responds) requiring the user to select a command and then wait several seconds to see if it worked. The unit reads all the metadata and automatically divides files by artist album etc; but it only displays the song title on the screen. Playback seems to be “random” only; I’ve never been able to get it to play an album straight through instead it only plays the tracks in random order. Very bad. Finally after only about 40 hours of use the screen lost more than half its brightness making it extremely difficult to see the display except in a dark room! I’ve used the unit reset button and the factory reset feature twice but the screen stays dark.Don’t waste your money or your time.
5,As someone with autism listening to certain music and sounds helps keep me grounded and calm. I have used MP3 players for calming purposes almost my entire life. When I became in need of a new one (since my last one I got back in 2002) I have bought and tried several different brands and models with mixed performances. Some had horrible sound quality while others lacked in function overall. These became rather stressful for me.When I came upon this one I was extremely surprised by it's overall performance. It was well beyond my expectations.Where I work corded headsets are not allowed so I am restricted to using bluetooth wireless models. Other players I have owned with bluetooth capabilities tend to have low sound quality or a tendency of dropping skipping or lagging the signal which causes moments of "dead air" during a song or calming session even when the player and I are stationary. For me these occurrences are stressful and annoying.I am glad to say that the Aiworth MP3 does NOT have these issues. It had kept a strong signal through the entire day even during periods of heavy motion with not a single pause or break in the music.The player's built-in speaker is also of high quality allow me to instantly switch from my headset to the speaker once I am home. This is minor detail but one I feel should be noticed.
4,I bought this mp3 player because I got a new car that doesn't have a CD player. You can play music in the car through bluetooth or you can plug it into the car's USB port. It doesn't have a touchscreen but the menu is intuitive and easy to use. IT has a good battery life and the sound quality is good.The only complaint I have is that the instructions were written with an experienced user in mind. If this is your first mp3 player or you don't have much experience with them this is how to transfer your music to the device:1. Using the supplied data cable plug your mp3 player into a USB port on the computer. A new window (or a list of options) will automatically pop up within a few seconds.2. Open a second window and find the folder that contains your music.3. Simply select the music you want to transfer and drag and drop (or copy and paste) the music to the mp3 player window.The process will be slightly different if you have a Mac but the concept is the same.
5,No sirve el contacto de audio hace interferencia no recomiendo
3,I know for some people a really small device is good but for me its hard to use the small device.  It works well and sounds good but the user interface is just too small for my moderately large hands.  I would like a player as large as a larger cell phone.
3,It’s a great product for the time being however my power button gotta stuck when I push it in to power it on. Now I’m not able to turn it on.. Now I’m out of $40 bucks
3,I bought mine about nine months ago and the thing started glitching out and randomly turning off this past month! It was a really nice mp3 player while it was still alive however. Stayed connected about 30 feet away around corners and through doors connection was finicky but got the job done. Turned out the lights on the control panel were draining the battery slightly but it kept kicking for hours and hours regardless.Whoever's making these things needs to give these a proper birth because man... it was good while it lasted.
5,This is the 3rd or 4th MP3 player I got for my husband. This is the nicest one! I downloaded all his fav CD's and it was quick and easy! The sound is great! He loves it!
3,User interface is not easy to use the underlying software driving the interface seems to be similar to some of the other mp3 players. No instructions on how to add songs to playlist or how to put MP4 on the device. After connecting this player to my PC it only showed two folders and one for converting video. Yes you have to convert the video to be compatible with this player.
5,Great product and easy to use.
3,I have an old IPOD  Gen 5. I haven't got around to replacing the battery in it. That gen IPOD was the best.It's loud and sounds great with good quality earbuds or head phones. I bought the MP3 player just to have something in the interim. Unfortunately it just doesn't have good volume at least for me. I've been all through the settings and can't seem to find any way to get it any louder or better. I'll probably wind up selling it or giving it to one of my kids. Other than the volume issue it seems to be a descent player.
1,This MP3 player worked great at first.  Everything on my unit worked I tried each and every function on it.  As I had read the complaints about this unit.  A couple of months in my mp3 songs started to give a disruptive sound while playing.  I thought Inhad corrupted files.  NOPE.  The disruption was never in the same place and never on the same song.  Next issue ..it would not turn on......  3rd issue it would only play songs on the 8gb micro disk.  4th issue.  Unit would only come on when the micro disk was installed.  I spent day trying to figure this out.  5th issue:  When micro disk was out I recieved an Disk Error msg.  I spent days Isolating each issue that Popped Up on this thing.  The pictures are taken after windows acknowledgement via sound as the MP3 player is not recognize in windows.  Yes its on.  There is absolutely no Support on this item.  Manufacturer Website has an older download ver than what's on the unit.  Didnt matter as the unit comes on when it wants to.  I spent a little more hoping for a better quality unit.  This would have been a great deal if it only worked.  My unit is 1 year old.  The problems started month 3.  I kept doing work arounds until finally I'm giving up.  You will find same unit under different Names and prices but it's the same unit.  The 32gb is useless because the disk will fail and the disk will not be available. Most of the OS functions still work calendar date time etc.  But forget about playing music.  I still like MP3s as I dont like to have my Thousand Dollar cell phone on me when I doing yard work working on my car painting etc.  I'd rather lose a 50 dollar mp3 player than replace a cell phone because it fell out of my pocket.  Find a unit with a longer warranty then 30 days.  SanDisk worked on the 2nd unit.  But I'm still looking for a replacement unit.  Good luck
2,I am on my fourth (4th) one of these in just two years. The audio jack gave out on the first and the power switch failed on following two. By fail I mean it broke by being pushed into the device. The product is very flimsy.Otherwise I really like this MP3 player. Can be expanded to hold up to 128gb of music. Bluetooth enabled and the perfect size and weight for taking it on hikes runs or trips to the gym. The interface could be more user-friendly and I agree the volume is unreasonably restricted.I hope manufacturer will make sturdier models going forward. A business plan that relies on multiple purchases to turn a profit is a loser. I am pretty sure I'm the only sap who keeps buying a new one after the old one breaks.
4,Only used the player while I mowed the grass and it lasted almost 1 year until it the sound started to sound garbled up while skipping. Made sure it wasn't by Bluetooth headphones since they still sound fine connevted to my phone. Using this player was easy and the sound was OK to get you by but not for the pure audiophile types. Wish it lasted longer but for the price I didn't expect it to last for years (though 2yrs would be a nice run).
5,I’ve had my current MP3 player for well over 14 years. It was the highest capacity hard drive based system at the time and I loaded it up and took it on dozens of international business trips. While it still function the interface to add music was obsolete 3 Windows versions ago. While I’ve looked at a number of products over the years none of them really got my attention until now. The Aiworth Digital MP3 player fits the bill for a replacement MP3 and more. First the product exceeds the capacity of my old unit. Adding music video files pictures and so on is a simple drag and drop through common file managers. It also has built in speakers which really fill up a small room and play without distortion BUT it also has Bluetooth 5.0 built it. I connected this device to my Jabra Elite Active 65ts without any issue and now I can carry thousands of my favorite songs around in my pocket while shopping  mowing the lawn or just lazing about the house.The unit comes with a short micro USB charge cord and a simple get started instruction pamphlet. Mine came set to Russian language but I had no trouble entering the settings menu and changing to English. The instructions are quite basic but maneuvering the menus is a much better means of learning about the capabilities. One thing really sets this apart for me is the Line-in capability via the headphone port. This allowed me to test out the included Record function which offers a great means to capture audible lectures transfer from cassette tapes or even from an existing MP3 source when the PC files have long ago disappeared.I’m still exploring the full functions of this little device but I’m really pleased with everything I’ve tested thus far. I’m glad that I can finally retire my old aging MP3.
2,When I first pulled it out the box I was impressed with how solid it feels and how snappy it loads into the main menu.First hurdle how to get it recognized by the pc. After first trying some other cables I found I HAD to use the one that came with the MP3 player which doesn't bode well for the future.After putting songs on I'm finding there's an issue where if you want to skip too many songs while playing them it will just... crash... Completely. The only option is to restart which luckily only takes a few seconds but just.. Awful.It's not good at handling Metadata like the artist name or album art. It will only show you the track name so it's good if you have the artist name on the track otherwise you're left to identify it with just the track name. Art appears sometimes. I wouldn't be surprised if loading the art is part of the crashing issue I mentioned.The audio on mine has an ever-present low hiss most noticeable when tracks aren't playing. If it gets any louder this is a huge issue.There's probably more issues incoming. I would not buy again or recommend it.
1,This is my first time ever leaving a product review on Amazon. I feel so strongly about this item that I felt compelled to write a review to help manage other's expectations when buying this MP3 player. I purchased this item because the ratings were fairly good and it seemed like an economical choice. However when it arrived it came in an exterior packaging that would be akin to something you would win at a carnival for throwing a plastic ring around the bottle popping the balloons with a dart or squirting the little clown dude with the squirt gun. The packaging was generic with a fancy design but no brand or identifiable markings other than "Digitial MP3 Player". It was clear before opening that this was not a legitimate MP3 player from a reputable manufactuer. I felt like this was a door prize from a free raffle at the local Boy Scout jamboree. My alert-sensors immmediately kicked on.After opening the box and reading the directions which are not logically printed in a mannner that a left-to-right english reader can understand it was clear that this was not going to be an easy setup. Sure the directions had a lot of words but exactly zero words described how to get music files onto the device. It would not connect to a laptop over wifi (by design and explicitly stated as a limitation in the instructions) and multiple laptops would not recognize it as an external storage when plugged in with the provided USB cable. After closer examination it became evident that music must be introduced into the unit through an SD card which was installed in the side of the unit as provided by the manufacturer.Now trying to get the SD card out of the player.... That was an effort in itself. Thank goodness I hadn't cut my fingernails recently otherwise I would have had to go get a screwdriver to poke into the guts of the player to pry the little bugger out after engaging the spring release. It's has to get shoved waaaaaaay down in there for the release to actuate. So with card now out I have to search for my own SD card adapter so it can get plugged into my laptop. So I can save music to it. So it can then get jammed back into the guts of the MP3 player. Which if you mistakenly insert it backwards it comes very close to breaking the SD card and it doesn't have a picture or anything to help you discern which way the SD card goes in. Did the printed directions come in handy here? Uh not a chance.But I digress... I'm getting to the good part. So I insert the SD card into my laptop and the card mounts. And then all heck breaks loose with my virus scanner. Yep. This card from the factory MP3 player has now infected my computer. Full triage mode to stop the bleeding.Do yourself a favor. Don't skimp on an MP3 player. Buy one from a reputable company. Buy one where you can actually verify that the manufactuer is a legitimate business. Don't buy this MP3 player. Don't be like me.
4,Being an MP3 person I have been using separate folders for all albums - forever.  I loaded all my folders to the micro32 with a micro SD adapter directly from my computer (they make micro SD adapters that use USB also).  Instead of going to Music icon I just go to Folder and select what I want to play.  The buttons are pretty simple after a few sessions using the player.  I do use my Airpods as they sound best - along with my Bose headphones (plug in type).  I found that Skullcandy and the others don't sound as deep.  I added over 5000 songs to the 32GB chip - and like the idea of the ability to swap them out.  This player has fair Bluetooth distance but not an issue if you carry it with you (close).  For what I paid this is a great player - time will tell if it lasts.........
5,Bought this in a hurry after my husband's iPod died (right before a planned long airplane trip). It held a LOT of his classical music albums (with plenty of room for more). It's smaller and lighter weight than his iPod...and a whole lot cheaper! He's very happy with this!
3,It is loud which is cool but the am/ fm doesn't connect to local stations. No wifi ability
4,This player has a lot of nice options and that is great if that is what you are looking for.  I only use it for playing music while exercising and have found it mildly annoying.  The record button is frequently triggered when I slide it in or out of the included armband.  It isn't super simple or user friendly - especially if you don't need all the extras.  The design would be much better if it had the volume buttons on the side to easily increase or decrease the volume rather than having the activate the screen and make sure you are in the correct screen to change it.  While I'll keep it around for the occasional use I will look for a more simple straight forward option of playing music while exercising.  Again I think it is a nice MP3 if you want all the extras.
4,Good little starter mp3 player. It's not easy to hook it up to bluetooth devices for some reason but overall a pretty good product.
5,Bought this for my son as a replacement for the one that he broke and so far so good! And for anyone who has a teenager they know exactly what I'm saying! He is rough on his stuff and this one has survived 😁 great sound too!
3,Usage is a little bit complicated
4,Unit arrived timely in great condition.  There is a little one big page instruction with the unit but it is pretty much useless.  Nonetheless I did get the unit charged and some music files transferred to the TK card.  The music played on the device (so it must have some type of speaker.  It comes with headphones (wired) which I have not yet used.  I got it to connect with my Blue Tooth Speaker.  It took a couple of days to figure out how to do that.  Note you need to know how to connect from the device AND from the speaker too.  I got it to work once but have not yet done it a second time -- I am assuming it works.  I would like to do playlists with it but it does not look like it has a function to create playlists though there is a Playlist feature on the menu.  From what I have read in other reviews you need to put your music in files and play that way.So far OK but I am still in my early days trying to make it work.  I did contact the company and they responded quickly so the customer service seems to be good.
3,The power button collapsed and I am therefore unable to turn on or off the player.  Also the battery is not holding the change anymore.  Work well while it was working.
2,If you charge the battery too long it dies and never comes back to life.  They warned me in the instructions not to charge past some time that I can't remember.  I charged this for 24 hours.  INSTANT DEAD.  Also the interface is set up to look like a touch screen.  But it is not a touch screen.  User UNFRIENDLY.  That battery though... putting this in A different perspective-  If I put too much gas in my car it never runs again.  If I feed my dog too much she immediately dies.  Too much toothpaste on my toothbrush dissolves the bristles...and so on and so on.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I like this little MP3 player a lot.  Interface is similar to many other MP3 players in this price range so there isn't a learning curve.  It's capable of playing music video FM and recording audio.  Has a neat little ebook reader (not a lot of features and the screen is tiny...so...I guess if you have an emergency and need to read something...).  The external speaker is actually kind of impressive for a device this small.  Gets pretty loud!It's a pretty complete little package and I don't just mean all the accessories.  I like the capacitive touch controls under the screen.  You can't accidentally press anything because they don't respond unless the screen is gone.  For keeping in my pocket that's pretty perfect.  Also has a dedicated record button which would be handy for taking voice memos or recording lectures in class.Video is kind of silly for a screen this small but I guess if you want to watch music videos it's kinda cool.  Definitely not going to be watching any movies on it.  HahaBluetooth connection stays strong even in another room.  I've been playing to to a BT speaker off and on for several days and it never loses connection.  Included earbuds aren't very good but this does connect to BT speakers just fine.  With some good wired earbuds this provides high quality sound as well.  I was NOT able to connect this to BT in my car but the AUX cable works fine.This would be a great MP3 player for someone who wants something kinda stylish on a budget.  Highly comparable to other players in this price range and exceeded my expectations in a few areas.  Definitely beats some of the more expensive offerings from AGPTek.  The arm band fits it well but I prefer to just toss this in the glovebox or in my pocket.  Rather listen to this than waste data on my phone for sure!
4,Once I figured out how to add my music files so they show up under the music categories this is a nice MP3 player.  Help and documentation was no help at all for adding the music files and it appears that a lot of folks had the same issue to the point of calling this junk and returning it.  That's why I'm giving it a 4 rating.  I'd highly recommend that the documentation be updated to include the steps.  For those looking for this answer for Windows files here's the basic steps.  In my case I was working with Windows 7 but Windows 10 steps are pretty much the same.1 - Connect the MP3 player to your computer using the USB cable2 - Go to My Computer and locate the MP3 player (in my case it was F:)3 - Add a new folder to the MP3 player (in my case I used F:\My_Music_Files)4 - Copy your computer's music files5 - Paste the music files into the folder you created in step #36 - Once your music files have been copied over right click the folder you created in step #3 select 'Include in Library' then select the 'Music' library.  You should now be able to see all your music in the various menu options on the MP3 player.
4,Easy to use. Lots of memory on the card supplied. I bought it to play music so can't comment on the other features Ebooks etc. The only thing I miss from my last player is this doesn't show the artist in the "now playing" screen. With all the memory available I ripped every CD I've ever bought since the 80's. Some I haven't listend to in decades so now when a old song comes up in shuffel mode I keep thinking "who did this song". Most I can Remember but others not so much.
5,Enjoy my music in my auto & and on my walks
5,The sound could go a little louder.
3,The product is ok for the most part. The interface could have been a but simpler to use.
3,First off I like that this has it's own built in speaker at home I don't have to dig out headphones or connect it to bluetooth speakers etc. I can be out with my friends and we talk about music and i can quickly grab this thing and play something to see if it's what they're talking about easier to use this than a phone and it's louder than my phone.I wish the arm band actually fit. I don't imagine it was designed to be worn on the forearm but wearing it on my upper arm it's tight and I'm not particularly sitting here with body builder biceps but I don't have a marathon runner's smaller physique either. However that's not why I bought this so that's really a non-issue.I wish the writing on the display was devoted more to showing words so I can see what's playing instead of mostly taken up with an animated bar graph that appears to pulsate in a way totally unrelated to the beat of whatever music is playing.I bought this to use instead of the Oakcastle mp3 player I use in my work truck because it has a larger screen so I thought (wrongly) that I'd be able to read it more easily velcroed to the dash than that one. The Oakcastle remains my music source of choice at work but at home this one doesn't go unused.Nice touch that it actually comes with it's own removeable 32GB micro SD card
3,The screen is really hard to see when outside and the way the buttons are setup make it hard to use.If you're looking for something to shuffle music it works good.Very wonky to search thru songs tho.Bluetooth worked fine and battery seems to hold charge good so far
3,I don't like how it shuts off if you pause it for more than 3 or 4 minutes.
5,To listen through Bose 700 Bluetooth headphones
4,I bought thus mp3 a few weeks ago and I think it’s great! It’s very clear easy to use once you get the hang of it and comes with its own earplugs. It also can play without headphones ir s speaker which is a great addition. The things I don’t like are the that you can’t see the full title of the song you were playing. It doesn’t sound so bad UNTIL you realize you have a bunch of songs from the same artist and you don’t know which one is which and you have to sift through all the songs to find the one you want.  Also the instructions were unhelpful in downloading the songs. It was confusing and not fun to figure out but once I figured it out it was easy to download more. Overall great product!
4,This is a beautifully designed and appears to be a well built device. My main concerns is the limitations of its instruction manual. This has nothing to do with the author's limited skills in English. For example although it tells how to listen to music on the mp3 player it does not tell how to get music into the player. There is no tech support on the manufacturers minimal web site and my e-mail to their support site was not returned. However I found that entering a description of my problems in the comments area of the product page brought up all comments related to my problem. This proved helpful. I could also get tech support through a link in the "Orders" page of the "Accounts & Lists" menu at the top right of the page. I still have not figured out how to get music into the "Genres" and "Playlists" areas on the player (entered via the "Music" icon). For those who complain about having to load music one item at a time on this mp3 player this is not the case. I've been able to transfer entire files of many  musical pieces at a time. These appear under the "Folders" icon on the main screen. Each folder maintains its original name.
4,The interface is a little challenging since it is not touch screen but after a little practice it’s not too bad. I wanted to use it for singing practice but the speaker is not loud enough for me. If you don’t need the speaker and you are patient enough to sit and figure out how to navigate it’s a good little player for the price
4,Good MP3 player downloaded an audiobook. One problem is that if I’m not paying attention I can’t rewind a part without restarting the chapter and skipping forward to the point I missed it’s time consuming and I mess up the settings most times skipping a whole chapter ahead.
4,Got this lil mp3 for work I work in a loud shop type environment so haveing something like this was must the design is light fits in my pocket easily the battery life lasts pretty long just like it says Bluetooth works great the only faults ive had with it thus far are that the buttons have somehow jammed to the point where it just keeps selecting or scrolling but that was easily fixed the other problem is the volume  it won't go higher than 31 on the devise it self ive had to do a work around by adjusting the volume on my bluetooth headset that I have in order to hear certain songs better but mind you this is in a loud work area that Im using it in so others mite have no problem with this would definitely recommend this product to someone who needs a inexpensive decent mp3.
4,I received my product and after charging the battery I connected to my computer to start downloading music. My computer did not recognize the device (Win 10). There was nothing on the instructions about how to connect for downloading music. Went to the manufacturers site to see if there was a driver needed to recognize the device and could not find anything. I ended up removing the TF (Micro SD card) and using an adapter I connected to the computer. I downloaded a couple of albums and tried playing from the device. Could not find the albums I had downloaded. You have to reset the playlist in order for the device to read and sort the albums. After that I downloaded several albums and ~600 songs got it resorted and it worked fine. Battery life is excellent better than I expect and was able to play continuously for over 10 hours.  I connect to an amplifier so I play at low volume from the device and control volume from he amplifier. Not sure if  you play at high volume and battery life. Overall happy but a lot of time wasted due to lack of clear instructions.
2,Limited Bluetooth capability. This production looks like a very good value initially. Bought it because of Bluetooth. This player is not too intuitive when scanning for bluetooth device. Takes a while to connect and you have to go through a couple of steps to connect. After that then I discovered a big flaw. You can only use bluetooth while listening to mp3 if you want to watch a video the player asks to disconnect your bluetooth device. In my case JBL bluetooth earbud. Second flaw is that the sound volume is not that loud when compared to other devices. It's like its on half volume when sound is on max "31". After I discovered these 2 major flaws I've decided to return this item.
4,I've been using an IPOD to play music through a good quality speaker for a number of years.  The IPOD died and I needed a replacement.  Modern day IPODs are too expensive so I purchased an MP3 player.  There were a few challenges downloading the music saved on my computer but I was able to do it even though I'm of a generation that is not great with computers.  The player works great when it is hard wired to the speaker.  It is easy to use and the sound is good quality.  I have not been able to make it work reliably with bluetooth.  That is the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating.
5,I like how small it is
4,Originally I wasn’t very confident about the idea of an MP3 player. But this product is actually very handy. It’s no iPhone but it definitely gets its job done. In fact I find it way more convenient for me at the moment my phone is very old and stopped working earlier this year so I’ve been phone-less for a while. It’s no big problem since the whole epidemic thing I haven’t had to go outside much so there’s no rush in getting a new one. While waiting for the new deals on iPhones though I ran into a problem I love taking walks and going on long drives while listening to music. This is perfect for that. If you like going on runs in the morning then it’s perfect if you like laying down and listening to music it’s perfect if you like going on drives and turning on some music it’s perfect or even if you like walking around outside for a breath of fresh air there’s nothing music can’t help with. I personally enjoyed how compact this product is. It’s very lightweight and easy to use so you can pretty much carry it anywhere with a pair of headphones. I’d give this a 4/5 it’s a solid product and I love music.
5,I’ve been through a number of MP3 players in this price range. This is the best I’ve used. Like the others the user interface isn’t great but it’s usable. It excels in Bluetooth strength and pairing. Once paired to my Jabras when I put in the buds in and turn on the player it automatically connects. And the connection is strong with very few baubles. It rivals my iPhone in this respect. It’s also easy to get back to where you left off. Besides the music player I haven’t used any other apps except the radio which like the others requires use of wired buds or phones. Others have commented on lack of shuffle and poor use of playlists. Can’t really comment on that as I don’t use those functions  but my impression is that other players in this category have the same deficits.  You can make a list on your computer but it’s painstaking. Using a combination of letters and numbers you can put them in any order you want and put them on the SD card. It will keep them and play them in order and as I said before it’s easy to go back to where you were ( navigate to last played). It  is painstaking to make the list this way. I’ve been putting my list together for years and it’s up to over 1300 selections (no repeats many an hour or more) taking up over 13 gb. It’s plays many hours before starting over. I listen about 10 or more hours a week and it takes weeks or months to go through it.
5,Before buying this I tried a $20 device before and was a bad experience - the screen was cluttered pixelated and never showed the song title!This device is extremely readable and easy to navigate. Plus I love the choices for music play -1. Play from all songs list.2. Sort music in three available playlists and play from those.3. My favorite - Just transfer folders from Windows 10 into main drive of the player and there is a folder option that allows you to play music from whatever folder you want (as opposed to the three playlists)When playing title time elapsed and total time of file are very obvious and readable -crystal clear. Sound is what it is. I listen via Bluetooth on my MPow headphones. No complaints. I use indoors so can't vouch for or contest some reviews that have mentioned volume being weak when playing outdoors.Keep in mind at $40 this is a value purchase and for what it is I give it five stars. Probably why it's the #1 seller on Amazon for mp3 players..  I think some criticisms here may be unfair - you can't dock 3 stars off a Toyota Prius because it's not a LandRover!There are other music players that go up in price quite a bit. Right now I'm also in the process of restoring my old iPod video - parts $50 (front cover and battery) plus time needed and risk of breaking the thing but years ago I had spent $400 on it so figure it's worth a try - songs still sound amazing on it.
2,If you only have a few music files or just want to listen to everything on shuffle then this is OK.  User Interface is really awkward clunky and slow.  It technically works but poorly.If you have more than 4 albums for an artist it won't display more than 4.  It also will not include more than 4 albums in the All Songs option under an artist.Terrible Support from Aiworth.  Not sure where they are located.  They could not understand the basic issues I noted above and respond with anything useful or relevant.  Responding ""Yes it does work" is not an appropriate Customer Support response.
4,The sound quality is great until we try to use headphones or ear buds.  This belongs to my 11 year old son and he said that when he tries to use it with headphones that he can only hear the lyrics from the songs but the music is very faint.  We are having a hard time connecting it to ear buds with Bluetooth.  Overall it is a good starter music player for an 11 year old but not super user friendly.
3,It is a good device but I tried several  regular earphones of 16 ohms and no bass sound was reproduced. I used the same wired earphones with Sansa mp3 player also with my cellphone and the bass is great. probably with high impedance headphones the bass improve but I used it for running with earphones. The specs should include the  recommended coupling earphones impedance.I'm not sure if with software update it can be fixed but where can I downloaded?
3,I wanted to like this player.  However the loudest volume setting was too low to use in my car.  BT worked fine with my earbuds.
3,I wanted an MP3 player to listen to podcasts as I fell asleep to save my phone battery. Corded earbuds hurt my ears (even the ones meant for sleepwear) fell out and got tangled. So I liked the speaker feature on this device.I appreciated the ability to create folders and sub-folders to organize my sound files and the device synced easily with iTunes on my laptop. One downside was the minimal number of characters for the title listing on the device.There was also a sleep function which I also appreciated. Unfortunately it is by time (in 5-min intervals) rather than the end of an episode. Also it's not easy to get to so you have to navigate across several buttons to get to it. It's a bit tedious if you're still awake and want to set up another podcast as you have to reset the sleep timer and then navigate back to the soundfile folders to select another podcast (or vice versa).What ultimately led to 3 stars is that after 3 or 4 months I would get an error notice. First it would work after I restarted. Then it required a restart by inserting a pin into the restart button (the vendor was very helpful in recommending this). Finally nothing helps and it just doesn't work after 6 months.
5,Very happy with this player - compact lightweight and great sound. Uses plug-in headphones which is what I wanted. Also very easy to load with songs from my PC.
5,This met all of my expectations.
3,How do I fix the fact that it no longer has sound on the left side?
4,I like the weight and BT feature but just like most MP3 players it doesn't put the music in the same order it is uploaded.  If the music has embedded code of the band or musician the player files it in alphabetical order even if you change the file name.  Touch pad is sensitive.  If you'rev just a little off one of the "buttons" it will do the one next to the one you  want.  Overall it's a nice player.  Changing the music order of upload is annoying.
2,The music storage is good. Volume with the headset is good. Overall was a good buy.However My device screen went snow white in 1 week of getting it. No water damage no physical damage just went snow white out of nowhere. Now I am hurdling hoops to find out how I am going to get this dealt with. Website does not give contact information Amazon is a maze and the only thing I will be able to do is try now is the email sent to me with the product. Not sure if this is a random issue with the screen but first time I have had to look for a replacement or exchange on here.
2,It is really difficult to navigate its touch response is pretty slow. It also has lights for buttons but the lights are so bright and cannot be changed in brightness level. It is what it is advertised as and not the worst ever! The quality is good and has some features but really not much. Not the best not the worst. I hate the folders system it's hard to make custom playlists and to play from them and the back button exits everything and I can't find the now playing very quickly.
5,I have only written a couple reviews in my time. I felt this one was of those times due to many negative reviews. I always had iPods and was really skeptical about buying something like this. This mp3 player does exactly what I need. It plays music in my car and to my headphones. It is super easy to use and transfer files to. The sound quality when hooked up to headphones or directly to the car via aux cable or usb connection is supreme.  Sounds better then the old ipod in my opinion. The bluetooth connection (to my car) is not the best. It is really low if you turn the player volume all the way up the sound gets very distorted and sounds terrible.  I use the aux cable or the usb connection anyways. This player does support all of the files it lists. However some files will only play over the bluetooth...like .flac files. Not all file types play from the aux/usb connection.  There are a lot of reviews that are negative but its due to user error and lack of knowledge on how to use the product. If you are looking for a mp3 player that works and sounds great this is the one unless you only use bluetooth products. You def lose sound quality and volume. 5 stars all day for me I dont use bluetooth. The price is way better then forking over 300 plus for an ipod just to play music.
4,I have had this product for the past 4 months. I have found that the Alworth makes a good product and that they stand behind their product when there is a problem even if it is "operator error".  They will work with you until the problem is resolved. That being said I have been extremely happy with the MP3 player. I have loaded over 2000 songs which I listen to while exercising. The sound quality is excellent and the battery life is outstanding. For the price it is an good value
2,I purchased an Aiworth MB08 Mp3 player. It would not stay connected to two bluetooth listening devices (Tozo NC2 earbuds ;Honsenn headphones). These bluetooth devices stay connected and work properly with cell phones. I requested a replacement MB08. It did not stay connected to my bluetooth devices either. The manufacturer suggested resetting the device with a needle. This did not change the MB08's behavior. I returned the replacement for a refund. I gave the device 2 stars because its sound quality user interface and price are competitive.
2,Sound quality is very good and the device feels solidly made.However the Bluetooth often has dropouts if you move the player at all while it's playing. Even holding it in your hand impairs the Bluetooth Link. So it's fine if you press play and put it down and leave it alone within a few yards of your Bluetooth receiver.This player does not show up in all computers when you hook it up via the USB connection. There is no support available to show you what to do if this happens. So file transfer will not happen for you unless you take it around to the other available computers in your world to see if you can find one where it will work for you.The player looses where you are in an album if you back out of it to do anything. It does continue playing but if you try to advance or retard to the next or previous track or so you won't be able to. You have to go back into the Album Folder and manually click the track you want to play and the player will continue from the start of the track you clicked on. It will skip trough the track like fast forwarding if you want. So if you want to make an Equalizer choice while playing a track you will have to change the track by doing what I explained.It's an MP3 Player not a phone with a MP3 Player. I got this because they are doing away with MicroSD Cards in Cell Phones. So the world is going backwards without the Ease and Happiness of Customers in their concerns. If your phone stops working everything on the small and limited internal drive is gone unless you do frequent backups and make room for things when the internal drive gets full.
4,My Sandisk died after many years use so tried this one.  Miss the wheel but this one works well. Just taking me time to get used to it. I listen to a lot of my music on this device and am beginning to like it better than my old one.
3,OVERALL: better than the average mp3 sold on this site in this price range.Interface: Buggy on being identified by a MacProTower ( experienced videographer)File structure: jumps around using the buttons which light up and serve as your navigation.  Playlists are easy to create but if  you load a file of music from iTunes the unit may not recognize it and place the file as UNKNOWN. I recommend placing all those unknowns into a playlist.BLUETOOTH: As advertized using a Sony Bluetooth speaker.  You may have to re pair every time you hook up to a speaker.Built in Speaker: very good quality for checking a song out.Battery length: did not use it that long yet.Interface: Watch out for labeling your files correctly.EASE of TRANSFER and PLAYING: THIS UNIT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE m4a files which are common when transferring a CD to a computer. YOU WiLL NEED TO HAVE A WAY TO CONVERT m4a files to mp3.Otherwise its a handy dandy mp3 player to take to the gym beach or party.  I would not try to record anything musical using the built in mic for recording its just for note taking.
5,I bought this in March as a birthday gift for my 9 year old after a bad experience with a cheaper MP3 player. My son uses this for hour every single day. 100% recommend this to anyone who loves music. It's a great player and I really have nothing negative to say about it.Transferring files is so easy. I use a MacBook Air and have had zero issues transferring MP3s. Works great.The built in speaker is really decent considering how small this thing is. I got a bluetooth speaker for my son to use this with but he never uses that he just uses the built-in speaker instead! He really likes the sound of it. The battery runs down quite fast but I suppose that's probably because he plays songs out loud all the time! I imagine it would probably last longer if he would use headphones like normal people... :)I bought a silicone case to put on it when my son is using it around the house because I felt nervous about it potentially getting dropped etc. and I wanted some level of protection. I couldn't find one made for this brand but I got one that was made for the Soulcker MP3 player and it fits almost perfectly. When we're out at the playground he wears it in the armband case included with this player. Fun stuff.
3,Product is easy to use and the sound without the Ear Buds is good.  I had the MP3 player for about 35 days when the left side of the Ear Buds stopped working only the right side of the Ear Buds now works.  I tired a few other Ear Buds that I have and got the same results.  I used the Ear Buds on another device and they worked fine.  Since I bought this over 30 days ago I can't send it back.  I will have to live with only one side of the Ear Buds working not really happy with this product when I have only had it for over a month.
4,Bought this MP3 to use the Bluetooth feature to connect to my car or in my deliver van while working.  Works great for that though sound is not that great quality decent but you have to turn the vehicle stereo up a lot to hear it.  Two things I don't like is you cannot see the screen well in sunlight even with backlight always on and brightness all the way up its hard to see even in darker conditions. The touchscreen takes some getting used to as its very sensitive. The other thing I do not like is the Radio feature does not work in the USA.  The frequencies are set for Japan so nothing will come in on the radio here in San Diego CA (yes I used the headphones as suggested for the antenna).  Other than these few things its great that is holds 32GB with removable storage.  I have over 50 full albums on it with room to add.
4,In the begining it used to work very well but then after a month I started to have some problems with the sound. But  in the overall it is a good MP3.
3,Good Luck Trying to Figure How To Use.  I guess the hardware is pretty good bit good luck in trying to figure out how to use it.  I could not figure out how to use this device by using the directions.  I had to rely on my tech-sense and good ole' hunt and peck & trial and error.  The little picture with the ID of the buttons has mistakes.  Please point out my error but I could not find any instructions on using the device as an external USB drive for drag and drop loading of files from a desktop.  I could find no way to move files from the RECORD location to the Music Section etc. etc.There are way too many options and confusing directions.  But if you kinda' know what you are trying to accomplish and are good at manipulating your environment then the device will serve its intended purpose.
4,I wasn't even expecting to be blown away. From the packaging to product AND..it came with an exercise case I wasn't aware was included. Someone said it doesn't have a speaker..it does. I was able to connect to wireless buds and my Bose. The volume is perfect. Isn't what I'm sued to with the bass from other devices played on my Bose headphones and speaker..but it does the job.I was a bit disappointed when connecting it Bluetooth in my car. It doesn't read the tracks or show pictures like it does on the device itself. It just says China on the screen AND for some reason it skips and you can hear static. It doesn't do that when using my phone or ipod..so I'm not sure. Still happy I was able to dump all my music in it. After Google Play cancelled their music app..I didn't have a place to store my music and purchase in one place. It is what it is. Im happy.
4,If you're familiar with using an MP3 player this player is for you.  If you're a beginner you will need someone to show you how to use it.  Instructions are not written with the beginner in mind.  They don't tell you what each button does.  With that said here's my observations:PRO:- Has built-in speaker so you can play without earphones if you want- Has lots of memory- Paired nicely with my bluetooth speaker- Automatically shuts itself off after a minute or so of no activity to save battery- Look and feel of player is nice love the rounded edgesCON:- Can't figure out how to shuffle songs within a folder- Buttons are not intuitive mostly trial and error ... mostly error- Display shuts off too quickly can be frustrating if you're slow
5,This is a nice MP3 player. It keeps the charge fairly well and is easy to use.
3,Junk
3,Good value sound could be better
3,The unit powers down constantly and I have to reset it.The sound quality is poor.I will not purchase this product again. I only use the music feature.I can't speak for the other parts.
4,I bought this to replace an older player and was surprised that it came with a 32 GB removable memory card.  Vague instructions for all features and nothing on how to transfer music from PC to the player.  The website provided my the seller was rejected by my PC security as a "threat" so no support was available.  A previous question on Amazon said to just load a folder with all of your music onto the player and I then just used the folder option on the player.  The "music" icon on the player has no function.  It took a bit of trial and error to master the setup but I was successful.  The quality of this player is very good and I recommend.  I removed one star for the incomplete instructions.
5,I bought 2 mp3 players to compare. I bought the Aiworth and the soulcker to compare they both had ther Pros and Cons.They are both good in there own aspects. I have only use Apple so these were a first for me.The AiworthPROsVery lightCan hold up to a 256gb micro sd card ( I have not tried this yet) but have been told by many it will hold it.Easy to use after you get the hang of it.CONSHard to set up if you are not used to mp3 players besides Apple.Here is for people who have trouble because you can only email them for help. They really need to setup a help site with directions for beginners.1. If your using windows you have to use windows media player. Don't worry my itunes ( I had it itunes open) music library automatically opens it in the windows media player.2 Now I plugged in my mp3 player after I opened windows but you should be able to do it before ( I just have not done it this way yet).3 drag and drop to the player mine comes up on the right side.4. It is a good player once you figure out how to do it. It took me 2 days and I am still waiting on a email from them to tell me how to do it.
5,Bought this for my 81 year old dad and he loves it. He is technologically challenged and he has no issues be able to use it. Battery life is good and paired with his Bluetooth speaker has good sound quality and gives him great options to listen to all his favorites on his kayak or just sitting on his front porch. Good buy for the money and we’ll made!
3,I am having a great deal of difficulty getting my Itunes music onto this device.  Being technology challenged I was extremely disappointed there were no instructions for syncing this device.  I probably should have purchased a refurbished Ipod instead.
5,As a lifelong NPR listener I've struggled in recent years to get decent reception anywhere in North San Diego County except on my car radio. Reception was especially horrible indoors even with powered antennas. All Things Considered and other favorite shows were virtually impossible to hear clearly unless I wanted to jump in my car and go for a pointless drive. This radio/player has provided me with a simple and effective solution. Using the wired ear buds as an antenna I am able to listen to all programs broadcast from my local NPR station with crystal clear reception even inside my home. The MP3 player is also brilliant although many of my music files had to be converted from MP4 to MP3 using a free cloud converter. Haven't had a chance to record anything yet but I have no doubt that function will perform as well as the radio and player. Note: there is as always with new devices somewhat of a learning curve but the interface is actually very easy to manage. For newbies if you are unable to figure out how to add your music files to the player keep in mind that it is basically just a USB drive with controls. In other words just plug it in to your computer using the USB cable and it will show up as a folder icon on your desktop that you can drag your MP3 files into.
3,Overall the unit is good for listening to music.  I would like to have had a unit that would allow easy setup of playlists.  This unit unless I'm overlooking something requires each song to be added to a playlist one song at a time.  I was hoping to be able to connect to my PC and set up the playlist by drag and drop.  I was not able to figure out how to create a playlist and add songs with ease.  Very time consuming to set up a playlist with over 800 song files to search through.  Nuf said!!
5,This is a great little MP3 with a flash card to store your recordings instead of internal memory.  This works really well since it is easy to pop out the 32 GB micro card and insert it into a flash drive on my computer and then copy the recordings from the computer to the flash card.  I like to listen to historical podcasts when walking or driving and quickly loaded the flash drive with 14.7 GB of MP3 files or 374 podcast files.  Note that it is important to perform this work on the computer because a file structure is needed to keep the podcasts organized since the traditional music meta-data does not work for podcast files without a lot of cleanup work using the file properties edit function.  I will probably get another flash drive just for music since flash cards are very inexpensive. This makes this MP3 very flexible and expandable.  The user interface is fairly intuitive and the podcasts are clear.  Also I did not have any issues with the volume and had to turn it down when using the headphones.  I have not tried music yet so the comment from someone else may still be valid.  At this point after just a few hours I believe this is a great MP3 and a great value. I highly recommend it.
4,it I did like the way works. The screen is small but that is okay I need it for sound not display.I think it could do better to have a nicer interface. Hard to move around and find thing. Battery is very good.
5,I'm still learning on this thing the only thing I do have a problem with is that downloaded songs from my iTunes and some of them do not play they skip over it so I'm going to try to reformat the card and be download them instead of taking the card out and put it in a card reader and see if that doesn't do the trick if it don't then I have a problem I will always have my songs all 5765 songs from the 1930s up to today music. This mp3 will not play mp4 music and music today on iTunes is mp4.
2,I purchased this as a birthday present for my daughter in April of 2021. Now it is September of 2022 the battery died and no matter what we tried it will not charge! I cannot believe this product is so cheap did not even last a year and half! My daughter is heartbroken I will not recommend this product to anyone!!!
3,No tiene manual de uso en español. No especifica el riempo que dura la carga.
4,I really like the radio and how I can personalize this mp3 player.  There are a few things I disliked about the device. It gives you the option of downloading music but when I tried it wouldn't work at all. Another thing is the E-book I never read digitally and this is supposed to be a mp3 player not a laptop or  i-pad. The battery life on this tiny device is HUGE! I charge it for about 25-30 minutes and it goes from 0-100%. Plus the sound quality is great even with the head phones I can here it from about 10 ft away. The user interface is easy to access but I think before you start using it  You should start reading the instructions first so you understand how to use it.
2,I bought this mp3 to listen to music on the job since phones aren't allowed but this thing is kinda bad half of the music i downloaded wont load it lags and stops working sometimes and once it lags your stuck on that screen forever until it runs out of battery then it will start working again so if you can don't just buy it because of the low price compared to other mp3's it will probably be better if you buy a high quality mp3 for a couple more bucks and ACTUALLY get your moneys worth overall 2/10
3,The way it operates is a bit screwy...the set up is such that it saved to a files directory not music directory. This makes it such that you can accidentally delete your music.
3,The surface scratches easily.  It doesn't seem to automatically reconnect to my car bluetooth -- i have to manually choose to connect it every single time.  The display is hard to read in bright sunlight and the letters are too small unless you have good eye sight.
5,I got this for my sons 13th birthday as a gift of responsibility and his new chapter into teenage years… I was Amazed to figure out I could easily upload songs and files to the mp3 player 200 plus song… With room to spare for him to add as he grows… I found it was easy and user friendly nothing wrong with the quality especially for the cost..It’s a real deal sound quality and durability is truly remarkable the craftsmanship of this product and easy to use and make personal truly made a 13yr old happy as can do or go where ever always with his tunes in reach….he even falls asleep listening and truly I feel not a better quality life of battery and easy to use interface with adjusting to his teen age needs and clumsy ways perfect price for a perfect product beyond the value a must get product.  Perfect size to travel and it’s not only playing preloaded songs but he can listen to fm radio on the go to keep up with the hot songs of today’s music whenever and where ever…
4,This is an excellent player for the money.  (It plays more than just MP3's as advertised.)  Excellent sound quality.  Very full-featured.  (I only use it as an MP3 player so I can't comment on the other functions.)  My only complaint - 4 stars instead of 5 - is that the instructions are absolutely worthless; not Chinglish but confusingly written and incomplete.  Be prepared to be frustrated until you figure it out.  Plays MP3's in alpha order (except if shuffled of course).  One downside is that it shuffles across all folders not just the current folder.  It also responds to commands - volume skip pause etc - from BT headphones.  It acts like a flash drive when linked to your computer so file transfer is easy. Overall well recommended.
5,Ordered this because all I wanted was an MP3 player. I already have an iPod but didn't want to go thru the headaches of having to use iTunes to upload or backup my device (like I have to with my iPod). This MP3 Player loaded directly (and quickly !) from my laptop and by creating folders on the device I can now play ANY song by ANY artist in ANY order I want (either alphabetically chronologically or randomly). I thought only iPods could do that. This is much smaller and lighter than my iPod. The sound quality is excellent for such a small device. The instructions on how to set it up/use it were not that great but I figured it out rather quickly by trial and error. The battery charged quickly and held the charge for an extended time (I only use the device while on morning and evening walks). I've loaded over 1200 songs so far and plan to add many many more since there is ample space for them. I don't use any function on the player except playing music - that's enough for me for this price. I highly recommend this device.
5,I bought this little MP3 player to replace an old Samsung bought many years ago.  Technology has really leapt forward over the years and this Aiworth is a massive improvement.  Not only is the memory MUCH improved but the sound quality too.  Ok...the built is speaker is not too brilliant but connect it to something decent and it's pretty impressive.  Now to be clear I had not planned to use it that much...just a bit....BUT...I found some Soundcore speakers which I paired it up with and it totally transformed this little baby!  It is better than playing music on my PC and even my CD/cassette player.  As an older person I was not up on Blue Tooth technology but it was easy to set up with the speakers.  The MP3 player is pretty easy to set up too...the instructions are not brilliant but it does not take much figuring out.  You can download music from your PC via the drag and drop method...easy!  In short...it is VERY impressive with decent speakers...get some really good ones like I did and it might just blow you away!
2,The product comes in a nice clean box. Packaging is great. unfortunately the blue tooth feature fails to connect to any of my devices. So i plugged the device into my speaker with a cord. The songs often cut in and out i tried different cords to confirm it wasn't the cord. I noticed that if I tried to change the volume on the device the playback cut in and out frequently. Overall the device is very finicky as if it has a hard time processing its own features...
3,I like that this MP3 player has a lot of capability. They packed a lot in. From recording to audiobooks to music to video (haven’t figured out how to get one on there yet) to radio to files and folders to plenty of control settings.Unfortunately not too long after using the player only one side of the headphones works (it’s not the headphones. I tried many).If you’re an audiobook person you can bookmark. It’s just not convenient. You have to click around a bit to save and then you need to remember your chapter and then go to bookmarks.Overall it’s not bad for the price as long as you don’t have an issue with the headphone jack.
5,I read a ton of reviews that complained about playlists but bought it anyway. Transferred all my songs using Windows Media Player but unable to drag and drop or otherwise transfer playlists. I used Media Go (already downloaded for my old MP3 player) and it worked great! Well worth the trial and error! Unit feels solid not cheap plastic. Sound quality straight from the player is what you'd expect. However it's awesome through bluetooth! Battery life is pretty good too.
5,This MP3 player is AWESOME! I had an iPod 5th gen that I was using to play music in my car. It worked great but someone stole it from my car so it forced me to buy another one. I decided to look at alternatives instead of going back to apple products. I have lots of those by the way. I came across this one and ppl were complaining that the volume level max at 21 is way too low. Maybe they’re using the headphones that came with the player but while using it in my car it’s VERY LOUD! What impressed me the most are 2 things:1. There are equalizer settings to use but I left it on eq off and it sounds perfect! With the iPod I had to play with a few settings and still wasn’t satisfied with the sound quality2. When you set a song or track to play it automatically closes the player so you don’t accidentally press a button and change the track etc. If you shut down the player you can continue right where you left off. The iPod didn’t have that feature the track history was erased.I have just installed it today and LOVE IT! If I could give it 10 stars I would!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!
3,Not compatible with Spotify unless you purchase a separate app which allows Spotify music to be added to your Mp3. We did this easier to keep our Spotify we’ve had for years will pay the additional app fee monthly.It is compatible with iTunes but who wants to pay that much for each song? Nope.It is compatible with Apple Music but we already had Spotify didn’t want the hassle of moving hundreds of songs over; and not all were available from Apple Music.There are other apps that supposedly are compatible with a monthly fee but we didn’t trust no-names.Bottom line keeping Spotify with the additional app was easiest and now our kids can listen to music at night without the temptation of internet/text/etc.
5,I use this for sound healing for my clients. They love it. I love the easy user interface and quality. Great find for a great price!
5,I use my phone for way too much other stuff to use it as an MP3 player on top of everything else. I just want a simple music player so I can listen to my own music without having to go download apps and clear out storage space. I don't always want my phone with me especially if I'm out on a walk and don't want to be interrupted by texts and email notifications. This has been the PERFECT replacement for my old 2nd gen iPod and doesn't make me jump through a hundred hoops to transfer over music from my iTunes library.Charges with a basic micro usb which is super convenient. Easy to use. Good sound quality. SUPER lightweight. Battery has lasted through multiple long flights (which I can't say for my phone OR my old iPod). Transferring music is quick and simple. It's as easy as plugging it into your computer opening up the folder and dragging your files over.I make folders for individual playlists and hook them up to my car via Bluetooth (which connects easy) so I can listen to my music on the way to work. It's been a lifesaver for long commutes. Honestly I'm kind of shocked it was only $40.
3,I bought this player so I could listen to my music using my blue tooth ear buds.. After I paired up my ear buds everything sounded good except when I walked more then 10 feet from the player I lost the sound and had to disconnect and then connect the ear buds to get the music back.. The arm carrier that came with it is too small. You have to squeeze the player into it which ends up pressing the buttons on the side and you loose the music . If I get my ear buds connected and hold the mp3 player in my hand it is fine My wife put the player in her small purse which is a little bigger then a cell phone. It worked in there for about 30 seconds and then I lost sound I was walking right next to her.. If you are outside and loose the sound and want to reconnect it it's impossible because you can not see the screen even at its highest setting. I am very disappointed in this player. I guess it is fine if you want to use the wired ear plugs.
4,This device works instantly when I choose the Bluetooth feature to play my music inside my vehicle  my previous device at times would cause for me to Disconnect  Reconnect  then Search and Pair in order for me to select and play my Music Files  that's not the case for me any longer with this current device.
5,I like that I can carry it around all day and it doesn’t run out of battery.  I listen to podcasts mainly.
5,Got this because it's annoying running with my large phone bouncing around in my pocket. This mp3 is the perfect size for this. Very easy to sync up your bluetooth headphones and holds more songs than you'll ever listen to. Navigation of the menus is also very easy. Sound is great also. Highly recommended!
2,UPDATE: As of recent the blue tooth functionality is dying out. I tried it between two different wireless earbuds and a set of wireless headphones and the problem persists. I've dropped it maybe twice but it's been months since then. I've looked inside and it's not wet. I wouldn't say the $50 I spent on this just for it to last me 6 months was worth it.Old review: It's small and light and fits comfortably with my phone in the same pocket. The audio quality of the speakers is bad but works fine with headphones. Lasts through my 10 hour shifts at work continuously playing and when I head home it shows 50% battery sometimes out lasting my wireless earbuds. Comes with plenty of space and is easy to use. Only issue I have with it is that the music is always shuffled which can make listening to some albums jarring but overall I don't have too much problem with it.
4,This may be more of a speaker issue than the actual player's design but I can't get it to pair with my Boom speaker. It seems it can't find the device. I am going to try hard wiring it to the speaker. It does have a nice large capacity for lots of music which helps since I use this for classes I teach and I don't like to use my phone as the device to stream music during class. The player links easily to my car.
2,It works OK once it is on and going. I need to pair the Bluetooth earphones every time and I first have to turn the unit on and then take the earphones out of the case. Also the buttons are not very responsive so it takes too long to get everything prepared. Not really practical for the gym. OK for an airplane where you have time. Once it is up and running it's pretty good for the price.
5,After 2 previous players that went bad shortly after this one appears to have hit the mark.  Out of the box this little player felt much substantial.  The features are all there - radio pictures movies books music player and bluetooth.  I bought this to play music on my outdoor activities - walking/hiking yard work etc and this met the demands so far.  The bluetooth will come in handy when I finally get to drive to visit out of town family but I have used it inside for some quick music in the house to play through my stereo.  This was a best seller item and for the money it fits my needs and who knows maybe I'll experiment with the other features.I glanced over the manual but basically experimented with the keypad to aquaint myself with the operations.  Bonus - nice large visual display!  Music menus allows for multiple options - songs albums artists last played genres and shuffle.  It also has a built-in speaker which was a surprise.  Unit came with ear buds charging cable and carrying case. Very satisfied plus it's affordable!
2,I have had it 3 days. I use it to listen to podcasts and music files while walking the dog. I need to be able to pick up where I left off easily.  I need to be able to see what is playing and where I am in the file easily. I need to be able to change to play other files easily.. It is short on the ability to do any of the above..  It is a nice design and seems well made. Has unneeded features like clock alarm calendar recorder but others may find that important. Sound is fine blue tooth works well and it is easy to copy/paste files or folders of mp3 files from my PC .  It places copied folders under its Folder icon and copied individual files under its music icon.  Although the menu icon shows a MP4 (video) option  it doesn't play mp4 files.  The main things I wish were different include:.. Almost impossible to read the screen out of doors... it is impossible in sunlight. Not bright enough and the font is way too small on the file information.... Does not pick up where you left of in a podcast file.…Plays music files of an album in alphabetical order.. not by track number.. Does not fast forward from beginning except to hold down the >> button and let it scroll to where you want.  For finding where you left off in an hour long podcast that takes way too long.... Very difficult to read the position in a file as one is trying to fast forward. Again.. dim and way too small to read information on position or time left in the file.I will likely return it.
4,It is not easy to use especially for first-time MP3 users. It looks like the device has a touch screen but does not. My nine year old uses it to play music over headphones while in bed. We programmed calming music to help him relax. Once it needed to charge and the cord was not long enough to be charging and in use with head phones at the same time so we just let it play at max volume. It sounded great and the volume was perfect for trying to sleep.
5,Older interface but easy to move music from my pc. Awesome battery life. Very happy with this
5,This MP3 player is both a good size and great qualityIt has excellent battery life and ok volumeThe volume is not very good by itself but with Headphones it is fineIt is easy to navigate the menu and it organizes itself wellthere are two glitches I have encountered though...the left arrow button gets stuck and skips backward through the songand there is a glitch with playlist three where if more than three songs are added it fills theplaylist with the first two songs added and deletes the rest of the songs(the playlists can only hold up to 100 songs)but it is more than likely these are glitches only for my MP3 playerbecause I use it for about three two at the least every day so...it might be because I use it so much but I this MP3 Player is all around a GREATMP3 Player and I would Highly recommend it if you are looking for a MP3 Playerwith good battery life
3,I bought this because my old iPod was worn out. It had lasted over 10 years and preformed impeccably. But now glitches were happening and I didn't want to have to go through itunes every time I wanted to add songs nor did I want to spend $200 on a new iPod. So for $35 this was worth a shot. Here's what you should know:- Sound quality is decent but not great. My 11 year old iPod actually still sounds a lot better.- The sound is not pure meaning sometimes when I have my ear buds on I think the mic pics up when I'm playing music and you can hear hissing.- The interface and navigation feels outdated and something you would find on a Samsung phone from 10 years ago.- LCD display quality = bad.That being said. If you want a flexible player for under $40 which plays different formats and can easily download content on to this isn't such a bad choice. Just be aware that you're getting $40 worth of technology and innovation.
3,This is overall a very decent mp3 player. Bluetooth works fine the sound quality is also very nice. I can connect with aux or Bluetooth to my boombox or car. The interface also is quite pleasing to the eye. This box also contains free earphones and a charging cable and a 32 micro sd card inserted into your mp3. Some issues to be aware of though are the LED backlight will not stay on even after I set the backlight timer to "always on" the lights will go off after a few seconds. Its quite frustrating and I'm not sure what the purpose of that setting is. Then the buttons themselves are not so sensitive to touch so that means I would sometimes have to touch a button twice to get the desired result. The playlist in the menu (you can set a total of 3 playlists) is utterly useless since if you add a few albums onto it they will not stay organized but there would be a hodge podge of songs in your playlist. And the playlist itself cannot hold more than a x amount of songs and that x number is pretty low.
5,An amazing little MP3 player.  I can finally upload all of my old CD’s into a portable device that i don’t have to worry about managing storage space.  Yes I can stream music but a lot of my music I want to stream I have to pay extra for it.  The Bluetooth is amazing.  Also I plug it into my vehicle and it recognizes instantly.  It’s small enough that it isn’t cumbersome so I can see it fitting into a pocket without any bulky feeling.  The battery life is great it holds up throughout the day; though I will add I’ve been using the Bluetooth and playing through my speakers - what an amazing sound!  I have also used the voice recorder and it’s stellar; as simple as you can get (this could market as a voice recorder first it’s that good).  I have not used the video yet but there are instructions to convert video I may try it but with YouTube and other streaming I’m not in dire need of a video player.  Oh and the alarm function great; I get to wake up to my favorite song -speaker volume is high enough to wake most people!  I’m using all day long now!
3,No me gusta que se congela y no puedo usarlo.
3,I bought this MP3 player to replace the broken CD player in my vehicle. Worked great so I bought a pair of BT speakers - those sound great too. About 3 1/2 months into it a problem developed - music was randomly stuttering with the BT speakers and tracks would change when plugged into the vehicle sound system. It took a while for me to determine that it was the MP3 player messing up. Thought I was screwed ... past the warranty period according to Amazon.But then I noticed the aiworthtec guarantee in the manual didn't mention a time frame so I emailed them. After trading a few messages I was sent a new player. After switching out the memory cards I realized the problem was a defective memory card.
5,I have had my Aiworth Mp3 player for only 2 days now but I absolutely love it. It is a quality device and has very good sound quality. The menu is easy to negotiate even without reading the instructions (even though I recommend that you read the instructions). I had the whole thing up and running in just a few minutes.I did figure out how to upload my mp3 files the instructions were not clear. I plugged the device into my computer with the cable supplied and using Windows File Explorer I moved my music files into the RECORD envelope of my Mp3 player. This only took a few seconds and I was ready to listen to some great music.I am having trouble setting up the Bluetooth Headset I have but it is because I do not have instructions with the Bluetooth Ear Buds to explain how to Pair the Buds to the Mp3 player. I am working on getting that information now and that problem should soon be resolved. This unit will accept the standard hard-wire headphones with the small input jack as well.Everything was packaged well and delivery was right on time.
4,Overall a pretty good bang for the buck. So far working as advertized.Pros: Very easy and quick to transfer files onto the player. Can make my own folders to organize however I need. Lots of storage. Great value for the price. Has fast-forward rewind repeat track options. Even has option to make a custom repeat loop. Has a built-in recorder although the interface is a bit slow. User interface is very simple - easy to figure out.Cons: Can’t figure out how to keep audio tracks alphabetized. It seems to add newly added files at the bottom of the list no matter which letter they begin with. The built-in speaker is a bit quiet as others have mentioned but works great with external speakers or through headphones.
5,I just got this in the mail today and it looks great! I haven't had the chance to try it out yet but my initial impressions have all been positive. The unit is extremely shiny and it has a good weight to it. Along with the player itself it came with an arm strap earbuds and a cute little braided charger cord. So far so good!UPDATE: I have gotten the chance to use it and for the most part it works well(the bluetooth connected quickly and stayed connected the whole time I used it). However I have noticed (what I consider to be) one fatal flaw:Scrolling through songs on here is painstakingly slow It takes a REALLY long time to get to any song that's later in the alphabet. If all your music is super organized and well labeled you should be able to find songs quickly under the "Artists" tab; however if you're anything like me and your music is not neatly labeled/organized you're going to have one heck of a time getting to any song that doesn't start with an A.TL;DR: Pretty decent mp3 player overall but it takes forever to scroll through songs
3,Overall this is a good MP3 player except that there are 3 pre defined "playlist" that you can't rename or add more.  You have to add songs from the device to the playlists making management cumbersome at best a nightmare if you have a lot of content.The manufacturers "solution" to this is to create folders and mange your content through that. While this is a work around if you have a few favorite songs that you include in several lists you will be saving full copies of them in several folders eating up space and leading to duplicates in the music list when browsing on the device.Also the voice recorder is a slider button on the bottom of the unit.  If you engage it when putting it in your pocket or an arm band it will start recording and will continue until you turn it off so you may end up with a large file that takes up all your storage.Essentially this is a voice recorded that has been marketed as a MP3 player.
5,Mp3 player is better than expected battery lasts longer than others I've had.
4,Good soundEasy to use only problem is limit of making of playlist
4,El producto cumple con lo que señala en batería y tamaño de espacio pero su interfaz no me agrada mucho. Por lo demás está bien. El chasis se bueno y modelo bonito
2,I bought this mp3 player and have had it for a few months now. The functions work well such as the ease of downloading music and listening to the FM radio. There are a couple of problems i have found when using the player.1. The display can not be seen in sunlight. Better find some shade. It does have a setting for brightness but it is dim at best. The text display is very small and unless you have 20/20 vision forget about figuring out what it says when navigating outdoors.2. The sound settings provide a way to limit or choose the volume output but when setting the limit it does not retain the sound output level. If you try to go back to select another other function it reduces the sound output to a minimum. You have to return to the volume limit again to reset the volume. No way that I have found to correct this problem.3. When selecting the equalizer it has a number of selections. There is no control if you want to change the amount of bass or treble independently. The selections provided little or no change in tone when selecting any of the choices.4. The mp3 player does not retain memory regarding most settings when turning off the player. Just navigate thru the menu.5. I have found no online help or a customer support site for answering any of these problems. Sales but no customer service.
5,Friendly and easy use
5,The mp3 feature does work. You must first download VLC onto your PC or Laptop. Then convert the mp3 file to WAV. file. Youtube tutorials show how to do this. Then transfer to your music folder. Don't get mad get educated! Hope this helped someone..
3,The UI is not well optimized if you have a lot of tracks. Uploads from a computer have little control as to where they show up. Unless you make a specific folder the tracks are placed somewhat randomly. Even with a new folder the tracks show up in a random order so audiobooks are annoying to listen to. Tracks aren't guaranteed to show up under 'Artists' or 'Albums' for example and if you want to find a track you might have to scroll through thousands of tracks under the ' all songs' menu.I listen to audio nearly 10 hours a day at work etc. and this device just isn't the solution. 3.5 stars
5,This thing is awesome. i do not like streaming music so i can download all my favorite songs and put them on here. its not even half the size of a cell phone just a couple of buttons and i can have it on a blue tooth speaker. I strongly recommend one of these to anyone who does not enjoy streaming music.
5,Although the interface could be more user-friendly the battery lasts a long time especially when you aren't using bluetooth. I bought it to use while running and doing other activities so I wouldn't have to use my phone's battery so much. It works as well as I'd hoped--I've used it quite extensively since I bought it.
2,Everything was fine until the entire screen went blank with nothing but a white facing. I couldn't even turn it off to reboot the device. Sent it back and won't reorder. I don't have the time or money to waste on bad product.
5,I purchased this MP3 player a little over 4 months ago but wanted to use it for awhile before writing a review.  I use it mainly to listen to audiobooks and when I first started using it I was unable to get back to my stopping point when wanting to listen again which was very upsetting.  I finally went online to see if anyone else had this problem. I could not find anything to help me so asked for help.  One answer I received solved my problem and I fell in love with it.  The sound is excellent and it connects to my wireless speaker as soon as i turn it on.  It is very smooth and feels  great.  I recently put some music on it which was super easy  using the copy and paste method.  It doesn't weigh much but has proven to be high quality.  I am very pleased with this MP3 player and would buy again and recommend to everyone.
5,I was pretty brutal about this unit before and rightly so.  I went ahead and used that unit as best I could until I dropped it too many times. Having made somewhat of an accommodation when I broke the unit I ordered another one and am I glad I did. All the negative things I had said before no longer applied. This unit has excellent range can go in almost any pocket and still plays and can be handled up down sideways and still pumps clear music.  I'm so impressed I'm thinking of getting another one in case I break this latest one.  Keep in mind I have to set this up to run through my hearing aids but that is a small detail to pay to now have an MP3 player that runs great. Good job Aiworth
4,I use this player to  play music in my car or at home on my stereo.  I have never used Bluetooth so I had to start from scratch and the learning curve was not real easy. But my  mp3 playerworked fine.the playbackon the headphones and the device speaker is fine. The quality of the player seems to be fine.  But there are a few cons: The screen  could be a little brighter. It is hard to  read in sunlight.  The directions for erasing a file could be clearer (I still don't know exactly how to do it).  A lot of this is due to my ignorance but all in all the operating instructions could be clearer.Overall the player seems to be of high quality and I would  recommend it
2,Its nice to handle and good for a child who wants to have a few albums available. Interface is easy to learn from them.Wired headphones don't work correctly - something is misaligned with the pins so if you place the connector all the way in it only plays on one channel. If you back it out slightly then you get stereo but it isn't stable. A few other reviewers had the same issue. Bluetooth headphones work fine with it in stereo and sound good.Tag reading - it only reads a bit and cuts off. The White Stripes is just shows up as The White St
5,Okay first off I should mention I use this MP3 player to listen to stand-up comedy albums at work so I don’t get bored during the day. Now this thing is amazing and all the negative reviews seem like either one-off incidents or people that don’t know how tech works. Now it seems people have trouble with making playlists with this thing. I’ve never been a playlist person so doesn’t affect me. Some people say the touch buttons aren’t responsive or are off center. Mine work perfectly. If you’re technology challenged don’t press them just tap them gently. The interface is easy to use and friendly enough. And unlike my last MP3 player (a little red GPX) it has a really lasting battery. And for those that complaing the sound is too low get louder headphone or a louder speaker. Paired with my JBL Charge 4 speaker I can hear my comedy shows over the loud machines surrounding me. I hope this review helps with your decision to buy or not buy this MP3 player!
2,I returned this MP3 player. Every time you turn it on you have to manually Bluetooth your headphones. The volume at max 31 is probably not loud enough for the gym or a busy city if you're walking. There is no shuffle feature. The unit doesn't have a touch screen but you'll find yourself pressing the screen. If you plan on using wire headphones the sound quality is tinny although if you use Bluetooth headphones the sound is REALLY good. The player is an all around disappointment.
4,This is a nice player but there is a learning curve for first time users as far as navigating the different screens!I only set this up to listen to my favorite local stations I saved in the preset function!  The ear buds have a clear sound and pairing it to external blue tooth speakers was easy.  I do not plan on using the ebook function and will try the recorded music at a later time.
5,Work as F amazing
2,Overall it works just OK - the really annoying part is that it stops working altogether if it is in direct sunlight so don't buy this if you're planning on using it outdoors.  The interface is also a little dark and hard to read in bright light so again don't buy it if you are planning on using it outdoors.  Other than that it works great.
2,There are two problems with this player.  (1) When playing music on wired earbuds there is a constant static and crackle underlying the music.  (2) If your music's file format is anything other than MP3 it may not play through Bluetooth.  Most of my music is OGG (Vorbis) which isn't supported by BT on this device.  I am disappointed and would not have purchased this player.
4,I like it but for some reason the music skips. I can listen to a song and it plays fine then the next time I listen to it it skips. Can be really annoying when you're playing it for other people at a party or campfire. But other than that I have been pleased with it.
2,It looks great and is easy to use. However there is a continuous buzz whenever anything is played regardless of source of music.  Avoid this one!
4,I wanted an MP3 player on the go so I would not have to use my phone. The audio is okay but it is not the best quality you could get from an MP3 player. In speaker mode unless you are listening to just news or podcast don't. Audio from the speaker is not great. However considering the price being paid for this device I think it is reasonable. For my needs it is good enough for general use but not for audiophiles.
2,cant connect to any Bluetooth device searching on device never finds anything soo ill just jack it in the old way
4,Pluses are clock calendar radio recording capability video pictures stop watch alarm wireless pairing to headphones built in speaker so you can listen to it without head phones ( not very loud but good for listening to while nodding off to sleep)  Pairs to other devices fairly easy.  Not the most intuitive setup for navigating around functions. Takes some figuring out and getting used to.  Once that's done it's a nice little MP3.  Just set it up so don't know about battery life.
3,I use one MP3 player in my car to listen to audiobooks. It works great plugged into the USB port. It is easy to download books and always keeps its place even when I remove it to add another book. Sound is great through the radio . So I bought another to use while walking (also audiobooks).  This was not the same experience. I echo what others have said. It’s not loud enough the screen is hard to see it constantly hits buttons while in my pocket. And worst of all it doesn't keep its place. So every time a button gets touched I have to search for where I was at. I give it a 5 for car use and a zero for walking use (sent it back).
5,I am a professional musician and teacher with over 50 years experience. I ordered this on Saturday and it arrived on Tuesday. It is very easy to use good sound with my real headphones and buds. The buds that came with it are comfortable and good for voice but too narrow frequency band for music. The negative reviews must be from people who cannot or do not read instructions and perhaps some who are comparing it to units costing hundreds of dollars. Someone said it took 2.5 hours to load 20 songs. I took 30 minutes to load 575 songs and many compositions much longer than the average song. Also the volume is fine. I like loud and it is plenty loud unless you are mostly deaf. The one thing I would improve is that it alphabetizes tracks on an album by default instead of just keeping the track order as it is. I'll probably be able to adjust that through the computer.
4,I was replacing an mp3 player that was functional and smaller.  This player is more phonelike but the user interface is easily hit.  I have not figured out how to carry it without accidentally hitting keys.  I will look for a holder for it.  Can't workout with it yet.  It has been skipping occasionally.  My other player never skipped.
5,Due to cell phone reception being very scarce on my walking trail I needed something to provide music to walk by. The Bluetooth feature was a must.  Ability to provide enough storage space to hold a large selection of tunes was essential.  This little monster delivers everything I wanted and then some.Attaching a lanyard is almost a must - it is so small and light weight it will probably get lost in my pocket.The only stumbling block I encountered was knowing where to transfer my MP3 files.  I initially loaded them in the RECORD directory but it could not find them.  I transferred them to the root directory and it was ready to rock 'n roll.Sleek looking it is an attractive piece of electronics genius.  Comes with an armband for easy carrying.I haven't had a chance to load a movie in the video option but will before my next flight.Dollar for dollar this is a giant value.
3,I usually don't rate stuff I buy but thought that doing so with this MP3 player may be helpful.  I rely on MP3s for the basics of recording and listening to albums and don't usually use the bells and whistles.  That said the overall quality of this player's function and sound is fine probably a 4-star rating.  But you will need to figure out how to program and navigate its features on your own.  The instructions are the worst I have encountered in a long time - poorly written difficult to understand and bizarrely organized.
5,Are you missing the nostalgia of the flip phone you had 15 years ago?? Here’s your chance! This MP3 player is a great value at the price.  You are getting a lot or what you would expect for the price point. Remember your old phone that showed pictures it was so small and pixeled that you couldn’t read the album cover at all? And with the small screen for some reason the picture is 1/2 size in that window ? That’s this MP3 player! You go to tap the screen then get that nice 2005 feeling you miss.  Hahaha you can’t touch screen for selections. It’ll keep getting you. It’s great. It would be helpful since it comes with an arm strap that you could adjust volume or pause without having to look at. It takes a minute if you want to do anything so driving running or walking is not easy. I had no problem connecting Bluetooth. Adding music also no problem.
5,If you're familiar with using an MP3 player this player is for you. If you're a beginner you will need someone to show you how to use it. Instructions are not written with the beginner in mind. It took me a long time to figure out how to upload music to my MP3 player. They don't tell you what each button does. With that said here's my observations:PRO:- Has built-in speaker so you can play without earphones if you want a great feature  😀- Has lots of memory- Paired nicely with my bluetooth speaker- Automatically shuts itself off after a minute or so of no activity to save battery- Look and feel of player is nice love the rounded edgesCON:- Buttons are not intuitive mostly trial and error ... mostly error- Display shuts off too quickly can be frustrating if you're slow like me
4,The storage capacity is tremendous and the sound quality is great. The various options are fine. The issue is figuring out exactly how to operate it. It is not intuitive and the instructions are no written by an English major - they are very brief and sometime confusing in their word choices.
2,well. Need to use it to download music from my desktop (over 600 songs).
2,So first off it is really hard nowadays to find a standalone MP3 player that works well.  This one checked all of the checkboxes I wanted but it turns out even the functions it has aren't that great.  Bluetooth was a nice feature that stopped working within a month.  I believe some of the other reviewers called out the same thing.  I've resorted now to just using a 3.5mm cord to connect it to my amazon echo plus which for now is working.The user interface on this thing is just OK.  The real problem with the interface though is the limitations on the functionality.  The playlist functions are basically useless and when navigating the menus for the music to browse by artist or album the interface seems to be limited to only displaying 100 or so albums/artists.  As such about half my music doesn't even show up in the list.  I've found a way around that by simply organizing all of my using in folders and just finding music via the folder browser which does seem to allow me to access all of my music.The one bright point about this thing is the battery life.  We don't use it much but I've been able to go a couple weeks between charging it with relatively minimal use during that time (we don't usually listen to it much more than 30 minutes in a day).
3,I believe you get what you pay for with this I did. Does the job but there are better choices.
3,Well. I did not receive 2 items with my product. A carrying case . A a plug to connect to my car.  Disappointed once more.
1,Sound quality and battery power were mediocre at best compared to what I can get from a similar-sized phone or speaker made 4 years ago. Some unboxing videos showed the device coming with a armband to hold the device while running others - including mine - did not have that so I guess that's just like a Golden Ticket that you get and you have to buy more to get the armband.Most noticeable was the utter inability to download/transfer files onto the device from my laptop. The MP3 files go into "recordings" where they do not play sequentially nor can they be organized into playlists in this state. There were no instructions on how to move music files into the music app. I suspect the conversion tool software that came with it was meant to be used to first convert the files into a useable format and then played. This was unfortunately not possible because the conversion tool could not convert MP3 files into whatever format the MP3 player required. I am a 25 year-old student and my condolences go out to any elderly or technologically illiterate consumers trying to figure this out. There is also no built-in process to uninstall the conversion tool and I will need to get a 3rd party software to uninstall the 3rd-party software that came with the device.This brings me back to the original sentence - if I could get all this functionality without the hassle of trying to figure out how to convert the music ALONG WITH the ability to stream music from YouTube or other sites from a used phone made four years ago why in the world would I bother with this device? It simply does not have anything to be competitive.
5,Im really loving this little Mp3 Player...Im old school so just having a device for music is essential for me. I take it everywhere and I bought the MusiBaby Speaker to go with it and pairs well with it-both are bluetooth Good for office porch campfire surrounding camping anything really.Cons: Instructions aren't real clear. You will have to play with it to understand the functions but really wasn't too hard to figure out. I had to plug it in to my computer twice before it recognized it..I don't know what happened really. Then I made a file called Music.Pros: Nice and handy even comes with a arm band for physical activities. Files transfer easily volume is enough for me. Even had to turn it down a few times with speaker Seems to play almost all songs. Some songs could have been corrupt.All and all a good player for the money value!
1,This is a very inexpensive unit which separates itself from others but I've learned you get what you pay for.First off the user interface is atrocious.  It looks like it should be a touch screen but it isn't.  You have to use the light-up buttons to navigate the menu but the buttons quickly go dark and you can't see where to push.  If you pause a recording or playlist after a few seconds the unit will automatically turn off with no warning.  So if you're in the middle of a playlist and you want to pause to answer your phone or do something you can't easily resume.  You have to start back over at the beginning and navigate to whatever playlist you were listening to.The screen is basically useless for the most part.  List of artists songs and albums are lucky to display the first 20 characters of the filename.  It doesn't seem to fully-recognize metadata and will just display filenames which often are very long so if you're looking for a particular song to play good luck.  This is a complete mess of a user interface.Bluetooth works but if you perform any major function on the device it will disable bluetooth.And for podcasts audio books or any audio you want to keep track of your last location?  FORGET IT.  If you pause in the middle of a podcast or playlist and don't immediately resume (or accidentally hit the wrong key) you lost your place in both the playlist and the podcast.  It's incredibly frustrating to use.  The unit is also very slow to respond to keypresses and starting/stopping play.It's a shame because this unit seems to have most of the base features available but the user interface is atrocious and the omission of certain key features make this more of a frustration to use.  I wish I'd never bought it.
3,If you like me were having a hard time getting it connected and recognized by your computer... it's the cord. the cord that came with it is no good for this only for charging.I used a random micro USB cord that I had laying around and it connected right away. we almost sent it back but thankfully this worked!Other than this issue for the price range I have no complaints.
4,I bought this for my sister for Christmas. She was hesitant to use it at first because she was used to her iPod classic. But when that went bad rather than buying a new one she decided to use this. She found it to be easy to load with music and was really pleased with the sound of it. Now she uses it all the time and has even added a larger micro SD card to allow for more music and she loves it!!!
4,Volume is a little to weak could be higher.
3,I don’t really mind the laggy interface or not amazing battery life. It’s a cheap mp3 player i don’t expect it to have the best interface battery life or anything like that. Some songs don’t seem to load onto it properly and then play skip half way through. It’s a bit frustrating but that’s not my biggest issue.What i do have an issue with is the buzzing. Whenever a song isn’t loud enough(or songs with just an acoustic guitar or a piano) I hear a buzzing noise. While it’s cycling through tracks i hear electronic noise and i think it might be due to how close the headphone jack is to the sd card slot.If you got some big over ears the buzzing and electronic noises might not be too big of a deal but with some IEMs or earbuds it’s almost unbearable.
5,I use this product for my music! I love it! It is easy to use and set up! I have put a ton of music on it! Music is my happy place.
5,Got it for my daughter. The interface is OK but easy enough for a 12 years old to use.It allows her to listen to music while going to school (in the bus). It is just funny to know kids don't know what it is around her.It is nice to have a micro sd for storage makes things easier to load.
5,When my wife's IPOD recently died she was lost without her music. This MP3 player was a perfect replacement. It was easy for her to use easy to carry and has very good sound quality. Although she mainly listens to CDs the MP3 player has a very good AM/FM radio. It was also easy for me to transfer her music from our home computer.
2,What can I possibly say about this player? It really isn't too horrible with the sound or battery life that holds up well. I however HATE the scrolling and menu on this thing I wish it was more like ipod and had a quick searching method to scroll through music and not continuously having to hold the buttons down. I have a ton of music and the way to look through thousands of songs sucks! You really have to set up the music playlists way before putting them in the player because it is a pain in the butt having to go through one at a time and add them to a playlist. The headphones are really uncomfortable and any pressure from the wrist band messes up the connection to the headphones which sucks. The blue tooth is HORRIBLE! The connection is pathetic and does not have a good distance let alone disconnect when it was inside of my sweater or shirt pocket. The recording button stops any music you may be listening to if you accidentally push the button. It also doesnt record good quality either. Another thing it is a freaking DIRT MAGNET!! Try to keep a cover over it because it is constantly dirty even when inside of a car or clean shirt pocket.  Definitely not happy with this purchase however I really tried to give it a fair chance.
4,It took be awhile before I was able to set up this  MP3 player which is replacing my old Zune and I still haven't tried doing the blue tooth pairing with the conduction head phones I purchased. The instruction pamphlet does not really cover how you can access the interface under the screen w/o having to turn the player on/off.  Very frustrating. I started the process to return it and decided to give it one more try.
3,This is my 3rd MP3 from different companies.  This one is touchy. What I mean is that if after I've paired it with my blue tooth set the volume level and if I set it down to hard It will radically change the volume level. Sometimes when I pick it up to change setting it gets all gorked out on me. (I know not the right use of the word "Gorked" but it's how I describe it.  I'm sure you get the idea).  It will change it's file location or jump way into our out of my play list and I have to go through the trouble of finding my place again and resetting it.  But sense I usually start a play list and leave it on most of the time all day it does what I want. Has a long battery life and sound through my blue tooth device is good.
5,The look and feel of the hardware is nice. It's very thin with good touch buttons. The screen is average. I haven't tried video I bought it for workout music. If you add more songs than its supported capacity some of the tags might show up under artist / genre / album navigation. But I can access all my songs through the folder view just fine so it isn't an issue. I did successfully use a 128GB SD card formatted as FAT32 after copying all the system files over from the first SD card.  I have been using it constantly for a few days with Bluetooth headphones and working acceptably. Definitely use with better headphones; the ones it comes with are cheap. It is not the quality of the player my better headphones sound great. Extra star for still having a regular headphone jack to use with line-in speakers.
5,The user interface could probably be 5 stars for people who understand more about technology than do. It will do more than I understand.  I am pleased I figured out how to get audio books on it and that I found them on it and it plays well.  I still can't figure out how to get books listed in the book icon on the device nor music in the music icon  I access everything through the menu button.  The other icons are useless for me.  Since I can find eveerything through the menu icon  I'm satisfied.  It does the minimum of what I wanted it to do. I wish the bookmark was easier to access.  Since I only stumble across it by trial and error  I usually just listen to the entire chapter of my book and then delete that chapter afterward so that I remember where I was.
4,none
4,I got this mp3 player as a gift for my boyfriend. For the price it does a great job. The user interface on the dice is easy to use and figure out. The sound quality is great. Three only drawback I found is that is does not have dios to use for transferring music from you other devices. I was able to figure out how to do it using Windows Media Player and iTunes but it took some googling on my part to get to that point. It would have been nice if the included user manual at least rolled me that much. Once I got past that hurdle it worked great.
4,I wanted this to use in my vehicle and it performs nicely. I have to connect it through the audio jack and so need to turn my speaker waaay up to her the music. Still it holds a lof of content and will play on shuffle for hours. On a 12 hour drive I don't remember one repeated song. It is hard to see the readout while you are driving so I now start playback before leaving. Also works fine with my bluetooth pill speaker. I think this is a pretty good piece of equipment.
4,Seems to have alot.of options and sounds surprisingly good. Used it to provide house music into the soundboard during band break.the unit seems well built.
2,1/8" jack won't allow cables to fully click in place I tried a few different ones so it won't transfer the sound fully to my car speakers or my playback speakers at home without half the sound still coming from the mp3 player itself. Bluetooth would not allow songs to play on my home speaker box or in my car it just says "Files not supported for Bluetooth playback" on the mp3 player itself (just basic iTunes files) Also had issues with the headphones not fully plugging into the jack and getting the full audio signal. If you enjoy wasting money I strongly suggest taking $50 and tossing it out your window on a windy day... OR buy one of these.. either way is effective.
2,EDIT:  What a piece of junk.  I downgraded from 3 stars to 2 stars.  I have it on shuffle and was looking at the different menu options when the entire thing just froze.  I can't even turn it off.  I can't adjust the volume.  I can't go to the main menu. I can't hit the back button or choose another song.  I can't even flip the recorder button.  I guess I have to let this play until the battery runs out.  This is DEFINITELY getting returned.  It's defective and the sound is terrible. What a waste of money.  The ONLY reason I'm giving it two stars is because it was easy to transfer songs onto it and I like the display.  That's it.There's no manual way to adjust the EQ.  There should at least be an option or a bass boost or something to round out the sound.  Very "tinny" with any pre-set EQ option. I'm debating whether I should return it or just eat the cost. It does connect easily and it's easy to transfer music over.  So there's that.  What good is it if the sound isn't there though?
5,Great sound except when played at a very low volume like for when you are falling asleep; there is a faint clicking noise like the old movie projectors sound except faint. Not sure if it is the player or the headphones. Didn't find the player extremely user friendly. I will have to go back and study the not very user friendly manual to figure out how to use most of the features. Otherwise it seems like a very nice player if you are tech savvy.Follow up:I changed from 4 stars to 5 stars because the customer service was awesome. I was able to exchange my first MP3 player and the second one works perfectly! And the shipping was fast! I had my new player in 2 days before I had the chance to return the first one! So I did not have to go without one. So I am very happy with this easy transitional transaction! Thank you!
2,I purchased this because I wanted a new blue tooth device for my vehicle. While it connected it dropped within 2 minutes. Also it won't work with my Bose bluetooth speaker even though it indicates that it is paired. No sound comes from the device except for when playing back from the built in microphone. User guide is worthless. Not a true touchscreen. Built in speaker is tinny so very low fidelity. Unable to use the memory in the device only the included 32g micro sd card. On the plus side it's a sleek device much like a Sansa fuse. The usb interface seems to work in my vehicle like my old Sansa. Jury is out as to wether I keep or return it at this time.
4,The battery life is very good. The sound is good if using headphones but without headphones the sound is muffled.
4,You have a good look but the volume when you play it through Bluetooth and very very low you hthey're very low you have to turn your system up to a 95 in order to hear it and it and it doesn't have any substitution
4,- My biggest complaint is that there is always a slight static background noise while playing music.- Easy transfer from Mac with occasional music transfer errors.- The menu is intuitive but the display only shows so many characters so you cannot read entire track names album names etc.- Battery is good so far but have only had it for a week.- I have only used this for music so I cannot comment on its other features.- The earbuds that come with it are not great. Only the left one works but other earbuds work fine on the device.
5,I purchased this for my son.  It took a little to figure out (like most tech) but the customer support was very helpful and we love the quality of sound.  Uploading was very easy and he carries it with him a lot.  Definitely a good purchase.
5,great
2,Design gets in its own way it sounds like crap & saying it has an "Equalizer" is an absolute joke.......But it is Cheap! I'll give it that! Battery life is also a plus. Large storage is handy & a decent sized SD card is included. So that's def something...Right..? 🤔In all fairness this is probably a decent option for a child's 1st portable music player. They won't have any frame of reference to compare it to so they'll most likely be as grateful as I was when I got my very 1st Walkman! Back in the late 80s & early 90s I didn't realize a discman would sound better than a cassette or that lossless music would someday become a thing... No siree I was just excited to have a place where I could blast Marilyn Manson & 2LiveCrew without my mom losing her mind about the "Satanic Devil Music" I was listening to🤘So in summary if you're a child (or maybe even my mother) then this player might actually work for you! If not then I recommend you spend a little extra & get something that does more than just work "alright."&If you're looking for recommendations I just bought a new player by the name of Surfans & it pretty much freakin rocks FYI 👌
2,Just got this today and have to say pretty disappointed. I replaced a Sandisk which was much better for about the same price. This thing times out (shuts itself off after 5 mins - that's the longest you can set it to) which then does not remember where you were even if you had hit pause - which sucks if you're listening to a long podcast. The volume maximum is way too low. Couldn't get it to pair with my car's Bluetooth. Overall waste of $.
2,May be for kids but not me. Too complicated to operate.
3,I thought most people bought MP3 players for music play back mainly the manual does not dwell much on music mostly the other Options which don't intrest me or others maybe I think the playlists need mentioning but not adding music most may or may not know but it's not there either sound quality is good and they do give equalizer settings but nothing you can manually do just choice's there is good utube vids on playlist but u can't name them only 3 I put 128 GB card in place of the 32 works fine no problem radio works ok battery life on Bluetooth playing library you may get 8 hrs. Says 60 hrs that must be sleep time and still wake up. All in all for music once u figure out how to navigate it's ok!
5,We bought this MP3 for our son to take to sleep away camp for 7 weeks. He loved it and said he used it every day. He said the battery life was great too. Would recommend this excellent product!
2,I have only had this for a couple of months now I many use it when going to and from work. I use a cassette converter to listen to it. It worked great for the first month or 2 then I started noticing the left speakers would work only if I turned the cord where it connected to the MP3 player. After a couple of weeks of this the left speakers stopped working at all. They still worked when I played the radio just not with the MP3 player. I then plugged my phone into the jack and the left speakers worked again. I just got a new phone that had 64 gig on it so I decided to transfer my music file over to it about 3 gig worth and it still works perfectly. So basically if i use head phones or anything else that uses the jack The left side will not work with this MP3 player. Just a side note the MP3 player I downloaded for free from Google play onto my phone is also much more user friendly then this MP3 player. I am now stuck with this piece of junk sense it decided to do all this after the return date. At least my phone works good.
3,I put a bigger chip in to down load more music which is good the mp3 as for playing work well. As stated earlier I did sink my blue tooth head set to the system. However every time I go to use it. It does not automatically connect to the mp3 player. I have reset blue tooth but it still does not automatically connect.I am I doing something wrong??
4,This is a great MP3 player. The sound is great and the interface is easy enough to use. I had some trouble downloading music to it- the user manual was not so helpful but I found answers on Google. At first it wasn't playing MP4 music files and saying that the music could not be found but after a few moments it started to work. It's great for my needs-I just need some meditation music on this device to play on bluetooth for my therapy clients when doing processing therapy. Worth the price and it's sleek and cute.
5,This is a very nice MP3 player. Very easy to operate. I downloaded all my music from my PC  using the supplied USB charger/data cord. On my PC I put my copies of music in different folders that I use as playlists. I downloaded all my folders to the new MP3 player. To play the folder contents I  had to use the MP3 players Folder option to select the different folder to play. You can also use the music  option to play the music but there is no option to only play what’s in the folder. No issues it works just fine for my needs in the folder option. Blue tooth connected to all my device without any issues. I use this player when cutting grass (10 acres) with Bluetooth headset. Also use it wired to aux input on my Yamaha amp for outside patio/house music no issues there either. I would buy again.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This device is amazing. Love the sound quality the visual is great. It’s light weight slim and easy to use interface just make it a very simple and easy to use device. Most of all the luv the batter life. Great device for anyone that’s want a music at hand. Searching the menu is simple finding the music is easy and not jumble like the other players. I can lock the device whiles listenting to music so my hand won’t press on the I telefaxe and change anything.  Hooray for sound quality this lil thing is like a party box in your ears.
4,Battery life is strong. Comes with SD card which is great for easy music transfer. The screen is pretty low quality but it does its job. The Bluetooth sound is pretty good. I've tried the earphones provider and it's not the best quality. The built in speaker is pretty low quality.Overall for its current price it's okay. If you're looking for a good quality mp3 player look elsewhere. If you're looking for something basic this is pretty good.
2,Device looks cool but it is misleading. The only good thing about this device that it has a lot of space.Bad things about this device1: If you want to have a few folders on PC you can see them but not on the device itself.2: if you intend to use it for listening books - don't buy it. When you stop listening your book it doesn't hold location. Next time when you turn it on you would have to start listening from the beginning the very beginning.3: device start recording your conversation even without you know about it.
4,Good
5,Really easy to use bought for my child is even able to use the radio feature. Battery charge lasts a long time.
4,Exactly what was advertised
1,DISAPPOINTMENT - BIG TIME!!  Walk away.  You get what you paid for.The interface is clumsy for something that does so little.  Playlist thinking is absent from the design.  How do you not provide a robust playlist manager tool in this day and age?  I have all these playlists in Windows Media Player (and in Itunes).  I cannot copy these playlists (in-tact) to this device.  You have to pick each song on the device and use the clumsy interface to add it to one of the 3 empty on-board playlists and then hope that the order you add it in is correct because there is no way to edit the list after you are done.Volume - Meh.  about 2/3 the max volume I get from my old iPod.If there is any way to get my money back I'll put it toward getting another old iPod (from Ebay?)
1,So it's an mp3 player that is nearly impossible to transfer mp3's to. Directions DO NOT explain how to actually get ANY files onto the player. Plugged it up to my computer and the computer doesn't see it....in order to transfer files to....again no direction. Bluetooth .... according to the directions you CAN NOT transfer files via Bluetooth. So .....how do you transfer files onto this thing....I read some reviews and they kinda explained the same thing and the convoluted process to get files on the player. I tried several ways to get files on the unit and spent about 2 hours to no avail then decided it wasn't going to happen and decided to send it back.....SAVE YOUR MONEY.Update: I purchased a SanDisk unit 2 days after this debacle. Charged the unit plugged it into computer clicked the file dropped it into the SanDisk music folder and I was listening to music 2 minutes after the charging process..... that speaks for itself.
5,My iPod classic recently stopped working and I did not want to purchase another one since they are rare and expensive. I decided to look for an mp3 player since they are on the economic side. This mp3 player was one of the ones that popped up. I decided to purchase since I liked that you can expand the memory with a micro SD card. Most of the other mp3 players I was looking at could expand up to 128GB but this one did not say that which I liked since I already had a 256G micro SD card. I do wish the interface was a little better but maybe I'm still getting used to it since I have used my iPod for a long time. When going from song to song there seems to be a little bit of lag but that's about it.
5,I have only had this a short while but so far I love it.  The bluetooth connected with my headphones with no trouble at all.  It is so nice to be able walk around listening to music without any cords hanging around  you.  Yes I know I could use my phone but i prefer separate devices plus this is much smaller and lighter than a phone.  I put a 128Gb card in the player and it recognized it without any issue.  I have loaded a lot of music on it.  The only issue is that when you select the music icon it does not show all of my folders.  Apparently there is a limit.  However if you select the folders icon all of them show up so really not a problem.  I highly recommend this player.
5,I've only had it 2 days but am impressed by the programing ease. At 77 years I sometimes have trouble with technology but this player is so easy no manual needed. The sound quality is so much better than my old Ipod.
4,So far seems to do what it claims to be able to quite well. 4 stars instead of mainly cause of lack of length of overall time of use will see how it holds up in cold etc this coming fall / winter. Set-up & interface is decent quite an overall change for me but no fault to unit. Nice to have built in speaker I would think quality is as good as any unit w/ that feature. I think it's an overall good bang for your buck well featured unit.
5,I love this player and it works wonderful and the sound is great. The only thing and it is a simple fix but some of the songs are doubled but once I get it sorted out it will be great to listen to and it plays great with my car's system and look forward in many years with this player.
3,Nice portable unit but conflicting review about ease of product. Unless your use to a product like this it's easy for you but confusing for a novice.  Setup is in directions but very small print. Getting music on it is a whole different issue. Front key pad is very sensitive to the touch unless you blacken the screen. Just read and reread instructions if you can see them and take a bunch of time to figure it out with no help. Good luck hooking it up to your computer to get music transferred your going to get frustrated as I did and still trying to figure it out  !!
3,It's ok I guess
1,I got this MP3 player in the mail I open the box I plugged it in to charge I turned it on just to check out the functions and the user interface it turned on initially when I plugged it in my computer acknowledged that it was connected gave me the ability to load songs but I didn't want to I wanted to make sure it was fully charged. So I plugged it in a charge I went back about an hour later to go put music on it and I never turn back on. The buttons would light up so I knew there was power to it but the screen would never turn on and I couldn't get it to do anything.Literally an hour out of the box the thing died. Now I had purchased it based on the fact that it Amazon said it was a bestseller and the fact that you know the first 10 reviews that I read were good. Well those were probably the only 10 units that ever functioned properly after manufacturing. Because I failed to read all the one star reviews that said the thing died within several hours or a day one of them I think was like a month that guy got lucky. So I say again do not buy this. Stick with like a SanDisk from Best buy for 50 bucks. at least then you can just walk back to the store and get a new one if you need to. Instead of dealing with freaking Amazon.
5,I like that this is not only an MP3 but also has FM radio.  I like the feature where you can set it to shut off after a certain number of minutes so I can fall asleep listening to the radio or if I can't get back to sleep at night I can turn it on to FM talk radio station to get me back to sleep without it staying on all night long.  Sound quality is good and battery lasts a long time.  I use it to listen to music I've downloaded when I go running.  The size is much better for holding in my hand or for putting in zippered pocket during my run than a smartphone.
5,I actually still like MP3 players. I don't mind the standalone MP3 player. Quite honestly in some ways I prefer them. I don't have to sit there and listen to notifications that my phone makes. With a standalone MP3 player you don't have to listen to your phone chiming chirping beeping and making weird noises and it interrupts your songs. you can just put the headphones on or Bluetooth speaker or plug a external speaker into it. You could even plug it into your big home stereo system. and so I'm glad that I bought one of these. I picked up a couple other MP3 players. it's easy to read it's easy to transfer stuff to it. You just plug it into your Windows computer. It shows up as a drive letter . So just copy all the stuff that you want to it period and it works just fine.
3,I bought this for my son to use as an alarm clock. The sound is fine. It’s  not too hard hard to add music. I’m disappointed the alarm only sounds for like 15 seconds. Not as useful for waking up a teenager (which is the whole reason I chose this one). But my son likes it so 🤷‍♀️ we kept it.
2,It worked for several weeks，then could not turn it on any longer…
4,I was looking for a cheap alternative to the iTouch and this seems to fit the bill.  Still getting used to the navigation screens as I keep thinking it is a touch screen.  It paired easily with my Bose Mini Sound.  Setting up playlists so far is a little cumbersome but not a huge problem.  The sound quality to the Bose speakers is a little less than what I get from listening to my Samsung S8.  I will give it more time and see how it goes.
3,Bad sound  if you go through  bluetooth  better when going through  usb cord.Screen  light  doesn't  go bright enough  my sandisk Fuze mp3 player is brighter and easier to read.
4,This MP3 player is very nice. The only negative is that its not touch screen and its different in 2021.The only draw back is that the volume only goes up to 25 or something.  It comes with an arm holder for it headphones and a micro SD card USB cord. Transfer from computer to phone with no problems and the best way.It also has a speaker so that your recordings can be played back out loud also the songs.
1,I bought this because it was cheap and I just needed something to listen to music on.When i got it it worked fine. Hooked up to my computer to add the music and everything. Played great and everything was good………….for a couple of weeks.Found some more music I wanted to add and when I tried to hook it back to my computer it wouldn’t show up. I did everything I could on my computer to locate it but my computer was fully updated and fine. Could not get the device to show up or register that it was connected. It would just show that it’s charging.Only thing I didn’t want do that was a last ditch effort was to format the memory which would delete everything. I had no other options so I tried that. Still wouldn’t register as connected to my computer. So now I had a useless piece of metal that I could do nothing with.My advice is to avoid this and buy something else a little more expensive. If you decide to get it then you better hope you don’t need to add anything else after the first time you add music.Complete waste of money.
4,great MP3 player wish the screen responded to touch too that would be awesome but understand the draw backs as well with the travel of the aspect of the object..
1,I love to download audio books and listen to them on a mp3 player.  I have over 25 years of IT experience.  So imagine my frustration in trying to get my Windows 10 and Windows 11 laptops to recognize this device.  The USB ports work fine  but no matter how much configuration changes I made  this device was never recognized. I purchased this one to replace an older Zune MP3 player that suddenly stopped being recognized as Microsoft no longer supports Zune.  I believe that the issue may be with the upgrades to the Windows Operating systems.  Nowhere online is there any info from Microsoft on how to make the player recognizable.  They don't care.  I'll try Sansa and see if that works.
3,Bought this and it worked great for about ten uses. Really enjoyed the screen setup sound quality etc. Then the audio jack stopped working correctly and couldn't hear out the left ear bud. Tried a few earbuds too. So they sent me a new one right away which is great except that the replacement would not charge or even turn on after trying to charge it all day. Tried dif charging cords and outlets. Totally sucks cause I really liked it.
3,is not loud at all. have to crank the radio up to hear it after turning the mp3 up.
2,Needs accessibility options. I can barely see the writing when using sunlight. The display is very faint even when I cover it with my hand to shade it. Also the volume is low when using sync in the car. I have to turn the volume all the way up on the mp3 and my car just to hear it comfortably. Do not buy if you need accessibility settings.
2,Se pierde la senal con los audifono....
4,Like the size of it but do not like the idea you cannot turn the sound off..
1,I bought this because just so I could have music and podcasts at my work station while keeping to my job's rule of keeping your phone in your locker and not waste phone battery at the same time. I should have checked the other reviews first. So 1. this thing felt flimsy the second it came out of the box it seems like it will shatter if you drop it even a bit and with it being so slick its hard to grip sometimes while trying to use the interface. 2. Because its so slick its hard to make it read your touches properly 3. if you pause for even like 2-3 minutes the whole thing turns off and does not save to where you were. I was easily 2-2.5 hours into a podcast ran to the bathroom came back and found I would need to turn the device back on go back through all the menus and then fast forward to get back to where I was. 4. When it says mp3 it only means mp3 the device does not warn if a file you put in is a mp4  5. For a device made in 2020 it feels like its from 2005 with how it runs and looks. Likely this is an old software from that time that added bluetooth and someone is trying to make a quick buck off people who need an alternative to their smart phone for various reasons. Please don't waste your money on this cheap rip off.
3,Well it looked good to start. The volume is not able to be set high enough. Purchased this to use while mowing the yard and it barely was loud enough.Worst part is the headphone jack went bad after six months. Yes it has Bluetooth but I like to have a jack for higher volume. It seems to not have the full volume with Bluetooth. Would not purchase this product again!!!!
1,This thing does not play .mp4 files at all.  Only uses what they call .avi but it's some sort of non-standard .avi that requires you to use some Chinese-notated software that only runs on Windows apparently...  When you upload a folder of .ogg music it unpacks it and you loose the folder.  You can't load the SD-card with USB 3.0 and then plug it in because there's some sort of db indexing going on.  The FM radio works fine and I do like the stop-watch but I want something that accepts and plays video's as well as music and this thing just doesn't load-up well...Comes with inadequate instructions and does not support very many file formats.  I did get music to work but it isn't even compatible with .wav files..  .ogg worked okay but they're very thin files... I prefer other more rich formats.  Their support email-response was fairly fast but I do prefer US-Based support for my products with an 800 number to talk to a real person...  I would not recommend this .mp3 player.  Luckily I bought it on Amazon and they set up a return/refund right away.
4,El reproductor tiene buena calidad de sonido solo que si te gusta un volumen bastante alto al usar audifonos este no te servira ya que el volumen tiene un limite.Tiene buenos acabados es elegante  El parlante tiene una buena salida de sonido.
3,Purchased this to replace my buggered Apple Ipod of 12 years. Wanted to get away from Apple products and only Apple software and propriety programs.Purchased specifically for the gym and riding my mountain Bike using the supplied arm band for wearing. Took me awhile to transfer my mp3 files over to this player but playlists proved to be a pain in the ass to do. The one fallout I have with the unit is that the volume is somewhat limited even at the max of level 31. That might sound high but I would put that at about a normal level of 6 on my Ipod and there doesn't even seem like there is a way to get around it either (except wearing Sound Cancelling earbuds)
5,I use this product because I prefer having my own music vs. streaming services like Spotify. The touch screen is responsive and the sound quality is great. The volume is comfortably limited so If you need to blow your eardrums from time to time you'll need to bump the recording levels on your original music files. Formatting is a breeze and it holds power for an 8 hour shift at work and then some. (Note: I only have about 3/4 of its full capacity in use at this time.) I've had this player for about a month so lets see if it stands the test of time with almost daily use. So far....This is a great product and I would buy it again.
5,I really like how you can listen to music on this without headphones! Great product!
4,We don't always have access to internet and needed something that could play without the need of internet or cell service as there is none in the area we live in. Not reliably anyway. The first one that we got had a wierd glitch and we had to exchange it. It was replaced quickly and without any issues. Replacement was great. Loaded the music on it and ready to go.
2,Easy interface decent features but can't  see screen in the sunlight
4,For the price this MP3 is an excellent value.  Storage size charge time and battery life are all really good on this item.  I would recommend this MP3 player.The only thing I would like to see an improvement in is the user interface.  I had a little trouble figuring out if I was in an Album shuffle or Artist shuffle when I first used it.Other than that I am pleased with it.
3,Works great at playing music holds a good amount and I love the option to add additional music via an sd card (that’s what I did). The ONLY problem I have with this product that I can not rectify is that about  1/10th of the tracks I put in I just can not find on the player. I made sure the files on my computer all had the correct tags artist album artist album genre etc - but they still not display even under the “unknown artists” folder in the MP3 Player. It’s a shame really because this machine would be just perfect if not for that. If you have a smaller music collection (<30 gb of music) this might not be a problem for you. Still would recommend!
5,Love that its compact and can fit in little female pockets. Great price. It holds a lot of music and is perfect when you dont wana have a big phone on you just to listen to music. Love that it has Bluetooth so i can just send the songs to it instead of having it plugged in. Amazing for working out or running because its so small and compact
1,Right from the start you know you are in for a 'treat' with this product.  While the packaging is nice the company name is nowhere to be found on either the box OR the literature.  Let's talk for a second about the literature.  It may be in English but this is also not written in a clear fashion.  Nor does it give ANY operating instructions.  The only way to contact this so called company? An email which is where you get the name of the company for the first time.  Sorry I can't give you a rating on this product because I did not hold it in my hands long enough before putting back in the box and requesting a refund.  Amazon was lovely and the refund took all of six minutes on the phone.  Call so you can ask them to let you keep the product and not waste gas to return it.  Gas is VERY expensive these days.  This product clearly is not and you don't get what you pay for.  What DID I almost pay for? O M G
2,Display is very aggravating. Radio frequency in red is nearly impossible to read in any environment. Rest of display is adequate indoors but nearly useless outdoors.Works OK once you navigate to the song you want but due to the display you have to locate the song album before going outside.Very disappointed.Would not recommend unless you only want to use it indoors.
5,I LOVE this player!! I tried & returned 2 prior players. I read all the reviews & company information I could before choosing this MP3 player. The Mibao500 is very easy to use. It paired with my Bluetooth earphones without a glitch; Put all my music on without any problem. Sound is awesome (good earphones were used with extra base).  Bottom Line:  good price/ good size/lightweight/easy to use/holds all the music I need/armband okay but would have like a corner cut-out for hanging on a lanyard as alternate for armband but otherwise can't ask for anything better. Company offers excellent assistance. Better than most that ignore you after you make the purchase. Purchase this Mibao500  MP3 player without any worry.
4,First off I like the mp3 its good enough for me don't really need all the extra gadgets in an mp3 that are over a hundred dollars. Because most likely it is on your cell phone that has those gadgets. The mp3 max volume is 31 good sound don't need it on max. No issues with Bluetooth. One thing that is annoying about the mp3 is that it is a fingerprint magnet that gets so bad I occasionally have to wipe it down.
5,I rely on music to accompany me while working in the garden to keep my mind off my sore muscles.  This MP3 player meets all my needs with clear sound and the ability to pick up all available radio stations. It was a very good purchase for me.
5,Once you get it you got it.
4,Got this as a replacement for my 9 year-olds old MP3 player. It’s great in so many ways but the record button is so easily pushed that I have to delete 2-3 accidentally recorded audio files every day. He tried to delete them himself and ended up deleting all the music files. I haven’t figured out how he made that mistake but it’s something to watch out for. Overall we’re very happy with this purchase.
1,This worked fine for a few weeks.  I usually wear it during bike rides.  Then all of a sudden on a ride the sound cut off.  After stopping to investigate I saw that for some reason the "voice record" function was on. Weird.  I thought maybe I accidentally hit a button.  Next day same thing.  It started happening every time I used it.  Even if I just leave it alone sitting on a table and let it play for some reason the voice record function will take over after a period of time.  Now it is happening after just a couple songs and when I turn the power off then back on it immediately starts the voice record function again.  Today I had to power off and on 5 times before it would let me use the MP3 function then it went back into voice record before the first song even finished playing.  Tomorrow I will not be using this device.
4,I got this mp3 player for my mother and was initially worried that it would be too hard for her to learn to use but the interface is great and so far she seems to have mastered all the basic functions. The sound quality is on point as well. Hard to know about the battery life since we've had it for a week but it seems to be on par with similar models. Overall I'm happy with the purchase
4,It is a great product if you do not want to spend lots of money on a MP3 Player.  128MB Memory expansion is good if you want to load lots of music and it responds in decent speed.One pro about this one is that the software allows you to remove the song while it is playing something that cannot be done in other MP3 Players.There is no case for it So I am not sure how resistant it will be against drops.Cheers!
4,For the most part this is a fairly good mp3 player.  My two problems with it are:1. The manual is incomplete and at times due to language difficult to understand.2. I returned it because I need one that will pair with my hearing aids and I was unable to do that.
2,After using for about a month whenever I try to do anything other than listen to Fm radio I get a disk error message.
4,It is easy to load songs on the micro SD chip through your computer. The radio does play through a Bluetooth speaker but you have to have earphones  connected for the antenna to pull in the stations. I would like the station numbers to dominate the radio screen rather than a picture of a radio with little tiny Itty bitty red numbers. It recharges fast and will play all night.
3,The many favorable reviews for this product seem justified and it is obvious that people use it for jogging gym workouts etc. where high quality sound and adequate volume are not issues with inexpensive highly efficient ear buds. However for high end audiophile listening the volume available is very limited and only produces a moderate output entirely inadequate for deep bass and overall definition. With high end wireless earbuds such as my Shure 215's this product is worthless as far as volume is concerned. That said you shouldn't have a problem with less expensive earbuds such as the ones that come packed with the product-- but don't expect high fi sound!
2,This is useless. Does not have a page up  or down you cant shuffle thru artist songs etx. if you have 500 songs. You have to go thru them in order. no jumping or shuffle or again no page up or down. and does not work well with Automobiles. A useless purchase for me
3,I bought this cause it was ranked “best seller” and my last MP3 player had broke and I can’t live without one for when I go outa the house.I spent 60$ total to get it new and delivered quickly. It works fine and charged pretty quick but there is a ticking noise when I play music.Luckily I can drown it out if I turn it up a bit more but it’d annoying when you hear it fade out or into a song and you hear that tick.3/5 it works and I can deal with it but I wouldn’t buy it again just because of the ticking. Last one I had was cheaper and it sounded better.
4,This player seems to do everything it was designed to do. I bought it for the Bluetooth capabilities. I have an older Sansa Clip player which I feel has a far superior user interface and better and more balanced sound. What it doesn't have is Bluetooth which this unit has and it works very well. This new player is capable of playing videos but I didn't have a single video in my collection that met the limited qualification
4,Meets my need for a reliable simple reasonably priced MP3 Player.Sound would be improved with better quality headphones than providedCannot easily read time on player screen-requires a magnifying glass (for me -- maybe not you!)No regrets
4,Great value and the seller really cares and with skull candy ear plugs it has an excellent sound. The ear plugs that come with it fall out. Under sound settings 31 is max and when using a Bluetooth speaker 31 is not enough even if you increase the speaker’s volume. The seller sent me several videos to adjust the volume. Bottom line is not enough volume for Bluetooth speaker. Why.31?
5,Most of my music was on my phones every time I had issues with the various formats during the switch this put everything in one place easy to use and set up battery lasts a long time. So far very happy with it after a couple of months of use.
2,Just trash. did not like at all. do not recommend to anyone who consider to buy
1,I purchased this for music while walking. I transferred music onto it and it worked fine for a couple of weeks until one day it just stopped playing music in the middle of a walk. The screen still lit up and the touch buttons worked but I couldn't hear anything except for a little static when I would change songs. I checked the earphones but they were fine. I planned to return it for a refund but realized I had not kept the packaging. At that point I started messing around with it because I had notice that the front and back did not always seem to be tightly put together. I removed the SD card and when I put it back in it started playing music again. Problem then was that the catch would not keep the SD card in place and I had to manually hold it in or it would pop out again. I finally got it to catch and it is currently working. I wrapped the top part without the touch buttons in clear packing tape to keep it together. A total piece of junk.I used it for under ten hours before it stopped working and I have never dropped it or caused any other damage to it. If you do decide to buy this based on the positive reviews I suggest you save your packaging and hope that if it does stop working you are still within the refund period.
5,This mp3 player was great from the start when I had first opened the package I knew that this was an above average mp3 player. It had enough battery life to last the night and through the day it was easy to use and to add music to. And its audio quality was great. It has lasted me about 9 months so far and it still works great to this day. Great buy!
3,I like the MP3 player but volume is lower than expected even when pluging it into my car stereo system. No problem with interface. It says it has a DAC but I'm not sure. My smartphone has a DAC and sounds much louder than this device. Over all I guess for $40.00 it's ok. Would I've purchased it knowing what I have now probably not. I purchased this device to not have to use my smartphone but I guess i will still be using my smartphone. I just expected a little more out of this device. Not iPod expectations. Other than that it's nice.
3,It works. It has a lot of space. It is hard to organize songs except by album or artist.
2,When I first got the MP3 player it died after the first charge. The buttons were flashing rapidly and it wouldn't turn on. I got a replacement and after a single song it turned itself off. I had to hold the button for over 30 seconds before it would turn on then freeze when I tried to go to my music. After I managed to shut it off again and let it sit for about a day it turned on with seemingly no problem and started working. Then it shut itself off and stayed off after one song. I ended up returning it for a refund.When it does work it works fine. Just what I wanted in a MP3 player. Easy to use and navigate.
3,As a family we bought 4 of these mp3 players and were delighted initially with the sound quality ease of adding music and its bluetooth connectivity.  Unfortunately it was short lived.  Only one of these currently still functions properly.  2 stopped working for no apparent reason.  The screen would just flash or go dark.  The coating on the touch screen is also very easy to scratch with little to no durability.  I give it three stars because it was really nice with good functionality while it lasted.  Hope this help you all given the ratings on this were so high.
4,So far this is a great little mp3 player. It does everything I want and more.Cons:Can't add playlist I just made folders of my playlist and use those.Pros:I can have as many folders as the memory card allows and was what I wanted.It does work with a 128gb memory card as that is what I am using.It is light weight and small all good things for me.
2,This unit like another I recently purchased suffer from noise and static.  Player sounds good and player seems to work great.  But in between songs and when nothing is playing there is static and noise when using the menu and noise suppression is bad.  Other than that it's a decent player.  If you happen to not have the noise issue I recommend pairing with a bass boasting set of headphones.  I tried several and those type seem to work best with this player.  The way it reads folders can be pretty bad too.  I have several albums with the same title in the first few words and it grouped them all together.  You then have to go to folder view for some extra steps to get to the right album.  Other than that its a decent player. I will be returning it because I can't live with the static.ProsValueDecent sound when paired with the right headphonesBatteryConsReads and groups music folders oddlyStatic and noise when nothing is playing
4,price is ok
5,I cannot speak to the Bluetooth capabilities as of yet. I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband as he uses his phone for work and does not want to store music on it. I wanted to find a workable solution for the car and this seems to be it.  I can say as I spent hours transferring his music collection to the device it was relatively easy to do so. I wish the screen had touch capability as we are all used to that kind of interface now but it is relatively easy to figure out how to use it.  The storage capacity is huge. I think I am only three GB in. The music quality is great. I will come back after we have tried out the blue tooth.
3,The player's screen is too dark to see in daylight.  The volume setting is awkward too and doesn't play at a level loud enough for my liking.  I just wanted a player for playing some recordings formatted in FLAC but the player tries to do several things such as videos ebooks and radio.  I would have preferred a player that focused on music only if it would have made the screen interface more user-friendly. I wanted to like this but instead I've gone back to using my phone after just a week of trying with this player.
2,Intent was to use with a Bluetooth speaker. Attempted to connect to 2 different speakers and was never able to connect.
4,The case is a bot fragil but it does what it is suposed to do.  Others (I bought 3 other brands for grandkids) and some played videos and some didn’t.  This one was a couple of $ more but worth the differences.  Save yourself the frustration and forget the real cheap ones.  This one will do what it is suposed to do-  i would buy again.
3,Terrible battery life. Other than that it was pretty cheap and does the job.
4,This is a decent player but i found it not as easy to navigate as my old Sony MP3 player.  I mainly bought it because it had Bluetooth but i was never able to pair it up.  It's probably my fault for not understanding what to do. I did contact support by email [no support phone number} but that did not help.
3,Backlight is very dim!
5,I bought a new car that connects to MP3 players and also offers Sirius XM. I looked at Sirius XM package prices and realized that even though their channels are more specific I would still be listening to what someone else was playing. I want to listen to my favorites. So I dug around for my old MP3 player. I was missing the charger and it was really old and only holds 2G of music. So I went to Amazon to find a reasonably priced one with more capacity and that was small enough to leave in one of my car's storage compartment. This was exactly was I was looking for. Reasonably priced small and lightweight easy to transfer files and easy to operate.
2,This device has:- The dimmest screen of any device I've ever owned- The worst interface of any device I've ever owned- No practical way to sort your songs the way you want to- A bunch of useless functions the effort of which developing would have been much better spent on improving the interface and sortingDespite all this it will play music files.  Battery is good enough.  Nice size.  Mediocre build quality.  Will update this review if it breaks within a year the way it has for some other reviewers.  I feel like most of the positive reviews are from people putting 10 songs on it and immediately writing a review.
5,very good product!! long battery life lots of storage efficient compact cute and lasts a longgg time! also very durable. you should buy this :)
5,I replaced my old apple ipod with this Digital MP3 player. I am really happy with this player. Storage is expandable to 128 gigabytes. Came in perfect condition. I like that it is black and shiny. Very durable. Also comes with its own wrist band that can hold the player. I found it convenient when I go hiking or walking. I also really liked that it takes only about thirty minutes to charge it fully. It has Bluetooth 5 and can be attached to multiple devices. Supports different languages. Sound quality is great when you use headphones with Bluetooth connection. Also it has a built in speaker that allows you to listen to it even without headphones. Please note that there is no touch screen and at first it might be a little uncomfortable.
2,Bummer!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Overall I liked the quote thing.  Used it at work and it lasted the whole 12 hour shift with about half the battery left according to the image don't quote me on that.  If you want it constantly on set the Shutdown settings to 0 Minutes or it will turn off automatically 1 to 5 minutes after pausing.  You can also set the volume limit which was nice.  Decent product for a decent price.
3,The only issue I have with this player is that I get random cutting out when playing mp3 music files.  It doesn't happen with the same songs it is random and sometimes happens a lot then at other times its just happens a couple of times. I know it isn't the music files because it doesn't happen on my computers or in our car with the same mp3 files.  I'm thinking about resetting the player and reloading the music to see it that fixes the problem.
4,Love the sound quality! Love the battery life! Still don't know how to use all the bell and whistles! Will have to go to YouTube.Update 01/13/2022 - After 1 year music comes through only right channel on all ear phones and plugs. No idea if this can be fixed. Still it has great sound. Had to deduct the one star because of lack of stereo sound now.
3,This item is advertised as being able to play videos but no matter what I do it doesn't play them. I've met the requirements to play videos but still it displays 'File Error'
5,I have enjoyed how long the battery life is.  I like that it has enough storage for the music that I want.  I am really happy to pay the price compared to other music players.
5,Bluetooth is a great feature to have. It makes it much easier to listen to music as apposed to only corded.- Touchscreen is also a very great feature to have. It's very cool and i like it a lot and gives good display in little light.- I like that it has speakers a lot aswell. Instead of having to grab headphones.- The addition of the headphones and armband was a great addition to have.- The microSD card that came with it is also a good size. 32 gigabytes can fit a lot of stuff on it. (at least for me)Overall a very good product and deserves a five star rating.
5,I was looking for a replacement for an aging iPod but since it was for casual use didn't want really to spend the amount it would cost for a new iPod. After doing some research and comparisons I settle on this little guy and I'm so pleased I did.The sound quality is pretty decent even when not twinned with Bluetooth speakers. It was very easy to upload to. The interface is a little different but easy to manipulate once you get used to it.It isn't touch screen.It has a neat sleek look and the added armband is a nice touch.The seller was very prompt in their delivery and it arrived well packaged. I would definitely recommend both product and seller.For the price of this you can't go far wrong.
2,where to start.  bad interface menu shuts itself off after each song wont play more than one song from playlist with out having to restart player again does have a good battery life.  price is wrong should be $1.00
5,Having to be an avid MP3 player buyer since the 90s' I know I got a great device. Its simple to use and holds thousands of songs and podcasts. I use this in a work setting where my work is sensitive about cameras so this player is allowed. I use the Bluetooth feature and its wonderful. I can walk around my whole office and never lose connection. I can work two days without plugging in the MP3 player and even then the player still holds a charge of about 20%. It comes with a built in speaker which I use on weekends and trust me the speaker is loud. I have already recommended this device to friends who have since purchased this for themselves.
4,The functions aren't as diverse as I hoped. Creating playlists etc. is not a simple task but it plays mp3 and does the job. It does not play MP4 video files. However the SD card it came with included a utility to convert MP4 and other file types to a compatible version. It is for Windows (including Win10) and worked well for me.
3,Like:Amazing battery life!Expandable storageSizeDislike:Not touch screen but posing like it isEQ settings didn't make much of a differenceBluetooth connecting process is awkwardOverall:Not bad for the price but the pictures are a bit misleading. If you are into aesthetics this isn't what you're looking for. However the battery life is what will will you over. I work in a secure environment and I can't have my phone with me but we can have music players. So this was needed and it does what I needed it do.
3,- Weird interface.- Buttons stop working when it gets too hot.- Screen and buttons feel super cheap- Headphone jack started messing up after two weeks barely works now.- Features that should be easy to use and standard either aren't there or are difficult to use.+ Frame feels very sturdy.+ Battery life is amazing+ Bluetooth works well enough (not the best range but has never been a problem)= Worth the price but barely. Go a step up in price if you can.
4,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this MP3 player. The battery life is much longer than I thought it would be and for a cost of under $50 in total this is a great value. It takes a little getting used to since you cannot scroll the screen but it doesn't take long to catch on.
1,This unit just reeks of poor engineering and aggressive cost-cutting. As mentioned in many reviews the display is so dim it is impossible to be seen in a majority of light conditions. The UI looks like a touchscreen but ... it's not. The actual buttons can be unresponsive although ironically they seem hyper-sensitive to fabric. Thus placing the unit in your pocket can trigger random play track advances huge volume jumps or descents etc. Add all of that to very iffy Bluetooth connectivity and you have a player to avoid.
3,I ordered this for a gift to a non-techy person. One person here had posted instructions for transferring music to it. His instructions were great. While the player would find the folder containing the music it insisted there were no music files inside that folder. Even though clearly there were. The purpose of getting this player was so their CD collection could be played in a car with no CD player. Do not need it if it's not going to recognize files from CDs. Otherwise it seemed to be a great little player.
4,This device is great if you just need a simple mp3 player and don't really care about lossless audio. Getting music onto it is very simple and the navigation is clean and smooth. Connecting a pair of Bluetooth headphones is painless and great for when you want to work out. When using wired headphones It lacks a little bit when it comes to bass output but it's definitely serviceable. Overall I'm very pleased with this device.
5,I received the item in an undamaged shipping box undamaged product box.  The device backing was completely detached and all but of the plastic knobs supposed to be holding it on were not there.  Returned it and ordered it again.  Took a lot longer to get that package in the mail but received it undamaged.  I'm used to apple products so it took me a minute to get used to the interface.  I use this in my work office and it is always plugged in so battery power I'm not sure about.  The speakers on the device are good but I use a separate speaker.  Connects easily to bluetooth.
1,I bought this Bluetooth mp3 over others because the Bluetooth connection was supposed to be very good.It isn't. The player cuts in and out if I put the player in a pants pocket. I like to put the little mp3 players in the watch pocket of my Levi's. I have a couple pairs of wireless earbuds that work fine with other devices; so the earbuds aren't the problem.The interface is next to impossible to see if you are outside; even in the shade.I realize that the mp3 is cheap and I didn't expect it to have a lot of range; but I didn't expect it to crap-out at 2 to 3 feet.
4,I have been using this for couple of months and it has been very good. I wanted to have something for my kids other than phone when they do  treadmill and it servers the purpose. Bluetooth is amazing and able to download various types of songs. I tried some other MP3 Player on Amazon but their Bluetooth connectivity is bad. Overall happy with my purchase .....
2,Display too dim; can be adjusted but it’s terrible outdoors. Interface is janky at best touching the player on most spots changes the song or stops it. Bluetooth difficult to connect when connected has dropouts and punch outs that occur frequently destroying the integrity of the recording. It’s just like your at a party in the 70s and people bouncing/dancing causes the record to skip. File system is primitive this is poorly designed operates poorly and in 15 minutes it was evident it needed to go back.
1,When I first purchased this in November 2020 it was a backup to my Apple Ipod Classic which still works thankfully but I wanted to slowly start rebuilding my mp3 collection on a backup player. This mp3 player doesn't compare to an iPod but it plays music. I was able to group my songs into folders (playlists) easy enough. But this past week when I added more mp3's to it it would suddenly freeze and not play the new songs I added to the microSD card. When I removed the microSD card and played the songs from my computer or my laptop the mp3's would play with no issues. When I popped the microSD card back into this mp3 player only the songs I previously had on there would play but when it would come to a new song I put on the memory it would freeze. By process of elimination I first reformatted the microSD card put the mp3's back on it and played it from my computer and laptop it worked fine. When I popped the reformatted microSD card into the player nothing but freezing. I'm gonna say something glitched with the mp3 player so I'll be purchasing another one (of a different brand altogether) that hopefully will not have this issue. Frustrating. Ultimately I'm just glad my iPod hasn't crapped out on me in the 10+ years I've had it.
3,Poorly lit display...likely to save battery life. Firmware I think was poorly designed. Difficulty mating bluetooth to: in my case MB GL450. Unable to mate either unit as USB device in same vehicle.
4,I don't like that I have to use an sd adapter to unlock the mini sd to transfer music on to it because its locked in the mp3 player and how hard it is to get the mini card out. Other than that it's got a good battery and easy to use once you get the music on it.
4,Once I figured it out it was easy to work... The instructions were Ok but a little small for my older eyes...It's light weight... Just had to get used to not having a touch screen like an Iphone... Overall it's a good MP3!!
2,If I had a chance to do it again.  I would have likely bought a different player.  This one is very SLOW.  I would return but missed the window...
1,I don’t know where to start. There’s no way to transfer your playlists onto this MP3 player which means you have to transfer all of your music onto the player and then go through the alphabetized music list and one-by-one place each song in its playlist folder. But bear in mind it’s a 3-step process each time you do this. I also couldn’t find a way to name my playlists created on the player. They’re just called Playlist 1…2…3… Also the player wasn’t always recognized on my computer. Only half the time would the player’s icon appear on my computer. ALSO—after no more than a few seconds the player’s screen goes black and you have to keep pressing the “on” button to get it back on which means you have no time to think about what song you want to choose or action to take.
1,Brought this item and at first after I down loaded all my music I uses the auxiliary plug to listen is my car and everything was good the only thing once I tried to connect it using the blue tooth to my car it couldn't connect so back to the auxiliary cord (but it would connect to a blue tooth speaker or head phone) now i didn't uses it that often so after three month old the Mp3 player stop working and I couldn't reset it or power it on and once I contacted the company they decided to send me a new one but somehow I never received it and when I tried to email the company again they did not return my email.  Wouldn't not buy this one again.
5,This is a very good MP3 player. The product has a very solid metallic frame and is of good design. I found the installation of music from my PC extremely easy. The pairing of the devise to my Bluetooth headphones and external speakers was very easy and the sound to both is very good. The included 32GB memory card was easy to load music onto and to install into the unit. The internal memory and external memory allows the storage of thousands and thousands of songs. I found the instructions very useful and provided all necessary information to use the unit. I am very happy with this product and would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a good quality MP3 player.
4,The product offered exemplary characteristics and impressive storage capacity it behaved flawlessly multiple timesuntil it started freezing once and again with no apparent reasonI gave it try best shot erasing and transferring audio files from my computer but again I ran into the glitch Icommented above.Even though I consider more quality control is warranted it's a solid product
4,Fantastic design.Excellent quality/price ratio.Enjoy.
4,So far so good.  Works.  Easy to use.  Taking it on a year long walk from Canadian border to Tijuana.  Will see how well it holds up.  If good I’ll buy another for backup and leave an even more favorable review
4,I bought this to use in my truck. I was using my phone but the music took up too much memory.  It was pretty easy to figure out until I wanted to connect it with my truck.  That was a little challenging for a non-tech older person but finally managed it with some help from my wife.  :)
3,I mostly use it for listening to audiobooks. It does pretty much everything I ask it to do. I find it convenient that it comes a speed adjuster since some audiobooks can be a bit slow. This is something that my old ipod did not have. It would be even better if you can change how fast you can fast foward/rewind. Right now it does have a "ramp up" system to change how fast it goes but can still take a while.Update: Welp after using it for about a year and a half it completely died out of nowhere. Such a shame it was decent while lasted
4,This MP3 player was more than I hoped to receive. It works great and the battery life seems to be very long. I used it nonstop all day today while driving my delivery truck and it still has probably 75%. I also noticed it has a picture option so i may be able to use it to look at trail cam pictures.
3,I have only owned this product for a few days so it's durability is still up n the air.On the plus side it is lightweight attractive and easy to use.I compared it to my FiiO M6 which costs $200 and the difference was striking. The sound was thin lacked depth and most notably had almost no bass.We plan to use it for mostly spoken word and for that it sounds fine.
5,I bought this MP3 player for running and gym workouts. It was very easy to transfer from my laptop play list to the device. It has huge memory so even with my long playlists there is room for more. I like the other options of radio and recording. Screen is touch screen. I highly recommend this light weight easy to use MP3 player.
5,I bought this for my 9 year old nephew for Christmas and he is really enjoying it. It has an easy user interface that he and I were able to figure out and master quickly upon opening Christmas day. He can access radio and download music to listen to. He absolutely loves music and this was such a great investment for him. He was listening to music downloaded to his tablet which drained his battery very quickly. Now with the MP3 player his music is available almost all day. He also likes the armband that allows him to carry it with him. I'd definitely recommend the product for anyone wanting music to listen to while working out or just being around the house.
3,Well I love the sound but I need to return it because the left channel dropped pit sp I only have right side to listen to. I need to return it in hopes this doesn't happen again
3,Very nice looking unit but... Could not connect via bluetooth to Soundcore headsets nor with Phonak hearing aids.  This is the second MP3 with bluetooth I have purchased from Amazon and the second one I've returned.  I wanted to listen to booktapes while working around the house (i'm retired) without having the cord dangling from my headsets.  Instruction sheet leaves a lot to be desired especially concerning adding music or books to the unit. If the bluetooth had worked I would have given it 5 stars.  And yes I contacted Amazon Support and they could not get me connected either.
5,I know the return window to return this product closed on January 22nd 2022! HOWEVER.. IT IS NOT WORKING LIKE IT SHOULD FOR SOME REASON. SO IF POSSIBLE COULD I GET A "RETURN PACKAGE WITH A LABEL" AND RETURN IT... AND MAYBE GET SOME KIND OF CREDIT? Thanks!  : )Dave Lane
5,It is really easy to use. I wish the screen was brighter.
5,To help disconnect during my runs I wanted to be able to listen to music without carrying my phone.  Enter this MP3 player.  The bluetooth feature allows me to use my running headset and still listen to music without being reachable via phone- EXACTLY what I was looking for.  The MP3 player is easy to load (drag and drop via folder system) with music and playback is great.  I also like the radio option for longer walks. At under $50 it was a great purchase for me and it does exactly as I need it to.
4,You get what you paid for this item. Works ok but will not hold settings after you change them. i.e. volume channels. Goes back to factory settings.
1,Caution: If you can deal with disappointment you can go ahead and buy this product otherwise avoid it. This is just a basic device to play MP3 music period. It cannot play MP4 format or video as advertised on Amazon/their site. You have to convert all other formats to MP3. Also the Bluetooth connectivity does not work. Sadly when I reported the situation the Aiworth Support team did nothing to help. So BEWARE!
5,Easy Setup. The fact you input any music format into it by copy and paste is the deal. Sound production is also great.
5,It took a little while for the package to come but that was just because of the snow. I had gotten this for my husband. He used to have a phone that he would carry at work and listen to music. However he really does not like having a phone and got rid of it. He has to have something that is bluetooth. I am giving this to him for his birthday. I really like the look of the mp3 player. It is small enough to fit easily in my husband's pocket too. It comes with a charger headphones and a little armstrap for runners. I am well pleased. I like the amount of storage on it too.
3,I bought this device primarily for UNiversity of Tennessee football games where I listen to the FM radio during the games. The instructions are poorly written but I have figured out most of the information. I just bought a wireless Bluetooth headset but it does not work with the radio. I am hoping it will work when I get some music recorded on the MP3 player.
4,Liked it but sent it back because it was not loud enough and with a touch screen every time I took it out of my pocket it would turn off including if I just wanted to turn volume up or down.
3,It's not bad. It works fine and is easy to figure out without the directions. My only issue is it seems cheaply made for something that's almost 40 bucks. The backplate has a section that was overhanging the player and when I brushed up against it it opened up and bent. It's not bad but I feel like if they aren't going to make sure it's solid and not going to break open then it's more work 15 20 bucks not almost 40.
5,Back in October 2020 I was looking to replace my Google music. I found the MB08 MP3 player attractive looking especially at night when the whole system lights up. Built quality is very sleek. The sound quality is awesome. It has a high quality ambience sound when using quality ear-buds. What surprised me the most was the built in speaker sound. There is no need for an additional bluetooth speaker. Great bass sound. Navigation is easy. Battery life is great. I saw many MP3 players on Amazon but my eyes caught this one because of the honest statement "About This Item". In my honest opinion I saw the rest but this MB08 MP3 player is the BEST. I am pleased. Will purchased again.
5,This device works great so far. As I have mentioned earlier there are one or two setbacks. One setback is that this device only offers three playlists for the whole device. The other setback is that it looks like a touch screen so you will end up having an automatic urge to touch the screen repeatedly so watch out. ;) The SanDisk card is a little tricky to take out so use something just as small to push on the chip until you hear a small click. Other than what was mentioned this is a great way to get some tunes. I especially love how the radio is incorporated. Genius!
2,gave 2 stars mainly cause it was hard to use and I returned it
5,If you are looking for a good priced easy to use mp3 player that has all the basic functions you need then this is perfect for you! I was easy to set up download music to and connect to my car. I tried out the radio function you must use the earbuds to get it to work (they act as the antennae) and it sounds clear. The only thing I think would make it better is if it was touchscreen just because I am so used to that and I keep tapping the screen before remembering I need to use the buttons. So far I am very satisfied and would recommend this.
3,Okay for knock around. User interface is awkward. Durability is yet to be determined.
2,I just got this today and I would be impressed if not for the defects in the display. There are three black marks that might appear at first like scratches but they are beneath the LCD.I may return this but I might be willing to keep if some of the price is refunded since it is cosmetic but I wouldn't expect a new product to have any display defects.Oh it also has the issue of omitting characters in names. I have one group that the last letter of the name is missing but it isn't a length restriction because other names are longer. Not as bad as some of these cheap players that duplicate letters on many names.In the photo you can see one black mark near the right of the group Blackhawk. Another major one just right of "Clay" a smudgy mark on the line below that near the right.
2,I bought this MP3 player in October 2020 mainly for the Bluetooth capability.  Right off the bat it did not and would not sync up with my bluetooth earbuds.  I contacted the company and while they were very responsive they believed the problem was with the earbuds (which paired up with no problem with my cell phone).  It was a nice little player otherwise and the battery life was really great.  Today (5 months after purchase) I went to try to change music tracks and nothing happened.  I thought if I just powered it off and back on it would fix itself and found I could not power it off.  It is still playing--I left my earbuds plugged in so I can't hear it and I guess will just have to wait til the battery dies to get it to shut off.  There is no no display on the screen either.  All in all I would recommend not buying this player!
5,I bought this for my young son who loves music as a Christmas present. After using this for a week I am very happy. Songs and videos are easy to load via my laptop the device shows up as a drive when I plug in the usb cable. The manual is clear and the player is very easy to use without instructions - very user friendly.  The battery life has been good so far and the sound quality is very nice. I didn’t buy it for this feature but I really love the recording feature. There is a switch on the side which allows you to record voice. I recorded some nice messages for my son. Overall a very nice MP3 player for the price!!
5,I bought this mp3 player for my husband when his sony mp3 started dying. He loved his sony mp3 players in the past but I decided to try something new. He was pleasantly surprised by how good this mp3 player is. He works 3rd shift and uses it at work. His only issue he has had was the sound quality with the particular bluetooth headphones but with his regular wired headphones no problem at all. He loves the quality of sound playing aloud without headphones too. He was also very happy that he was easily able to transfer all of his music from his ps3. Definitely a great find and I am glad I decided to try it!
5,So far so good! Used for a few days now and haven't run into anything I don't like yet!I was concerned about the volume cap for headphones some complained that it was too low. I did not find it to be an issue at all! I can listen comfortably with the volume at 18 even with one ear bud in my bad ear.The external speakers are pretty decent too I like using those for when the kids listen to stories. They can both hear it without having to share head phones! If I play want to play music then the Bluetooth speaker option is great too!
5,I didn't expect much from this little device.  However I got it and boy was I happy. I used my Bluetooth earbuds and let the good times roll.  The sound quality is clear and crisp and the bass is pretty great as well.  I will say it takes a little bit to get used to using the controls on the device but once you have it load your songs and go.  The only thing I wish I was able to do is upload my iTunes to it.  unfortunately you can't unless you change the formatting.. I don't know how to do that so the MP3s were the best I could do.
4,So far I’ve just used the music aspect with Bluetooth headset. Well I haven’t received a reply to my email I find it the brightness of the screen is severely lacking and if I’m outside or in the shade I can barely read it. Hopefully their tech-support has a fix for this.
5,I got this product primarily to work with my large outdoor Pathfinder 4 Bluetooth speaker system.  The speakers can pick up the BT signal from about 75 feet away (not the 100 feet as promised but that's probably the fault of the Pathfinders).  The main reason I like this was the price - I'm tired of paying a lot of money for the iPods or similar products that do not provide any better sound.  This one is so cheap that if and when it loses its battery capacity I'll just get another - hopefully that's not for a long time.
1,I've owned this unit for about 6 weeks and have used it enough to really hate it.  Battery life is good but the interface is worse than terrible.  It shuts its controls off way too soon so if you want to fast forward change tracks or do anything other than adjust volume you have to press the power button again and navigate the menu over and over again.Another problem I've encountered is the player's poor bluetooth connectivity.  I just got a new expensive set of JBL earbuds and the player doesn't see them.  It won't connect with them.Lastly the player is very slick and easy to drop.  I'm out of the return window so I guess I'll have to apply some mustard and eat it.A short amendment.  The operating system in this pos shuffled my (book) files so that they are unusable.  I put 8 books on it and now the playing order is track 1 of disc 1 then disc 2 etc. in all 8 books.  Completely unusable.  The Aiworth is headed for the trash can.  I'd rather light two $20's and a $5 on fire than buy this thing.
5,Very nice product for the price. Was a little difficult to connect blue tooth. Just kept trying and then no problem. Memory is huge capacity.
4,Great little gizmo for the price.  The only drawbacks I find are  Max volume is too low and cannot be adjusted higher than 30.  Wish it had an Auto Volume Control to keep the volume at the same level for all songs played.
5,It takes some getting used to for someone used to the old apple Mp3 players but it's not too difficult to learn.Plenty of room for all my old music a radio and it even plays video. 32 GB memory card comes with it. It does NOT play M4A files (most of my old itunes music) but there are online conversion tools available.Blue Tooth connects well to vehicle blue tooth systems. I thought it would connect to my blue tooth headphones but that's not the case.Sound quality is very good through an AUX cable too.Like I said it's good for $40
2,Bought in April and lasted to today Aug 1. The screen started flickering with white scattered light about a week ago and now no longer plays tunes. This is not a touch screen but a touch pad interface that sits below the screen. You need to use arrows up/down/left/right to select stuff in the screen. Synced with bluetooth headphones as wired headphones didn't produce good sound. This was used everyday during 30-60 minute walks (not running or jogging) in the neighborhood. I'm guessing this would fair worse for more active people.  Sucks as it lasted long enough to be out of the return window. Pulled back cover off to check battery and see if there were any loose connections. No dice... Battery didn't seem to be a problem. Nothing obvious was disconnected. It didn't seem to be defective I think it just wears out based on weak/cheap parts.
5,Our 11 year old wanted a personal music player to take with him on the go. It was easy to set up although we did need to find out SD card adapter in order to transfer MP3 music files onto the mini-SD card that the device comes with. He has been happy with it and we are excited about the additional features such as being able to record voice notes and videos. The ability to connect or transfer data via bluetooth seems like a good option too but we haven't tested that out yet. We would purchase again.
3,Will not sync with sound system
4,It's small & user friendly. The onboard speaker isn't that good but I don't think it was intended for that application. BT works fine. No problems so far. Not bad & at a fair price.
1,I bought this for my kids piano lessons. Since they are young I only put the 3 songs on it that they need currently in their class. I am the one using it and the kids haven't touched it. We did one music lesson made sure it was charged then turned it off and put it on the piano. 2 hours later it was black and wouldn't even turn on anymore. It is trash! Returning!
3,Seemed fine to me but it was a gift for my brother. He said it was to small for his fingers to manipulate.
2,false advertizing ... sent it back the next day after attempting to record various versions of MP4.  IT ALSO will not sync with your iPhones... very limited use.
2,Very not worth a nickel much less for what I had to pay for it. I advise to not purchase. Just don't buy this crap unit.  so they said "Hello very sorry for the issues you encountered. As for your question if you do not satisficated with the volume of the player you can apply refund via Amazon. Hoping to help you." Hmmmmmmmm  I smell dodo talking
2,Tried all manner of methods to get this to work.  If it's not disk problems it's a format error.It will not play my mp3 music like my other three Mp3 players.Tried different methods to transfer the music.Have reset player at least 10 times as it Freezes up and nothing works.
5,A great little player at a very good price I really love it.  Very easy to use and stores all my music.
4,Interface hard to use. Bluetooth works now that i found earpiece that connects. Sound is hard to adjust with the downloaded CDs. Requires some trial and error. Radio is a no go Here in My area. I love the size of this unit fits my pocket and power last all day.
4,Seems to be a good player. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn’t say in the description that it can play MP4. And I do not want to give my little kids something that can play MP4.But when I turned it on i saw on the screen the MP4 option. So I returned it.
4,This will do everything you need an MP3 player to do. The sound quality is good it's lightweight and you put in a micro card of considerable size to expand the number of files you can carry. The only issue for me is the controls aren't very user friendly. Well worth the money.
3,The pros;Sound quality is good for the price. Awesome storage capacity. Bluetooth has a really good range.The cons;Very primitive controlls. In shuffle mode it tends to play the same 30 or so songs 80% of the time(I have over 2000 songs by over 150 artists on the sd card but in a 10 hr work day it will play the eagles hotel California 4 times bob seager nightmoves 6 times ECT.) and in 3 weeks has not played a single song from atleast 40 albums.
5,I am not familiar with MP3 player but I had to transfer the audio book from the old one into the new one and purchased this product.  Firstly it arrived in 4 days after I ordered earlier than it was planned.  I immediately opened and start working on it.  I wanted to know how to rearrange the order of the downloaded audio and emailed the tech support.  The response came within the 6 hours and it was very helpful.  I would recommend this product not only the quality of the player but shipment and the tech support were excellent as well.
1,Worked fine for 2 weeks. My main complaint originally was the low volume. Compared to other MP3 players I've owned the volume is very low maybe half to 2/3rds and that is with the volume maxed out. Then issues popped up with the record switch. The device thinks the record is enabled even when the record switch is off. So you will be listening to music and randomly it will exit your song & start recording you! The device will respond to nothing you do & continue recording you. The only way to stop it is to shut off the device and when you turn it back on it will start recording you again! This device is trash total waste of money.
5,First off the MB08 is ready to go from the box.  The only thing we experienced was the charging cord provided was exactly that... a charging cord.  Once we deduced that and used another cord we were able to transfer music and files with ease.  The player has some decent heft to it making it feel like a well built item.  The interface was also good... once you get used to it.  I am used to a touch screen so using dedicated controls was a bit of an adjustment but no big deal.  In all I would heartily recommend the MB08.  I will post an update if something changes!
4,I really like this MP3 player it has excellent battery life and sound quality for the price point. Super lightweight and comfortable to carry in my hand but it doesn’t feel scrunched. The buttons work great and have just the right sensitivity. The included memory card was a nice bonus!
5,I like this little machine a lot. It's been very easy to learn and use and YES it works with a Mac! I put the flash drive into the computer added a folder named 'All Music' and then on the device selected 'Update Play List'. My one teeny comment is it is a little slow to start playing so I need to be patient after pressing the play button. The first couple of times I kept pressing play so when it started playing it went back and forth from play to pause till it caught up with how many times I pressed the button... My Bad. I'm impatient.
3,Mostly good so far.  My complaints are that it doesn't allow for easy access to the music and you can't access any folders directly to play from.  There are 3 playlist folders and you have to manually put in each music into a playlist one by one.  You can't drag a bunch of music into it.  Not an efficient way to create playlists especially if you have over 100 songs.
3,I bought this player to replace the player of a different brand with headphone jack issues. This player seemed just ok with sound quality.  The bass was extremely weak regardless of sound preset chosen rockjazzetc. It has been reliable with no headphone jack connection problems. The player of a different brand with headphone jack issues had excellent sound quality while it was working. With that said this player continues to work with extremely good battery life also. The same headphones were used in my evaluation of sound quality.
4,Only had this for a short time but so far it does what its supposed to do.  I mainly use it to play all my CDs that I recently ripped to my computer.  I also put 1 eBook on to try that function and had no problems.  Can't speak to the durability yet but I am happy so far.
5,We bought 2 of these for our children as the previous ones we bought were difficult to use. Both of our children were thrilled with this product. They expressed that these devices were much easier to use and navigate compared with the ones from the previous year (a different brand). We highly recommend this product.
5,This was a nice surprise. The mp3 player was very easy to learn to use and going to different functions was easy. Greeted by a colorful "Welcome" screen then straight to the different device uses. Radio blue tooth and settings (and more). All right there and easy to use. Mine came fully charged not sure if that's true for all buyers of this product though...It connects to blue tooth earbuds very well and quickly which is lovely. I've had devices that either A) took forever to connect or B) never connected to anything. Great product! Not everyone's experience with this device will be perfect but mine has been pretty good (so far ;P :).
4,The only downside I found is that the user manual doesn't explain how to create playlists or even how to load music onto the device. For someone with previous experience using other mp3 players it wasn't hard to figure out. However a clear explanation in the user manual would be a nice improvement.
5,Sound quality itself from the device is poor but that's to be expected and no one uses mp3's like that anyway. No problem if you use a headset plug it into the car or bluetooth speaker etc. Interface is easy to navigate and easy to drag and drop files into the device for playback.
5,I love this MP3 Player it is very easy to set the bluetooth and the sound quality is very nice and clear with nice bass. The battery life is also great I used it for about 3 hours before I left the house for work and then I forgot to turn it off. When I got home from work after 7 hours I was able to use it the MP3 Player without charging it that's how great the battery life is.  I will recommend it to everyone because I love it and I can say with confidence that you will find it to be one of the best MP3 Player too.
4,PRO:- Built-in speaker- Has lots of memory. 32GB is a lot of music and videos- Bluetooth- Look and feel of player is nice love the rounded edgesCON:- Most option are hard to figure out
5,The sound quality is great. I like that it is light weight. My iPhone and iPod are too heavy to put in my shirt pocket without them pulling down on my shirt; I wanted something light enough to prevent that. Sideloading my music is as easy as drag and drop unlike my Apple stuff that forces me to go thru the hassle of iTunes. With the ability to increase the SD card size to 128Gb I can load a ton of music and audio books. The FM radio voice recorder and Bluetooth 5.0 are nice add-on features for the MB08 that a lot of other MP3's don't have at this price.
5,This Aiworth Mp3 player has many more features than I am accustomed to. The interface allows for moving forward and backward up and down in selecting features. The sound quality of the player is good.  I like the ease of syncing songs the clear on/off power button and having the option to record. I haven't explore the blue tooth feature as I prefer to use hardwired earbuds. The overall design of this Aiworth player is sleek and lightweight and the price point is accessible. I'm looking forward to listening to songs I haven't heard in awhile as my older player (different brand) skipped many in its narrow shuffle groove!
5,Sound quality is fine but it also depends what earphones you use. The fact that its compact and easy to carry around is what I like since i like doing different activities and cant carry my phone for music without it falling out of my pocket at all times. The armband/protective sleeve is a great wy to just carry music around at all times and when i get tired of my music i use the radio. It has speakers but to use the radio you need headphones as the "antenna". The screen sensitivity is normal according to what im use to on a typical touch phone.
4,So this just came in the mail today. so far it has been easy to use and the quality seems great. Can't comment on battery life as of this moment since haven't had it long enough to determine how long it lasts.
4,It plays well and sounds great and can be able to download music from your computer. One complaint is that its hard to get into the interface at first but you will get used to it afterwards. 4/5 stars
3,I purchased this player so that I could begin the process of transferring all of my C d's. I didn't realise that I had to buy the 128GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card separately but that arrived quickly so no problem.  This is a good little player but I wish I had invested in one that had a true touch screen with icons. I don't find navigating this one easy; to be quite honest the directions included were incomplete and not very helpful.
3,Overall the player is ok however I got it specifically so that I could have a player to put in my car instead of my phone. When I started making my first playlist it told me it was at capacity after fewer than 100 songs. I like big playlists that I can start and listen to for several hours. This player does not have that functionality.
3,The Bluetooth works like a charm but the headphone Jack is ass. Bluetooth use ONLY.
5,This is a great mp3 player. I use it exclusively for old radio dramas like the Whistler X Minus One the Mysterious Traveler etc. I pair this device with a high-quality speaker and listen to the old radio dramas for hours and hours. A great device at a very reasonable price. By the way I mistakenly spent $11 for a micro SD card but it was not necessary. This device comes with a 32GB micro SD card already installed. Just pop it out load your files and pop it back in the slot and you are good to go.
1,Being the supposed top choice mp3 player on Amazon I think I got a bad batch or something? This thing was nothing but problems from the start constant freezing when I played any song ! It wouldn't even turn off no matter what buttons I pushed finally turned off by it self and I formatted the device to no avail ! As soon as I uploaded my music it would freeze all over again so frustrating paying for some thing that just doesn't work. Asked for a refund and I didn't want another one of these at all so I went for the AGPTEK A19x for 4 dollars more and what a difference ! The AGPTEK works like a charm and I love it !
4,usage instructions
1,It was great at first...but then when the computer stopped recognizing the device all hell is loose. What's the point of getting an MP3 that will only download songs for about a couple months? The device is still really new but after a while something seems to be eating it away. I rarely use it and when I do I expect to use it. CAN SOMEONE JUST TELL ME WHY THE DAMN COMPUTER WILL NOT DETECT THE DEVICE! I tried to detect it on all computers (and my jump drive works just fine) I tried all kinds of plug ins and NOTHING WORKS. It's a scam I tell you. Until they give me reasons DO NOT BUY THIS! I tell you you WILL REGRET IT
2,I purchase this device primarily to help control my anxiety. I found that listening to soft calm music is my life savior. Rather than search for a radio station with soft/calming music when I feel anxious I brought this device so that I could upload soft/calming music that I can listen to when needed. L loved the item however I am disappoint. I pressed the power key and it sank into the device and now it does not work.  Perhaps this is flaw with this particular item that was sold to me but I would greatly appreciate a replacement.
3,The volume and other controls are clumsy to use  but the volume control is irritating to use
5,I especially like the built-in speaker. Since I have a mild form of tinnitus I do not like feeding sound directly into my ears. This speaker puts out sound at more than sufficient volume for my purposes even at the midpoint of the volume slider. The sound quality was much better than I expected from such a small unit. It was easy to transfer files from my PC although they did not appear arranged in the categories as I thought they would. I'll need to do more experimenting on that. Battery life was excellent. The included 32 GB card holds a massive amount of music.
5,Purchased this along with a bluetooth receiver to get rid of my old CD player and allow my amplifier to play music from my CDs that I digitized.  The set up was easy and the sound is very good.  The instruction manual was not very useful but the interface is fairly intuitive so I set it up without reading the instructions.  This is a relatively easy and inexpensive way to update an older (but good) stereo system ... and it holds a ton of music. On top of that it's portable so you can take it with you if you want to use it while driving exercising etc.
5,This MP3 player is great. It has an FM radio plays music from the TF card and will record voice and radio.  I purchased this MP3 player after considering many others.  I selected this on due to the price.  It also came with the TF Expansion card which in many cases was an additional charge.  So far it has been very easy to put the TF Card into a card slot on my desktop put a CD in the player and transfer the music .  It is easy to carry on a walk and easy to operate.  I would give this player 5 stars every day.
1,It seems like a electronic device from 1990s. Doesn’t work with new technology. Hard to work with doesn’t read some mp3 songs and reads other ones. Hangs most of the times and you have to hold pier button for a min or 2 (long time) to manually restart it in order ti get out of frozen screen. I only used it today. Played only 4 songs out if 27 of my songs with all the glitches.Small and slippery in adults’ hand and my hands are not very big. Normal female hands.If you connect one blue tooth device it won’t find others ever again. It took me a month to figure it out because I was working with it on my spare times but now the return window is closed or else I would return it. That’s what you get if you try to buy electronics cheap from Amazon.
5,when I was trying to connect to Bluetooth the device was connecting to a neighbor's  TV. so very powerful. then it connected to my wife's Bluetooth headset but not mine.  Wait a minute. What's wrong? so I figured I had to 'pair' my Bluetooth aftershokz to this device and it works perfectly. I am over the mood with the product. the product has many more features like record conversations and e-books which I won't use. However it was wonderful for runners.  FYI aftershokz is good for runners because it transfers sound via bone connectivity so no ear plugs in your ears. I can hear traffic.
3,I purchased this to use as a Bluetooth MP3 player in my car but it would not connect to the bluetooth in my 2014 Honda Accord. BUT it is a very simple user interface. It reminds me of a old iPod nano the black ones not the super small one and putting song on it is very simple. Have to return tho because that was the reason why I bought it.
5,This is a simple easy to use mp3 player. I was looking for something with bluetooth and a headphone jack and also a slot for a micro SD card. This player had it all and at a good price. Easy to put music on just using a normal file system instead of iTunes. Copy and paste the files you own and enjoy listening to music. Best part is this little guy worked with a 128GB micro sd card. I got the samsung evo select card right here on amazon. If you are looking for an inexpensive ipod alternative this is it.
5,If you want to add music to your mp3 just buy a USB to microSD. It only costs like 5 dollars for this amazing product. The mp3 player is very responsive. You click a button and the response time is in milliseconds compared to other mp3 players. For the price it also offers bluetooth and 32gb of memory and thats not even the best part.The potential for this is that you can buy more microSD cards and add more music to it. The music will never stop if you use it to its full potential. And I can use my AirPods with it too.
5,Easy to use interface. Sound quality for blue tooth is great battery life is also long. Which I love.
2,Very small. The brightness goes to 11 (weird number to choose) and isn't very bright. The sound goes to 14 (another weird number but okay) and is loud enough when the room is quiet. I do like the radio feature. I don't like that you can't download music right to it it has to be downloaded to the SD card which is a micro and doesn't come with an adapter. I don't like that there aren't volume buttons on the side or other options on the side; you have to wake up the screen to change the volume etc.
4,I like the record switch on its side. makes it a convenient voice recorder without going through the touch menus.took off one star because it doesn't seem to have any real internal memory just its sd card. dont have it long enough to tell durability or battery life. didn't test bluetooth either yet
4,Inexpensive lot of room for music connected to usb in car and word great.
5,This is exactly what I was needing! I needed something to transfer my music to being that Google Play music is now YT (YouTube) Music I wanted to keep my purchased music and play it when I wanted to and not be consumed with intrusive ads in-between songs. This is it and it was easy to set up. It comes with everything you need (charging cable headphones instruction manual and an arm sleeve for the MP3 player for if you go jogging biking hiking working out etc) it has bluetooth capability also and it does come with the SD card inside. I'm very pleased with this MP3 player. 🤗
1,Only needed an MP3 player that would connect with my bluetooth external speaker.  Amazon advertises this as a 'Best Seller' so I bought it.  Instructions explain various features but there are no 'setup' instructions - charged it and added several hundred songs from my old device.  It worked fine at home.  Connected and re-connected without difficulty.  Problem:  took it to the park and the screen was too dim to be usable even under large shade trees.  Could vaguely see screen icons but not differentiate which was highlighted and underlying menus were entirely unreadable.  Finally walked across park into restroom and once indoors the screen became visible again.  Went into settings and confirmed 'brightness' was set to max (11).  Can't imagine how this device could be of any use outdoors during daylight hours.  Not recommended.
5,I got this for my 8 year old daughter since we didn’t want to spend a lot of money on an iPod. She loves music but we don’t like listening to the music she listens to especially in the car. She loves it. Great price point. I wish it was touch screen but even still it gets the job done. We bought a case for her since the arm sleeve is not needed for us. We like that it came with headphones as well. Wish there was a sleeve for it but even without the sleeve she carries it around in the case to protect it.
4,I am a new owner of this product from what I can see so far It appears to be really well made and easy to navigate and get things started. I will update my review in the future when I have a little more time with it but so far happy with this purchase!
5,I bought tis MP3 player because my other one broke. I did a little home work and after I was finished I decided to order this one. The package arrived on time and after reading the instructions I had started downloading music. Was very easy to set up and complete all the actions need to down load my music. The device linked up easily with my blue tooth speakers. The sound quality is great and no lag at all even if I walk away from my speakers. The enhanced bluetooth technology has come a long ways. The voice recording is crisp and clear. I for one love this device much better than my other one.
5,Easy to use! Great for overnight camp for my 11 year old.
5,I recently purchased this to replace one that quit working not this brand.  I really like it.  Above it asked me about battery life and I honestly can't give 5 stars because the one I received had something wrong with so I didn't use it.  I reached out to them and they immediately sent me a new on which I just received and will put my music on.  I use my mp3 player 5 nights a week for 8 hrs. plus and I'm excited to get my music on it.  Thank You for standing behind your product.
1,I really had high hopes for this mp3 player. It advertised Bluetooth 5.0 but I have my doubts about that. The best thing I can say about the Aiworth is .. it starts up quickly and the sound quality is fine. On the Con side it is very sensitive to touch and you might be listening to a song or story and if you touch it by accident the player skips over to another track. Also once you pause too long or stop the play it will jump to the beginning of a chapter rather than leave off where you stopped. So you have to stop what you're doing and fix it. It is very difficult to connect to your earphones. With the Beats wireless headphones you can pause with a tap to the earphone but if you use Jaybird wireless earbuds it will not pause. That is one reason why I question the Bluetooth 5.0 claim. I decided to return them as it was a wrong choice for me (Amazon is charging me for the return) . My old Samsung players still work like a charm even though they are slow to startup. Sometimes it does not pay to buy new technology. This is one is annoying.
4,Works pretty well and sounds good but I had problems connecting it to some Bluetooth speakers. In one case it wouldn’t connect at all.After some work I did get it to connect. Give it 4 1/2 stars because it is a little hard to connect to every device
5,Excellent sound and quality MP3. Downloads music easy and is easy to operate. Price is equivalent to the quality of the product. Definitely worth the quality!!  Pleased with purchase. Highly recommended!
5,So far so good. I couldn't even get the last mp3 player I ordered to connect to computer or even acknowledge that there was a 32gig memory card in it. This one was so easy to connect and get started. I had tons of songs on there in minutes and it was ready to go. The sound is great so far but I have not cranked it up. I haven't had a chance to try everything else out but my hopes are that it is as smooth as it has been so far.
4,I bought this mp3 for my wife it's a great piece of equipment works beautifullythe sound quality is super and it has good user interfaceI think I will have to get a second one for myself
4,Easy to use and the Bluetooth feature fits my needs perfectly.
5,My 9 year old son loves music. He also loves technology. This device is perfect to satisfy his needs.The product compact feels very luxurious and is pretty straight forward and easy to use. I transferred music files from my computer in a matter of seconds. My son has enjoyed using the radio and the audio recorder functions as well.  The player plays music surprisingly loud without connecting to a speaker. There is a video player option but so far I haven't successfully converted files into the correct format to be able to play them. Overall this is a fantastic product for such an affordable price.
5,Not sure how there could be bad reviews for this player.  I found it exceptionally easy to load and operate. The battery life is outstanding.  I work in a small factory on a bench.  I find that volume level 15 is plenty loud using the internal speaker.  Some people commented that there is no need to have it play video / video conversion process burdensome.  I converted and loaded several short videos to my player and they look and play great!  I highly recommend this player.
5,Don’t like it I have a few in my house and 1 already stopped working in less ten 4 months
2,Have not even used for a month and the headphone jack already stopped working. One of the channels wont play. tried multiple headphones same issue. I slide the jack in slowly and can hear it start but as soon as it is in all the way...no sound! It was working for the first few times. So it doesn't sound like a design flaw of the headphone only vs the mic headphone jack length difference maybe so cheaply made that this connection stopped after a few inserts.I purchased this for $40. I had purchased another unit that is based on the same platform when on sale it was $18. Very cheap yet that worked for months before it got wet and died.  So the mark up on these is super high for the quality you get. This is the maybe worse than other makes.
4,MP3 works ok as an over the road traveler.
5,Really liked the user interface.  Battery life was unexpectedly long.  Sound quality was good for the size of the unit.  The small thin size was perfect for hikes.
5,This is a great MP3 player as it comes with a decent amount of capacity and good range of sound. The thing I like the most about this product is its functionality because it is quite easy to operate. I was able to transfer my music files from my PC very conveniently. The Bluetooth connectivity is also very good as it makes it easy to play audio via other wireless devices. This is a good MP3 player in terms of its affordability. Overall I liked this product and I would recommend it to anyone who’s looking for something inexpensive yet worth it.
5,This is a really nice mp3 player and is very easy to use .Down loading music from my PC . Downloading  was very easy just plug in USB cable  highlight music file copy and paste  into the the players software . To play music was very easy just go to music  and select the songs and play .My player came with a arm band case but a sleeve case would be nice . I am using the player through a amplifier via the 3.5 headphone jack on the player .Over all I am pleased with it and would buy again .
5,If your looking for a simple MP3 player that comes with 32gb sd card and do not care about having apps then this is a good little device to have. I take it with me to work so I can connect to the Bluetooth radio with have and it works perfectly fine with radio. This MP3 player does come Bluetooth 5 I was able to take the mp3 to the lunch room which about 120 feet away and it did drop the signal. Honestly do not regret my purchase
4,I got the mp3 for my wife for Christmas. She Absoluetly loves it. For the price it was a great mp3 player for a good price. The sound quality was great. The battery life lasted a while . it's a wonderful product to get
2,listen to good music while I while Im getting beat in pool computer does not recognize the unitcannot download to the player. download music onto the card then put card in mp3 unitwould not buy again
4,I would recommend however it's not user friendly. I wish it was touch screen the timer cuts out too quickly making it harder to use the functions. Overall I like it. I bought it to play nursery rhymes on my mommaroo baby swing.
5,It seems I've had a hard time finding a good MP3 player lately due to everyone using their phone.  I hate taking my phone into the gym so I'd prefer a small MP3 player.  This is a great device.  Long battery life the perfect size (not too bulky but not too small) great sound quality and easy to use.  Some of the other MP3 players I've tried to use over the fast few months have been horrible.  I'd highly recommend this if anyone is in the market for a new MP3 player.
3,The user interface is just so simplified and the whole device is so small as to make it difficult to work with.  I should have realized all that when I was reading user's evaluations but I still thought it would be useful.  Even the memory card is so tiny as to be annoying to keep track of and manipulate.  I finally decided to just use my smart phone which can do the same things as this player anyway.
1,I've had this thing for a few weeks now and have not been able to connect it ti anything with Bluetooth. Nothing car sound system TV  Bose speakers just will not coonect to anything via Bluetooth.  So if you can actually connect to anything good luck.  Also transferring files to this thing is a nightmare no easy way to do this and they wind up in recording or some other file not on the "playlists" listed on the screen.  I had an I pod for 10 years I know how to use these things but this is a nightmare.  I'm listeneing to it now plugged into the aux jack on my Bose speaker only way it works.  Way too much hassle to load songs and get them to play.  Would not reccomend this to anyone unless copy and paste every song in your library to it and then trying to fugure out how to get it to play is your idea of fun...would send it back  not even worth the trouble to me.
1,I have an MP3 player and it pairs with my Sony Music Center for PC to transfer music to the player.  So I bought this for my husband and I've read through the instructions but nowhere can I find any information on how to transfer music to it.  The instruction headings are: Ebook Folder Music Videos Product Key Diagram Tools Instructions FM Radio Settings Technical Specifications.  Nowhere under any of these headings does it explain how to TRANSFER music to it.  The music section of the instructions simply explains how to play music that is on the MP3 player.  Well it's hard to play music that I can't load to the player. So it's useless for what I bought it for.  After much frustration with trying to get it to do anything I need I decided to return it.  But of course I missed the Amazon deadline for returning this item.  Was going to return it and buy my husband the same MP3 player I have because it works well. Now I'm stuck with this user-impossible POS.
5,I bought this Mp3 Player for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. It is sleek lightweight easy to use and able to hold up to 5000 songs. It also has a speaker on it so you can play music from it without buying a separate speaker. Its not as loud as a bluetooth speaker but its loud enough to hear as youre cleaning a room or just hanging out. But it is also able to connect to a bluetooth speaker so no wires to worry about hooking up. Sound quality is great I would definitely recommend this Mp3 Player. Thanks Aiworth
3,I don’t know how to put music on one of these and I still don’t. I suppose most people will be ok but not me. I can pay the radio shack people $15.00 to show me. I’m totally unqualified to say whether it’s any good.
5,I had bought this mp3 player for myself as I wanted something to use for workout and to listen to music at work as I didn’t want to drain my phone battery.This mp3 player has been what I’ve been looking for as its easy to just drop music into the player (via laptop). There is a application inside of the player to convert videos if they aren’t already in the format of the player.I’ve had this player for about two weeks and its been great to have and works perfectly with my bluetooth earbuds.
5,I was able to pair this easily with my new blue tooth headphones and the sound quality is great!  Update:  I was confused with the directions that came with it and thought the on/off button on the right side was the volume button.  I didn't know how to turn the player off so I contacted customer support.  They responded to me in just a couple of hours and even sent a video to show the function.  Great product and great customer support!!
3,It’s ok. The display already has permanent  lines in it after the first use kind of like an LCD display that is dying. Volume is a little too quiet even when turned all the way up. Otherwise a good little MP3 player.
5,We bought this for our 13 yr. old son who loves music!  He's not interested in a cellphone because he feels he could get in trouble with it (as do his parents).  With this there is only what you download onto a micro sd card which comes with the player.  That's a plus.I would highly recommend this for anyone young and old.A great product for anyone who exercises too.  Comes with an armband to wear during those times plus #2.  I would definitely buy it again.
5,Everything in the picture comes with the unit ! The radio works well with plenty of space for pre-set stations in the memory. It has a huge amount of space for your music folders. Along with 15 pre-set radio stations (more than in my car!) I have downloaded 2400 songs with plenty of space to go. You will not want another MP3 player other than this one. The arm band carrying case is nice and the earphones are of good quality and sound. I( bought this for my wife to use during her walking exercises. She loves it.
5,I bought this mp3 player for my daughter a couple of months ago and she loved it. She likes to ride her bike and its size makes it easy to just drop it in her pocket then go riding. It also has a Bluetooth feature that she just loves. 10/10 would recommend for anyone doing sports and wants something to use to listen to music or podcast thats smaller then a phone.
5,Easy to use and download songs. We like simple!
3,I like the sleek design. Interface is user friendly. I'm hoping the battery life will be close to advertised. I use my MP3 players with my Ultimate Ears Boom2 speakers  at work for10 hour shifts. I like the flexible options of connectivity.Update 2-5-21 the player has stalled on me a few times already (I bought it in November of 2020). My biggest problem is the lack of volume. So I will be looking for yet another MP3 player to suit my needs.
5,I like the recorder on there and there is lots of space. Good product definitely a step up from the oak castle.
4,it is good and slim . small fits in my palm so well and slick . very good .But i'm still trying to figure how to download songs in it. so   overall a good product.
5,This portable player will handle FLAC files which is why I purchased it.  It also has an electronic equalizer with pre-programmed settings and a built-in FM radio *the antenna is built into the included ear buds).  It also handles headphones with an included jack but performs well with wireless capability.  I swapped out the included 32gb micro card for a 128gb formatted one with no problems. Now I have access to many many lossless songs & a tiny player to boot!
5,I bought this as a gift for my 15 year old daughter.  She loves it!  She especislly likes the earbuds it came with.  She says they are very comfortable and have good sound quality.  I haven't got to play with the player itself but if the teenager is happy then it must be pretty good. The player itself seems sturdy and looks really sleek in its black glass form.  Time will tell on battery life but my daughter lives with earbuds in all day so it must be pretty decent.
5,I like how easy this is to load and how easy it is to navigate through each section. With the 32 GB I haven't even touch the max limit yet. Even with 500+ song I only made a small dent in my storage capacity. Even if it isn't hooked up through a blue tooth speaker the sound is still pretty loud all by itself. I like the small sleek design of the product. When it is not in use it automatically shuts off by itself. I'm glad I bought this to replace my old MP3 player.
3,User interface takes getting used to as it is a bit of a pain to move around. Volume is only good while using wired ear buds. Max volume through Bluetooth not loud enough.
5,I was very glad to switch out my old Ruizu MP3 player with this one in large part because of the way more pleasing user interface and organizational options for my extensive music library. For this price tag this player is a great value in terms of sound quality and base storage capacity. Of course the SD card allows for up to 128 gb and I was able to simply switch my card out of my old one and worked great on this one. Loving the bluetooth option as well!
4,The instructions were hard to follow.  The start up portion should include the fact that if the rec button is on you will not see the page with all the icons.  Otherwise it is a fine device with good sound quality.
4,Took a long time to figure it out but it is only limited to 50 m3u playlists (plus the 3 defaults) for a total of 53.  If you have more than that it will pick a random set of playlists.
3,This is a re write. Functional MP3 player. Instructions for the first time user could be much better. I agree with another purchaser in regards to blue tooth.. Not functional so far. Doesn't locate blue tooth device less than a foot away from it. Bought it as a replacement player for a Sansa that has lasted over 10 years. It serves this purpose so therefore it deserves a better review than I previously gave it.
5,It is small enough to fit anywhere I can use bluetooth I can easily transfer files onto it and can delete them easily.  I am able to rewind and forward on the audio song/lecture it is touch control; I can also record onto it.  This product was delivered to me within 2 days!  It comes with an arm band so I can place the mp3 in it and carry it around anywhere.  It is excellent I highly recommend it my husband wants to take it from me.
4,The product itself is great. The sound quality is good. My only disappointment was using my wireless headphones.  The sound only worked on one side. Connecting to my other devices worked well.
3,I got this for my dad because he loves his music.  It was very easy to put his music on it but the volume is terrible.  There is no way you could listen to it if there is any background noise.  He likes using his music players while he mows but this will not work.  We tried with wireless and wired headphones but it still wasn't loud enough.  I'm currently looking for another.
1,The screen went blank after just a few days of you. Nothing heavy at all. I had 4 songs on there I played while I worked. No heavy manual labour just walkin around while it was in my pocket. While it worked it was good but just after 2 days the screen when blank.
5,I stumbled across this MP3 player while randomly searching and figured for this price point "why not?" The first thing I can say is that this MP3 player lives up to the hype and far exceeded my expectations!!This MP3 Player is a top-of-the-line budget-friendly device that is great for all ages. It is intuitive easy to set up and sounds fantastic. Out of the box you can feel that it is durable and not a cheaply made device. I highly recommend this MP3 player and intend to buy a couple more for other family members.
5,Use it with blue tooth ear buds and works perfectly.  Light weight and easy to use.
1,I have purchased this same item twice because it was very easy for my daughter to use and worked well with our computer etc.  The first one lasted about 8 months and I THOUGHT I purchased a 3 year warranty the second time I purchased it but I can't find the record of that on Amazon.  Basically don't buy this if you want it to last more than 8 months to year!
4,This is a good MP3 player. My only complaint is I have to reacquire my Bluetooth device for each use. Other than that I love it.
5,A great little MP3 player 👏
5,This was exactly what I needed in an MP3 Player: compact/slim for any pocket bluetooth works well long battery life on one charge external memory card capability and voice recorder function.  The only thing I would change is the user interface as it's not as intuitive if you're used to an older ipod but you will get used to it.  Plus I like how the volume buttons were also easy to use.
5,I am so happy with this product that I just bought one for my husband. These are extremely easy to use transfer files and the user interface is intuitive. I am not a Mac user and I have been struggling with iTunes for too long. I wish I had bought this a long time ago. The only downside for me was that it only has the option for three playlists. It is a minor complaint and I was able to easily overcome it by just creating my own folders and transferring them to the player. Thank you so much for a great product.
5,I needed something to easily listen to MP3 files and add/remove at will without all the problems encountered trying to manage my old iPod Classic without iTunes. I LOVE that this device utilizes an SD card with expandable memory. I plan to have various playlist categories I want on different cards. The sound limiting feature was not a problem for me because I use portable amps anyways due to hearing loss. It was easy to setup and I've filled up the supplied 32GB card already. Smaller and lighter than my iPod with smooth glossy external body. Perfect solution for me!
1,I just got this delivered and all I want to do is load some songs. How about I just drag them from a file into the player? No. I can't do that? Really? The manual that it comes with doesn't even tell you how to do that all all but if you google the instruction it says you have have to download some software (EMODIO AND WMP10 OR HIGHER MUST BE INSTALLED) in order to move file straight from the computer.That is utter nonsense. I am not downloading anything. There is no reason for it.Trash. Do not buy.
5,Great quality for Price loads very quickly and battery life is very long.
5,We purchased this MP3 player for our son who was thrilled to receive it. Our goal was to use this MP3 player to download audio books from our local library and then transfer them to the MP3 player so that he can play inside or outside while listening to music or an audio book. So far it's worked great! It was very easy to set up (a couple minutes to set the date time and name the player) and then it was an easy transition with the Overdrive app to get audiobooks transferred. He's thrilled!
2,can not pair with the computer to download books or music...basically useless
5,I bought this as a Christmas present for my 9yo who loves to sing. The record option was one thing I really needed in a music player and this one does the job perfectly. No my 9yo enjoys recording and listening to music on this player. It Also has speakers so you don’t need headphone(except when listening to radio) which is another positive.  Navigating can get a little annoying since we are also used to touch screen but works perfectly for my little one who enjoys taking it on hikes and walk.
5,I was looking for an mp3 since I had no space on my phone. This little mp3 has PLENTY of space on it. I barely put a dent in the space. The recorder function is very handy with the size of it. Its bluetooth function works fine but I always have to remind myself to turn off the music before disconnecting or the music would play from its speaker and scare me.
5,My old MP3 player was a Sony Walkman. It had limited features and capacity 8 GB. This new player has Bluetooth Recorder and Speaker (among other features). It also has a replaceable Micro SD storage card (included with it) of 32 GB. It will store up to 5000 music files and the card can easily be replaced with up to 128 GB storage. I highly recommend this Player and also the company's Customer Service who prompted answered my technical questions.
5,I like that the Bluetooth stays open when you switch it to open and you don't have to open the Bluetooth every time you power on the mp3 player.  The mp3 player has a hole for a lanyard but it doesn't come with a lanyard. You can not use the equalizer when using Bluetooth.  When using wired earbuds the equalizer presets are not that distinct. This mp3 player's Bluetooth 5.0 range isn't that much different than my smartphone's Bluetooth 4.2 range.  Again this is a contingent 5 star review.
5,My husband bought this MP3 for me.  I like this little MP3 player a lot. It has very convenient controls.  It’s very easy to organize files and operate. Speaker sounds good and enough has enough volume for me. Bluetooth is easy to pair with my headphone and the car. Also I tried plugging it into my speaker; it sounds beautiful indoor or outdoor. The recording is quick and easy with good sound.I am so excited to have it make me smile every day.I word like to recommend this MP3 player to people everywhere.
3,We purchased this for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it! The sound is actually very good! We can hear what she plays throughout the house. Unfortunately the radio ONLY WORKS WITH THE HEADPHONES! The battery lasts pretty decently. It looks like a touchscreen but it is not. It takes some getting used to for those who have been touchscreen for so long. Overall a good buy.
2,The sound quality in this player is awful. There is barely any bass at all. I bought this player because I was deceived by the many 5-star reviews. I would imagine that the main reason for buying an mp3 player is to listen to music so I cannot believe that people would give 5-star reviews to a player with such poor-quality sound.One of the answers (to customer questions) in the player description (uploaded by a seller) claims that one can transfer music to the player through iTunes which is not true.Instead of trying to add many capabilities such as voice recording video reproduction or Ebook reading (which I doubt are what someone is looking for in a small mp3 player) the manufacturers should have been focused on providing a music player with good sound quality and with capability to easily create playlists.
3,Good overall mp3 player. Just has a few small issues. 1. I took the time to add a release date for all the sound I downloaded from the 80s. When the song plays you can't see all of the title. What you can see is some goofy equalizer type thing taking up the whole screen. 2. The volume is not very loud. But still a good unit for the price.
3,Purchased for my son. He loves it. It has so many options for listening. MP3 Radio Bluetooth and many more. It seems durable enough for a pre-teen and even a kid. It's also great for an adult if they need something to take to he gym or whatever. The battery lasts forever. My son has been listening non-stop for almost two days and we haven't had to charge it yet!
5,Love this MP3 player! Really easy to use and add music. I have a Microsoft 3 tablet to help me upload music to the deviceYou can connect via bluetooth to a speaker wireless or wire headphones.This is exactly what I needed for when I go hiking or have no access to WiFi.MP3 player has a memory card of 32 GB. I purchased another one with more memory of 128 GB and both work excellent. I just have a lot of music and audio books in my library.
3,I was searching for a mp3 player that was bluetooth with customizable playlist. You can customize internally but not externally. Which is what I wanted. It works fine if you just throw your stuff on there and hit random but was not the right one for me.
5,This MP3 is better than the other one I have except for the other one having internal storage this one only supports an sd card It has Bluetooth 5.0 one improvement can be made that this allows you to connect to two devices at a time and play music on the devices simultaneously that can be possible from an update or flash but maybe not. I still like this MP3 Player a lot.
4,Its a great little player. But it could use physical volume buttons on the side
4,It's small easy to work with. I hope to have it for a long time.
5,The charging case is very looked like the AirPod case although it's in black and bigger and the battery indicator is on the outside of the case. It's very comfortable holding on my hands. One thing I notice thou it's the cover of the charging case which can only be opened at 90 degrees max and it takes times for me to take the earbuds out from the charging case.
5,As a replacement for my tiny sandisk player that went missing this is all I need. Simply plugged in to my computer via usb created some folders and added songs. Took less than 3 minutes. I only use this player in my vehicle and connected easily with bluetooth or usb. One of these options allows me to browse the player and find the folder and/or song I need. Only con I found is the screen is hard to read in bright surroundings.
5,I am so excited for this product! It is tough to find quality MP3 players that have long battery life and also have quality sound bluetooth and holds my large amount of music. It is also incredibly easy to figure out and use. The past MP3 players I have had lose charge quickly does not offer bluetooth and does not come with a built-in speaker. I am loving my choice of purchasing this product!
5,Instructions not clear. I only use it for music only.So far so good Battery seems to hold up well.
5,If you are looking for an MP3 player to buy this is the one for you! This thing has outstanding performance. The sound is very clear and connects to Bluetooth without a problem. The main interface is easy to understand and it is very portable and easy to carry. It's also very tough as i dropped it once on the pavement and it still works just fine with only a few tiny nick marks. Overall a very nice quality easy to use MP3 player!
5,I work with a crazy and manipulative person. I actually purchased this because of the recording switch it has. I pretend I'm pausing my music before talking with this person but I'm just starting the recording.The battery life is amazing. It actually is around 60ish hours playing music at max volume on big headphones.Truly love this mp3 player.
1,This MP3 player has a horrible sound quality. No Bass whatsoever and hardly no sound output and that is with Sony earphones. When I buy a MP3 player having Bass is a MUST!! and quality sound output.
3,This mp3 player is pretty good. I wouldn't say its amazing but it gets the job done. i think it has a lot of 5 starts due to bribing people. I bought this and they gave me a code to put into their website in order to get a 30$ gift card. But when you put in they tell you to rate it 5 stars and show proof.
5,When we purchased this as a gift for our daughter some reviews said that there were issues with creating and using folders. However the folders are easily set up on your computer and then remain in place when you upload files to the device.  My daughter has been thrilled with this MP3 player and is able to easily navigate through the folders and the songs on her own.  It also works well with her Bluetooth earphones.  Overall for the price this seems to be a fantastic product.
5,Love this player have bought it twice. Very easy to load your music on.
2,Build-wise it's ok. It has no physical volume buttons though so each time you want to change the volume you will have to unlock it and go to the sound settings. The major flaw for me that I can't stand is that it will only work with the type of headphones that have no bass (the ones with only 2 insulation rings on the jack hence that's the kind they'll send with the package when you buy). This means that you can't listen to your music with a full sound. If you try to use regular 3-ring headphones the sound gets distorted because the connections won't align. If you are fine with listening to only the tweeter (higher end sounds) of your music then this is fine. However if you like your music with its original bass then no.
5,All that needs to be done is to take a micro 32gb sd card to your computer dump 1000s of mp3s on it and you are good to go. Took me 45 minutes to fill the card with over 3800 files.It is easy to use however it works better with an external audio amp. I use a FiiO A3 which on hi gain works well but any audio amp should work.
3,I tried several ways to load my music. Neither my Mac nor my HP worked with it to download music. If anybody knows a how to load it help!
4,I PURCHASED THE ITEM FOR MY WIFE WHO WANTED ON SO SHE COULD WORK OU WITH MUSIC.SHE LIKED THE UNIT COMPACT ARM BAND AND SOUND. NICE UNIT FOR THE PRICE.
4,Ordered this MP3 player and it was here in just a few days. My daughter is so happy with it. thanks soo much
5,I wanted a simple non wi-fi mp3 player that we could give our daughter and know that they could not get into any web issues and this was one device we did not need to lock down. The unit is bluetooth which was great and we got some really nice Sony headphones that this unit linked up to really fast and the sound is great. Easy to load songs to and the sound quality is great.
1,This device worked "ok" for 4 months. The controls are a bit awkward but are workable. Occasionally it has been difficult to get it to connect on BT. However after 4 months of ownership the charge cable connection port failed from just routine plugging / unplugging to charge and download. I managed to get around that by propping it in just the right position to where it would still work but I later noticed that the connecting plug inside the port was completely detached from the frame and I had to jiggle the unit to try and line it up. Then today I went to charge it and it initially started to charge with the indicator flashing then the screen went black and the control lights all came on at the same time. I tried to recover it with a power down but no dice. The device appears to have died. So $42 for four months of use . . . you decide if that's good enough or not.
3,My Nano finally died and I was hoping to get a player that would synch up easily to my Apple Music. It does not. Great battery life. Screen is really difficult to see outdoors. Still working on how best to transfer playlists. Decent little player for the money
3,Really low sound levels.  Don't plan on cranking it up.  Very quiet
5,I like the size and the quality of this item. The recording quality is great and when I connect to a good sound system the recordings are great. I will be using this player a lot. It fits in my cellphone case and will be easy to use on the go. We live in an area that is far from a lot of fm stations. I was surprised at how many stations that were locked in on the automatic scan. For the low price I recommend this item to anyone.
2,You need to actually have the MP3s to download onto the device
4,I like it. I bought it to use while jogging and its perfect. Its light and sound is good. Its easy to use and very simple.
5,The audio quality is very good on this thing. The Bluetooth works but sometimes it randomly cuts off for a few seconds which can be irritating specifically when i tried to put it in my pocket it would cut off a lot. The video player works well and the picture quality is better then i expected. You can make playlists and shuffle them which is nice. Overall it worked well only problem being the Bluetooth.
1,Ive used to have an iPod that I’ve had for a long time and I wanted to upgrade my abilities to listen to sound while I’m running or doing work around the house. I bought this AIworth digital MP3 player and although it came from China expect things to work OK. At first it seem to work fine for the couple of months but then I started having issues with the power button not working right. I would have to go and unplug the whole thing and even let it die down until it could be recharged it would start working again for about maybe five or six songs and then it would phase again and it would do it all the time now. I’ve tried different chords I’ve tried working without the Sim card and none of it seems to work. I would like to get my money back if that’s possible. The battery seems to do just fine it’s just when you want to listen to radio or download Music it would not work.
1,I bought this so i could still listen to music at work when my phone signal goes out every once in a while but I can't even enjoy that. After reading others reviews I can only guess I purchased a malfunctioned one. Whenever I set it down and barely move a few steps the music gets choppy when I set it in my pocket and start moving the music gets choppy and I have to put it on the charger every couple of hours.
5,I just received this today and wow! I already have enjoyed it so far. It seems to have a touch screen interface and the device itself is small and convenient. It comes with a 32g micro sd card so I can download my music without having to buy another sd card. It comes with an armband which is great for when I need to have my hands free or if I want to go for a run. Overall great buy and I’m not disappointed!
5,We needed an MP-3 player to connect to a sound board for an event so we could play background music and this little device worked beautifully. I signed up with a site where I could download unlimited songs beforehand charged it up and added a bunch of music before leaving for the weekend-long event. I never had to charge the battery and we used it throughout the weekend. It was great to have a long-lasting battery.
5,I purchased 2 of these MP3 players 1 for each son.  Adding music files is very easy and you can load thousands of songs (depending on file format etc.).  The sound quality with Bluetooth headphones is very good; paired easily and maintains connection.  I had to try it myself.  Calendar alarm and FM radio all work and intuitive.  Lightweight at just a few ounces. After nearly a month of use I would recommend to anyone seriously interested in an MP3 player.
5,I bought this MP3 player after iTunes refused to recognize my old Nano. I needed a basic MP3 player to hold my music and free up some space. This was perfect. Seamless transfer of my favorite music files onto this device. Just plug it in drag your music files over and let it sync. The sound quality is very good for the price as well! Couldn't be happier with how easy this device is to use especially for this price point. Certainly recommended!
2,The record switch on the side is really annoying. It’s very easy to accidentally push it on so you may end up running down your battery if it’s left in record mode overnight or if you bump it it takes you out of listening mode and you have to go through the menus to get back to whatever you were listening to and restart from the beginning. I’ve had the buttons become unresponsive a few times and I had to get an exchange on the first one I got because the headphone jack started to go bad within about two months of getting it. The new one I got has started to get finicky about transferring from computers as well.
4,Easy to transfer music to. Headphones don't really fit well in hole but I'm using it with the bluetooth only.
4,Loved this product!! Very sleek and and small which makes it nice to carry. It’s also pretty easy to download songs on. My daughter loves it.
3,Would not purchase this product again. Found it difficult to use and still have not been able to do anything with it other than listen to radio stations. The numbers are way too small and radio station numbers in red...not good very difficult to see in light.
4,I use it for listening and record and it is good. It sounds like analog as I guess. It sounds nature like acoustic.Thank very much.
1,Unfortunately I missed the date to return this item or I would be returning it. It was given as a gift and that made me miss out on the return date. I did not like the fact that it advertises as a touch screen. It is not a touchscreen in the way that one would expect. There's only a few keys that you can actually touch. And the screen can barely be seen on a normal day let alone on a bright day outside hiking or in our convertible. It doesn't have a true Shuffle capability. It does not have a search option. And the battery life is around 3 hours. It only charges with the cable that's included. When selecting a button oh it has serious lag time. Which causes you to think that you didn't actually depress the button when indeed you had and I find myself going around in circles trying to find the area I need to select. It doesn't have a screen lock so I was constantly accidentally advancing songs or turning it off etc. I wish I hadn't bought this MP3 player.
5,This froze up and wouldn't work. It looks nice but quit taking any more music. My husband worked with it for hours but no use. We sent ot back for a refund.
5,The interface features and the ease of use of the MP3 player are all really good. We almost got another MP3 player but decided to get this one because it is really affordable especially with the radio bluetooth and all of the other stuff. The menu on the bottom might take up half the screen which some people might not like and the quality of the screen is slightly dated but it's not too bad. Overall not a bad pick if you're looking for something like this.
5,I've bought this device to replace my old MP3 player. I use it to listen to foreign language lessons. The sound quality is very good even without earbuds. The device also does voice recording which I can use during lessons with my tutor and then play back. It fits nicely in a small pocket of my gym shorts so I can use it at the gym without feeling any bulkiness or weight.
5,We are tired of hearing about the school bus drama of 10 yr old girls. We bought this for our daughter so that she can chill out to music on the bus and enjoy her air pods she got as a gift. She is not ready for a phone so this is the next best way for her to enjoy music tune out to drama and have some time to relax before and after school.
5,So I was looking for a MP3 as a gift to my 13 year old cousin I was struggling with finding one. But then I ordered this one (based on my guts) and gifted it to my cousin. He used it and he can’t stop complimenting it.Basically he loves the sound and the way this MP3 functions smoothly. He is using it with a Bluetooth speaker and he loves it.I would recommend everyone looking for a MP3 to buy this one because IT’S WORTH IT!!!
1,I started off really liking this MP3 Player.  The sound was great (could be louder though) I liked the features and I just thought this would be a keeper.  I've had it for about a month now and used it less than ten times and each time was for 20 minutes or less (treadmill running errands etc.) and the Headphone/Aux jack stopped working properly.  To clarify when I plugged in the Aux jack in my car I was only hearing out of the right speaker.  I first thought something was wrong with the speakers in my car but then I turned on the radio and CD and there was no problem with the sound & all my car speakers were working fine.  I then used different headphones which confirmed something was defective in this MP3 player because I could only hear out of the right earphone.  I never dropped it and treated it delicately but since it's not working right I deleted all my files and I'm returning it.
5,I like the look and feel of this mp3 player.  It looks like a tiny cell phone.  However it is not touch screen it has buttons.  I wanted a separate mp3 player that wasn't part of my phone.  My old mp3 was a very old sandisk which worked fine but the sound wasn't very clear anymore and I wanted something bigger.  I like the sound of this new one.  I am happy with this one so far!
1,Text is too small to read. Bluetooth is weak difficult to connect and sometimes the sound is garbled. Button lights disappear after 10 seconds you have to guess where to press the button. The cheaper one I bought was better.
5,I've had several mp3 players throughout the past couple of years. Most my brother has broken or have suffered damage in one way or another. This is a really nice mp3 player. I listen to music every night when I go to sleep. Unlike others I have bought this one hasn't broken right away and it sync's really well with my headphones. Really happy with this product. Would definitely buy again. -From my son
4,Lightweight & great to carry my tunes on the go! Great when I’m biking in the woods .Also great that it has a record button!
4,Ordered back in April and now it won't even turn on...kind of disappointed because it was a nice MP3 Player.
5,Very easy to get the music onto this device. This unit comes with everything you need to get up and running in a snap. Attach the unit to your computer with the very nice _included_ cable and the device now appears as an available place to save files. Put your music there and you're in business. There is also a set of ear buds; they're comfortable and they work. I am very happy with this device. Sound quality is great.
4,It’s aight. I got it for my 5 year old. Bluetooth works and connected to some cat ear wireless headphones. He’s happy. Next is singing lessons.
5,I really like this MP3 player. It's got larger storage for all my songs. It is very easy to navigate (I was easily able to download my music and start listening right away). The size is great it's not to bulky or  heavy. The screen is a nice size I can easily see to navigate. The sound is really good too very clear. It also has radio video and ebook functions as well.  I'm  super happy with this purchase and I definitely recommend this MP3 player!
1,It doesn't work. I just got it. I tried to charge it and nothing. It won't charge turn on or anything else. I would give it zero stars if I could. I am very disappointed.
5,I use a Bluetooth MP3 player and bone conducting head phones for my daily bike rides.  My previous player died and I purchased this one as a replacement.  It was easy to set up and has easy to use controls. Using my previous memory card I got this one fully set up in 10 minutes.  Best of all it was less than half the price of my previous player.
1,This player was just delivered today and it goes back tomorrow. It will not pair with any Bluetooth speaker I have and I have tried for hours. Others buyers have had the same issue. Waste of time and money DO NOT BUY!
4,So I just received mine today and I will come back to let you know what I think about it. I’m so happy 😃
5,Really simple really modern mp3 player. Kinda like a super futuristic version of a walkman with a FM radio and Bluetooth. I think it would be too small for the e-reader but its cool. I bought it for my 9 year old daughter as I thought it's time for her to be able to express herself more with her own music. Just arrived today so I cannot speak to it's durability.
3,Unless you're extremely familiar with the technical aspects of electronics (i.e. younger than I am hint I have grown children) you might as well plan on downloading the instructions from the manufacturer's website.  Otherwise seems to be an extremely good player for the money.  Now if I could only learn to use it properly...
5,The moment I opened it up and plugged it into my mac os laptop downloading music to it was super easy. It syncs to my car without issues and my favorite part is the battery conservation. I miss having a good MP3 player that I can wear with headphones while I work out because the new iphones don't have headphone jacks anymore which is a bummer.
4,Still trying to figure out exactly how to download music. But so far so good recording work well. Nice an Slick. Would purchase again and would recommend.
3,Clearly you'd have to "play" with this mp3 player to figure out how it works. The instructions over lap run together making it very confusing. It's not a touch screen. It has touch buttons to operate the screen. My mistake that I missed the return cut off date. 😩
5,Bought this for my dad since his old mp3 player died. The build quality is pretty solid and feel extremely cheap like other models. Interface is easy to navigate and sound quality is very good if you connect it to a better sounding bluetooth output. Still sounds decent on its own though. Also came with a micro SD which is a plus for the price it's worth. The only thing I wish it had was a USB-c port. Not a major dealbreaker though. Would buy again.
3,Sound was great easy to use but charged it. The other day and it didn't work for 3 days. Decided to try to charge it yet again and this time it worked. Will see.
4,I got it for my fiance and she's happy with it. It was easy to load with music and seems easy to operate.
5,this is a great player.  the sound quality is remarkable the slimline shape and feel of the player is like a new phone.  (My granddaughter loves to listen to it as she feels like she then has a phone like her big sister.) the battery life is excellent and lasts so much longer than my former mp3 player.I use it for downloading books from our local library to listen to and for my favorite music.You will be happy with this over any other player out there!
5,Everything is good with the player. Just wishing the music was easier to load. It could just be a computer issue rather than a player issue. So far so good.
4,The sound quality is very good and it was very easy to load my music on the device. I use the player when I am out walking biking or hiking.
3,Quality seems very good.Purchased mainly for audio books. The stated features were exactly what I wanted. However once the power is turned off it does not keep its place. You have to back to the folder and find the file.......This is completely useless for audio books.Returned
5,It works well but a little difficult organizing a play list I think I just need to play with it more to figure the play list thing out. For the price this thing is well worth it if all you want is something that will play music while camping working out mowing your lawn. The usb interfaces well with my new RAM truck and the blue tooth works great.
5,I purchased this digital mp3 player so I could play through my Bluetooth speaker without interruption and it works well. The user interface is straightforward the feel is comfortable. I am pleased with the battery life it is longer than I expected and the sound quality is very good as well. I was using my phone but the constant notifications made it impossible to enjoy but this device solved that problem and functions better than all my other options.
4,For the price it is bargain.  Not as user friendly as comparable Apple product but that is why it is so much more affordable.
4,Seems like a good unit. Fairly intuitive. Good interface. Purchased for a parent who is not interested in tech stuff.
5,I ordered this to replace an old MP3 player.  I like that it has independent volume buttons that are not part of the scree.  I also liked that it came with an arm band memory card and earbuds as the other ones I looked at did not come with any of these extras.  I have only just opened it and getting it charged so I cant comment on sound quality yet but I am very excited.
5,I bought it to take with me to the classes I teach. I needed something small and that was easy to navigate and to carry around. My hubby helped me add the songs to the device and he didn't have any issues. I like the fact that my students can listen to the songs without having to use a speaker device. It seems to be very sturdy! My husband thought it looked very nice.
3,I had a question about the player. I wanted to know if it had random play capabilities. Amazon did not know. Contacted seller with no response. The interface is clunky and the sound not that great. The player is just OK at best.
5,Real nice. A real surprise to find that it had all these features. I like the touch screen. Doesn't go well if you have fat fingers but still nice. I also like the equalizer settings. Now its very sensitive to the touch. Just remind yourself to lock the screen.  Nice size MP4 Player and Easy to work.
1,I used this product for only three hours and the control panel stopped working and lighting up. The player is now useless as it can no longer be controlled.
5,I bought this to replace the one I ran over when mowing I did not even note that this player has a little speaker so when no headphones are plugged in your music can play this I found great when working on cars and other items and headphones would get in the way. When i received this player I had a few question I could not find the answers to so I contacted the company directly and they responded very fast and answered all my questions big thumbs up for that!
2,Poor sound qualityBluetooth disconnects very oftenEasy to navigate but worst display qualityDisplay not viewable on sunny daysUnfortunately my return period is over otherwise I would have returned.  :(
3,Bought a second one for my other child.  My son says "The battery last a whole day.  The sound though is a little off". That's why the  3 stars.
5,Good Product the learning curve to use this was easy.  Checked all the boxes.
5,I've had tons of Mp3 players over the years and this one beats them all! The range for keeping connected to my bluetooth headphones is incredible and it hasn't broken the connection yet at all within my house. It's easy to add music to and even comes with a micro SD card! I've also never had an mp3 player that could play music without headphones attached but this one can be used like a mini radio! It's awesome and I'd buy it again for sure!
5,The “touch screen” below is to manipulate arrows to position choices on icons.  Easy once you get used to it.  For the money this is worth 10 times the price. So easy to load and edit like a disk drive from PC.  I hate trying to get stuff loaded through Apple on my iPods.  I clocked ripping on my PC at 8x faster than through my Mac.  Thank you. Battery plays at least 10 hours continuously  so far. Wow.
5,It took a bit longer than expected to arrive but due to delays in the postal service it is understandable. Mp3 comes with a charge cable headphones and an arm strap to use when exercising. Came pre-charged and has lightup touch screen buttons to navigate options. I recommend using better headphones when using this mp3 to really enjoy your music. I have some super bass headphones that I use and am very happy with this device in itself.
4,Nice unit. But it's more trouble than what it's worth. Volume is not up to par. Bass is not great at all.
5,Love it. Sometimes you want the security of not having to risk losing your phone.
5,I bought this mp3 player for my car because it doesn't have a cd player.  This device holds all of my music with plenty of room for more.  Just plugged it in and it synced up with the car's display screen.  So cool to be able to search by artist album song.  This was exactly what I hoped it would be.
1,Was just looking for something to provide a way to listen to some background music through a Bluetooth earbud at work and this was perfect for that.  Unfortunately it only lasted 2 months so I would not recommend this product.
1,I read the reviews and it’s even sponsored by Amazon. I was able to download music and set the radio station. When I downloaded music it went into a regular folder there was no way for me to move it to the music folder and it froze on me twice within 10 min.
4,It worked right out of the box.  I put some music in it and it worked quite well.  It held the charge for an extended period.  Can't complain
5,This product comes with a $30 Amazon Card if you leave a 5 star rating for this product.  The product is not user friendly and the manufactures website lacks any product information which is useful.  I do want the $30 Amazon cards so I'm leaving a 5 star rating.  If is was not for the $30 Amazon Card I would probably give this product 2 to 3 stars.  It is not very user friendly.
5,I bought this mp3 player for my wife to use in her car and she loves it.  It's easy to drag and drop music from our music library on to the player.  It comes with plenty of storage so she was able to upload most of her music. If needed it gives you the option to swap out memory cards for even more storage.
5,It is a nice little MP3 device. It is nice that it has a bluetooth function and that it comes with a strap holder for when you are doing things. It's a nice purchase well worth getting. It does all the functions I need and despite the volume only going to level 31 I still find that the volume is fine. It does what I need and that's all that matters to me!
3,Got this for the kids for Christmas and trying to navigate the screen wasn’t too bad but trying to get the volume to stay at the set level was challenging even after setting it the sound would revert back once trying to adjust the volume again. They love it so that’s all that matters.
4,Great functionality and usability!!!
4,It only stays on for 5 minutes if I don't use it I wished it had more of a selection of stay on time
5,I used the 32GB Mp3 Player with Bluetooth 5.0 - Portable Digital Lossless Music Player for walking and running. I was able to download some of my favorite music on it and it was very comforting while walking. I found it w very easy to use and it was very portable. The sound quality was great and the battery life was awesome. I'm thinking about buying my brother one for Christmas because he walks like 3-5 miles a day and he would definitely love this!!!
4,Easy to use great sound
5,I love the interface as far as the buttons on the face of the player. They are easy for my big thumbs to use and much easier to use than a touch screen on a unit this size. The battery life is great for my purposes. It sound good for the price of this unit and I got it to blue tooth to the radio in my Side by side so it I am more than happy with this little player.
1,The mp3 player was good for the first two months after buying it. Everything worked well but the only significant issue was that you could only create three playlists and it was hard to edit the playlists. Other than that it worked great both with wireless headphones and Bluetooth headphones. The sound quality without headphones was a bit muffled but it wasn't too bad. However after two months of use I plugged in the headphones and the audio only came out of the right earbud. I assumed it was a problem with the headphones but I plugged them into my computer and the headphones worked fine. I also tried plugging in different headphones into the mp3 player but the audio only came out of the right earbud. At first I thought I had done something wrong but I realized that it wasn't an isolated issue after looking through the reviews. Be careful when buying this product.
5,This MP3 player was a gift to my husband for Easter as a way for him to enjoy his music in our Bluetooth camper stereo. While not especially used to electronic interfaces he was able to use and understand how to access in formation and play the song of his choice. (I had uploaded several of his favorite songs in advance. ) The record feature is a real bounce.
5,I purchased this as a first time MP3 player for my 9yo. Something to learn responsibility with before jumping up to more expensive products. It fits the bill 100%. The interface is user friendly and he got it right away. It’s not a touch screen but who cares? No instructions on transferring music over but turns out you just drag and drop!
5,The thing I like the most about the product is "All in One" such as listening to music radio; reading Ebook; watching video especially recordings. The menu icons are nice and big enough to handle. In addition I can use Bluetooth to pair with other devices easily. I think the price is reasonable for an excellent product like this. I am going to use this device for listening to music and recording my songs.
5,I like the size and tap-button-navigation. I Love how it connects to my vehicle most easily via Aux-Line-In and I can listen to any song while I drive.  I'm only sad about them not easily pairing with the ear-buds I wear when I skateboard. I may have to get a blue-tooth headset for that.  (oh well.) other than that I'm pleased with the product.
5,I bought this for my mom to use during work because she didn’t want to drain her phone battery and she loves it! She loves how small and slick it is. My mom isn’t great with technology but it only took her a few minutes to get used to it and now she is comfortable using it. We also love how it has a speaker option so you don’t have to use earphones the whole time. Awesome product for the price!
2,I have had several MP3 players in my life. This one is okay. The main problem is that it acts exactly like an iTunes system. You either have to manually add every single song into a playlist or listen to all the songs shuffled. I have over 700 tracks so making playlists is too time consuming. You would think the interface with a windows file system would let you just put it in a file and then play from that file. Nope. The player does not recognize any files or organizing system transferred to it just the MP3s alone. So if I don't want to listen to 'oldies' mixed with 'classical' I have to manually ( a painstaking process) create a playlist (which is not recognized and does not transfer to the windows based programming). Not good.
4,The mp3 was great for the price! It's light and it's easy to add songs. I do wish there were more playlist options though.
5,I found this to be user friendly and of good quality for the price. The FM radio is a bonus and with the headphones plugged in as an antenna I can also use the bluetooth function. I bought this specifically for long bike rides and it is perfect for that. I like this product. I had a question for customer support and they got back to me with several emails to help me.
5,So far I'm very pleased.  This thing does exactly what it needs to - turns MP3s on a micro SD card into Bluetooth-playable music.  No frills no BS just a solid piece of purpose-built tech.  Hard drive as big as whatever memory card you feel like putting into it.  Great sound quality and volume.  Will report back if battery life turns out to be a disappointment but very happy so far!
5,Works great
5,This is a great affordable MP3 player! Once I trained myself that it's NOT a touchscreen (because everything is these days) I'm able to load and play music successfully. It works perfectly with my Apple computer and really is surprisingly simple to use. I recommend the Aiworth MP3 player as an affordable alternative to the iPod (which I prefer to loading music on my cell phone).
5,Wasn't sure what to expect as my daughter had an old iPod for years and hadn't had to download or upload anything to it in a long time let alone set up a new product. The setting up was a breeze! Connected it to her laptop and it was done in no time. It plays the radio as well as downloades music and the sound quality is absolutely top notch. She is very pleased with this product.
5,This is my third MP3 player this year and this one is by far the greatest. It is easy to use easy to read and the sound quality is awesome. I highly recommend this player to anyone looking for a good one. I love the fact it has an arm band and you can easily carry it. Thank you for such a brilliant product.
5,Interface Confusing at 1stHard to see in sunlight
5,Purchased this MP3 player for a 12 y.o. boy at Christmas. The player is of decent quality with the sound being comparable to music played on a cell phone. Impressive screen and overall durability attributes considering its price point. Battery life is also fairly long after a full charge. Only loading the player with music so having enough memory won’t be an issue for a while. He loves it so I’m very happy with purchase!
5,This mp3 player has plenty of storage and excellent sound. It comes with an arm band and wired ear buds. I'm very happy with it for the price. Great battery life! It's easy to purchase songs on Amazon music connect the mp3 player to your computer and drag & drop the songs to the player. I'm not the most tech-savvy person but I figured it out in  a few minutes. Get it you'll love it.
5,Have spent many hours on vacation on the beach listening to my music and walking. This has great sound and easy to use. I use Bluetooth ear buds to listen
1,The operating system is difficult to operate to attach to a blue tooth device. The instructions do not tell you how to load songs from a computer. When a cable is plugged into a usb port then to the device the computer does not see the device as a drive so you can load files/songs.
2,I bought this MP3 player and it worked for a total of a week or so. The headphone jack on it is already busted and now im limited to blue tooth options. (Which my car does not have)For a 43 dollar device getting 1 week of use out of it is very frustrating.I don't know if having it in my pocket was the issue but I've had devices that i've abused far more than havin them in my pocket for the headphone jack to mess up in 1 week.
4,I just opened this product. So far it seem easy to use and gives me the features that I was looking for.
5,I like it's sounds so clear.
5,Purchased this for my daughter. She had a little work figuring out how to put some of her music on it from her MAC book pro but after a bit she figured it out. She seems to like it and uses it almost constantly.
4,I would have given it 5 stars but it sometimes freezes while switching to new music.
5,Great sound quality on this MP3 player. Also it is very easy to operate. I got it for my 11 year old daughter and she figured it our right away. She particularly liked the sleek design but we both liked how easy it was to get her audiobooks from a computer onto this MP3 player using the USB provided. There are also nice headphones and even a pouch you can stick the MP3 player into when exercising.
4,just what I wanted....going to download my purchased music onto this so that I can listen to it anywhere!
4,Easy to use and add files to. The kids love it - especially the voice recording feature.
5,I was looking for an MP3 player that I could use to for long periods of time.This MP3 player has great memory and great battery life for a very low price.The sound quality is very good for the price.I was so satisfied I bought another one to have as a spare!This is a very good purchase
5,I got this for my 11 year old son and he really likes how good the sound quality is and has been impressed with how long the battery life lasts.  He was a little disappointed that it wasn't a touch screen but overall he has really liked it and uses it almost daily!
5,Though not a touchscreen the "buttons" used for controlling the features are extremely responsive and make feel like the best low-budget MP3 player I've ever tried.  Came with a 32gb micro sd which I literally filled with thousands of songs and the unit indexed them perfectly.  Does a really nice job and recording audio too not a feature I was expecting or interested in but never know when it might come in handy!
4,This mp3 player works well and has great sound. It is very compact and easy to carry. Connects well to a bluetooth speaker. Great value!
5,Easy to set up and use!!
1,I use the MP3 player for listening to audiobooks downloaded from my public library.  When the parts of an 18-part book are downloaded to my computer then to the player the player sorts the parts from "left to right" which lists the parts in an incorrect order.  Here is the effect of the sorting protocol used by the player.  Part 10 is listed first followed by 23456789 then 1 followed by 1112131415161718.  The sort should be in numerical order from low to high which would list the parts in the correct order i.e. 123456789101112131415161718.The book parts from the library to my computer are sorted correctly.This is the second unit I've returned.  The first wouldn't go off "shuffle" mode.Thank you to Amazon for exchanging the first unit then taking back the second unit for refund.The parts downloaded to my computer from the library are listed numerically consecutively.
4,the volume is high enough
5,This little guy does it all plays music videos records on demand and has a radio. I use it at skatepark with bluetooth speaker so I won't mess up my phone. Kids are always picking songs and messing with the recorder and it just keeps on playing. The battery lasts all day and it charges really fast. I honestly have no complants solid little unit.
4,This is a nice digital music device option for our teen. Uploading music was a bit trying.
3,This is definitely a cheap piece. Bluetooth doesn't function at all. Doesn't pick up signal from anything. Interface is old and out of date. Would not recommend. Glorified USB thumb drive
5,This is a very good product. The high capacity is so good. I already have 100 songs on. The best feature though is the bluetooth! I can easily connect my airpods and run. The sound quality is also super good. It also ah a lanyard hole if you don't like the armband. I personally like the armband though. Overall this is one of the best products I have ever owned.
2,1 your music stores under files notisic and 2 the screen if so faded and glitchy its hard to see anything. Sounds good Bluetooth is nonexistent battery lasts a while. I was hoping it'd be a bit better than this.
5,Great MP3 player so far so easy to make playlists to rewind a song from the beginning and  to connect Bluetooth devices only issue is that you can’t name the playlists but other than that it’s a great MP3 player worth the money and worth 5 stars highly recommend it
5,I wasn't too sure what to expect since this comes directly from china but it's a very solid feeling device the audio is very crisp even with the headphones it comes with. The built in speaker also works really well but it's max volume is pretty low great if you want to review notes you recorded on it or maybe for playing music at night.FM radio works really well too and even the arm band seems decent quality.
5,This little unit is exactly what I needed. Works great and I had no problems whatsoever. A little larger in size than I thought but still fits in your pocket. All features are easily accessible. Easy to use.Slightly lower volume output than my previous mp3 player but still plenty loud enough.UPDATE: July bought another as a gift.
4,It seems to be working very well so far. I will post an update if conditions get worse :)
5,This MP3 player is exactly what I was looking for. Enough space for my entire library and a headphone jack. Music sounds good and gets loud enough for my taste and then some. I use it in my car going on walks with the dog and anytime I can use a little music in my life while doing housework without bothering the rest of the household.
5,First time buying an MP3 player. I am of the cassette/CD generation.  I am so pleased with this player.  I am not a techno nerd and it took me a little bit of time figuring out how to get my iTunes songs copied over but I am totally stoked over how this works using my JBL speaker.  Expect to use this in my rec room on my treadmill and elliptical for years to come.
4,Getting songs on device is not straight forward. No directions. We did struggle and figure it out. My son loves that he can use ear phones or just listen from device.
5,It has a plethora of fun and useful features including the RECORD function Bluetooth and FM tuner. The battery life is great and the sound is good for a product this price.I would recommend purchasing another holder for the device b/c it doesn't work great with the headphones in and it create a lot of glare in the sun.Otherwise it's a terrific entry level player for kids and adults alike!
5,It's a good size--not too big or small has plenty of features sounds great!  It plays all the formats I was looking for both lossy and lossless audio.  I was pleasantly surprized that it came with a 32GB SD card installed.  Instructions are clear and easy to read.  All in all I'm very satisfied.
2,A decent enough mp3 player it does its job well and the bluetooth works perfectly. However save yourself the hassle and get an mp3 player with buttons! It has no reason to be a touch screen when the only things you can manipulate are the arrows! I've had to press down hard on the buttons and hit them multiple times just to get it to register since half the time it doesn't. This is an even bigger pain when you find out how difficult it is to navigate and make playlists. Don't settle for this $40 hassle go get a different mp3 with either buttons or a real touch screen. Heck it could be this dang model as long as it had buttons!! Frustrated.
1,There is to many problems with this MP3 player to mention first off there is no volume control at all and when I paired my headphones with it the volume went all the way down to nothing tried another set of earbuds and the same thing the volume was so low you could barely hear them at all even with the volume limiter all the way up when you go to the other settings such as ebook videos it says disk error I am sending this back to Amazon and get one that works the price I paid for it was way to much I don’t know why all the good reviews were for maybe I got a bad one.
1,Got the item I ordered fairly quickly but so what....the thing is just junk.  Don't waste your money like I did.  The instructions that come with it are very much lacking.  Every time you touch the part where you set up settings and want to change the volume or change songs etc. it starts the song that's playing over again or it cancels playing the music altogether.  It doesn't tell you how or where (on the micro sd card) to put your music.  I transferred it from my pc quick and easy but the player can't find 50 songs.  Very annoying.  It wouldn't recognize my Skull Candy headset!  I mean c'mon!!  So I salvaged the 32 gb card that comes with it and just tossed it in the garbage.  Lesson learned not to buy MP3 Players online.Crap!@
1,No matter what the company has answered you CANNOT download pre-created playlists by using media player or other software.  You have to make "folders" like they were regular files using explorer.  Then add them one by one.  Literally one by one.  When you go to the folders you made on the player the songs are NOT in the order you had them in.  You have to "trick" it by putting a 1 2 etc in front.  Like I had to 14 or 15 years ago!  That or "create" a playlist by using their pre-labled playlists and yep adding each song 1 by 1 in the order you want them.Then the max volume is ridiculously low.  Also when you're putting the player in the sleeve the record button gets tripped disconnecting Bluetooth etc.  This is just a pain.  I have better interface and volume control with my 8 year old Sansa mp3 player.If I could return it I would.  Just awful product.  Spend some extra money and find a better mp3 player.
5,I bought this unit to download MP3 audiobooks.  It works great for listening to the books.  I wish it saved the place where I stopped but I just check where I was in the book to come back to it.  No other issues with the player.
5,I've already uploaded over 100 songs to it and still have so much space left! It was so easy to do and organize them! The sound quality is great but I usually use the bluetooth and connect it to my echo. The fm radio will not sound good without the earbuds connected to it which is not good if you just want to listen to it out loud but I don't listen to it anyway!
2,The only good thing about this Mp3 player is that it's Bluetooth. Do not get this if you plan to use it with headphones. This thing has no volume at all. And yes I do know that some Mp3s are better quality than others! I have a Sony Walkman (NWZ-E385) that is 10 times better than this MP3 player. But it does not have Bluetooth  capability. I hate I wasted my money on it. But it does work good with my Bluetooth speakers. So I guess I will stick with my Walkman for my walks. Rick
5,This fits all my needs I actually run an escape room and have these MP3 players used in the room as a replacement for a bunch of ipods I had used in the past. I have had zero issued with it so far so I will be purchasing a few more most likely.
5,Great product. Highly recommended.
5,What a great little mp3 player!  The interface isn't quite as easy to use as an ipod but is still pretty easy to use.  Loading your music onto this player is much much easier than using itunes for an ipod.  I would recommend this mp3 player to anyone.
5,For the price it has a lot of features. I was looking for a good Bluetooth connection to a speaker. This one is best so far. There is no volume buttons on the side you control it on the front with + and - signs while songs are playing.It has a speaker good to have. No internal memory but it has 32GB TF(micro SD card) very convenient.
5,Right out of the box it was fully charged I downloaded my music & paired with my bluetooth headset I am a regular gym attendee I bought this to replace my other aging MP3 player have not found any issues with the product very happy with the compact size and love the sound quality and storage for all of my music.
5,The MP3 device looks good and sturdy. Love the arm band that came with the product.  I just opened my new 32GB Mp3 Player with Bluetooth 5.0 - Portable device.  As you see the photo added on the review I was charging it.  Best part it has extended memory slot and voice recording feature. How cool is that for the price. More reviews upon charging and usage of the device.
5,We bought these players for our kids for Christmas. They are 6 and 8 and this is their first player. They love them. The sound quality is great. We aren't sure about battery life at this point because they've only had them for 2 days. The interface is nice and sleek. We do wish it had actual buttons to push instead of just being touchscreen for the kids. Overall a nice music player.
5,There is a wide range on the volume whether you are using the headphones or the built in speaker.My son likes the audio record feature and that you can also play MP4's on it.He doesn't like how you have to be on the current playing song to turn up the volume. Volume buttons double as menu selection buttons.Just as a note the screen is not a touch screen.
1,I bought this mid January as a gift for my husband and it has stopped working. Charged it up but nothing happens. It doesn't power up.
5,I waited till I used this MP3 player about 2 plus months and I can say I love it the sound quality is amazing and it is so easy to use I love that you can lock the settings on the volumes so you don't turn it up too high in error. If you looking for a new one don't hesitate buy it. Money well spent
5,This MP3 player comes with a 32gb card and it holds (so far) about 5000 songs and it's only about half full.I paired it to a Bose speaker and played it continuously for 12 hours and it still had over a half of the battery life left in it. I loaded it with 94 different folders with from 2 to 310 songs in each folder and it works great.
5,I just wanted an Mp3 for my dance practices so that I could play music and record on my phone at the same time. It works quite well! I had seen some complaints about low volume I think it really depends on what kinda speaker you're using. Just make sure to get a decent quality one. It is plenty loud for me. I'm satisfied.
1,The User Manual that comes with this MP3 player is the worst I have ever seen. It does not provide clear instructions on how to use the product. It does not tell you how to download music files to it. It does not tell you how to create and add songs to playlists. It does not tell you how to control the volume. I had to figure everything out by myself through trial and error. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
3,Very difficult to see screen outside. Player works good otherwise.  Blue tube connection did not work on my players. Difficult to connect in a hurry.  I hard wired them in for better connection
5,This is an amazing little MP3 player. Finally uploaded all of my old CD’s into a portable device that I  don’t have to worry about managing storage space. The Bluetooth is excellent. It’s small enough that it isn’t bulky so I place it in my shirt packet and use with my Bluetooth ear phones. The battery life is magnificent holding up for a couple of days 5 Stars.
5,Really enjoy this new MP3 player from AIWORTH and it's ease of use..  I've been backing up my 1000+ cd collection on MP3 converter and saving to the multiple 32GB cards for backup.. can enjoy 1000's of songs using any of them in this player with bluetooth technology..  Arrived quick and well packaged..
5,This little player is just the right size for a shirt pocket...just slightly wider than a credit card.  The surface is glossy with curved edges very beautiful.  Sound quality is great too.  Follow the instructions in the enclosed user manual to get all the benefits of this sweet player you can get at a great price.
5,Love this! I got 2 of them! They work great amazing sound and it’s a very nice modern piece. Good purchase.
2,Sound went to sh/t a few months into owning it. Only plays through one ear feedback through aux cord is loud randomly shuts down or turns on the voice record function resets sometimes and cannot load music (have to restart player and try again) and battery does not last as long.This would work very well if you only wanted a short term player it worked perfectly for a while! Loud clear sound long battery life settings and navigation easy to manage and understand.Just disappointed with how short its lifespan seemed to be. Oh well!!
3,It is not on shuffle and chapters are downloaded in order but plays out of order on audio books
5,i can say this is something i can't live without. you can play music with or without headphones ists Bluetooth and very comfortable in either my hand or pocket. i like how its not like the other mp3 players it has a lot more storage and I can do more with it in general. it didn't cost much either.
4,Great little device.  Holds a lot of music.  Compact. Can connect bluetooth!  My daughter loves it!
5,Purchased this for my son's birthday about a month ago.  He has carried it with him almost the whole time since getting it on his birthday.  He is loving it.  It has great quality sound and it is durable.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good MP3 player.
5,I'm really enjoying using my new MP3 player. It's easy to use and I have downloaded a whole lot of my favorite songs. I think the best thing about it though is the Great sound quality. I seem to walk faster and longer because I'm enjoying the music.
5,I've been looking for Mp3 players to replace my iPod and tried other ones in the past like a SanDisk option. This one has worked the best of the options. I like the display screen the bluetooth connectivity and also that this player has many other options. There is a radio option and also an ability to serve as a recorder if need be. Very user friendly. I recommend.
5,Good for walking around listening to music while I work out and go for walks. Would definitely get again!
3,Very user friendly
5,This mp3 player has a very clear screen. I like that the buttons/controls are touch screen. The product is not too small to get lost while at the same time not too bulky for me to feel the extra weight. The screen is bright and exciting to use. This product comes with clear and detailed instructions in English explaining how to use each feature on the device. Overall I really enjoy using this product and its convenience.
5,I've been looking for a device that could store my library of CDs and play them back through my care stereo.  This device did just that.  It only took a few moments to learn the controls move music onto the device and pair it to my car's stereo.  Everything worked as advertised.
1,i had a death in my family an because i was 2 days late from my 30 dy mark they would not except this useless device bad business the device is in the brand new shap but the sound sucks
1,Whatever you do do NOT buy this piece of Chinese junk. Took over 12 hours for the initial battery charge then it will not hold a charge for more the 3.2 secs (yes I really did measure this) and then it shuts down. Total junk and a waste of money.
4,The player is easy to operate and has multiple options for entertainment purposes.
1,You get what you pay for so I thought this little player was a good deal.  The alarm function works and it is easy to load.  It does mess your playlists up so I always had to use the file function.  The screen froze on me after only 4 days. I am sending it back and sticking with Apple.
5,East to use. I walk a lot and it is easier with music.
2,Instructions inadequate. Trouble paring my sound bar. Took over 1/2 hour paring with my brand new truck. I loaded over 735 songs from my PC via USB cord supplied. I also have an older MP3 ( 20+ years) load with same music from same PC. I compared them for sound quality using my sound bar. The older one uses a 3.5mm jack not Bluetooth capable.The sound quality of the older one using a jack was MUCH MUCH better. The new one actually SUCKS. Sounds like the music is too compressed. Not the fault of the sound bar. I listen to Pandora via Bluetooth from my cellphone it sounds great.
5,Got this for my aunt who is less familiarized with technology. I'm very excited to get this to her and put her favorite music onto it should alleviate all of her cd troubles having everything in one place; and again I believe she'll be fine with this device which is a big plus.
5,I've only had this a day but so far it is as advertised.  It is pretty easy to figure out.  Read the instructions first most of what you need is there.  I still have a few questions but will figure those out with use.  I can't rate battery life yet but as I said everything else is as advertised so I imagine battery life is as well.
4,I use it to listen to music while at work. Works great
2,when you use headphones there's barely any bass and the volume is too low but it sounds ok on a bluetooth speaker
4,A little hard to download load music from a Mac.
5,We use these for audio books for our children. I like this model a lot because of the on/ off button that many other models do not have. It is slim and lightweight. We also love that it has a speaker that is loud enough so they do not have to use head phones
5,It's perfect for what I wanted: lighter than my phone and lower cost than the iPod. A perfect way to have tunes when I walk every day.I had some trouble figuring out how to download tunes. Went to the website tech support page and followed the written instructions. Very easy to do
5,Worked for what we wanted--a durable affordable mp3 player for a younger child.  Been dropped more than a few times and still works fine.  interface is a little clunky--looks like it should be a touchscreen but it is not.  And the sd card has been ejected more than once or twice by curious little hands but its still working fine too.
1,I am glad that I am not the only one having the same experience.  Let’s start with the no instruction on how to load music.  Would be nice to know that it had to be fully charge before you get the option of mounting it as a drive.  Not the only one that can’t copy more than one song without it just losing its connection to my computer.  Very cumbersome to navigate and it is trying to do to many things.  Ebook...who are they kidding.  You need to be desperate if you think you are reading a book on that screen. LED on the buttons goes out but still execute the tap even without seeing.  Poor coding!Getting back to music there is no way to manage playlist and it does not recognize genre.  At least list them by folders that you give a name to.  Just too much wrong with this and it is defective during a copy.  Sending it back.
5,Easy to use. Great sound comes with apple style ear buds. Removal memory card. 3 in player user playlist.I gave this a five star because (it isn't in the manual) you can add a folder of music and embedded a M3U playlist file and this player will see it. This is a major plus if you already have playlists made.
5,My daughter purchased this MP3 player with her own money.  It was well worth it!  The songs were easy to download and she was able to figure out how to use it before we did.  She likes it so much that my other younger daughter wants one too.  Will definitely purchase again!
5,I have been trying to find an inexpensive MP3 player as my iPod doesn't have enough space on it.  My grandson helped me pick this one out and pair it with a speaker.  After downloading music I tried it without the speaker - I am very impressed!  I like my music when I'm working so now I can have it all over the house!  And the size is great as well.
5,I purchased this player as a gift for my 7 year old son. It is the perfect size and the interface is easy to navigate. He struggles with tech but he was able to figure this MP3 player out totally on his own. The sound is good and it even comes with a really nice pair of earbuds and an arm band for workouts. Totally happy with the purchase!
5,For the price this product will definitely fit our needs.  We have a side by side with sound system that you can't always connect through your phone due to poor internet service in certain areas but with this device we can jam on without any problems.  Was easy to set up upload music and connect to bluetooth devices.
5,This product is an amazing device  Bluetooth is a bit difficult to get use to but as soon as you figure it out the device can connect to any previous devices.  I would make the user interface a bit more clean with the text . But overall a very great little device that fits my needs
4,Enjoyed the MP3 player. Simple to use and needed little instructions to use.
5,I had to update my computer to see the device. But it works very easy and user friendly drag and drop great sound quality. I read that the volume is not high enough if you are not deaf or have hearing issues it is very loud. Very good customer service! I would buy again if needed for a gift.
2,finicky to use and to transfer music to it but that may in part due to the many protections for music files instituted over the years.  .....and then the stereo jack turned mono. I still use it with my single speaker when I can get the bluetooth to work but my car bluetooth refuses to pair with it
3,Lack of instructions. FM radio frequency display is very difficult to read.
5,I bought this device as my phone has a very picky battery and very big for on the go music playback and so far I've not been disappointed with it. A minor nitpick would be that it doesn't load some of my music artwork correctly but that's only minor and doesn't bother me that much
5,As a purchaser of an original iPod several years ago I found this unit to be superior in  construction user friendliness and overall quality for a fraction of the price. The new technology blows away the original 2 gigs with a whopping 32 gigs including features that were never available on the old iPods.
5,I purchased this MP3 to upload audio test material to study for an exam I am taking. This device was simple to use and provided me with good quality sound.  The mp3 player also has FM/AM radio in which I have also utilized with good reception of local radio stations
5,Long battery life and bluetooth connection makes it easy to road trip in my 2016 prius. The only thing is it won't show the name of the song on your car dashboard. And it only lets you make 3 playlists. It's lightweight & sleek so I keep it in my driver's console all the time even when it's playing.
5,This device came fully charged and ready to load with my songs! Easy to read directions excellent user interface and very good sound quality. Don't have blue tooth ear buds yet but anticipate using them with player.  Wired earphones worked fine.  I'd recommend this player for price and quality.
3,Can't pick up any local FM radio stations so if that's one of the features you're wanting this for this isn't the device for you. Otherwise no complaints.
1,I had to replace the headphones the second time I used it. Yesterday 8/8/22 it just stoped workingand its less than a year old. I have used maybe 20 times since I purchased itand now it d=on't work at all.Save your money buy another brand.
1,I bought this back in February and now it will not turn on even after charging for several hours. The interface only allowed me to add my albums to the records tap and not the music tab. If you want to pause a sing then when you come back you have to click down from the top menu to the album and then remember the song you were listening to. Not my definition of PAUSE. The touch buttons work well and the sound quality was good. I was using external powered speakers so I can't say about the earbuds. If you add albums out of order they don't get sorted alphabetically. Plugging the device into a USB to transfer is slow.
4,I really enjoyed the sound quality. It also had great battery life.
3,Instructions suck not very user friendly
1,This thing is a piece of crud! Don't walk away from it RUN! Kept dropping wi-fi connection 2 feet away. Would glitch songs while playing. Would lock on so could not turn it off had to just let it run out of power to get it to turn off. Would lock in seeking ear buds and be impossible is get it out of that mode. Had enough and threw it away. My 15 year old player was head and shoulders above this piece of crud. Should have payed more attention to the lower rated reviews and skipped this thing.
2,It was GREAT for the 3 moths but then stopped working as well as it did. I bought 5 and 3 of them stopped working. One just wouldn't turn on after plugging it in to my computer. Another one froze at the charging screen(but I was able to fix it) and the audio cuts out a LOT. And same with the other one the audio cuts out too. The radio is vary staticy and the videos are HORRIBLE! I think that if you want an mp3/mp4 that lasts longer then DON'T buy this.I suggest buying an mp4 player instead.
3,Very frustrating to use this device we can't get Bluetooth to turn can't download music on it.....the fm radio range is limited. I really thought it would work better based on the reviews....
3,First off the battery life is terrible. They are lying about the 60 hours battery life! It dies within an hour for me…
5,Bought this for my father who simply wanted an MP3 player that he could connect to a Bluetooth speaker. This absolutely did the trick. It has more than enough space to hold all the songs he wants the Bluetooth works great and the sound quality is excellent. The user interface seems pretty straight-forward to me and I'm sure most people would not have an issue with it. Definitely would recommend.
5,Great product bought for my son because of it's radio capability and I can regulate what music is added to the device. Easy to use vs an ipod don't need to download iTunes and jump through all those hoops just to add music. Bluetooth works great with wireless ear buds and speaker. It came with headphones sd card charging/sync cord and carrying band which is a great plus. I would recommend this product.
4,a little difficult communicating with customer support but help from the internet got me through it.
2,Loved this when I first got it. Easy to use and set up. Sound was great but after 5 months it suddenly stuck on and I could not shut it off. Let it run till the battery died then tried to charge and it won't charge. Not expensive but I would have expected it to last much longer considering I only used it on my 30 minute drive to and from work.
1,No Wi-Fi as stated very difficult to download my music from my phone. I actually never got any downloaded. No instructions available on how to make it work. Will be returning for refund.
5,The design of this device is pretty and catches a lot of attention. The compact size allows you to bring along for a walk/run and this will be my go-to player. The ease of getting my mp3 files into the sd card also makes this gadget very appealing. I have not even venture into some other functions ie. Radio eBooks and Recorder and I am already impressed. This is a good player without breaking your bank!
4,My wife seems to like it very much and it paired well with her Bluetooth earbuds.
5,This MP3 player is awesome and is exactly what I was looking for! It is specially very beneficialwhen I am doing workouts at the gym. The leather arm clip protects it from getting scratched while givemy both hands easy maneuver while working out on elliptical or treadmill machines. I am really happy withthis Aiworth MP3 player
5,After years of having an old MP3 player I upgraded to the 32GB Mp3 Player with Bluetooth 5.0 - Portable Digital Lossless Music Player for Walking Running Super Light Metal Shell Touch Buttons with TF Card Expansion. What a fantastic machine. Every accessory is available for a runner and the quality of sound with headphones is well worth it.
5,Nice player and no problems so far. Easy to set up and add music. Controls are easy to use and has excellent sound. Some reviews complain about volume but it has plenty of volume for me. Bluetooth syncing is easy and had no problems to headphones or speaker. I like the ability to upgrade more memory but for now 32gb are enough. I recommend this player.
3,The volume is preset. So if you like your music loud  don't buy this one. It's not real user friendly. Or that could just be me.
5,Small and light weight mp3 playerI bought it for my daughter and she loves it.  Super easy to load music onto and use. Her only complaint was that the screen isn't actually touch screen you use the buttons bellow to move the box on the screen to select your app. The radio function seems pretty pointless  but for the purpose of what I bought it for its perfect.
5,first: Delivery on point nice person also!Second: Product is working screen is good buttons work well Radio is working well good sound  through headphones also!!  Easy to work and figure out! Came fully charged!Third: I didn't know it came with an arm holder thing to run with so that's a plus!!All and all this was a good buy I'm glad I did this!
3,having trouble pairing it to my bluetooth  on my motorcycle  which is why i purchased this  was able to gt music on it but now it is so confusing
3,Folders are really set up in a strange fashion.  It works but it could be configured in a better manor.  Sound is very good.  Plays FLAC files also.
5,I bought this player to replace a 10 year old Sony mp3 player. I am astounded by the sound quality of the Aiworth especially since I am now using Bluetoothed ear buds. Setup operation and maneuverability of this player was a snap. I've only had this player for a few days but so far so good.Oh yeah the price ain't bad at all ..
4,Great product - easy to use and great value!
5,Easy to use.  iTunes songs downloaded easily when converted to mp3 format.  Easy connection to bluetooth speaker.  Display is a little sensitive so be careful if you keep the mp3 player in your shorts/pants pocket when exercising.  Sounds great through bluetooth speaker and headphones!
5,Easy to load tracks. Connect the player to a computer and simply click and drag from Apple Music or a folder. You can create and name folders and copy them to the player. You can copy tracks to three furnished playlists. The player will automatically categorize your tracks and eight separate genres. Includes a calendar that displays the full month. Also a stopwatch and alarm.
4,I absolutely love this little mp3 player.  Has great battery life and storage.
1,Froze up in 10 min while connected to my car.  Very disappointed. Also won't function when it gets hot.
3,Bluetooth wont stay connected while I'm moving.  Stop and it works perfect.  This thing is slick as a greased pig in the rain.
5,Kids first mp3.  They seem to like it.  Comes with ear buds kids also like that
5,I bought this mp3 for working out or doing some cleaning at home.It's so small and handy. It came with screen protectorearphones and anti lost rope which is cool.It has a bluetooth and can be connected to any type of speaker which is awesome and it has a pedometer to track my exercise.lastly I can put tons of songs coz it can support upt to 128GB for the memcory card. Really worth the price.
5,This is a well designed MP3 player for my son. The only issue that I had with it was installing music on it. I had to go through a few steps to even get it to show up on the device. But once it's on there it sounds great! My son loves to listen to it before bed time.
5,This is easy to use and load music on to.  There is only issue that a have and that is the 32GB Micro SD card. I wish they would have included an adapter as my computer only has a standard SD card reader. Fortunately  I had an adapter.
4,Just setting it up i will repost review after I use it awhile
4,For traveling walking on treadmill
5,I tried 2 other players that cost just a few dollars less and was very unimpressed so I decided to try this one. What a difference! The user interface is so much easier to use the built-in speaker is great and the overall quality of the player is what I was looking for. As the saying goes " you get what you pay for"
5,Connects to bluetooth right away not like others i have tried.
5,It's really easy to upload music and from your computer towards the MP3. The sound's great and it comes with earbuds and an arm wrap for those who enjoy running while listening to music. It comes with a charger that doubles as the connection that transfers your music. It's just a really great MP3. No problems with shipping. Ten/ten would recommend.
5,Bought this for my son so he can listen to relaxing music at night through his Bluetooth speaker.  Connected without any issues to his Sony XB20 speaker.  Battery life has been good so far and lasts all night without charging.  Came with a 32GB micro sd card so plenty of storage space for songs all night.
1,It does everything it claims it can just not well.The Bluetooth transmitter is weak and glitchy and makes a hissing sound. It’s speaker is bad and decides to play out loud with headphones plugged in. It’s recorder is nonfunctional and plays back garbled beeps. It’s screen is too bright at its darkest and too dark at its brightest PLUS it came with a couple of dead pixels. It feels cheap and squishy and scratches easily. It’s UI is slow and annoying. The picture and video displaying ability is slow and loads in practically one line at a time. Battery quality is good but not worth all the downsides. All in all DO NOT BUY IT. I’ve seen mp3/4 players 20+ years older than it that work better
1,1) I've reached out to Aiworth for technical assistance by email but have not received a response.  Hello-is anyone there?2) The device is extremely small light weight and the display is hard to read under any lighting conditions.  The quality of construction is not very durable.3) The instructions are very limited and do not address or point to answers to questions first time users might have like 1) how do I import music from my computer or other devices 2) When might I put music files into a Folder instead of the Music section4) My computer has difficulty in locating this device when I plug it in using the provided braided very short USB cable.5) My Bluetooth speaker has difficulty in pairing with the device.The warranty period is very limited (not clearly stated but the return window is short) I cannot recommend purchase of this mp3 player.
1,This player is pretty basic and the interface feels like it was made 20 years ago. Clunky interface and small screen make this junk
5,This MP3 player is a good entry-level MP3 player for someone not familiar with technology. One thing I didn't know is that it can also play videos if you use the included conversion tool which works wonderfully and simply. This does exactly what you need if what you need to do is play music.
4,Small and easily used on an airplane.
4,sounds good looks good feels good in your hand.bluetooth skips but so do others
4,nice compact easy to work bluetooth is great with my receiver nice to have 4000 + songs right there.
4,Convirnent
4,I use this as a Bluetooth player and it works great!
5,I've been pleased so far with this mp3 player - the bluetooth functions well with my earbuds and speakers.  Small sleek and clean this is a great buy.The built-in audio recording ability is a handy feature for many different uses.
5,I purchased this MP3 player with the primary intention of using it to store and play backing tracks to accompany my guitar solos. It works perfectly for this purpose and is ideal for storing MP3s for general listening as well. The unit is sleek and sturdy and the programming is very straightforward. Highly recommended!
5,Bought the MP3 for my son. He loves it. It looks and feels like an MP3. Nice fancy design. Bought one other from a different company and I returned it because it was just garbage. Flimsy and made of plastic.The user interface of this product is friendly. Battery life is good as the sound quality. Worth the money.
5,It was just what I was looking for with a great price the only draw back was that the record switch would turn on accidently and my music would quit playing for a sec. Other than that it is a great product!
2,I was looking for an MP3 player with Bluetooth connect ability to allow me to listen to books using my wireless earphones. Although this may be a top rated item from Amazon it is not good for people who want to listen to audiobooks. No matter what I did I could not turn off the shuffle and every time I finished a chapter the player would jump to a totally unrelated book or next segment. No one could help me turn off the shuffle.
1,What I got was working bluetooth but the playlist caps at a maximum of 4000 songs which is incredibly infuriating because it can hold much more storage.
5,I used it for mostly bike rides or stationary bike rides for cardio. Nice to have the bluetooth hook up so you dont have to deal with wires but has the port if you want them. like the arm band so its not another thing you have to carry around in the gym or outside on a bike.
5,The built in functions and apps are super cool and allow for great expansions the storage system isnt hard wired in and can be expanded for extended play lists that i can listen to for hours on end. I can load my entire music library and still have space to experience more! a very great product for the price and availability!
5,I was looking for an MP3 player to use while working out and also an MP3 player that has Blutooth so I can use it with my home stereo. This MP3 player has everything I was looking for and more at a very low price. I would highly recommend this product!
4,I really like the features  nice and small if anything ii wish it could hold more memory.
1,does not play music over bluetooth  must convert music then load total pain! DO NOT BUY for MUSIC over BLUETOOTH!
1,Every 2 songs or so this thing has a skipping song noise that interrupts the playback. It’s very annoying and frustrating.
5,I purchased two of these for my boys ( 11 & 9 years old) bc they wanted to listen to music.  These r great players and come with a memory card.  Super easy to use and so far have kept up with being dropped repeatedly.  They also enjoy the voice notes which is a plus.
5,Purchased as a Christmas gift. Seems like a really good product so far. Easy to use interface. Construction feels quite solid which is important (given to a 9-year-old). Sound is good. The user interface is very simple and easy to pick up--my kid asked me zero (0) questions about how to operate it and that's a very good sign. :)
4,It looks nice haven't gotten around to using it yet looking foward to it :)
3,I used the product mostly for driving instead of using my phone and wasting battery life and not having it for emergencies. It did however take a while for me to get the product to hook up Bluetooth.
5,I gave my 9 yo son this mp3 player for Christmas. He has been using it non-stop and loves the size and how easy it is to load music. The sound quality is great! I also like that it comes with an arm band so he can use it when we go for walks etc. I highly recommend this product!
4,In general a good purchase.
5,I mean for what this this is worth and what we paid it's great. You'll have to spend some time in set up and you'll need to be a bit savvy on the tech side of things but it's not too bad. It isn't plug in play but once you get it working it's great. Bluetooth is the way to go.
5,Five star out of the Box.
1,Biggest piece of crap i have ever used.  had a 8 gB SANDISK FOR YEARS AND NEVERhad a problem  wanted nsomething bigger so i ordered the top rated 32 gb aiworth and have had nothing but problems  could not get all the songs on this one that was on the 8 gb.  go figure  then started having more problems  computer does not recognize in now  not one i would ever order again
5,Its sleek and it is easy to operate by my 6-year old. He loves it. I would have loved though is the seller would have provided a silicon back case for it (because its not available on amazon because it's unique size) to protect it from drop accidents.
4,Me agrado lo fácil de usar no me gusto que la pantalla no es táctil
1,This is interface is non existent. I don't have time to spend 12 hours making 1 of 3 playlists within the player one song at a time. I thought it might have included some software from 95 that would have been easier to deal with.
5,Same as title…
5,Just what I needed. I love it. Easy to use.
5,The product came within 1 day. I charged it up fully and put it to use. The sound was great it came with headphones and also connected to my Bluetooth speaker. The battery life last me all day. The screen is clear and easy to read and use. Overall great product for great price!
5,Battery life is super long.  I can charge it on weekends and use it to commute as car stereo blew out.
5,Most of my music was manually ripped from old CD's rather than purchased online.  This mp3 player lets you simply drag and drop files from Windows to the player without requiring any sort of app as a middleman.  Perfect for my needs.  Bluetooth pairs easily and plays great.
5,This was a replacement as my song got a cheap mp3 player for xmas so after searching I found this and I was presently surprised you don't have to have headphones. It took me a minute to figure out where to drop the file but its actually quite simple. I like the slim sleep design and my son is happy :)
3,Too difficult to figure out. Returning it.
5,The offers for product service from Aiwothtec were great. They were responsive and concerned when I had a problem moving songs from Itunes to the MP3 player which meant a great deal. Just be aware that it is quite the effort to do this transfer however it is worth it. The MP3 player is a great value and functions well. Thank you Aiworth
2,I wanted a basic MP3 player and this seemed to fit the bill but poor UI for navigation makes it somewhat annoying to use to the point where it's almost unusable.For example scrolling through listings of artists or albums there is no way to jump to the next letter or even page you just have to start at the top and scroll down. I have a lot of content so it takes forever. This alone makes it too annoying to use.Hardware seems fine audio quality is fine but user interface is garbage.
2,The sound quality is very poor at best.  The headphone jack is a bit undersized so plugging headphones in is a struggle. The controls are okay not very intuitive memory with a card is good.  But the sound quality is not good at all.
3,Aiworth MP3 PlayerThis MP3 Player is adequate but could be better.The Return button is annoying as it must be used to do almost everything.The sound is good.
4,Great product for the price. Also sized correctly.
1,All songs from albums are clumped together into a single folder. It also has no ability to pick up where it left off. There are also no instructions for connecting this device to your computer and transferring files.
5,The mp3 player was very easy to set up and load music to.  My daughter loves the fact that the external speaker is able to play loud enough to hear the music clearly for the times she doesn't want to use the Bluetooth function for her ear buds.
2,I have never used an MP3 player before. There is nothing about this device that is intuitive past the basic functions and the instructions are absolutely useless. I reached out to customer support and they couldn't figure it out either. There is a lot you can do with it but figuring it out is flying blind. I have never had any problems with music on my phone but this is has been an exercise in trial and error.
2,Difficult to use for audiobooks.  Two problems: 1st each time a file (disc) is selected this player wants to start near the middle rather than track 1 forcing you to scroll to the top.  2nd each time you pause and it goes to sleep when you restart it does not remember where you left off so each time you pause you must remember the disc & track then search out that spot to begin the next time.
3,Nice player when it worked. Sound kept cutting out with both headphones and earbuds. Customer support was great in responding to the problem! It was defective so they are sending me a new one!
5,You can tell from the moment you put it in your hand  that this is well made. i also found it very easy to use . I think the sound is great as well. i am very happy with this purchase. I have seen other players & can see the difference & quality in this one.
5,Loved it works great for working out and having ur music with out having yo use a big bulky phone
4,it has a long battery life and it charge quickly
5,It's hard to find a quality mp3 player that has a memory of up to 128 GB even more so one that doesn't actively spy on you.  This one does both.  Well worth the money in my opinion.
5,The product is sleek and the sound is good. I like also like that it has an FM radio on the MP3 player. The only issue I had is that you could only upload 16GB instead of the full 32GB (minus a few MB).
5,I found this MP3 player very usefull. I like the color screen also I love it that I can use it even in my car thru the bluetooth option. It is a great device. Actually I purchased twice one for my wife.
5,I love it but its not a neccesarity only a will to have. I dont use it much.
4,Use it all the time
5,I move alot between offices on the floor and it continues to offer great sound although I am far from the reciever. Also I love the really long charge time and ease of use when uploading. That versatility and allows me to keep it safely on my person.
1,Product only lasted 9 months and there is NO Warranty option with this product.  Don't buy it and waste your money.
3,I'd say the only thing i had a problem with is it doesn't have a long enough battery for what i wanted it for it barley lasts 8 hours i needed it to last 10+ hours.
5,Once you figure out how the controls work and how to load from PC or other device works great.
5,Bought this to run the sound bar in a golf cart. The seller responded quickly to a product question I had prior to purchase. It arrived nicely packaged and charged in about 45 mins. The Bluetooth connects quickly and plays my FLAC files with no problem. Decent battery life. Looks and feels like a more expensive player. Very happy with this purchase.
4,Only one complaint could have a little more volume.
5,I purchased this for my daughter so that she could have an easy way to listen to music and podcasts.  It's small sleek pretty and works well.  No complaints whatsoever and it arrived quickly and without incident.  I was impressed with the seller's commitment to customer service.  Recommended.
1,I honestly can't say how good this mp3 player is because it won't recognize the song files. My old mp3 battery was starting to fail so I bought this one to replace it. After much trial and error I just can't get the songs to play. iI reformatted the hard drive several times in various modes. Both with the computer and the mp3 software and still the mp3 player won't recognize the files. But heres the thing. The songs play fine on the old player. The songs play fine on the computer. And when i gave up and just installed the songs on my android phone they played fine on there as well. Maybe I just got a bad player but how is this mp3 player getting such a high score on the reviews when it can't recognize the files that three other devices have no problem recognizing?
5,Ordered this for our young daughter for Christmas.  This is perfect for her to listen to her favorite music.  Sound quality is good and really like that we can set a maximum level so she doesn’t turn it too loud.  Easy to navigate and upload music.  Her favorite gift this year by far!
4,Good Christmas gift-my 14 year old son loved it because he can download videos.
4,This was a great product the sound could be better.
5,Bought this player to replace a SanDisk player that would not transfer files via USB. Glad I did. This device is much better faster higher capacity and nice looking. Sound quality is very impressive and I can easily transfer files right from Windows onto the device. Very pleased
5,Excelente producto chevere que puedan incluir el brazalete sería importantede resto buen producto.
5,Bought this for my wife after her other one failed. She enjoys listening to her music while walking on the trail near our house.
5,This is a nice little unit.  I bought it to listen to podcasts at the gym.  I plugged it into my computer created a podcast folder copied some podcasts to it and it played them without me having to navigate to the folder.  Nice!
5,I am impressed with the overall performance of this player.  It was easy to transfer audio files from my computer to this player.  I like the face that you can use folders from computer and files remain organized the way they are on the computer.  Lighted buttons are helpful in the dark.
5,First let me just say I’m happy that the MP3 player turned on 😅. The last two MP3 players I ordered on amazon were defective and wouldn’t even turn on. Although I haven’t had it for long I’m happy with the features it offers! Shipping was also in a timely manner.
5,This works great. Bought it so I could take some time off from my phone but still listen to music. Bluetooth 5 works well with my AirPods. Originally bought a different MP3 player with Bluetooth 4.0 but the audio quality was noticeably bad for wireless headphones so ended up returning it and buying this one instead.
5,The MP3 player works good no issues
1,What a piece of garbage! When I plug this mp3 player into any of the USB ports on my brand new computer with Windows 10 the device isn't even recognized by my computer. Therefore I can't import any music onto it. The instructions do not say how to import music and there's nothing on the internet that addresses this problem. You would think that all you have to do is plug it into your computer the computer recognizes the device and you start importing music. Simple right? But no not with this device. Nothing is recognized. It's as if nothing is even plugged into any of the USB ports. I have a brand new computer and the USB ports work just fine with everything else I plug into it yet this device does nothing. I've spent hours trying to fix the issue but no luck. What a waste of time and money!
5,I purchased this mp3 player in hopes that it would be of great quality. It absolutely is. Clear sound quality the screen is easy to read. Battery lasts all day playing music. The Bluetooth capability is excellent! It connected immediately to a speaker I purchased. Thank you for making a 5 star quality product!
4,Good MP3 player for our kids to have portable music.
5,I love my new mp.3 player. The sound is great. It’s very simple to use. My granddaughter is now wanting one just like mine also. Excellent product and I will order from them again. So if you are looking for that perfect MP.3 player look no further  because you have come to best place for it.
5,The product came quickly and was packaged well.  I had no trouble downloading a ton of music for my autistic son to listen to.  Very easy to navigate. And easy to read.  Sound was clear for a small product size. I would recommend.
2,I bought this to play books on CD in my car which doesn’t have a CD player the Bluetooth keeps dropping off
3,Buttons are hard to push.  You have to hit the power button every time before you can access anything.
3,...the sound quality is lacking.You can't modify the sound too much as there are limited options.This is decent but I could not keep it as sound quality is important to me.
5,I love it. I always like to keep my music on one device and this is perfect. it is small so it's really easy to Carey around with you anywhere. It even comes with it's own micro chip so you don't have to get one you can just transfer files onto it.
5,This MP3 player is by far the best one I have had yet. The sound quality is incredible and you can clearly distinguish the treble and bass. I would highly recommend this to anybody. It is way better than the price. Definitely worth it.
5,this works exactly as it is designed too  perfect for work and bike rides.  its not a touch screen so keep that in mind everything is controlled and navigated by the center buttons.
5,I had a iPod nano for a while but I always thought it was a pain to use. I prefer to just drag and drop music in. This makes it a lot easier. It’s really sleek and a good price. Can’t wait to use it for working out!
1,Don't waste your money on this player. Too late for me to return but the bluetooth has never worked on this player. The only positive thing is that is does play FLAC.
2,After 2 months of use it's getting harder to get a full charge if it charges at all. Switched from the wired earbuds after the cable started to break just above the pin Bluetooth cuts out after 3 weeks of use if my hand passes between the unit and buds or if I stand too close to solid objects.
4,its great for the kids and when they want some alone time
5,Works great.
5,We purchased 2 of these for our kids.  We were looking for something simple that the kids could use.  They absolutely love them.  They take them around with them.  You can't beat the value for these.  It's simple to get songs on the SD card and easy for them to use.
4,Good mp3 player for on the go
4,It is a good quality mp3. Has very good battery
5,I got this mp3 player for my aunt and she has rely enjoyes it so I decided to get one for my self I love it I can were wireless ear buds any were with out worrying about the wiers tangling plus I love how you can FM staireo on it as well.
5,These are much better than the last 2 units I had.  The only thing I dislike is the way you have to hit the up and down button to move to a different button.  I thought it would be that I just had to touch which button I wanted.
3,Difficult to navigate.  No clear instructions to download music videos or files.
1,Every time I try to copy an mp3 to this thing I get an error saying "unknown error".  I have been at this for hours. There are no instructions for copying music to the player only on how to use it. If there are limitations on the type of mp3 it can play it is not clear in the very insufficient instructions that are included with the device.Very frustrating my son was so excited to get this for Christmas and we've not been able to get it to work except with a few songs. Most of my mp3's are in 320 bitrate perhaps that is too high but that seems unlikely since the device is supposedly also compatible with lossless formats.No I would not recommend this. It is a very Chinese experience very Chinese feel and has that very Chinese "quality" to it if you know what I mean. AKA garbage pretending to be cool and nice quality.
5,I needed something for my daughter that didn't have internet connectivity but played music for her.  This was perfect.  She was able to easily connect it to her computer and download what she needed and she is satisfied with it so this mama is satisfied!
4,It does what i need it too.
4,Only available for mp3 limits product.
4,My granddaughter loves this gift and we can control her music
5,i received this player and was surprised to find that it was smaller and thinner than i had predicted.  it has great sound and the battery lasts longer than i had anticipated.  linked easily to my bluetooth speakers and is used daily.  would highly recommend this product
5,I bought this one to replace the other MP3 player I bought 5 years ago on Amazon. There was a learning curve for me and it didn't come with a guide book but I found all the answers to my questions by googling them. Great value for the cost!
4,Easy to use menu very functional sound quality excellent.
3,Description was mid leading. No arm band or strap. It was a learning curve to figure out how to load music etc.
5,I really like this product so far just keep in mind that it only comes with three playlists labeled "playlist 1" "playlist 2" etc. And there is no way to make your own.However you can make a folder and name that whatever you want and it will play from that folder like a playlist.
1,The item worked fine at first but became increasingly difficult to connect to my Bluetooth earphones now it will not pair at all.  I have spent several frustrating hours trying to get the MP3 player to work correctly.
5,i cant find out how to get volume on the bluetooth end i have great volume on wire ear buds but plays very low on my bluetooth ear buds can someone tell me how to increase the volume
5,Amazing mp3 player with great battery life. Able to use it multiple days at work with my Bluetooth speaker before even having to charge. Handles all my songs with plenty of extra space so I can keep growing my library.
5,Battery life is up to 11 hours I love it !
4,The MP3 player works and I enjoy it.
5,This MP3 player is awesome. I had one for a different brand and it sucked to the max. This is easy and straightforward sound quality is good. Has a built in recorder! I don't know about you but I don't remember anything so the fact there is a recorder is a win!
5,As the title says it's incredibly easy to learn how to handle and set up and using it becomes just as simple. And the small size makes it convenient to carry around.  When the time comes to replace it I'll happily be doing so with the same company
4,A lot of capacity for the price.
4,This works perfect for streaming to a receiver.
3,Battery life is only around 5 hours at 16 volume using bluetooth no where near what the stated battery life is. Sound quality is good.
5,Battery life lasts for many days.  The user interface is very simple to use after reading the manual.  The only thing is there is a clicking noise whenever music is playing but it's not that disturbing.
4,Wish it shuffled songs better
2,Frustrating thing about this player is that I couldn't hear it.  It would be perfect for someone to listen to content in a quiet place where you don't have to contend with background noise.  I wanted it for my daily walks in the park where I do have a not so quiet environment and would be very tough to hear it.  It seemed pretty simple to operate and navigate and I would have loved to give it a much higher rating but unfortunately it was unusable to me.
5,Purchased this MP3 player for a birthday present for my son. He loves it. The menu is easy enough for him to use on his own. I simply plugged it into my computer and transferred some songs over for him. Now he listens to it all he wants.
5,Normally would just use my phone for music but I want a music player for an upcoming trip were I can't have a phone. This player has great sound and is easy to use. Inexpensive but doesn't feel or seem like it will break anytime soon.
4,Looks slick
3,I hated the sound because it wasn't very loud. I use it for music
3,not sure about quality yet. instructions are a bit fuzzy. Making rebate difficult requiring a 5 star rating to get it.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very good cheap mp3 for an active person.
5,Since Google has shutdown play music I was looking for a way to stream music to my Bluetooth enabled speaker. Now I can play the music I had on my CDs /  USBs using this player. Recording and FM features are bonus. The interface is easy to use. Very impressed with the quality too.
4,It's a MP3 player...
1,The first thing I noticed is that when you plugin earphones it produces a buzzing noise. If you turn the volume up enough you don't notice it.Then I noticed that if you apply a little pressure to the screen it might turn off by itself. For example I operate a machine at work and sometimes my leg leans on a surface. If this mp3 happens to be in the pocket of the leg I'm leaning with then the mp3 player might turn off by itself. Okay watch out for that. No problem.The straw that broke the camel's back is when music through my left earbud started going in and out. You'd think the problem is with my earbuds but no. My earbuds work just fine on other devices. I tested other earphones and headphones in this mp3 player earphone jack and the problem persists with everything that I plugin.Not worth the hassle. Do not buy.
4,Pretty good quality.
5,I recommend this MP3 if you're looking for one that's in mid-range and good quality overall. It is a good player with a good touch screen that is not too oversensitive. The sound quality is pretty good but if you want to listen without headphones you'll probably have to add a speaker.
1,bought this back in november 2020 as a christmas gift; itʻs been used by the recipient four or five times and1) the controls are NOT on the screen but on the black touchpad surface below it back lit only when you initially power on and then re-awakens when you touch the touch pad.2) navigation is not intuitive for those who are not tech-comfortable/tech-oriented.3) worst of all:  the device now freezes wonʻt power off wonʻt respond to any touch commands.  we have to let the power drain out by itself recharge it then turn it back on only to have it freeze up again.i will not be replacing this with the same brand or model.
5,This is a perfect mp3 player for car rides.  It's the right size to not take over a cup holder and still holds enough music so that my 7 and 2 year old do not have to listen to overly risque violent or depressing music and commercials. Great product!
5,This MP3 player isAmazing I needed something that just played mp3s to use for my performing Duo this had an audio out which was imperative I downloaded all my songs while it was charging! flawless execution matter ofMinutes highly recommend!
1,Just wanted my son to be able to listen to music since he has no phone. Couldn't ever figure out how to load music onto it without apps on the device. Money wasted just passed the return window. My son's hard earned money is gone.
5,My kids enjoy listening to their playlist on this device - was an excellent Christmas gift.
4,Very nice looking mp3.
5,this product is great and very easy to use it could use a brighter backlight but other than that very simple and compact. Easy for a 62 year old to use and that says a lot since my generation isn't always tech savvy
3,Easy to use. The volume is a little bit low
4,I enjoy this mp3 very much
5,Great product. Good quality. Holds charge well and has great sound! Light weight and perfect for jogging
3,I thought it would have been bigger and play better than that
5,I thought this was a very good product. I was worried about whether you could play sound without the headphones but you definitely can. And it's good sound quality. It's not distorted or anything. It's easy to put files on from my computer. So far so good!
5,This is a mini but very powerful Mp3 Player I can enjoy my favorite songs and music at any time. The only thing I don't like is the manual it doesn't tell people how to start.
5,Got this MP3 player to replace another one that had difficulty working with Bluetooth. So far the sound quality is great it has a built in speaker and it works perfectly with Bluetooth. It’s easy to use and comes with a 32 gb SD card. I would recommend this MP3 player.
5,I love this device MB801 32 GB version. This is affordable way to listen to music on the go. I got for gift for my brother in law and also put music with and he enjoys greatly using for work. I give this a 5 star review for quality compared to value is exactly right.
5,The MP3 player arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Has a lot of storage good audio and easy to use.  Battery life is very good at 8+ hours.  Menu options are intuitive.  Bluetooth paired to several devices with ease.  Will look for other products from this vendor.
5,This MP-3 player is one of the best buys I've made. I use it to connect to "out of sight sound system" in my 1962 Impala. It works GREAT! very easy to use charges up very quick has an included case and 32 GB memory card. I would rate it 10 stars if I could.
3,Blue tooth drops out when you turn it off. When you turn it back on you have to search for you Bluetooth pairing device.
5,Bought for my daughter to take to camp with her. This was perfect easy to learn and use.
2,had this around a month and the Bluetooth is starting to fail and had to hit the reset button a few times as it freezes on one screen and trying to turn it off from the power button does nothing when it does this.
5,So far so good. Upgraded from an aging Zune. Size is great. Price is great. I don't ask for much and what I am asking for it meets them demands or exceeds them so winner winner chicken dinner.
5,I like that it has bluetooth and aux capabilities. I had mine for 2 months and it had an issue where sound would only play out of one head phone but I contacted the seller and they replaced it without hassle!
1,This is the second Aiworth MP3 player I have had where the headphone jack stopped sending to both earbuds and now only sends to one. I had another one where the same problem ocurred and it stopped working with headphones all together. I discarded that one this time I have contacted the seller for replacement. We'll see what happens. Only had it less than two months. When it works it's great. But obviously they have a problem.
1,I have no idea how this thing got so many good reviews!!It does NOT have a touch screen as advertised.Volume limit too extremeWon't play ogg files.. (Lossless player??)Bad EQClunky user interface...NOPE!!!!This will be going back.
5,Aiworth Digital MP3 Player Model MB08 with 32 GB micro sd card. Plenty of memory and memory can be upgraded. Very good sound quality delivered through plug-wire earbuds or through bluetooth players earbuds or earphones. Can play MP3 music audible books FM radio or recordings. Very flexible and easy to use.
1,I cant figure out how to transfer music and I dint have a pc. Its 2022 if I cant use my phone to transfer then your product is useless
5,Bought this for my 8 year old granddaughter-price is very reasonable easy to add music and sound quality is excellent. Compact size (purchased a case to protect and keep track of the player) - all in all she couldn’t be happier.
5,This works great. We use it for our RZR side by side.
1,-It plays music.-The interface is pretty bad. Album art is tiny and it doesn't display any song tag data... Only the filename.-If you have more then 4000 songs on the SD card you will need to play them thru the folders menu. That means you can't shuffle through all your songs.-Also it disconnects from Bluetooth a few seconds after start up everytime and makes you go through the horrible menu to reconnect. Then it's fine.-Sometimes a file will be all distorted for a few seconds then go back to normal.-battery life could be better.Update: headphone jack only works in certain positions now.
5,I ordered this for my father because he loves to play his music when he is out playing golf. The MP3 player stayed charged and had a great sound and it was easy to set up with Bluetooth speakers. The price is excellent for the product. I would recommend this product!
2,This works fine with the earbuds that come with it. It seemed to connect with our Bluetooth earbuds but if you try to play the music it freezes or says it is unable. Very disappointed that it doesn’t work with Bluetooth headphones.
5,Got this as a gift for someone. It was shipped quickly and packaged nicely. Seems to be a good quality product for the price! Nice look and feel. Powered up right away and was simple enough to navigate. I will do an updated review once they have used it for a bit.
3,Battery life was phenominal. UI was clunky and not clear how songs are sorted. Constant popping buzzing and crackling in background.
5,I like this little MP3 player a lot. Interface is similar to many other MP3 players in this price range so there isn't a learning curve. My android phone got rid of google play so I needed something for my audiobooks. I like the fact that it has the bluetooth headphone option.
5,I love this MP3 player! My favorite feature is that I can bookmark or save my place without having to search for my stopping point! The sound quality is great and it holds several books! The ear buds were a little uncomfortable but they was an easy fix to switch out!
5,My daughter got this as a Christmas gift because she loves playing music in her room and isn’t old enough for a phone. It’s awesome for her to listen to what she wants wherever she wants! She uses it extensively on flights and long car rides.
5,Overall this is very nice. I wish the directions in the case came with more info. There were a few things I struggled to figure out. But it is a wonderful electronic with many uses and feels sturdy but sleek.
5,It took me a little while to get used to the controls but it is more than sufficient for what I needed. Easy to use and lightweight enough to comfortably run with it. And came with accessories I didnt know it came with! Good stuff!
5,I am good...it was a good item
5,awesome MP3 playermy son loves it
5,I bought this mp3 player for my son as a gift. It is very nice and well worth the cost. It is easy to use and seems to be of very good quality.  I would recommend it.
5,I love this product  it's  Bluetooth and I can connect  it to my headphones  and can listen to it on the bus only problem I have is the radio just seems to get fuzz but otherwise  a great  product
5,This is a great little mp3 player. Super easy to use and it's really lightweight. I enjoy the earbuds they came with as well. I needed something that allowed me to stream music while I teach dance classes and this was perfect for it.
1,I have owned an iPod Shuffle and a Phillips Songbird MP3 and had no problems loading music creating play lists and operating device.  Phillips CS was excellent.  The Aiworth MP3 instructions were poor CS was worthless.
5,So far so good. We didn't have to read manual the interface was pretty self explanatory. Easy upload of my kiddos Bar Mitzvah and Hebrew classes so that he can practice.Hopefully it holds up to my preteens abuse but for this price it totally worth it.
5,I got this player for christmas for one of my kids. (Teenager) It is absolutley perfect. I may even have to order one for my husband now. Great screen. Love that its bluetooth and that it has a FM radio. 5 stars. Bonus is the wrist band it comes with.
5,Really good mp3 player with a lot of other features. Battery life is good. It is small and perfect to either put in your pocket or in the arm case that is provided. Easy to move songs to the device. Bluetooth support works perfectly and is a nice added feature.
5,I bought two each for my kids since they are at an affordable price! Love the slick look and so easy to use. I was able to download music on it it was so easy. Love it!
5,I love this little guy. Sound quality is great I can’t complain at all. I have dropped it a few times and it hasn’t broken yet very durable so that’s a plus. The Battery is AWESOME last a long time. Overall I am very satisfied!
5,It does everything it says it does. The battery lasts a good couple weeks. I use it while walking to and from work. Well worth the price too as it's pretty sturdy. Came with some headphones too.
5,This was a birthday gift for my 10 year old son. He has found the device easy to use and it has all of the functions he was looking for in an MP3 player. Now he has all of his favorite music in one spot on a convenient handheld device.
5,I use the MP3 player when riding on the trail and listen to it at home plugged into the stereo system.  I wish the backlight could be brighter for outside use however it is fine for indoor use.
2,Lasted two months stopped charging. Interface to change songs is slow and laggy.
2,You are going to have to figure this out on your own.If you have a significant number of songs it is nearly impossible to find one.It has freed up space on another device but otherwise it is a waste of money.The sad thing is if they had used pictures instead if words I might be able to use it to it's fullest potential.
4,Used for musicinstructions could be clearer
3,The MP3 player is easy to use and the sound quality is good but the volume only goes to 30...which is pretty quiet by most standards.
5,I'm very impressed with this mp3 player.  I thought it would be really cheap but it's build very well.  The touch screen is very responsive and it has a nice look to it.  I would recommend it as a cheap option to play music.  Bluetooth is a HUGE plus!
2,Radio dosen't work. Not very userr friendly.
1,Sound died after Return date. Piece of CRAP! DONT BUY!!!
5,The browsing can all be set up on the computer when you connect it and the interface transfers one to one in terms of what you set
5,THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL AND PRACITCAL UNIT.  THE SOUND IS CRISP IT IS VERY EASY TO SET UP AND IT COMES WITH VERY WELL CONSTRUCTED EARBUDS AS WELL AS AN ARM BAND  TO SET UP IN ORDER TO GO JOGGING.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.
5,This little MP3 player works great!!!! I purchased it because I bike ride but I like need to be able to hear when cars are near me. I blue tooth it to my bose sun glasses awesome!!!
5,The product worked as well as I expected. Now I can listen to my mp3s without going through my phone to search for them. Saves my phone space and makes it more comfortable whenever I'm on the go with the extra clip-on. Thank you Aiworth for the convenience.
5,Now a days receiving what you ordered on time is rare.  Received MP3 player on time for aChristmas present was perfect.  The battery was fully charged. Ready for loading music and playing. Plus there are so many extras you would need to see for your self.
5,Very easy to set up. Sound is great. I highly recommend it.
4,ok
5,I actually bought this recorder to record seminars at work. I thought I would have to purchase an external mic but the internal mike works just great I have yet to run the battery out and the sound is awesome.
5,For the technology weak I found this devise easy to navigate and access the various features.  It helped that it had printed instructions.  It got it's first workout this morning and the sound was "the best."  I am very happy that I choose this product!
5,Item is working well..
4,All right
5,Great price for a simple mp3 player with great sound  I use it at home with BT smart speakers  and in my car where its great to have my entire CD collection just a few buttons away
5,My daughter loved this Mp3 player. It was a perfect size and I was thrilled to find a great quality item for an amazing price. Also I was excited to see it came with an arm band. Now she can skateboard and not worry about dropping it.
5,It has a long battery life easy to navigate to upload music onto. Works better than I thought it would for the affordable price. Sounds great when plugged into either Bluetooth speakers earbuds/pods or your car. Great product would again with the results I have gotten.
3,Can pair with my Toyota 2021 4Runner via Bluetooth any suggestions
5,Good volume easy to use.
5,We really like this upgrade from the MP3 players we’ve purchased in the past. It’s slightly larger and easier to not let slip from your fingers it get radio stations and the sound is better too. Not as tinny as the other ones. We’ve been pleased.
5,We got this as a gift for our 11 year old who loves music and it has been amazing! He has his favorite songs and some books so he can enjoy his trip with his grandparents
5,This is just what I wanted.  I had a different Mp3 player that was always shutting off and not working correctly.  This is perfect and I run a lot and have no problems.  Pairs nicely with my ear buds too.
2,Sent this back just a few days after giving it to my son. It wasn’t very user friendly and did not work with any of our Bluetooth headphones.
5,I like that it has a built in speaker and that the sound quality is good. It is easy to use and the battery lasts longer than my last mp3 player. I am always on the go so longer battery life is great!
5,This worked out perfectly. I recorded all of my grandmas sermons for my mom and surprised her with them all uploaded to this perfect MP3 player!!! It was her favorite gift!!!! She loooooves the color of it too. Thank you so much. I will purchase from you again.!!!
5,The only con is that it seems to require you to manually select connect every time you use it.
5,This mp3 player is the perfect size for me to carry while doing my walks.  The sound is amazing and very easy to use and download songs.  I'm enjoying it!
5,Not being tech myself it what amazing how quickly my grandkids twin 11 yr. olds & 9 yr. old!  My daughter does not allow kids personal computers so the children are thrilled with their MP3 players and parents are thrilled with the lack of sound!
3,Great product just didn't allow me to advance the volume past the 31 level....light on bass and insufficient volume for me to hear it while jogging. Large music capacity and quick downloads were the upside.
5,So glad I bought this MP3. My husband and I did a lot of research before purchasing it. It's perfect! Sound is clear good quality easy to use and the size is just right. If your looking for one this is the one. You will be happy you did.
1,Very cheap plastic mp3 player.  Buttons don't work and Bluetooth cuts out.
5,Unlike many I like my phone and music separate and this MP3 meets my needs. My only complaint was having to covert all my music to fit the MP3's capabilities but it was not that much of an inconvenience. Over all it s a great mp3 and useful to me.
3,Could not get music to load on MP3 from my computer tried for 3 days with no luck returned.
2,Player holds massive amount of songs.  The headphone port on third plug-in would only play in one ear headphones.  I like the ability it has speakers makes up for the lack of usual headphone use.  Screen is very hard to read in a partially to full lighted area.  Needs to be brighter so I don't need to stand in the dark to see what I am doing.
5,Works great sounds great easy to use and setup works great with my ear buds
5,It's small and sleek and fits nicely in the hand. It does a good job of recording and very pretty. Only took a few days to arrive. All the features are nice for the price.
4,As advertised.
5,Just received it a day early as a birthday present for my son. Easy interface to figure out and connected to a BT speaker with no problem. Sounds great and lots of options. Even the internal speaker is OK but could be louder. No complaints on the first day.
5,I like that it has blue tooth and you can connect it to a portable speaker.  What I don't like is that some songs I have tried to download don't work on it.
5,Great little mp3 player. My friend wanted me to get an iPod shuffle but this one is so much better especially for the price. Works great and have no problems with it what so ever.
4,will work great for me
1,As the title suggests we received a device that doesn't power on.  Disappointing. Do not buy
5,I purchased this for my son and he was so excited it has Bluetooth.  Now he has Bluetooth earbuds to go along with it.  It also connects to all our speakers so he can listen to his own music anywhere.
5,Very good speaker quality quiet-loud.
5,Seems to be good.  Instructions are confusing and not as informing as they could be.  Haven't figured out it reverses order of play when not in shuffle mode.
5,I loved how easy it was to put my music on it and I have at least 600 songs on it so far and I have only used about 3 gega bytes!
5,I use this to listen to audio books. I pair it with a blue tooth speaker and it works great. It takes a little getting used to but overall I am very satisfied..
2,I really wanted to like this player; however while the sound quality is poor at best I had planned to use it through my Corwin Bluetooth headphones. After two hours of total frustration showing me it recognized my headphones but not being able to connect to them I was finished. I was on both the Corwin site and the site for the player (which refers you to the online manual which is the same manual in the box) I gave up.
5,Nice size screen to see and easy to use. Comes with many features along with playing music. I like the arm band included. Hooks up to bluetooth without much effort. Battery lasted beyond 8 hours of playtime thru a portable speaker.
5,Just got it but it seems to be great so far (: the packaging is sturdy the weight and size are exactly what I was going for the usability is simple and straightforward and I'm looking forward to using it!
2,I bought this machine 2 months ago. I really did not like the interface but went with it anyway. I had to hit the reset button several times already because the player freezes. Also the head phone jack broke already. I cannot hear the left ear (no it's not my earbuds since they work on my phone)  and the sound is in my earbuds as well as the player itself. It's annoying.
4,Very good battery life. Easy to use and intuitive
5,Incredible value for the money. The features are fantastic and usability too. They even Included an arm band. As for complaints I would like it if it had AM radio as well and I'd like it if the arm band were designed to store the headset as well.
5,Purchased for my 12 year old daughter so she could listen to music without being distracted by browsing the internet. This mp3 player is very easy to use and the sound is great! Love the memory card expansion ability.
5,Need a MP3 player that had bluetooth capability. Its easy to use and everything that is needed to to use and set up. bluetooth stays connected for a decent distance if you walk away form the player. Highly recommend.
3,Power life is terrible
5,Downloads all my music fast and easy. The sound quality is good enough without any speakers. You could shuffle through the setting with a really easy and smooth touch to go through the different options. Got this MP3 for my dad for his Birthday!
2,worked decently for 3 months or so then the power button broke. Still works but have to plug it in every time to get the screen to turn on on to select a song or video. Kind of disappointed.
5,Works great for the golf cart...synced it to my bluetooth speaker and now I can use my phone normally and don't have to worry about the battery draining.  Perfect for someone who spends a lot of time on the course but still needs to use their phone for work.
5,Got this for my grand daughter and she absolutely loves it! She’s not allowed computer use or a cell phone due to some differences she has but this was ideal for her.
5,I listen to my Overdrive audio book while I work inside for cooking and housework and outside while I am in the garden.  I am very happy with the battery life.
5,This is a neat little MP3 player! It has great sound quality especially in headphones. I like the speaker it has for listening out loud; the volume is good. It’s of good quality and very portable and convenient. Great seller!
1,The instructions are not easy to follow.  A helpful person at Amazon attempted to get me through this but we came to the conclusion that we should contact the seller.  So if you have time on your hands and want to wait for seller to contact you I suggest you do so.  I however plan to return it post haste.
5,I bought this Mp3 to download music from playingforchange.com to take along on walks and in my car. A cheap $24 gizmo from Staples lets you use the MP3 to create your own commercial free radio.
5,Perfect for son headed to summer camp to be able to listen to music without breaking technology rules. USB charger for battery life headphones included small and compact size perfect for pockets.
3,Expected better sound quality. Frequency range is stuck in midrange and flat.  Equalizer is not much help.
1,Hey I was really excited to use this.....I ran once with it (5K) and the screen blanked out and I've never been able to use again and by this time I couldn't return it. I was so upset. Won't recommend this for anyone looking for something to play music and exercise............disaster!!!!!!!!
3,Bluetooth is unstable often dropped out & completely stop working after 3 months.
3,Overall this is a pretty decent product the only downside (Which is a big one) is the Bluetooth range that is very poor.
5,I bought this for audiobooks to play in my truck during travel It was easy to drag and drop the files to the device and it works well in the vehicle I appreciate the 32GB card as it fit several books easily.
5,I hate putting my music on my phone because it takes up so much space and this is the perfect device. The storage is big and the sound can go super high and has a great quality. Would 100% recommend.
5,Bought this for each of my kids. They love them. You do have to load the music on it. The battery lasts for a while. Easily connects with Bluetooth headphones.
5,Still learning all of it's features. However this is a well made sleek and effective product.  Comes with TF card to download up to 5000 songs via your computer! You cannot download apps.
2,For starters the user interface and system software or firmware is absolute crud. Clunky would be a tremendous compliment. Literally everything is counterintuitive. The worst thing however — and I’ve only been using it a couple hours — is that it will randomly just stop sending the audio  signal over Bluetooth to the connected speaker. The device has to be powered down and back up whenever this happens. Supes totes annoying to say the least
5,It works great and the screen is big so you can see everything. The voice recorder and mp4 capabilities work well. It has awesome audio quality and I enjoyed the fact that it came with accessories such as earbuds and an arm strap.
5,I got this product for my father. His newer car does not have a CD player. I am not able to copy all of his CDs over and he can play them in his car. A great price to make a man happy.
5,I bought this for my twins for Christmas so they could have their own music to listen to for when we are on the go!  They actually uploaded their music on their own and were rocking out all in the same day LOL
5,So far so good! Nice user interface and controls. For the price you cant beat it. Bluetooth matched instantly to my speaker. When Wi-Fi isn't an option and you need tunes to get through the day this little player does the job!
1,It broke the first day I got it it’s a bad mp3
1,I bought one. I added MP3 files simple enough. But... when I select the music folder and navigate to the song I want to hear I click 'Play' and nothing happens. Then the screen locks itself. Nothing happens nothing works. No buttons do anything. I power it back on again by holding the power button and then it comes back I go to music folder and then go through the same headache over again. Read the instructions nothing there to explain what is being done wrong. We returned the first one thinking maybe it was just deficient with everything being so mass produced these days. The new one arrived today. Exact same problems as the first one. nothing but a headache..  I'll never buy anything from this company again.
5,Great stuff!
4,Easy to use
1,This is an awesome machine! Fantastic features with built in speakers a calculator an alarm clock and a countdown timer!! What!! Wait there's more! Latest bluetooth protocol 32 gig of storage and Date and Time Display!! Oh my! Even better it's super easy to use and I'm Happy!! Cheaper than one $GME stock  :-)EDIT: Bought a MP3 Player in the middle of February and it stopped working period. The item states it has a 3 month warranty and is an Amazon recommended item. Amazon will not replace it saying it's past the 30 days and this selling company does not respond saying to contact their support team and fails to include the contact information. The amount of time I have wasted trying to have the apparent warranty honored makes this an awful buy and I would not recommend this item or this seller. I now have a costly paperweight.
5,Item came packaged very well. Everything was in box. Arrived very quickly. I have not set it all up yet. But it looks as though it will be pretty easy to set up. Sorry so late on the update as to how well the device works..it loaded and played the songs.
3,The display Is hard to read.
5,The player has excellent sound and it is easy to download the music. It is small in size and you can carry it in your pocket. It has a large capacity card so that you can add 100's of songs or videos easily. Highly recommended.
1,Having a hard time putting music on it. My daughter can't even listen to the radio on it.Waste of 50 dollars if you ask me.
1,While it might be a decent sounding player at this price point the menu system is terrible. It should not be hard to figure out how to use an mp3 player without memorizing the proper key inputs but this device works hard at doing just that. The buttons are barely responsive sometimes requiring more than one press. Sending this one back cannot recommend.
5,We are happy with this product! I got it for my 10 year old for Christmas and he couldn’t be happier! It would be great if it had a touch screen but once you get used to the navigating on it it’s great.
3,Player works fine. Volume level Max is 31 which is not loud enough for remote speakers unless you are in a small room.
5,Nice quality MP3 player. Easy to set up and use. The instructions were easy to understand and follow. Small enough that I can carry it while I exercise or put it in my pocket. Sound quality is great no distortion and bass is strong.
5,This is a very nice MP3 player. Very easy to operate. I downloaded all my music from my PC using the supplied USB charger. Blue tooth connected to all my device without any issues.
5,Everything it’s advertising to be!
5,Easy to transfer music to this MP3 - even iTunes.  The controls and categories will take a little getting used to but overall it is fairly user friendly.  Sound quality is good for the price.
5,This mp3 player connects quickly and easily via bluetooth. I use it at the gym and I've had no problem with the ear buds falling out.  The battery life is great and the charger works perfectly.
3,Will not play your SIM card recordings.
5,Great quality and tech support (e-mail).The player is easy to understand and use.I used different bluetooth speakers and this player sounds the best (used Ipod Nano with bluetooth speaker which had average sound).
5,Overall it does the job. Use this while working out at the gym. Best thing I like about this is that it plays FLAC files which I prefer due to the music file being lossless. Very important to me and very hard to find with other players. Bravo.
2,Needed this for camping/out of range music playing. Out of the box it worked but not even a day later it wouldnt play half the songs I had on it and the Bluetooth cut in and out when connected. The operating system is not as seemless as it could be. For the price that it asks you can buy better elsewhere.
5,The interface takes a little getting used to.. connects to my Bluetooth devices comes with an SD card which I can load with songs from my iPad. Small and lightweight
3,It works for the  Reason I got it .
5,+ It works perfectly with earbuds.+ beautiful design reminds me of a mini-phone.+ not too heavy nor too big.- the speakers could have been better- I'm not satisfied with the touchpad. The backlight of the touchpad disappears quite quickly leaving it hard to navigate.
5,Plenty of space for thousands of songs.  Like the extra features like the stopwatch and alarm clock.  Great item for our 9-year-old son as an alternative to a phone since we have no interest in him accessing the internet without supervision.
5,Nice mp3 player. Good battery lifeinterface is pretty easy to figure out. The only thing I need to figure out is how to keep the screen on to change songs. It goes off too soon for my taste. Other than that works great!
5,I wanted to simply drag and drop music files and not deal with software like itunes.  This is easy to use.  Plays in my car and also has a speaker.
5,I use this every day at work! Love it!
5,Para escuchar musica
5,All my daughter wanted was a MP3 player for her birthday. She was so excited when she opened it. She has already downloaded songs. She also told her friends that they need one too. Great product! Thanks.
2,Screen is very hard to read and volume does not work well. Over all very poorly made but you get what you pay for.
5,I use mine outdoors and it takes a lot abuse.  Still works great and battery lasts a long time between charging. Verty happy with this MP3 player.
1,If it gets hot it gets stuck in the record screen. Also there's a bunch of other glitches the volume up and play buttons hardly work.
5,This is a great product. The only issue I have is the armband or case. It barely fits my forearm. The player is fantastic.
3,Great item - just the volume is way too low at 31.  I think this will be a return.
1,Low volume as preamp to Bluetooth device. It was just adequate. But the unit stopped working after 1 week. Therefore how can I give it a good rating. I tossed the box so I eat this one.
2,Went first purchased Love the look and feel but would not work with my Bluetooth earbuds and car stereo
4,Great Product recommended.
5,When you stop listening and go back later it does not pick up where you left off.  Maybe there's a way to do that but I haven't figured it out yet.
5,Sound quality easy to use price.I bought this as a birthday gift and am very happy with it. Can be used with our Bluetooth speaker for camping!
5,This MP3 player was a great choice for me. It was easy to learn how to work with it. The device is compact and lightweight. I am very pleased with this purchase.
1,Not a good product. I leave it in the car it gets hot and sticks in record mode even when the record switch is off. It's unusable when this happens.  The software is laggy slow. Ugggg
2,This device is hard to use and difficult to program. There are too many useless options.
5,This MP3 player surpasses all expectations.  The mirror-like surfaces are smooth and look/feel good in my hand.  The display is bright and easy to read.  The menu and its functions are nicely laid out and are very easy to navigate.
5,I really enjoy my mp3 player. It has a smooth touch. Sound quality is great with bluetooth headphones not so much with wired headphones. Touch controls can be a bit sensitive but great quality overall.
1,This looked like a satisfactory product but I was unable to use it. It was advertised as I tunes and Apple compatible. It is not.
5,I love how it’s small enough to fit in my pocket and can use with or without headphones. Don’t like that I can connect it to my car but won’t play through my car.
5,The buttons feel sensitive (which is a good thing) and the screen holds up pretty well to scratches. The menu is also pretty easy to navigate. As for the music the sound quality via headphones is amazing and so is the bluetooth.
5,I have to say this is the best MP3 player I have come across in a very long time. It holds up to 5000 songs and for the price you definitely can't beat it.
5,Didn't want to spend the money on the Apple product just needed an MP3 player for my daughter.  for the price this is good quality.  Nice metal feel and look.
3,The Build-in editor for playlists is awful.Doesn't work with M3U etc playlists
5,This Mp3 is really worth its value with such great battery life and easy user interface. The sound quality is also shocking due to its size. Touch screen is really responsive and it includes a recorder which I was surprised probably good for recording college classes
1,Wouldn't turn on after one week of use. No support or troubleshooting guide. Amazon support didn't have any additional information on how to reset the device etc. Complete waste of time to load mp3's onto the device and then have this issue a week later. Amazon customer support was slow and couldn't provide any real resolution. Returning.
1,This company produces MP3 players under different names ( Mibao being another) but with the same interface.  The unit itself is good but the earbud jack is of so poor quality that the last one I bought broke in four months and this broke in less than one.  I thought the first one was just the low-end model so I opted for the pricier one but it had the same flaw.  I now have two units that play well but I can not hear anything.  I am not a triathlete.  I listen to my units while I do normal activities.  The quality is so poor that this unit cannot tolerate even that.  Please save your money.
5,I loves everything about this MP player.  The sound is great with my Bluetooth. The screen allows me to navigate easily and the battery lasts last several days as I get my workouts in
5,I needed an MP3 player for my car.  It’s exactly what I was looking for and now I can have my tunes with me on my ride.  I like it well enough that intend on buying a second one.
5,I bought this MP3 because the other one that I got had a lot of problems. I love the sleek black look to it this MP3 has a great downloading format on it. Haven't had any problems with it I definitely recommend it!
5,I am not an audiophile. I do enjoy listening to music and this player IMHO is very nice. Easy to use. Better than expected battery life and great sound. All at a good price.
5,I like my new Mp3 it has a 32 gb memory it is lightweight. I put it in my pocket while I am doing yardwork. It has a great sound quality. I will buy more for Christmas presents. Unique sound quality. I highly recommend it.
5,Bought this for my husbands birthday to replace his 10 year old MP3 player. Works great especially for the price music and audiobooks are super easy to transfer charges fast and battery lasts. Great purchase.
5,MP3 is lightweight  easy to navigate and works perfectly for listening to music which is why we purchased it..  Very pleased and great quality.  Hope to enjoy it for many years to come.
5,I’m super glad it was compatible with my iTunes. I got this for my daughter and she loves it. The sound quality is nice and I didn’t have any issues with volume. For the price this product is really good.
5,Son's Christmas present
5,Bought this for our son.  It works great with great sound!  The only downside would be the black color shows smudges and scuffs.  But that is a very minor downside.
5,Bought this MP3 player for my 8 year old and she loves it. Very easy for her to use and she can listen to all of her favorite music whenever she wants to!
5,We aren't ready to purchase a phone for my 8 year old but want him to be able to listen to music on a portable device. This fit exactly what we were looking for. Easy to use.
5,So far so good...this mp3 player paired well with my bluetooth ear buds and it sounds great.  Look forward to listening to my music from this great device!
2,Sound quality and battery life are fine. Where this player hits the low water mark is in the user interface. It's awkward slightly confusing and more trouble than it's worth. Quite honestly I'd advise paying a bit more for another brand. I gave mine to a neighbor's child and even she won't use it...
5,The voice recording is great once you learn to navigate the interface. You can even take WAV recordings. Also I've had no problem with this device's music capabilities. It stores and plays music quite well.
2,Cannot find many songs or albums not sure how it sorts or stores names but i have removed the car wiped internal memory reset factory settings it still does not show some albums in the "folder" section or under the album not sure how it filters but really annoyed songs I add do not show up.
5,This MP3 player has a nice solid feel.  Great sound and plenty of storage space for all my songs.  I had some trouble pairing my BT headphones but that turned out to be a headphone problem not the player.
5,Great mp3 player lightweight but well made. Holds all my music very easy to use battery is long lasting and more importantly the sound is great!
5,I was able to fill up my library with a lot of room left for more. I use the shuffle mode the most and the battery life is very long. Highly recommended.
2,I would NOT recommend this MP3 Player to anyone one I kept it because I do not like to return stuff however I ordered a different one and that one works fine.
3,All functions do not work properly.
2,It does work it does what it says it's not bad... as long as you can deal with the tiny screen and the user interface.  It is very difficult to see the screen while outside in the daytime.I personally could not get the bluetooth to work.Trying to return it.  It has been three weeks and I have yet to hear from the seller.
5,It does exactly what I need it to do but the sound from normal earbuds and its speaker is low quality.
5,The player was very convenient and fitted easily into my pocket. During exercise it didn’t even drop. The software is excellent. I was easily able to download songs and transfer them to the player. Excellent sound quality!
4,I don't like the control
5,Great little device!  Took is bit to get music downloaded but once we figured it out it wasn’t bad.
5,We wanted our daughter to have some responsibility and fun with a music/video device without worrying about a full-fledged cellular plan etc. This was a greta fit and she loves it!
5,My new car doesn't have a disc drive so I needed something to load a ton of music on and connect via bluetooth. This works very well for that purpose.
5,This is an awesome little player has good sound especially through my car speakers.  it easily hols my entire mp3 library and i love that it uses micro sd cards instead of internal memory.
3,SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PLAYER HOWEVER BEYOND BASIC FUNCTIONS THE INSTRUCTIONS & SUPPORT ARE NO HELP
3,A little cheap and was hard to get it to work without freezing up.
5,I liked the sound and the equalizer for heavy beat songs. But not so much the volume control on the touch screen. Decent volume but much better on a bluetooth speaker
5,Bought this for my son for Christmas and he is thrilled with the number of songs this player can store.  The player is sleek and easy to upload songs to.  No complaints.  Great little music player!
3,It is a good first time music device.
1,Bought this item to use for music in my new car (no CD Player in modern vehicles unless special request).  I took the time to rip all of my favorite CD's and copy them over to the SD card for this device. Unfortunately the display on this is barely able to be seen.  It was very difficult to see what was happening on the screen.It should be noted that this device is also not touch screen.  Navigation is done with the buttons below the screen.  It probably says so within the description but I did not pay attention before buying it.  I found this device frustrating and ended up buying another device that worked much better for my long distance road trip.'
5,Very high quality MP3 player. Very nice UI and cool touch-screen buttons! My only gripe would be that I can't figure out how to get it to display metadata. But this is very minor. All in all great product!
5,I got this as a gift from my 9 year old daughter and she loves it.  It was very easy to upload the songs and connect to the bluetooth speaker.  love it want one for myself now.
5,Like everything about this unit. Easy to interface. The sound quality is excellent. I take it with me on long runs and the battery life has been excellent even on the coldest of days.
5,Bought this for my wife to help pass the time during her Chemo treatments. She loves it! Easy to use great sound quality and uploading music files to the device was as easy and click and drag.
5,Replacement for an older MP3 for hook up with aux on truck radio.  I did pair it with my wireless earbuds with no problem. * Update * still works great after continuous use in semi truck.  Battery life is great still.
5,I really like this Mp3 the sound is good and it's bluetooth compatible so it's easy to enjoy in the car. It has good volume too so it's a really good purchase.
5,Bought this as a Christmas gift for our 12 year old and she LOVES it!! Her favorite thing is that she can listen to regular radio stations and they come in as clear as they do in our car.
5,I received this for Christmas and am enjoying it very much. I like the speaker quality and it is really easy to use. I just don't like that it does not tell me what the exact battery percentage is.
5,The removeable memory card is a nice feature. I can plug this into my 2019 Subaru and control it with the car screen or connect via Bluetooth but I have to use the mp3 player to control it in that case.
5,Great little player that is cost effective and allows me to listen to music without having to be attached to my phone particularly when I go for a jog. Seller was quick to ship product!
5,I was pleasantly surprise that this came with earbuds and a armband case for my arm! The sound is great and it is so easy to set up and use I might have to buy another one as a gift for my daughter!!
5,The instructions are not "newbie" friendly and it only pairs up with another Bluetooth 5.0 device. The sound is very good and transferring songs to the unit was super-easy.
5,Great unit easy to sync with headphones and download music to. Unit is hard to see in sunlight though. Overall a great MP3 player.
5,Got this for using while riding the Harley. We use the aux cable so not sure about the bluetooth feature. Works great!
5,This is a very good mp3 player for the cost. My son has been through so many and loves this one. would highly recommend if you  are looking to purchase a mp3 player.
5,This is so easy to load music on--500 songs in the snap of a finger.  But wow!  The fidelity of playback is fantastic.  It is better than their older model because the screen is much brighter.
5,Easy interface quality audio enough storage to play for days without repeating. A price that's fair in today's market.
5,I like how you can listen to it without headphones and it's really convenient so I won't have to use my phone anymore to listen to music and drain the battery really fast.
5,Good player easy to use not a fan of the headphones that came with it but you can replace those. It holds thousands of songs and battery last a while.
5,This player is very small and easy to walk or run with.  The sound is very good.  Had a difficult time downloading songs but the seller was very helpful and I was able to download.
5,Purchased this mo3 player for power walking to have the music I want. love it had to buy another for my granddaughter to get to keep mine to myself
5,Small size and that's important as I use it on my Harley trike...road music is as important as the motorcycle to me.Keep up the good product line.
5,Simple and easy to use great for music in the kids room. Good sound we just turn it on and let it play without a speaker.
5,The battery life on this thing is awesome! Lasts all day at work during continuous use and holds a lot of songs. Like where it has space for additional sd card as well.
2,The instructions for use are very unclear. The software supplied to transfer music is in Asian. I could only get it to be recognized as a USB device one time and transferred one set of music files before it will no longer recognize as a USB device. I did give it 3 stars for sound quality the sound quality is quite good. Not gonna fight the Return BS.
5,My child received this mp3 player as a gift. He was really excited about the arm band and Bluetooth capabilities. He likes getting on his hoverboard and playing music as he is riding the hoverboard. Hoverboard has Bluetooth.
5,Using to monitor our church parking lot ministry on FM radio to insure that the broadcast is working properly.  I am seated in the sanctuary and will be able to monitor the broadcast through earphones quietly.
2,The length of a Band Name & Song Title over 20 characters is clipped on the screen
5,We purchased this for our younger daughter who loves listening to music.  She is satisfied just having her own little portable radio and listening to her own music!  Works easier than we expected.
5,Product performs exactly as advertised.  Solid product.  Added a larger card for additional storage.  I like the menu system.
5,It took me a while to figure out how to transfer the music (that's my fault as I'm not tech savy at all) but once I realized how to do it it could not have been any easier!
1,Very disappointed with this and in  one day past returning. From the description it appeared that it had a repeat mode. The AB mode that is common on many recorders now does not repeat the recording in a loop and this was the main reason I bought it. Also there is nothing to put names on the recordings that you make and unless you have the numbers in your head you have to scroll down and open each recording to see what it is. Still have not been able to find how to download music or ebook. Very confusing directions. I called their help line and the person I contacted was either drunk or confused with the responses that made no sense and finally said there is no repeat on this machine.  That took about 25 minutes to get that response!
5,Love the size of player with being able to see and navigate. Battery life is good for Bluetooth. Good sound quality and easily sets up for headphones.Love the ability to change out sd card. And loading files to card.
3,Only given 3 stars as I have not tried it yet.
5,Takes a little time to figure out but once done works like a charm.
5,This is a great little mp3 player and as advertised. Works and have been using it for a looong time now. Takes SD card and have tonnes of music on the go now.
3,Good little thing especially for the cost
5,Great mp3 player for the price i paid
5,This mp3 player is so easy to use and this very high quality. Sound is crystal clear. The battery life is long. And it is compatible with every electronic that I own. Great value at a great price!!
5,I use this mp3 player at work and it's great. It's slim and not too heavy so easy to carry around holds more songs then I will ever need and the battery lasts a long time. No complaints.
5,The product came packaged nicely with ear buds arm band and data/charging cord. It holds lots of songs and it is a good size to take with you wherever you go.  Sounds great!
5,I'm very critical when it comes to a good balance of bass and treble and this player got it right. Unless you want to rattle your brains this will do the job and what a price!
5,This product arrived on time and is as described. I was immediately able to download 400 songs without any problems in several genres and relocate them effortlessly. I would and in fact am going to order another.
5,Bought this for my 13 yr old son.  It shipped really fast.  He loves it and takes it everywhere.  Has a lot of music storage space.
1,La peor compra q e hecho
5,I use my player to listen to music while I work.  It is very portable and convenient.  I use the bluetooth to drive ear buds or a speaker.  Works great.
5,Bought this for my grandson for Christmas and he is really enjoying it.  I do wish it had a protective case however.  It seems to be easy to use and getting music onto it was easy.
5,Bought for my 13 y.o. niece. She likes that she can listen to her music even without headphones. The other features make it fun and interesting as well. She really enjoys it. Would definitely recommend.
5,Even though it takes a minute to figure out it's an amazing product. Totally recommend.Just found my "review". Must have been my 14 yr old son who I gave this MP3 player to for Christmas.
1,Terrible broken in a month. Does not hold the battery the wrong buttons
5,I received the MP3 player today and I love it. It came with an arm band for running and a pretty high quality charging cable. All in all im a happy customer.
5,Using for audio books.  The sound is excellent.  Backlit buttons a big plus.  Easy to use holds a charge.
5,This item is great. I have been waiting to find an MP3 player that also has FM Radio. This item is compact and easy to setup and use. This item bluetooths in very easily with my bluetooth speaker and sounds amazing. Thanks.
5,I bought this for my 11 year old son so he can have music to listen to that didn't require WIFI. It seems to be a very easy interface and he is already listening to his tunes.
5,I bought this for my husband he loves it easy to use loud enough to hear in a factory and last all day for work then some!!!
5,Very easy to use. I travel alot and did not have to charge it until the last hour of my 8hr drive. Highly recommend
5,I use this mp3 player to listen to the radio at work also have a bluetooth speaker the battery lasts all day a full 8 hrs
5,I absolutely love it! Much better than I expected and I listen to it every day. I love how you dont have to have head phones to listen to it! Thank you so much!!!
5,Great player at an affordable price. It took me about two minutes to figure out how to navigate through the menu and it is very easy to use. Adding music is easy too. All around great player.
3,Sound is limited in comparison to  AN iPod  the dark screen is also hard to see without my cheater glasses.
5,It looks like a touch screen but isn't.  The displayed icons are not touch sensitive. A bit confusing at first but okay after a little experience. Very good battery life.
5,Love the size of the player with its armband!!! Makes it easy t and non bulky to carry your music with you without having to be loaded down. Ease to load music also!!!
5,I got this MP3 player for my son’s birthday.  It is easy to use and has great sound quality!  I highly recommend it!
2,Purchased to listed to audio books on the go -This unit will not hold memory of where you left off - reverts to beginning of track.so far I have not been able to get it to pare with any blue-tooth speaker or ear buds.  Not sure if design flaw or just this unit... but wanted to share issues I am having with this unit.
5,The device has met all my expectations!When I had some minor problem with connecting the device with my notebook the help over e-mail was extremely fast and good with video attached. Excellent job!
5,I bought this MP3 player for my 9 year old daughter. She loves it. It is easy to use and has great sound quality. She loves that she can choose whether or not to use headphones.
5,I've had my old one for a year now and it's working great!  Much improved over the old ones.  I'm buying a second one for my wife now!
5,I was looking for a decent mp3 to avoid using data to play music. So far so good. Easy to use simple to load music Bluetooth works and it actually plays lol.
1,This bluetooth mp3 player MB08 will not turn the blue tooth on. The instructions are horrible. It froze up in the first 10 min of use. It is not user friendly and I am Tech Savvy.I would not recommend this unit.I tried to go to the support website and warned of "Suspicious connection blocked" and then very suspicious connection.It is advertised with Bluetooth 5.0Very disappointed and to late to send back or I would.
5,The sound quality was better than I thought/had been told by other users. It is very light and After working out for 4 hours i didn't have to recharge it unlike my previous MP3 players.
5,Ordered this item and once I synced music to it the sound is excellent as well as size not big nor small will definitely be ordering another for my son.
5,I gifted this product to my husband on Valentine’s Day. He absolutely loved it. I would recommend this product to my family and friends. And plan to buy it for myself too.
5,We have purchased these MP3 players for all four of our sons.  They work great and are just perfect for our boys' usage.
2,The sound on this fine but the lack of any kind of clip as well as a lack of any aftermarket clip made for it makes it useless for exercise which is what I bought it for. If it had a clip on it or available I would have rated it MUCH HIGHER.
5,Got the player as a gift. The audio sounds good and setup is easy enough. I just copy paste my MP3s into the main file once the device is plugged in and it works like a charm. Highly recommended.
5,I was searching for an mp3 player that had a huge capacity to store songs blue-tooth and easy to use. The Digital MP3 Player by Aiworth gave me that and so much more. Love it!!!
5,I recently just got this MP3 player and I’m really satisfied with how it turned out. It was surprisingly easy to put music onto it and even came with a lot of useful items to use. I really do recommend this product.
5,We bought this for our daughter to listen to music on; So far it is been great. It is user friendly and we will be uploading more music but we are satisfied with the purchase!
2,Very technical and not so user friendly. Also iTunes upload compatibility questionable.
5,Got this for my daughter who constantly likes to listen to music and books. It seems to be working well. She's only used it for a few days. Tge sound is clear and its easy to navigate.
5,We bought this to connect to our boat stereo this summer. So far it has been working great and holds plenty of music for us to enjoy.
5,I got my son this MP3 player for his 12th birthday and he loves it. It's easy to use. It connected to his bluetooth speaker easy and has good sound quality even without a speaker or headphones.
1,My macbook pro couldn't even recognize the device.  It would pop up for about 2 minutes then stop recognizing the USB device and tell me I need to properly eject the device even though I didn't touch anything and was trying to transfer songs.  Also I learned I have to pay for a program to convery my itunes songs into MP3 format but when I transfered my newly converted MP3 songs to the device it said it didn't recognize them.  I didn't have this kind of trouble with my scandisk music player so I'm returning this and looking for an easier-to-use product.  The manuel that comes with it doesn't even tell you how to get songs onto it.  NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!
5,This is a great little mp3 to use for traveling or for younger kids that don't have a phone.  Nice price and helps save battery life of phone.
5,Works great. Have had it since Christmas it's still going strong. My son is 11 he loves it!
2,Wouldnt read any of my mp3 files. It seemed really promising and the digital recording feature seemed cool too but I couldnt listen to my music... the ENTIRE REASON I BOUGHT THIS!! Maybe it is defective and the new one will work. But maybe I'll learn how to fly too.
5,Great value for the price comes with a charge cord armband AND earphones. Having an fm player built in (that incan record from too) is great as most smartphones dont have this feature anymore
5,I like that its small. The sound quality isn't bad. The battery life is good. I was able to listen to my music all day with no problems. So far so good!
5,Settled on this mp3 player after reading the reviews.  It has not disappointed.  The bluetooth worked seamlessly.  My son is very happy.  He uses it at night with his sleeping headphones.
1,I spent two days on the internet trying to figure out how to put my playlists on this device and it proved impossible. There is an AI support website listed on a card but there is NO support web site on the internet. No one to call and no help from the company. Sadly I had to send the device back. ALSO device is listed as having a "touch screen." Not so. It has touch buttons not on the screen. ALSO I was promised a gift / rebate within 24 hours of registering my product. That never came. ALSO the day the device arrived I was asked to give AI a five-rating. I had to give them one star to be allowed to write this review. I wouldn't give them any.
2,Didn’t get a chance to even try it out. Packaged great. Opened it up and plugged it in. Noticed the back upper corner was popped out tried popping it back in but it wouldn’t stay. After looking closer the back was missing several of the connection tabs used to hold the back and batter in place. Returning tomorrow.
5,It would’ve been great if it came with a clip to clip on to your clothes instead of the arm wrapI use this item for work.
5,Battery life is good have not used it a lot yet bought to use on my side by side
5,We use this to play music in our side by side when we go riding. Works great when there is no service to play the radio.
5,The interface is intuitive and easy to use for a great price! I just dragged and dropped the music into the mp3 player and everything worked great!
5,The MP3 player came quickly and was easy to set up and use.  I like the buttons but it takes a little bit to get used to
5,Easy to use and senses when car is off or on which is a great feature
2,I bought this one and within about a month or so the sound on the left side no longer worked tried many different headphones headphones worked with other devices and not on this randomly deletes songs.
3,Se cuelga frecuentemente
5,The MP3 player was the only one I could find that had Bluetooth and it worked and sounded really well! Great buy!
5,Using this product for music downloading is easy and fast. Would buy again.
2,Max volume is too low for outside use. Brightness so bad it cannot be read outside. Also not very intuitive. I used it 3 times then consigned it to the trash.
5,When I received the MP3 it was on a different language and I couldn't find English.  I emailed customer service and they very quickly responded with pictures on how to get to English.  I'm very satisfied with their customer service!
5,Very easy for my 8 year old son to use. He likes that he can now going running and have music to listen to. My son is very happy he received this for Christmas
5,Good MP3 player
5,Bought to replace my phone when using for music.  Nice features and perfect size.  No need to worry about a touch screen while exercising walking etc.  Good amount of storage
5,Easy to use and has a super long battery life enough to last me a full week of listening to music while travelling. Also super easy to connect to my Bluetooth headphones. Overall great purchase.
1,I was unable to figure out how to download my Itunes playlist onto this device.  The manual was no help either.  I spent hours trying to figure it out.  It says touch screen but it is only touch screen in the sense that you touch the buttons that move you up and down then you touch another button to choose the function you want.  Unfortunately I missed the deadline to return.  It is an awful device.
5,I use this MP3 to listen to my favorite music on the train and on the bus. Sound is greatI bought 2 more for family
5,Quite pleased with this and a solid mp3 player particularly for the price point.
5,When I had a problem with using the MP3 player customer service provided excellent help. Despite some initial frustration I was completely satisfied in the end.
5,This is an amazing product it plays music most awesomely and the battery life is excellent.  The compact size is very convienent too and the bluetooth is superb!
5,This MP3 player has great sound quality.  It is easy to use and lightweight.  I would highly recommend this product!
5,The audio quality is great. Got it for my aunty and she loves listening to songs in it. Great quality for the price very affordable
2,Problem with the headphone jack. We have ordered it twice and we have the same problem. After a couple of months sound will only come out of one side of the headphones attached. We switch out the headphones and continue to have a problem so it’s the MP3 player. Really wish we could find something that lasts!
5,This is great! Small and light weight and works with wired headset or wireless earbuds. The sound is also very good.
5,I actually sent it back I couldn’t put music on it without a computer. I needed something that could use my wifi and Amazon music account.
5,I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Loading songs onto the device was a little time consuming but the sound quality is great!
5,I bought this for my niece's birthday she loves it - she can hardly put it down ... thank you for this great product and speed of delivery!
5,Me encantó esta compra. Lo encuentro muy práctico y fácil de llevar y muy buen sonido. Lo llevo a todos lados... Lo recomiendo.
5,This is a great mp3 player and I love that it comes with a memory card. Easy to put music on there. I would recommend this mp3 player.
5,Downloaded from my ITunes with no problem sounds great the radio works great like having the option to record thoughts instead of writing them down . Overall great product
5,It was a nice surprise how solid the mp3 player feels in your hands and how snappy and intuitive the interface is especially for the price! I will definitely recommend to friends!
5,This player is very nice to hold it has no edges and fits right into your pocket hand of media holder.The sound is superb clear and has wide range for adjustment.I am very happy with my purchase!
5,Good quality and easy to operate
5,Love this slim line MP3 player took me a bit to figure it out but once I did I love it!! Love that it it will contact to my head set that is a 5 star plus.
5,Functionality takes a little while to get used to...not truly touchscreen navigating through options etc.  Great option for storing/playing music with bluetooth capability for the price.
5,Pairs immediately and with no problems with my Bluetooth headsets. Sound is very good. Interface is not complicated. For the price this is a winner. Worth the purchase.
5,Works well for playing music in my car especially since its bluetooth and the battery lasts a while before needing a charge
5,My son wanted an MP3 player and this is exactly what he chose for listening his favorite tunes.Decided to purchase second unit for my daughter and she loved it as well. highly recommend!!
5,Comes with instructions. Easy to use and great speakers along with video download capability and Audio book downloadable as well. Nice for my walk
5,This is a great player. The interface is easy to use. Good size not too big not too small. I love it!
5,I bought this to replace an older MP3 player and wish I had found this item earlier.  it is easier to use than any item I've had in the past.
1,Bought it charged it loaded MP3’s on the SD card from my computer - this thing locked up never to function again… can’t even reboot it or plug it into a computer nothing! Wouldn’t even turn off!
5,Product easy to use and the sound is great. My son downloaded all his favorite songs and it fits well in his pocket. Highly recommended
5,PROS: Long battery life easy to use holds 5000 songs 32 GB memory bluetooth works well in car.CONS: Could use a longer charging cord but still works fine
5,Been using in a hot warehouse for weeks without issue. Will update after a few months if needed.
5,mp3 player just as I needed....has plenty of options and easy to use.  Needed a simple and affordable unit and this one is perfect.
5,love it!  very easy to navigate no multifunction buttons easy to add and delete files and plays great
5,Excellent user interface Sound quality is fantastic. It is really easy to use and the best MP3 player I've ever bought. Really long battery life too. Definitely recommend.
5,I got for my dad so he could listen to his music in the car and he's been enjoying it
5,Great product for listening to music. Convenient size to carry around at all times. Good battery life too. Overall satisfied with my purchase.
2,Can't download any music off computer. Continues to freeze. Radio works decently however.
5,It was a really good item my brother loved it he put allot of music in it
5,This little guy will do everything I need and then some. It has Bluetooth auto-connect expandable memory nice sound equalizer and a nice armband!
5,I really liked how easy this product is to use and navigate. It also connects to bluetooth which is nice! It's a perfect gift for a teenager or anyone who loves music!
5,easy to up load music & great sound  holds a lot of music just wish the battery would last longer than 8 hrs :(
5,bought this for my 12 years old grandson and did not have any problems learning how to use. Thanks
5,I got this for my granddaughter and she loves it. It holds a lot of music is easy to use and compact. It also came with a sleeve which is nice.
5,Great sound quality.  Easy to carry and use. If I had one request it would be that the manual have a quick-start section for those of us who are technology challenged.
3,Overall an ok piece. Fair for the price
5,Everything about this was as advertised.  Worked right away and was easy to use.
1,I thought this was going to be awesome. It looks really good and from what I could tell it had really good sound. But now after trying to get my music transferred over to it from another device it decided to completley freeze up on the product name screen. I tried to let it power down then I plugged it in and tried to turn it back on again. No such luck it froze up again on the exact same screen! I don't know what the problem is. For some reason it won't even let me sign into my Google account! I don't get it! So to sum it all up: it's a big waste of money and time. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME WITH THIS. AVOID IT!
5,i use an mp3 player at work quite frequently and this one has all around great quality for the price.
2,This is just about unusable. It has a record button on the side. When you slide into your pocket or any other carrying device the record feature kicks on. The user interface is basic and not intuitive.I didn't use it long enough to check battery life or BlueTooth connectivity. The sound quality is ok.
5,It’s easy to put music on and stuff. The sound quality is alright too.
5,I ordered this for my Daughters Birthday and she loves it! Came with nice earbuds and has a lot of space for her songs and music. Great buy!!!
5,Awesome product! Would recommend it to anyone who wants a non full screen mp3 player. Just decided i wanted a full screen but still a great product
5,Top notch MP3 Player. This is the future of technology. You heard it here first. This MP3 player is the key to eternal life. It will cure cancer. It will solve world hunger. This thing is absolutely fantastic.
5,It arrived quickly. Its a great pocket sized MP3 that is very easy to use. I'm glad I followed the other positive reviews and chose this.
5,For the price and the experience I'm having with it I am enjoying it. Only wish it told me how to add Audio Books.
5,Just got this new MP3 Player and loaded some music up the sound quality is superb dashboard is easy to figure out didn't have to use the manual. Love it a lot!
5,I got this to listen to MP3 music and books. It works great. Paired my Bluetooth speaker and can listen for hours. This really works great. Best decision I ever made. Works as advertised.
5,Nice little MP3 player we got it for my daughter and she loves it. Will probably end up buying one for my son too.
5,It works well with a few software kinks but easy enough to work around. The sound is good and the battery life and bluetooth connectivity is great.
1,I bought this item looking at various positive reviews!  But when I opened the box and saw I was thoroughly disappointed.  The buttons (touchscreen) are very small and needs a magnifying glass to view!  The interface is very very bad!  I downloaded some music and played!  the sound quality is just ok!  head phones are also flimsy and may go bad in couple of weeks time.  For the price the product is just not worth.  I am returning the item!I would not recommend anyone to buy this item when many more products are available at the same price range with better quality!!
5,DIS-LIKED NOTHING  HAD TO BUY ONE FOR EACH KID... CANNOT BEAT THEM  VERY HAPPY
5,It seems good so far.  Doesn't jumble up the order of songs on albums like some I've had in the past.
5,Works great. Sound wualty is hood. Easy to navigate.
5,Really happyWoth this purchase use it all the time for recordings amd school activities
5,I purchased this item for my Dad so he could enjoy his oldies playlist.  It is stylish and easy to use and the 32G memory is more than enough for my Dad.
5,awesome little mp3 player.  great little player. you can transfer and charge at the same time vie USB wire so easy just move files. super happy would buy again.
5,We purchased this device for my sons 9th birthday. He loves it. It’s works great and is easy to use. This is a great product and we are please with our purchase!
5,It sounds great easy to use and connected right away with my Bluetooth speaker.
1,Ordered Nov 7 useless by Nov 26. The power button stays stuck so we cannot turn it back on.Other issues: initially we accidentally left it in record mode and after a 2h record was created the UI would not let us navigate out of listening to it I had to reset it completely. Also the frame is very cheaply made the top plastic cover does not align well with the metallic side so it has a rough feel when you place your finger on the edges of the player. Overall a huge disappointment.
5,Was looking for a simple MP3 player to store my music for running.  So simple to use and load my music on.  Sounds great!
1,Would not purchase again. The first unit I received did not work correctly. They did replace it. The second unit is 3 months old and the display has quit functioning. Just past warranty. Not worth the money.
5,I love this as an alternative to using up my phone's battery. It lasts so long! The music is also crystal clear!
5,Easy to learn and use great storage for the price and good battery life. Most of all its easy to upload music files! I would buy again!
5,the unit won't connect via bt very well and unless it's the system itself it will end up in the trash downloaded the library twice and am still having issues.
5,I love the aesthetics of it as well as the great sound quality. The bluetooth  connectivity is superb. I like that you can view photos videos and e-books on it as well. Great value!
1,I got the fm player to work and it has good sound quality. The printed instructions are for a unit which has music on it. There is only 1 mac video. NO instruction. for uploading material.  No instructions on organizing anything once it is on. There is a step required after upload to tell the unit to recognize the music.  No audio book support.  unfortunately I waited to long to work out the problems  and the return period is past.  No response to three emails.
5,My son loves this. He has Autism and music is his happy place. He loves to swing and the arm band made it easy for him to do what he love.👍
3,i didnt like the sound quality
5,It is a very nice model.  I like how easy it is to navigate the menus.  I would recommend this to family and friends!
5,I just received the MP3 player I purchased as a gift. I downloaded music so it's ready to go when opened. It looks nice and sounds great. Shipping was quick great MP3 player.
5,Works great! Excellent sound quality and the FM radio works well. Thanks so much! The included arm band will be great for walks or running. Very happy!
5,Bought this for my sister who lives in Guam She's really enjoying it. Has a great built in speaker and upgradable memory. In fact liked it so much asked to order another one for my Aunt.
5,I was surprised when I received this item! Well packaged and presented the quality was fantastic and sound exceeded my expectations! 100% recommend this product!
1,I only gave it ONE star because I could not give it ZERO. Based on other reviews perhaps I just received a defective one. the enclosed manual was worthless. And there are zero YouTube videos on using this product. And even in these comments somewhere the manufacturer states that they "made a video" about using the product but gosh where is it. You have to email "support" to get the video!?  Ok here's the deal. Every once in awhile I am able to get the "menu" to open. Not often. And then trying to get anything beyond that is a joke. It does not work. I received it two days ago and now I will send it back or just trash it. I am ready to buy an MP3 player that actually works.
5,works fine just fine for listening to music without your phone. it comes with a video cpnverter which is relaly helpful
1,Tried to down load music from 3 different computers and memory stick and nothing worked sent back.
5,Great little Mp3 player. It works great and includes a 5.0 blue tooth. I will be recommending to my friends and family.
5,I needed something to play music in my classroom and this is perfect! Holds a lot of music easy to add songs and I love the Bluetooth option!
5,I love MP3 players and this one is fantastic! I love that it has a recorder and a radio built in! Also that it plays music out loud without headphones. 10/10 would purchase again!
5,It was exactly what I was looking for after my old mp3 stopped working however the Bluetooth makes it a step above my previous mp3 player.
5,FYI: THIS IS NOT A TOUCHSCREEN DEVICE. Works well. Music transferred effortlessly. Unit came fully charged and ready to go. Can't complain for under $40.
5,Great sound and love that it's bluetooth.  Very easy to navigate.  My husband loves it easy for him to navigate.  Highly recommend!!!Sound quality is great!
5,Excellent product easy to setup and use! Long battery life and plenty of space for songs since they're on a removable SD card. Everything you need to enjoy it arrives in the box.
5,Amazing MP3 player for the price! Great acoustics!
5,Pretty nice MP3 player.  very small. very comfortable to use. Cute packaging. Good battery life. Strong connection.
5,Love the sound quality  size and battery life of this mp3 player. Great for workouts and beach!!
5,Simple clean user interface with digital on-screen buttons and not a lot of physical buttons (only two).Nice touches like auto-seek and save fm radio stations ebook reading recording quite versatile.
5,Bought this for my 8 year old and he loves it. Holds tons of music and it plays the radio really well.
1,Purchased as a gift. Put ALOT of music on prior to gifting recipient had for roughly 2 weeks and somehow ALL of the music was lost. After contacting the IT company that was advertised with the product they suggested a factory reset. I have done that numerous times and now my computer doesn't even register the device when I plug it in. I had accepted that all was lost and I would have to put everything on there again but it's not even allowing me to do that. I'm disappointed. For the short 2 weeks she had it she loved it. Super easy to use good size....  I'm hesitant to get the same thing again.
5,Love this product battery life is great. It sounds good. So easy to transfer files. I bought it to connect to car radio thru bluetooth. So easy to work with.
5,This MP3 player does exactly what I wanted. Easy to use and good battery life. Coming from an ipod it took a little getting used to...but I like it!
1,I have purchased two of these over the past few months for my son. Both have failed within four months. Units just turning off randomly for no apparent reason.As for the user interface it's not the easiest to navigate through. It's funny that the bottom of the player where the controls are seems to be touch based but the screen itself is not.Fooled me once you were the fool but the second time and I'm the fool. Won't buy a third.
5,I like that it is small enough to fit in your pocket and also has a radio.
1,Not for beginners. I should have read the one-star ratings more closely. All the comments there are correct. Looks bigger online that when you get it it is quite small. Directions are written by someone who does not speak English correctly (but then I don't speak Chinese either). You have to create your own file system. There is NO software to manage it. They have some Apple Media movie converter program that creates AVI movies for the player total waste of time. I purchased this for a friend who needs a bluetooth player hoped this was a good choice. I doubt it. Have not passed it on to my friend (yet).
5,I use this product daily and it's great.  Easy interface nice feel in your hand everything you could want from an MP3 player
5,So far this mp3 player has been easy to learn. The sound is great and perfect to wear while doing chores working outside and exercising outside.
5,Works great for playing mp3's functions well just wish it played mp4 (cd) files as well and didn't have a touch screen but that's just my preference :).
5,Better than I what expected at this price. Takes a while to get used to the navigation on the device but it works great.
5,I needed an affordable voice recorder.  I've run some tests and am very pleased with the sound quality and sensitivity of this device.  Works perfectly for my needs.
5,Fast delivery great packaging all items decribed were packed good quality sound quality is excellent radio frequency is great a definite 5 stars.
5,Fast deliver of promised product.  Easy instructions and quick upload of music and ability to plug in and use in car etc immediately.Thank you
5,Easy to set up with my playlist from my PC. Pairs easily with my blue tooth speakers
1,I wouldn't buy it again. I've owned several Mp3 players. I've never had issues creating folders and transferring music. I've had nothing but problems with this Mp3. Not sure if its the Mp3 itself or the memory card they provided. Either way too much time wasted. Not a good experience.
5,I like the player. Sound is good and lasts a long time before charging
5,I had no issues using this MP3 player. I also had no issues loading Music to it. Everything worked fine out of the box.
2,I just got this MP3 player in march and suddenly it just stop working. It won't light up play or do anything.  I tried to do the reset and nothing worked.  So now I have to look at investing in another one. Money lost.
5,I HAVE ANOTHER MP3 PLAYER WITH PRETTY MUCH THE SAME COMPONENTS; HOWEVER YOURS IS EASIER TO USE AND HAS MANY MORE OPTIONS! A GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE; UNDER $50.00. THANK YOU!
5,Had a problem with setup(my fault) and emailed them on Sunday night and received a reply Monday AM with correct info.
5,Bought this for my 9 year old for xmas and she loves it!! It super easy to use and download music to and she can listen all day!
5,Great little MP3 player!  Got for our 6 year old and she's able to navigate the menus and use it herself with just a little help.
5,love that its compact. also love that it came with a arm band for you to put it in while working out. and it also came with head phones too!
5,This is just what I was looking for. It works well for what I need.
5,This player is fantastic! Love the sound and is easy to use. Really like the armband holder and the headphones work really well
5,Just received it today. Very easy to load the music. I use it in the car better then the radio. Sound is clear and great sounding.
5,I got this for my husband to use on his runs. He loves it and how easy it is to use.
5,I got this for my daughter and she's been very happy with it.
5,this is the easiest mp3 player i have ever had. the sound is good with or without ear buds.
1,I bought a $20 mp3 player that failed within a week and it still sounded better than this horrible device. It's a shame because this player is good looking. It sounds like a tin can changing the EQ settings does nothing. Spend the extra 20-40 and get something good like Fiio m7. This thing isn't worth $10.The company offered a 30 dollar rebate for a positive 5 star review but then asks you to wait on them because they are very busy. Translation: we will make you wait until the return window is closed and then might not even give you that rebate after all. With practices like this you can't trust the reviews and that's a damn shame.
1,This product is bogus. They give you one month guarantee and this broke after 7 weeks. I hardly used it. It will not show up my computer. I can't load anything. Also the blue tooth never worked. Junk.....I have tried everything. there is no way to get in touch with the company and no support. I don't understand why amazon would say this was an Amazon choice. I am losing respect for this company and will be very careful what I order from now on. This is a piece of junk and no recourse It was delivered on June 5th and now I might as well throw it away. Don't buy this.
5,MP3 player is easy to use well recommended. Bought this for a Father's Day present.
5,Exactly what I was looking for! I wanted something to run with that wasn't as big and bulky and heavy as my phone. This works great and I couldn't be happier!!
5,Just what I needed to use in my car. Sound is great. Holds all the songs I could ever want. The battery lasts long as well. Very glad I bought it.
5,Works well for radio and easy to download and play music. Buttons work well. Intuitive. Similar to original IPod without being so expensive! :) Would recommend.
5,I purchased this for my husband to use while working in the garage. He feels it has great sound quality.  The earbuds are excellent.  I would buy again for sure.
5,Took a little getting used to the user interface but this is the best MP3 I've ever had.
5,This device holds a bunch of songs and sounds extremely crisp especially when played on my Bose.  The main page is accessible but hard to maneuver through.
2,Bluetooth does not work well.  Have to hold the player near the headphones or the sound will go in and out.  No range at all
5,Great sound easy to start up and download music. Self explanatory and easy to use for senior citizens.
5,My main usage is with my Milwaukee work radio. I either use the aux or Bluetooth with the Mp3 player and it works great over the radio.
1,never found out how to install mp3  I was going to use this when I went out in the boat instead of iPhone in case I drop it etc can't download Spotify wasted my money and I gave it to my daughter who is anIT person and she says I have to pay for songs  5000 mp3s  not hardly worth it  unless we're doing something wrong  by the time  I got it and tried to figure it out and then her my return TIME was  1 month . I can see why   save your money
5,I don't always understand electronics but this MP3 Player is user friendly. I was able to go through the information and start using it right away.
5,It is just a really good product in general! I would recommend this to everybody that needs an mp3 player!
2,Not sure if it is fault with my particular unit but you cannot read screen in external light.  Fine indoors but impossible to know what you are selecting outside.  Would not recommend or buy again.
5,Good product so far. Uploaded some language exercises and am able to listen to them clearly.
5,My 13yr daughter loves music and this was a great Christmas present!  Easily loaded music from Itunes and Amazon in a few minutes and she's in heaven.
5,Takes a while to get used to the many features but well worth the priceWould buy again.
5,Now I can use the Mp3 player while I'm on the phone without any missed buttons on the phone!
3,Like size.
2,TH reception  was too weak to receive my main section. Two previous models I brought still receive that jazz station well.  Please allow a return and a refund.  Thank you  I was expecting better instructions for the mp-3 unit  I could not find information on setting the time a n d for th tuning.
5,I love it! So much better than the old MP3 I had. It can record stuff and has a lot of storage space.
5,Easy set up and navigation of the menu. I am very satisfied with this player after using several others.
5,Great for road trips where cell signal cant reach. Nice interface and great memory storage!
5,Great MP3 player!! We purchased 2 of these for our 8yr old and 10yr boys and they love them. They are extremely easy to set up and use.
5,bought this for my daughter and she loves it!
2,I guess case of get what you pay for. Bought in March 2020 and stopped working properly in Nov 2021. It worked pretty well before it stopped functioning properly but would not count on lasting quality.
5,Just received it loading up music. Interface is nice and easy to use. Sound is good.
5,It was easy to learn how use and I used it to put my christian music on it and it sounds great.
5,Amazing!!!! Got it for my nephew for a gift and he’s in love with it. Exactly as described but better
5,Ordered this for myself for Christmas as I like to walk and this product is perfect!! So far I love it and think it will work perfect!
5,I accidently dropped my mp3 only 3 inches from the ground. The back cover is now broken in the corner. Horrible quality for almost 45 dollars.
1,This is my 2nd try with these player. Same problem all over again. After less than a week of having it the earphone jack gave out and only plays in the right ear. This is the second time I've dealt with this with this problem. I took the first one back and got all brand new fresh out the box and couple of hours later the same problem. I had high hopes from the reviews I've read prior to buying it. DO NOT BUY.
5,I like it and is really really good to have it you can actually run without feeling anything in your hands and all your pocket sounds good easy-to-use easy to download
1,Waste of money. Died after three months...did this once before then started working for another month now it has died completely can see the selection characters when I press down on the face but it will not turn on any longer. Very frustrating
5,It was exactly what i was expecting. Seems to work just fine but have no been using it long so we will see.
5,Great product. I love the look of it. Very sleek and thin. Directions were easily written and easy to follow. My 7 year old son loves using it!
5,Bought this for my mother and had her cds converted so that she can play everything on a bluetooth speaker very easy to use.
5,Great littler alternative to some of the big brand names. Easy to use but wish the bluetooth worked a little better. Altogether a great purchase for a gift!
5,Light weight. Built-in speaker. Easy to navigate.  Sound quality seems good with my own Bluetooth headphone. Battery time as advertised. Order another one for my kid:)
5,This little device works well and interfaces very well. My old MP3 player died before Christmas so now I can listen to my own collection again.
1,It seemed like a great player.  I can't believe how good the sound was for the speaker size.  Once I got used to them the function keys were easy to understand and worked (when they did) smoothly.  But all too frequently when I hit keys I would get "disk error" or "no songs found."  I'd keep pushing the keys and eventually they would work.  But overall the unit wasn't really use-able.  I love the features and when it worked it seemed like what I needed.  Also the e-mail I sent to the company was quickly and helpfully answered by a person.  So I am returning this one and have requested a replacement unit.  I really hope the next one works.
5,I absolutely love this little mp3 player.  It is a great value and delivers very good sound quality for the price.  I definitely recommend!
5,Very easy to use and nice quality
2,Not reliable - will play some songs but others will not play - played song a week ago now will not
5,Bought for my Daughter Who had no problems at all setting up and putting music on.
5,This is the best MP3 player I have ever had. Very versatile. You can do many different things including recording. I am very happy with this purchase.
1,After less than 3 months the output jack stopped working in one channel. Judging from other reviews this is a serious weakness in this (otherwise not bad) player.
5,Perfect for the little guy to listen to music on his bus ride to school.  Easy for a child to work and holds plenty of songs!
5,Really awesome. It is a nice device for the price. Hope will provide services for long time
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The sound is very low but there is a lot of space and a great battery life so far
5,Makes listen to music while driving or flying on airplane a lot more fun
2,I have had for two months The sound is not even and the shuffle plays the same songs and doesn’t shuffle through my music. I would not recommend this product.
5,I like the sleek style. I'm finding it easy to figure out. Nicely packaged. Can't wait to get it loaded and use it.
5,It has a lot of memory and I really like that you can listen to the radio on it.
5,Bought this for my work outs and in the car. Great size and weight.
5,I like the MP3 player so far will update later after I’ve had it a little while. Comes with headphones and charger cable also an armband carrier.
5,The MP3 player was a very useful addition. The battery life can last up to 18 hours and does not take long to charge at all.
5,Great battery life and song storage the music comes out clear and is an ideal size for running.
5,It works well and has a good battery life only downside is the charger is not usb-c
5,Product is exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased with it.
3,Like the sleek size.
5,Legit mp3
5,This MP3 player is very light. It comes with an armband and I use it for running. Battery life is very long for what I use it for.
2,Poor quality  I don't recommend.  Doesn't support latest versions of anything and is completely junk in my opinion.  It may work for you if all you want to do is download mp3 zip files from your computer.Light bulky device that is garbage with my experience.No go.
5,This MP3 player is in high quality light to carry and easy to get started. It has bluetooth and record functions. I also like the large storage lots of music can be put in.
2,Lasted ~9 months before completely dying.  It was a great little player during that time though; solid speaker for the size and a surprisingly large number of tools built in.
5,Amazing product! My son loves it! Sounds great and came packaged well! Easy no use! Will definitely be buying from this place again!!
5,Excellent unit for the price. Plenty of storage user-friendly love it
5,Great deal for the bargain. Can output to headphones and Bluetooth at the same time which is useful since the fm radio antenna is the headphones.
5,Grandson loves his mp3 and battery lasts for days!!
5,I needed an affordable flac file player as I'm an iPhone customer and this does the job well.
5,Great quick service. Product just what I wanted. Holds many songs my whole library. Works great with my car blu tooth. Highly recommend would buy again.
5,This was very easy to set up  I'm glad I bought this.  The sound is wonderful

5,Nice Mp3 player. Very good clear sound easy to upload songs holds a lot of songs.
5,Love the product and sound quality!! It is not touch screen but it is very easy to use.
5,Now that ive had a few days to use it i think it is a very nice mp3 player and will order another for my wife soon thank you
5,Works great! I was long overdue for a new mp3 player. This does exactly what I needed and interested for it to do for a great price! Love it!
1,Just stopped working and won't even turn on. It hasn't even been a year so disappointed as I didn't use it daily. The volume wasn't good either. I would not buy from them again or recommend it.
5,Great product! Long battery life many features large amount of storage capacity easy to use and just great all around! I would definitely recommend!
1,I received this mp3 player for Christmas. I did not try to use it until April. It does not work. While loading songs on it it just went dead. (It is fully charged) I don't know enough to rate it but I will have to toss it out since I waited too long to return it.
5,Awesome mp3 player. My last one was outdated so I upgraded. Awesome sound and holds all my songs. Would definitely recommend
1,Less than 5 month old . Froze up can not reset will not do anything.Cheap Chinese crap. DO NOT PURCHASE

2,Error: USB device not recognized. The disc malfunctioned when copying 5 MP3's to it. Windows could not fix with the scan and repair disk option.
5,I like the amount of storage but I can’t find the volume feature. The interface is cumbersome to use.
5,Bought for my 8 year old son and he loves it!! Easy to use and easy to download music.
5,This was so good I had to buy two more for my kids. Battery life is awesome as is the sound.
5,The product has exceeded my expectations.The build design and sound is great.
2,I bought this with the impression it was an Mp3 and WMA player "Mp3 FLAC APE WMA OGG Supported" it is not. I keep getting an error stating "Format not supported". As far as Mp3 player it works but it limits my use.
5,So far so good has been very easy to work and easy download music to. Haven't had it very long yet but the battery seem good so far.
5,Exactly as described / as expected.  Arrived on time with no concerns.  Would purchase again.
2,bought 2 of these and they both have glitches when playing songs. my apple and sony mp3 players don't hesitate like this. will request refund

5,So far so good with this product. We have only had it for a short time but no complaints yet!
1,Do yourself a favor take out a couple of $20s and just burn them. Product will not connect to a PC; PC does not recognize product blutooth; product does not recognize PC blutooth. PC does not see device. Get an Ipod!
5,Great battery life  easy to use works great.  Good recording quality.
5,Screen was nice. My daughter will enjoy this to listen to music. Came with a cool arm band she can use to ride her bike with.
1,Not really a good player. Work fine with MP3 but it didn't work with MP4. Bluetooth doesn't work either. Try to pair with my PC and it couldn't even found it. Not recommended at all. Should have gone with a brand name like Sandisk
5,we got this as a present for my husband. He loves the wristband and that it is bluetooth.
5,The battery life is amazing. It’s been 2 days and still does not need a charge!
1,Could not get my computer to even recognize this device as existing once plugged in so went with another device and had no problem.
5,Aiworth latest MP3 player is what I needed. It is bluetooth and bought to transfer my music from iTunes. It also has 32gb which will hold 5000 songs.
5,Very versatile you can use radio recorder or ebook reader. You can also view photos.
5,I've only had this product for a month but so far I'm very happy with it.

5,Very satisfied with this purchase. I allows my son to listen to his music while not opening the door to the internet traps.

5,I have wireless earbuds to go with it and works great at gym.  Very minimum interference from others devices.
5,Got this as a gift for my friends daughter and she loves it. She uses it everyday and finds it easy to use.
5,I like that this mp3 is small and light weight and comes with a memory card. Was shipped quicky.

5,My daughter loves her new mp3 player. Easy to use and great sound quality. We pair it with a small portable Bluetooth speaker and works great.
5,Sound guality
2,Wish the volume control was on the outside .  Instructions were not detail enough.  SD card hard to put in have to hit with finger nail to make it stay
3,The instructions are poor
5,Product works as discribed my son loves it and it connects through bluetooth perfectly
5,I love this little mp3 player it picks up a lot of radio stations when you attach the earbuds and so far it's easy to use.
5,This is a great MP3 player.  It has all the features I was looking for in a product.
5,Really nice MP3 player. Very compact and plenty of storage. Interface is verycsimple amd easy to navigate. Works great with Bluetooth speaker. Great product.
5,Love this product! Very user friendly and the battery life is awesome! Easy to navigate and great sound quality! Would highly recommend!
1,I bought this to use as an MP3 player because of blue tooth. I kept trying to download audio books from Libraries. It would download the books in the music section but not in any chapter order. It also downloaded them in the folder section but if you stopped playing to listen later it would start over. Would not save automatically when turned off. I was really sad since it appeared to be exactly what I wanted. Mainly a MP# bluetooth. I have had and still use the plain Mp3 by Sony it it works fine just doesn't have bluetooth.  Saw that others seemed to have same problem. Wish I had been smart enough to check.
5,good price.  easy to use.  straight forward interface.
2,Not a true touchscreen which caused me problems when trying to use it at the gym.  The record button on the side kept getting turned on which took me out of music mode for one thing. Not for me. I'm returning it.
1,*UPDATE*After less than a month of minimal use (used mostly at home so I wouldn't have to use my internet) the back just popped open and I couldn't close it back. Glad I was still within the return window. I actually liked this product but it wasn't very durable.Nice mp3 player exactly what I needed for a decent price. Sound quality is actually really good. Had a bit of a trouble transferring music couldn’t find it on my computer initially. I had to use a different USB for my computer to recognize the device. Instructions need a lot of work but other than that I am pleased with the product.
5,Easy set up and easy operation.  Now he does not need to be always connected to computer to listen to his music.Very happy with this purchase
5,Great product and a great price.  Once I understood the manual all went well in programing the device.
5,I like that is has a radio mp3 players and others devices in one.
5,Easy to use.  Has a internal speaker which I didn't expect.  Awesome.
5,Great product.  Use it for Audio books and works great.
5,It works perfectly for what we need it for. Great battery life. And has enough storage to hold as many songs as we want
5,Fantastic player!  This holds so many songs! Great for my teenagers.
2,Used it non stop for about a month then after charging it one night the screen is now permanently white and is now unusable. So it was nice while it worked but then just kind of died.
5,I really love this gonna be using it eve single day for work and school!!!
5,Was astounded with the amount of items included with this product. Got an arm band to carry it nice headphones and a charger!
5,So far no complaints. It works perfect for our needs... Playing music in the car!
5,Excellent mp3 player. I really love the FM radio feature. Great battery life. No downside that I have seen.
5,My husband really likes it. Good sound. The arm band is not compatible with wired headphones bluetooth would be your best bet.
5,It's great! Really easy to transfer songs to it. I just love it.
5,Bought for 15 yr. He loves it. I like it has no internet connection. So he can use it when his internet time is up.
5,This is the 2nd one for me. My wife liked the first one so I got Another for her
5,Got this product for my niece. It has great sound and pretty easy to use. Thinking about getting another one for my son.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Bought this for my husband and he love's it
5,The battery life is great on this mp3 player!  Very impressive little mp3 for the price!
5,MP3 player is easy to set up and no problem connecting to Bluetooth.  Highly recommend this MP# player.Sound quality is great.
5,Compact great sound. Easy to use no problems with loading music or play back with enclosed earbuds and blue tooth head set
5,Great little MP3 player! Sounds good with a higher quality Bluetooth speakers or head phones. Syncs well with all my audio devices.
1,If you have a collection of MP3 music files that you want to play on a portable Aiworth MP3 music player then look elsewhere.  There is no viable method to transfer your MP3 files to this portable player.  When I plug the player into my computer using the USB cable my Windows computer doesn't recognize it.  Nothing happens at all.  It doesn't show up in either Windows File Explorer or under Control Panel's connected devices.  Neither do the instructions say anything about how to transfer MP3 files to this portable deice.  This MP3 player from China is a complete waste of money. I contacted support at support@aiworth.com but after two weeks and I have received no response.
3,Touch screen didn't work properly. Battery wouldn't charge
5,This MP3 player was very easy to use right out of the box. It was already fully charged and the FM radio was very clear.
5,light and easy to carry during workout - super easy to download your favorite songs. I would recommend this product to anyone
5,Scans radio stations easily.  Good volume adjustments.  Simple user interface.  The armband was an added perk.  Quality product..
5,Great product.  Little hard to see the display when outdoors but still a great product.
2,Although for the most part the player worked as intended and the simple interface was easy enough to navigate the bluetooth stopped working and was unable to connect to any of my external players or wireless headphones and no amount of troubleshooting seemed to work.
5,Product is basic but what I needed. I do wish you could listen to radio without headphones.
5,I've had this MP3 player for 2 days but so far so good
2,I hate that it is to touchy you can put it in your pocket while playing without changing songs or cutting off.I like jogging and riding my bike.
5,Solid little playerwell made Supports many formats. Built in 32 gigs of storageprobably more than enough for what enough for what I need. I am happy with the player.
5,i baught this mp3 player for my son and im extremly happy very clear sound durable and well priced worth every penny
5,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! It can store all of her music and connect with her Bluetooth headphones!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Literally just got it out of the box put some songs on the device and tried to play it … froze after a few seconds… haven’t even gotten to test the audio quality.
5,such an easy product to use and configure. Bought it for my wife and she loves it!
5,Easy to set up and operate.  Great value.  Good sound quality.  Many functions and features at an economical price.
5,My child wanted to be able to listen to music but control what was uploaded. Very happy with price and quality.
5,User interface is easy and all programs easy to access. Quality machine good battery life good sound quality!
5,So far good product bought as a present and I was able to easily upload music.  Sounds fine and works great so far.
1,This is the fourth MP3 player in my possession and the third I have bought from Amazon but the first I must return.Simply put the sound quality is unacceptable. I have  compared it to AgpTek Searick and SanDisk players that I own using both MPOW and Behringer headphones.I found the Alworth MP3 player sound to be quite tinny in comparison unaffected much by various equalizer settings. I appreciate Amazon’s return policy but I can’t live with the quality of this item.
5,I enjoy the product. It does everything i need
2,The first problem is design. It is not user friendly. Going back and forth the menu is not easy and no other feature worked but audio recording. I would not do video recording or transfer anything from the device to say a computer. I returned it for a refund.
5,arrived earlier than expected lots of storage space and very easy to use! i use the bluetooth feature for music in my car.
1,did as advertised until it didn't. Purchased in Sept 2021....stopped working July 2022.
5,Sound quality is pretty good it is good for running
5,Holds All Of My Large Music Collection and MORE. I Love It!
3,Functions are limited
5,I am happy with mp3 player it i exactly as described. Paired easy with devices and easy to load music
5,This was small and easy to use perfect for what I needed it for.
5,This MP3 /Mp4 player is very good by design and excellent by performance and value for money
5,Very impressed with the device. Paired well with a karaoke microphone. Also included earphones and a pouch. Sound quality is very good.
5,So far this MP3 player works as it should. I've had no problems with it.
5,Bought this for a present for my niece. She loves to record her voice and songs. Perfect size. Easy to use. She loves it.
5,My wife is so happy to have this as gift. its worth for the money.
5,It transfers quickly charges fast has amazing sound quality and my kids will be so excited to get these as they love music.
1,It appears to be impossible to turn Repeat all the way off.  Even when disabling it through the menu it still repeats a playlist (or an album or the list of all songs by an artist etc) by beginning again with the first track when the last track completes.  In the joke of a manual there is a diagram of the buttons that doesn't actually show the buttons and no diagram of all the symbols that appear on the screen during normal playback.On the plus side the battery life is decent and it takes normal SD cards.  The built-in speaker is OK.  Never tried the included plastic earbuds nor the armband holder.
5,Nothing to dislike about this product. Enjoy the music downloads.
2,Could not put any music on this player.  Read the directions looked online; dragged my saved music from windows into this players file but it would never play.  Spent hours and hours but nothing worked. Bummer! Had to return it.
5,This Mp3 player serves my use very. Take it on my daily walks. Easy to load easy to use and sounds great. Would buy again.
2,It didn't seem to play on any Bluetooth speaker. Not strong clear stereo sound quality. Can't pair it with my car stereo. Does not show a clear album art for every song track provided.
5,I use this MP3 player when I'm teaching Tai Chi.
5,User interface is easy to use! Sound quality is great!!
5,Love the sound quality!Easy to navigate and usePerfect size to carry aroundExcellent product
1,I've had this product a while now. Its easy enough to use. One issue is the headphones jack. Mine is "stripped" so even with headphones plugged in the aux you can still hear my MP3 player outside. I had to buy Bluetooth headphones.  It does not sound very loud either.  The headphones that come with it don't work well for me because I have small ears.  The battery life is really good though too bad the other important features are not.There's a record feature...its weird and your device can get stuck.  Also when the MP3 play sleeps you have to turn on the side to change the song...its kind of annoying
5,I got it for my kids. They really like it.
5,I bought this to use in my car.  The interface is very user-friendly and it holds a lot of music!
2,I enjoyed this item however was very disappointed that it broke quickly the headphone port stopped working...
5,Easy organization long battery life intuitive for all ages.
1,Freeze every 10 songs  for the price  very disapoiment
5,The product arrived on time was a good value for the price and is easy to use!
5,Great player  with a great price. I am so happy with its ease of use and quality of sound
5,Works great! Just what my mom needed and it’s easy to use!
1,This is about as close as you can get to false and or misleading advertising. I am unable to use the bluetooth for the music I uploaded and I am unable to use bluetooth for the radio because the earplug cord is also the antenna. I would return it if it weren't such a pain to do so.When I did play it through my car stereo the sound was great. The battery appears to be pretty good too. It retained its full charge for the week that it sat on my desk while I was deciding what to do with it.The UI stinks totally.
5,I like the strong sound when I use it on my walks
5,I like the quality and how I can download music from my computer
5,A great buy!  Such a great value. Easy to operate  Highly recommend this.
5,Easy to set up and use once you figure out how to use the interface.
2,It was decent but now the charging screen is stuck on and so we can’t do anything with it. When it worked it wasn’t the most user friendly but for the price I expected that.
5,Just bought this for my dad. So far he likes it's ease if use and storage capacity.
5,Best bluetooth mp3. Blue does not work to transfer files it only works for earphones/speakers. comes with 3d gig sd card.
5,Really wish the fm came in better but overall happy with mp3 player
5,Great product! Easy to use and download music. Very very happy with purchase.
5,Everything you need in a good music player! A1
1,Absolutely dead...wouldn't even charge
5,Can’t speak on battery life haven’t had it long enough but seems like a great little MP3 player for the price.
5,It was very easy to setup and use and the shipping was fast. Very satisfied customer here!
5,I like the the stylish look and the armband fit that's included which helps it stay in place while running.
5,Bought this so i wouldnt have to use my phone and it works great
2,Not user friendly not well lit and the font is so small that even younger eyes struggle reading the font.  Find a better one IMO.
5,I liked my iPod and I got me some earphones. I want to buy one for my family
5,My daughter is going to camp and this player will be awesome.
5,Nice unit excellent sound Bluetooth operates well
2,Worked nice until now. No sound from MP3 Bluetooth or connected by cable.I would have thought it would last more than a year.
5,Great for the money.
5,Very sleek and lightweight data transfer is instant. So nice not lugging my big phone on those longer runs.
5,Bought for my 11 year old Grandson.  He seems very happy with everything about it at this point.
5,This was a great value for the price. Works flawlessly and has great sound. The earbuds are nice too. Very happy.
5,Works good for it's intended purpose. Nice price
5,WIll Purchase again. Great seller awesome product.
5,Easy to load your own music along with bluetooth and fm radio makes for listening to a variety.
5,Bought this for my girlfriend great all around MP3 player durable long battery life nice little MP3 player
1,I bought this Mp3 player to replace my smart phone when I wanted to listen to music using my BT headphones. I had two major problems using this player. One 75% of my downloaded songs that I had -0- problems playing using my SP via BT  headphones would not play through this Mp3 player (It says wrong format) And problem #2 The BT connection was not easy to achieve and once connected it would simply lose the connection from time to time and I had to start over to re-connect. This Mp3 player is just a pain to use period!
5,Works fine. A little difficult to navigate if you have bad eyes.
5,Used for my babies nursery. Uploaded old songs I want my babies to enjoy. Has a long battery life. Easy to use.
5,I love it wish I would've gotten it sooner!
5,Got this for my daughter to listen to music while she sleeps. It works great!
5,Sleek smooth amazing tech. Love it even more since I have it
5,This MP3 player filled all of my needs as far as bluetooth capabilities and ease of use.
1,I wanted to upgrade from my wired MP3 so decided to try this one. I ignored the reviews that mentioned the volume problem...big mistake. I'm getting less than 25% of the volume I get with my old MP3.With the volume maxed out the music still wasn't loud enough to work out in a gym. The background music and background noises were louder than my music.  The max volume is unacceptably low. Seems like a major oversight for a music player...and lack of attention to detail during the development and quality control process! Very surprising.Will be returning this and looking for something better.
5,Product works well kids love them and never put them down
1,Can't read the main display in any kind of sunlight -- need a very dark room to navigate the menu.  Once loaded with music some songs suffer from chopped digital signals.  It's not a very good player at all.
5,This is a great MP3 player. Really happy with it!
5,Just awesome .. my 6 year old Loves it
5,Great
5,A very nice MP3 player which is very user friendly and sounds great! Highly recommend.
5,This has really great sound quality and battery life.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 VERY DISAPPOINTED! This is the second device I've tried from this company. Bluetooth sound is LOW at its highest setting. Plugging earphones in sounds very distorted and low. Terrible quality.Update:I bought this Jan 10 2021 and now it keeps saying DISK ERROR... This has been happening since yesterday - I haven't done anything since the last time I put music on it (Jan/Feb). I DO NOT RECOMMEND! I wish I could return it...... I tried formatting it to no availUpdate 2: December 1 2021 -- still trash! Now if I even bump it it says "Disk Error" and won't play... ughUpdate 3: Apr 19 2022 - It no longer works...
5,Easy user interface with good sound quality and adequate battery life for my walking with my dogs.
5,Received in a timely manner.  This is a very good product for the price.

5,Bought this for my 11 year old.  He loves it. Easy to use.
5,The connection to my headphones is great! Very good mp3 player. Even connecting it to my car was easy!
5,Got for my 6 year old son and he loves it. Easy to use and connect to Bluetooth headphones.
5,This is easily the best mp3 player i have ever purchased.
1,Firstly. The device has touch buttons not a touch screen which is a weird in between that doesn't really work.Second. The interface stays lit for just a few seconds and the only options for that are lights off or on.Third. (And this is honestly my biggest complaint and why I will NEVER purchase it again.) The interface will randomly lock up and not let me use any of the buttons I have looked for support on how to fix this or unlock the buttons and came up with nothing after all my button mashing and googling.
2,I wish I'd seen the review about the frustrating volume issue. Unless your listening device has a volume booster a max volume of 31 is too low for a truly immersive experience.PLEASE UPDATE THE FIRMWARE & INCREASE THE VOLUME LIMIT.
5,Has good sound quality easy to use and great for working out.
5,Has a lot of features for a modest price.  Battery life is much better than I thought.
5,Fits perfectly in pocket and easy to use.

1,This is a good looking unit but I had to return it because it was impossible to load music onto it.  Maybe I’m too old but I couldn’t figure out how to make it work and the user manual was worthless and there weren’t any helpful YouTube videos.  It didn’t help that the unit was shipped to me displaying Chinese characters.  I wasted two hours randomly stabbing at the buttons just trying to change it to English.  I eventually solved that but lost all patience for trying to make it work.  Shipped it back and Amazon gave a prompt refund.
5,Exactly as described. Daughter loves it.

5,easy to use real nice not expensive
5,excellent unit works great with my Bluetooth speakers
5,Great value for the price
1,Loading music into folders should be clearly spelled out in the directions. In fact it should a main emphasis. Directions give no guild lines on how to load and sort music. What a huge disappointment. Maybe next time the person who writes the instructions should actually have to follow them.  Huge waste of time and money. Sending this back not happy.
5,Great MP3 player sound quality and easy to use!!
5,A great mp3 player! Highly Recommend!
5,Great product clean appearance easy data transfer
5,Excellent voice note taker.

5,Instruction were easy to follow and understand.The charging cord could be longer.
1,Please dont waste your money putting anything on here other than an mp3 is almost impossible. every function is slow. I have like 70 songs on it now and its so slow. each button touch screen and difficult to even know if you press the screen because of how slow the response time.
5,Easy to download music & was perfect for in car use.
5,The product has a good speaker and is stable when walking.
1,I enjoyed this MP3 player for a week as the sound was good and the user interface was good but after a week when I  plugged in ear phones which was several types loud static can be heard overtaking the music making this unit unusable so I threw it away so caution if you want to hear static with your music buy this product.
5,Seems to be a great product. Very functional and easy to use.
1,Not working after 11 months of purchasing. Not able to be recognized by computers. The device is not able to play through the manufacturer's USB cable or Bluetooth.Contacted the seller I got either a late response with very limited help and asked for lots of photos to proof or got no response. The customer service probably is just as good as this device.
5,This has been a great addition to my tech life!  We are enjoying it immensely!
1,When it quick working the first time I went to product support. They had me do a refresh. Worked for 1/2 hour and came up again with disk error. Of course I’m 1 week past the return date. Unimpressed doesn’t cover my thoughts about this player.
1,On my third one unfortunately this  one broke after the return policy was over
5,This is a great mp3 player with good hifi sound.
5,Easy to set up easy to use good sound
2,Downloaded 231 song only 8 of them will play on this device says format not suported but all are of the same mp3 format
1,I ordered 2 tried to put music on them both (drag and drop & on a card) they didn't play. You select a song and it freezes. They sent me 2 more to replace the faulty ones. Same thing! I sent them back now waiting for a refund. It's been 9 days since they received the return. Not happy!

1,BUYER BEWARE!! I got this for my 12 year old and it worked great easy to navigate easy to put music on great sound BUT stopped working after just few weeks..... and now it’s too late to return it. :( The screen just quit working and that makes me think it’s poor quality. Few weeks ago would have given it 5 stars. It had a year warranty but contacted company and they claimed I needed to update it. They were Chinese and had big problem communicating with them. I would give 0 stars if I could
5,I loved everthing of it
5,I am Highly impressed. Much more than I could have wanted
5,We got this for our 9 year old son and he loves it!
5,A must  mp3
1,I have been trying to "like" this device but it constantly freezes. When you try to sort M3 files it gets to the point that it stops working. Just yesterday I was enjoying some music and the device just "turned off" by itself. I have plugged it in but It does not seem to get powered. It is just defective.
1,This player has terrible volume it is not user friendly and the technology overall is limited.  If you need a device to play music via Bluetooth look elsewhere. This is not a good buy whatsoever.
5,This thing is perfect for what I need for mp3 player.
2,We liked the player but after the 30 day warranty expired it started freezing and not charging correctly. It is now not usable.
5,Sound quality is good. Easy to use.

5,I liked how easy it was to use. Instructions are very clear.
5,It is great. I really like the simpleness
5,I like the sound quality it is clear and easy user interface to navigate.
1,I spent 4 freaking hours trying to put music on this damn thing. Some songs would work and some wouldnt. When a song wont work the whole thing would freeze so I have to turn it on and off each time. God only knows how much that fried the damn thing. This was such a waste of money. I will return it.
5,It’s really good simple to use and has solid memory space

5,Needed a blutooth mp3 to replace my other one
5,Works good
1,I had one hell of a time getting it to connect to my computer. When it was finally recognized I had issues deleting a file that had been uploaded to the MP3. Now it's giving me "disk error" and I can't do anything with it! I'm returning it to Amazon. I do NOT need this frustration!!!
5,Can't beat it for the money. It even has Bluetooth
1,Operating Instructions are very limited. I was able to load music up on the TF card to play but the unit would freeze after a few seconds playing. No button worked except for the power to shut it off. After restarting I got the same result - the unit would completely freeze. FAIL. Sending this one back.

5,Easy to set up. easy to use.  sound quality is great
5,Great product.  Feels good in your hand.  Very easy to use.
5,Really like this product ordered other ones beside this and didnt work good
1,I bought this in December 2020. It died yesterday (5/5/21) while adding music to it via my laptop. The micro SD chip died. I performed a factory reset and even reformatted it to try and recover it to no avail. I ordered another. Hopefully it will work. The sound quality was wonderful while it worked but I found it very difficult to see the menu in sunshine clumsy to navigate and horrible when trying to build a playlist. Look for a better one.
5,We got this for our son for his 12th birthday. He is thrilled with it.
5,Really liked the compactness and simplicity of the menu.  All around a great product.
5,Got 2 mp3 for my kids and they love them they have good battery life
1,I have had this for a little over three months and not happy at all. I got this to plug into my Razor when we go riding. It keeps going in and out with the music and doesn’t play through both of my speakers. We thought it might be the speakers in my bike so we hooked up to our car speakers and same thing. Good thing my husband didn’t order one for his bike.
5,Works great just what I needed!
1,Not worth the price. It only worked for a short period of time then crashed. I sent the seller a message and have not heard from them at all. Amazon agent told me there is a 1 year warranty on it from the seller but that does no good if the seller does not reply to the emails we send them. Very poor customer service from this seller.
5,Use this to play kids music in my daughter's room.
5,Very user friendly!! Light weight. Great sound quality.
5,Needed something simple and inexpensive for music without all the features of a smartphone.
5,I liked how it fit into my jacket pocket and how it sounded.

5,Great player
5,It works well enough and my 10 year old is happy with it.
5,Love my device. Great quality and sound. Use it everyday.
1,I bought this item thinking it was going to be new instead I got an item covered in finger prints and the box was seal with the cheapest looking scotch tape I've ever seen. Rather disappointed both due to the used product received and the price for it seeing how it wasn't new.
5,The divice works without any problems. A very fast and easy upload of the files.
2,Get what you pay for. Not much volume. Connection to bose headset is iffy.
5,Nice little MP3 player.  Would buy again.
1,Have been using this product pretty steadily for two full months.  Started okay but now almost every song is ruined by the player seeming to lose power.  There will be a few seconds of slow-motion stuttering of the music sometimes more than once during a song.  I have the player plugged in while using and unplugged overnight.  Quite aggravating.
5,Great quality! Easy to use great features and battery life! Love it!
5,Good quality for my grandchildren to use for music.
5,I find this very easy to use. The battery life is great.
5,Sleek and easy to use. Shuts off automatically after use  to save battery life.

5,Easy to use small and compact.
5,This product arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.
1,Claims to support eBook; it does not support any Digital Book. The documentation was poorly written and does not tell you anything. No customer support to call. The limited documentation claims you need to load TXT files for books?????I was able to load one MP3 music file it took all day to figure out how  to do that. If it truly works they are keeping it a secret.
5,The company had quick delivery and excellent prices. The MP3 player simple to use.

1,Based on all the positive reviews this product is ot made for me I don't need most of the features on it.I was looking for storage device where I can put a dozen playlists and play them back on my BT speakers.I took me 2 1/2 hours to load 20 songs in 2 playlists then turning on the BT was challenge you select the BT icon then you search for BT devices I got an error message the BT is off?!?A touchscreen would be nice and helpful.I am returning it to Amazon
5,User friendly. Nice packaging Quick delivery. Good price.
5,This is a really cool Mp3 player. My son loves it.
5,The player has a modern look and also easy to use. My family love it very much.
5,Seems well made works good
5,Sound quality is good battery life is also good
1,This is the same garbage MP3 player as another one I bought but had a different name and somewhat different housing.  Same interface and same cheap like issues. Like the previous POS it quit working after a few weeks.  It still plays but no longer mounts on my Mac so I can no longer copy music to it.  I've only had it for less than a month.  The previous one lost Bluetooth capability and the earphone jack stopped working.  It's pretty much where we are today as far as "quality".
5,Works as a MP# player
5,Nice compact and easy to use
5,It has a nice light weight and it is comfortable in the hand.
5,very good quality for the money I definitely recommend this MP3 player.

5,Awesome battery life! Great sound quality! Easy to use! Love it!
5,Excellent product used for transfer music from itunes to MP3 Player.
5,Good product
5,Got this to load up songs for a cross country trip. Easy to use worked very well.
1,It would have been nice if this MP3 player actually played MP3 files.  The player worked for a short while then gave an error message that it couldn't read the MP3 files which is why I purchased it in the first place.  This is once again an example of CAVEAT EMPTOR!  However though we can't actually test the product before buying at least we WITH ASSURANCE can trust AMAZON to refund our purchase.
5,Product looks sleek easy to use and great product for the price
5,Good sound easy to use perfect for what I needed.
5,I will buy another one - good product for the price
5,Very well made- easy setup!
5,Good quality charged it 2 days ago and only used half of the battery life.
1,Got Mp3 player for our 10 yr old daughter bday. Shame on me for not checking to see if Mp3 player worked.Turns on then turns off. Does absolutely nothing else. So disappointing.  Normally I check anything I buy from Amazon. This time I let our kiddo open it which took about a month. Time to return had expired.  :/
5,Very streamlined would buy again
5,Arrived on time and looks very stylish
5,Very good MP3 PlayerEasy to use very ClearLooking goodI love ithighly recommended
5,Very nice love it
5,Works Great.
5,great mp3 player for the money worth every penny.
2,could not get it to work consistently.  instructions were vague
1,I bought this for ebooks. Did what is was supposed to when playing but I could not get it to put books where they should go in the book icon. The only drive that would show was recordings. I tried customer support and never heard from them. So sent it back.
1,I bought this and loaded my music and now plan on using it for the gym and it is telling me the format is not supported. Can someone please help me with this. I was not able to use this until now and now it will not support my music.
1,This device comes with several pages of instructions that are the most unhelpful and poorly translated from Chinese that I have ever seen. I spent two hours trying to figure out how to download music onto this device which the instructions though pages long unbelievably did not cover. I couldn't figure it out so I returned it. I went to their website and it had no support. I had to return it because it was unusable to me.
5,Was easy for me to download music and play music.
5,Awesome interface. Sleek design. Love it
5,Easy to operate and very user friendly.
1,Songs that were properly labeled in the mp3 file on my computer would come up as randomly named files on the player album folders would show up as "unknown" or various albums that had separate folders when copied to the player would end up all being in a folder in a hodgepodge.Finally when connected to bluetooth the keypad locks blocking you from changing songs or doing anything so long as connected to blue.
5,This works really well love it
5,easy navagation
5,Perfect for my 7 year old.
1,First time I have been burned by good reviews on Amazon.  Bought two for my daughter and I.  Both devices are now skipping during playback.  Now after a couple of weeks hers won't turn on.  Spend the extra money and get a better device.
5,Just received this Mp3 player. Will update the review if necessary.
5,just got the product. works great!!!
5,Exceeded all expectations! It’s awesome!
5,Great little mp3 for my 14 year old!!! She loves it
5,Everything came in perfect shape. Can’t wait to start putting it to use!
5,Battery life is outstanding! Works great great buy!
2,Absolutely nothing to like about this piece of junk .
5,Sound Quality
5,I love this device!
5,This product arrived quickly and safely an exceeded my expectations. Works perfectly. Highly recommend.
5,Nice product.
5,Easy to load big bright screen.  Very nice.
1,Not worth it. You get what you pay for :(Pros: Nice design 32 GB micro SDCons: Everything but the above :)It's WAY TOO QUIET even if you put your volume all the way upAlso there is no bass in the music when played on this junk. If I listen the same tracks on my 10 years old mp3player it sounds so much better and does have a bass.I am returning it and buying some better player probably will invest at least $100.
5,so fer no dislikes very nice
5,Better than I expectedplug and play
5,Nice little MP3 player!

5,Love this piece easy to use. Easy responsive touch screen.
1,My daughter loves this for the first few months. We had trouble adding more songs to her playlist. When connected to the computer it cannot recognize the device. We are now unable to add anymore songs. I have tried contacting the company however there has been no response. Very disappointed.
2,Difficult to load and select music.  Regret purchase.

5,Great sound loved the big screen and easy to read and use features.
5,Works great! Easy to use and our daughter loves it!
2,maybe I'm too used to other systems not smart enough to organise music on this device
5,Clean lines
1,Having used the player for less than 10 times and placed in a drawer after 6 month disc error no manual to troubleshoot what could have caused problem. It sat in drawer because the slightest touch would change music or if while using the control were confusing and not intuitive. Not happy with this product
5,Overall great quality reasonable price!

5,MP3 Sound very good.
5,So far so good.No complaintsVery Happy with this product
1,The first time I connected it to my computer it froze and I was unable to access it at all.  I returned that item and received an exchange.  It appeared to work well and would play music until I connected headphones. When I did it stated that it could not play mp3 music in that format.  I tried bluetooth and wired headphones with no success.  I strongly recommend you not purchase this product.
5,Works great! Big improvement on my previous MP3 player.
5,Exactly what I was looking for in an mp3!
5,The sound could be much loader
5,Great battery life and sound quality. Very easy to use!

5,Works greatWould buy again
5,Quick and speedy
5,Great product
1,I bought this in late October/ early November. My daughter just started to use it now and it constant freezes.  Not just once in awhile but all the time. Piece of junk. I will never buy this product or this brand ever again.
1,Regardless of features etc.  You are limited to a volume that the manufacturer finds adequate and doesn't necessarily care that you might have much better headphones earbuds etc. rather than the P.O.S. earbuds they enclose which aren't worth a dime.  The player as it doesn't output enough power to drive quality headphones or earbuds etc.  Manufacturer refused to help!There are much better ones out there.  Buy Them!
5,For  running
5,Like it so far. Perfect for my kid.
5,Very easy to use and great sound quality
5,Works exactly as I wanted!
5,Great quality for the price!
2,Functionality difficulty; poor software design. Unable to play mp4 format
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This mp3 player is sleek and sound is good. Definitely would buy another.
2,Directions too confusing
5,Great price and arrived on time. Am really enjoying this player.
5,Purchased for running works great for what I need.
5,Great product! Easy to use!!

5,Great sound quality and nice design!
5,Great MP3 player!
5,I love this MP3 player. Money well spent.
5,It works as it should
1,Will NOT accept audio from any source.  Manual interface is clumsy at best but there's no way to load music onto it and pair it with any of my bluetooth accessory speakers.Supposed to be top of the heap and doesn't work at all.  And customer support is non existent.
1,Bought this item for my son's birthday. What a disappointment! Never abled to turn on this MP3 player. Missed the window to return it. Don't waste your money on this product.
5,Walking!  Sound quality is great! good
5,used for jogging and walking
1,Keeps crashing I have to constantly hold the power button to restart it I maybe get to listen to one or too songs before it does it again and it keeps telling me disc error when I trying to click on music was not worth it
5,easy to connect to blue tooth...very good sound
5,User interface is easy to navigate and intuitive
5,It works very fast and it’s a great sound quality.
5,easy to use
5,Good user interface. Good battery life. Good sound quality.
5,Has been a good mp3 player
5,Great quality in a small package.
5,Great device.  Easiest to use yet for me.
1,First product I’ve ordered thru Amazon that was terrible. Not Amazon’s fault but fault goes to manufacturer. Terribly difficult setup and I even went to my socially savvy children and they were perplexed!
5,Small size that will fit everywhere easy to read instructions
5,Amazing device - saved lots of space on my phone
2,Poor design no AI bugs in software. Almost junk.
5,small size but big capacity and great sound quality
5,Love it
5,Works well have all my favorite music on it.
1,Dies fast and can't play loud Bluetooth or on a speaker with auxiliary cord not to happy about this item
5,Easy to upload music easy to use and light weight.
5,Awesome little MP3 player. My kid loves it.
1,This Mp3 player has such a cumbersome and finicky interface. Finding the songs and playing them is very cumbersome. Bluetooth connection drops sometimes. Sound quality is pathetic. Just to turn on and off is sometimes challenging with the touch interface. Cannot recommend this Mp3 player to anyone.
5,Great product! Grandson loves it
2,Records randomly in the middle of songs...not worth it
1,I really hate reviewing stuff but this MP3 player is crap.  It only worked for three months before it started acting up.  Now it displays "disk error" and is unusable.  I had better luck with the plastic $15 MP3 players from walmart.  Do yourself a favor and look for different one.
5,Great glad I choose to upgrade to this
5,Very user friendly and easy to use.
5,Love the sound quality The battery is great.
5,A+
5,what I was looking for
5,all things considering its well worth it
5,Perfect for my husband’s runs
5,Easy to use. Great gift for my kid
5,Love it! Affordable and great quality!
5,Works good!
5,Sound is good
5,when extrusive and play golf bluetooth works great !
5,Has the basic features you need nice and sleek
1,Knowing what I know about this unit now I would not pay $5 for it.  The sound is simply no good.  Have tried with multiple earphones (including a $200 pair that wound GREAT on everything else) simply no good.  Also there is a clearly audible and VERY IRRITATING electronic sound in the background whenever I play quiet songs.  If you need a decent player look elsewhere.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Terrible build quality.All these reviews are here because the seller provides a 30 dollar amazon gift card in 3xchange for a review.The back cover came off very easily and when I tried to put it back on the connecters broke leaving the device without a back cover.The OS is as if it's from a flip phone circa 2001.Do not buy there are better built mp3 players out there.
5,Quick shipment great included accessories quality build.
5,Works
5,I liked it
5,nice product that does what it says
5,Got a great price works exactly as intended lots of storage
5,Jumping for joy.
1,Only used it several times when the power button fell inside the unit and would not retrtact!  Don't like the folder and storage features much.  More complicated than it should be!  Good luck!  Looks nice but poor quality electronics.
2,Bluetooth does not work
1,I tried so hard to move music from Windows Media Player to this device to no avail. All the music was painstakingly synced and appeared to go to the MP3 player. When I went to check the device only 3 albums were there. I asked a question here and the response was “Go in to your music in pc and copy and paste to the player.” As far as I can see that’s not an option. Sorry it’s just not working for me and I will return it.
1,So disappointed. Was really hoping I would find an MP3 player for my girls and not have to pay over $200 but I guess you get what you pay for these days.
2,The Bluetooth does not work that good
5,Love the drop-in option for adding music.
5,good mp3 player nice looking money well spent
5,No frills MP3 player that works great.
5,Quality product that is easy to use.
5,Sound is kinda lowbut everything else is great.Quality built.
5,My daughter loves it. Easy to use.
5,Great music player
5,Works great! Very easy to use
5,It was perfect my daughter loved it❤
5,It is really good
5,Use for music.  Easy.
1,I have a 2018 Equinox and this player would not play. It would connect to it but you could not hear anything. Returned it.
5,Nice MP3 player. Very happy with product.
5,Very happy with this mp3 player!!
5,Just wish they had included a lanyard.
5,Great product
5,I like everything about it.
5,Worked as advertised
5,Awso.e
5,Like
5,It's amazing
5,love it
5,Sound quality
1,I bought this in hopes to transfer the songs I’ve purchased through iTunes over the years. Obviously it doesn’t support AAC files or at least I couldn’t figure out how to properly get songs on this thing. The instruction manual was in Broken English and it only supported the Micro SD card it came with. The 128 GB Micro SD card I ordered to go with it wouldn’t stay in and kept ejecting. Cheap for a reason.
2,Very difficult to download on. Several computer experts have tried to help
5,Easy to use. Nice clear screen
2,Difficult to get music onto. Instructions included are terrible. Just buy another product.
5,Great MP3 player
5,Very slick design light easy to use.
1,Got this for work because you can not use phone or head phone’s.  Bluetooth would not connect. When using the USB the sound was so quit I could not hear a thing.  You can only have 3 playlist . Regret this purchase.
5,good sound easy to use
5,like the size and quality
1,I bought this MP3 player because the reviews were so good.  This thing has been a nightmare.  I can't organize the music into playlists I can't correct things that were uploaded poorly . . . what a disappointment.  Its going back ASAP.
5,Good
1,No user manual.  When I finally found out how to turn it on it immediately started recording and I couldn't stop it.  Don't know how to charge it or load music onto it or use it.  Returned it same day I got it.
5,Great mp3 player easy to use
1,It freezes up when you try to play mp3 music. Waste of money
5,Love this product!
5,I love it.
1,I bought this to put my Christmas music on because my new car doesn’t have a CD player and I didn’t want Christmas music on my phone. I used it for 1 month and now it won’t charge or even turn on.
1,Used for running. On/off switch broke after 2nd use. Unhappy customer. I do not recommend this product
1,It broke down just 22 days after the end of the 60 day return policy.  It was never dropped and was kept in it's case when not in use. Buyer Beware!
5,My 12 year old loves this!
1,Got this charged it up loaded up some mp3's and low and behold it doesn't support mp3 format files. Then it was constantly freezing up. I would steer clear of this one. I bought it as a gift now having to buy another player.
5,Great
5,Holds a lot of tunes!
1,The worst part of this product is that after about a week I was not able to shut it off with the power button. Prior to that it would occasionally skip in the middle of a song to another song.
5,Great item
1,We purchased two and neither worked. In one the audio jack didn't work. In the other the screen didn't work.
5,The touch screen is a little picky
5,My son loves it thanks!
5,Look nice
5,Purchased for use at work
5,Battery life and sound quality great
1,I bought this device because it advertises the ability to play WMA files.  I does not play any of mine.  Lying has become very common among sellers of personal electronics.  But I don't like being lied to.  So I rated it one star.
5,A great product!
5,Easy to manage and fast delivery
5,mostly only used it for music. good sound quality. easy to use.
1,sound quality is ok and I've had no problem loading it with albums and audio books but sound limit is pre-set to 31 which is worthless for many situations.  Hubs tried to use it riding his cycle but engine noise overrides anything you're listening to.  I'm going to donate to Goodwill and look for another brand.
2,Did not include armband in box like advertised.it was missing
1,Died after 5 months of use. Not worth buying. Not sure if this is covered by warranty. What else would you like to hear?
1,Shortly after the return window closed the unit started "stuttering" while playing music. Doesn't matter whether bluetooth or internal speaker. Contacted Amazon and jumped through the hoops no dice on repairing it or an exchange. Don't waste your money move on from this unit!
5,Quick delivery quality product
5,Good quality
1,The instruction manual gave no directions on how to download music - my complete reason for my purchase. I tried researching on my own looking for apps and tips but after several days of trying to no avail  I decided to return this product back to Amazon.
1,This is the worst mp3 never buy
5,It’s very nice.
1,How in the world would you explain an 8 y/o child that Santa brought her a damaged unit and now we need to ship it back so that the elves could fix it?"Daddy why does the return label say Amazon?" Doh!In any case the unit was defective the audio is only working in one ear. Tried 3 different headphones. Perhaps the audio connector on the unit is damaged.Doesn't matter. Never again.
5,Great Product
5,Such a good product I recommend it
5,Great product large memory capacity nice functions very enjoyable
5,Exactly what I was expecting.
1,When unit is plugged into computer it is supposed to be recognized so you can drag and drop music to it. I cannot get computer to recognize this device no matter what I try. I have several other devices that are recognized and work properly on this drive.
1,It’s not intuitive. I can’t figure out how to download music onto it. I let it sit around too long because I don’t have hours to work on it so now I can’t return it. Stuck with a co fusing device without comprehensive instructions.
5,Used it to hold my songs
1,As nice as this MP3 player is I cant even use it.  I tried every way possible to add songs to it and it didnt work.  It wouldnt sync with anything.  We tried the co piter cell phone and tablet and couldnt get our songs on it.  I had to buy an Ipod and now have an MP3 player I cant do anything with.
5,Perfect for what I needed
5,son loves it
5,Works great. Would buy again!
2,I sent it back. unable to transfer my You Tube music library from my computer to the device.
5,Delivered quickly. Easy set up.
5,It works excellently.
1,The bluetooth is absolutely garbage! I contacted seller and they would not refund or warranty! Basically told me to pound sand. I've tried everything and the 5.0 blue tooth is a joke. It keeps cutting in and out and terrible during a workout. Look somewhere else trust me.
1,Downloaded 35 songs then quit. Been emailing with product support for over a week and they are not helpful. Do not buy this product.
5,seems to work fine to me
5,Works great and the sound is perfect
1,Tried connecting to Bluetooth to my car and it does not work very dissatisfied spent a lot of money on this device and a lot of time to download all of the music from my car and it don’t work and it says it’s Bluetooth
1,I returned it. It downloaded music fine but it wouldn't support or play the music files. It also kept freezing on me and I'd have to restart it. Going to look for a different MP3 player.
5,Prefect for my daughter!
5,Good product
1,I'm okay with it not being compatible with iTunes but when I tried to add mp3 files by dragging them to the disk file it jumbled up the order of the files (despite the fact that the files were numbered). I ordered this MP3 player to listen to coursework while driving and the files must be in sequential order if coursework is to be understood. Waste of money.
5,it work well
1,The menu is in Japanese and can be changed..IF you can read Japanese. Although it found my heaphones all it ever said was "Please wait" and never did manage to lock on to ANYTHING. not my headphones not my girlfriends my car stereo nothing. It DID play MP3's but only into plug in headphones. The IS no customer service so answering any question from the manufacterer is impossible.
5,Perfect for what I needed
2,No volume buttonShould be touch screen
5,i like it very
5,Radio for my motorcycle
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Music
1,I spent almost an hour downloading iTunes (M4A) files only to get the message "file format not supported for bt playback."  It is possible to listen to these files on the earbuds or on the small internal speaker.
5,So far so good love it
5,Works well
5,Nice little MP3 player!
2,Difficult to load with data.  Poor instructions.  Hard to read display.
5,in vehicle

I cannot play anything power it off or push any buttons. Even when I take the memory card out nothing happens.
5,ease of use

5,Excellent product.
5,Easy to use
1,NO STARS!!!! RIP OFF OF A PRODUCT!!!
5,My husband loves his mp3 player
1,To sum it all up this MP3 player is garbage. #Return back to sender!!!
5,Husband very happy with prodcut
5,Great
1,I couldn’t even use this product it froze every time I want to play a MP3 file I never even got to use it this is a piece of trash I can’t believe I even bought it
5,Nice simple easy to use
5,Good
1,It arrived completely dead.  No light to show it's charging.  Won't turn on.  Very disappointing - I bought it for a barn party we're having where we don't have internet access.  Now I have to go to Walmart because it's too late to order another one.
5,I love it.
5,Thanks
5,Ease of use and quality
5,Very easy to use
5,Excellant product tastefully designed...
5,Love it!
1,My sole purpose in purchasing this bluetooth mp3 player was to connect it to my car's bluetooth system which unfortunately it does not. I would not recommend this item if you plan on using the bluetooth in your car.
2,This product would not upload the music files I wanted to upload/
5,Great product!
5,Very good product
5,It seems good
1,Mal producto mala conexión bluetooth. Lo devolví y ordené otro igual y no funciona  la pantalla se queda en blanco .
5,Good sounds
5,I liked everything.
5,Absolutely Awesome MP3 player!
1,This is not as simple to use as they would have you believe. The instructions that come with it do not really explain anything pertinent with setting it up. Mine would only power on when it wanted to (even after fully charged). Plus when connected to laptop it might or might not pop up for me to work with. Almost impossible to download music when the device is so temperamental. Will definitely be returning it!
1,Will not connect to Bluetooth speakers.  User interface poor. Speakers and volume need help. No help online or email did not answer my email. WISH I waited for the Sony Walkman® NW-A55.
5,Excellent Bluetooth
5,Good sound quality
5,Great product. Love it for work.
1,The product was a excellent MP3 it work pretty fine for about two or three days and then it completely died for no reason the screen doesn't illuminate and the battery only lasts but 3 hours I'm sorry to say that it doesn't work anymore I will ask for my money back but the process of return is too hectic
5,love it
2,Very difficult to load mp3 files
1,I waited for few months before I write a review.  This is a really bad mp3 player. I used it only for few months then it stopped working. I DO NOT recommend buying this.
5,Really nice device!!
5,Very Good
5,Very easy to use!
5,Very nice
1,don't like the fact that ounce the langue is set .You can not go back and reset it to the langue you wont. The sound quality is not great. Down loaded music. the titles are in English ..But it's set-to the wrong langue because I happen to touch the wrong icon. At start up it is not in English. Now I have to guess what things are. Tossed it and purchased a Sony.
5,GOOD PRODUCT
5,Great
1,The button lights are super bright and too focused.  It looks nothing like the picture.  The lights don't give an even illumination on the button.The UI is slow.  I press pause and nothing happens then I press it again and it pauses then starts playing.You get what you pay for I guess.  This will be going back.
5,Excelente
1,Stopped working after my 10th use. Sounds like a skipping record. Pure junk.
5,Loved everything
1,this thing is total crap it wont keep a charge even if its charged for 8+ hours. it wont work with any earphones bluetooth or corded it wont let me see but a fraction of the music ive put onto it and the instructions also dont tell you how to work it
5,Good product
1,Literally a piece of junk!It's a tad bigger than my pinky finger.  Nothing like advertises. Impossible to connect to anything.  For as much money as this was I'm extremely disappointed.
5,Love the product
1,I bought this product thinking that it would be great. Number one seller good price great reviews. It is great right? But no. My computer can format songs correctly but the mp3 player itself would not take any of the formats that it was supposed to be able to take. Amazon bust not worth your money.
5,Great music player! Son loves it!
5,Great
5,Love it
1,This thing is a bunch of JUNK.  I only had it for 8 months and the back fell off.  The clips failed.  I will never buy this product again.
5,Mp3
1,Built cheap compared to the SOULCKER mp3 player. The SOULCKER has built in memory with an expandable slot. THIS player has no internal storage. only SD memory.  the back panel is not flush on one side I couldn't ignore it. Oh Well.
5,Great product
1,Advertised as having 8 hours of play time it does not. Can’t load songs by connecting to computer I have to eject the SIM card put that in my computer load songs then reinsert SIM card in device. It’s cheap and it works just not as advertised and more complicated than it needs to be.
5,Good Product
5,Works perfect
5,great product
5,Great product
1,Poor bluetooth range and the record switch on the side gets caught going in and out of your pocket causing disconnection.  Too late for me to return it. You get what you pay for bit me on this one.  Treat yourself better and pay for quality.
5,Fast shipping
1,Piece of junk did not last 1 month loaded 20  songs on it and  would not turn back on
1,I just bought this mps a few weeks ago & i'm already having issues with the headphone jack. If the headphone pluck moves slightly in the jack the sound cuts off.
1,Edit: well it turns out that this player corrupted the sd card that I put into it.I like the size. Easy to use. Sound volume is too limited in that the maximum is too low. Sound quality is average.
1,I used this player for a couple of months and was pretty happy with it until it died.  I don't recommend buying one.
1,Advertised as 5.0 Bluetooth version but the music drops out around six feet of receiver. Not what I was expecting so I am returning. Another cheap toy from… you guessed it… China
1,Bought this for my son for Christmas and of course he didn't try to use it until well past the return deadline. It won't connect to any of our computers or laptops so there's no way to download music onto it. Waste of money!
1,I changed my mind from 5 stars to 1star . The bluetooth sound is way to low even at max volume. otherwise Easily readable touch buttons with symbols large enough for even older folks to read. Easy to follow instructions. Well designed MP3 player.
2,would not recommend
1,Very cryptic instructions (and typical poor translation to English) buttons unreliable(!) no setup instructions(!) above all: after trial and error trying to set it up and fully charged the device went dead and left me with no choice other than returning it. How this device passed the "Amazon test" (if there is one) is incomprehensible. Do yourself a favor and skip this item!
1,The screen quit working 30 days after purchase. I can not control the device. it is a paperweight now.No product should quit working because of inferior craftsmanship.I received a replacement and the speaker cut out. it works with external speakers but not the speaker with the device. JUNK JUNK JUNK
2,It was a good product.
1,I even had others that have had mp3 players before and they couldn't get to the interface either. It simply dont work
2,Instructions very complicated
1,Would love to be able to use this as size is perfect...however there are no instructions on how to operate and I have tried several times to no avail.  And NO customer support number listed....
5,Nice product
1,When ever the item was turned off/on you would have to resync it. Maybe defective maybe not. Just returned it.
2,Not user friendly
1,When I connect this MP3 player via bluetooth to a speaker or headphones the sound is muddy with little treble.  I know it is not the speaker or headphones because both of those sound much better with a different MP3 player.  On top of that the external speaker on this MP3 is terrible.
1,I don't understand these good reviews. Maybe they were "unbiased reviews" in exchange for receiving a free player? For $40 this player was cheap and junky plastic. It felt like a toy. It completely died on the first day of use - powered off and would not turn on again in spite of being fully charged. Very disappointing.
1,No touch screenCan't keep track of your last location.The location of the hole for strap is awkward.Max volume is too quiet.Limited Video format
1,Started out fine but within a month already has a short where you plug in headphones.
5,Easy directions
5,Fantastic!!
1,This MP3 player appeared to have a good rating at the time of purchase. It froze up on me in 2 weeks and was totally inoperable. The connection to bluetooth earbuds was not too stable.
2,Won’t Bluetooth to car
1,This device no longer will power on so if you want to spend 40+ dollars for less than 6 month use go for it. Now it does not even power on.
1,Lol y’all don’t do this. It’s not a good purchase the price is the price for a reason like this is not what you need. Keep on scrolling! The screen is weird the interface is strange. Like don’t.
2,The sound output was very low and poor I returned it
1,Tinny sound no bass on any equalizer mode low volume.  Returned it for a refund.
1,Whoever packed the box replaced the mp3 player with an arm band mp3 player holder. I bought an mp3 player and got the usb cable ear buds and arm holder for the mp3 player but no mp3 player. It was supposed to be a birthday gift. So mad
5,Love it
1,Will randomly disconnect and reconnect to blue tooth. Will turn on repeat and repeat 2 seconds of the song over and over.
1,I was really hoping to love this product. I even added all my songs and was about to go for a walk using it. I turned it on and all my songs I had added the day before would not play. It kept having an error message. I had to return.
1,Headphone jack was broken on the 3rd use. Only played out of one earphone. Unfortunately missed the return window because I took the player to a 30 day inpatient rehab where I didn’t have any contact with the outside world.
1,It wouldn’t even let me transfer music!
1,Limited storage. I got this to play when I exercise.  But it has low storage even when I use the SD card no matter the size of the SD card. This mp3 player won't do the job.
1,It did NOT operate at all. I returned already.  I am glad the amazon has easy return system.
1,It's small and looks cool but when it comes to downloading music from a laptop or jump drive there aren't any directions.  Any kind of directions on this subject aren't covered in the user guide.  I would not purchase this product nor would I recommend it to anyone.
2,not as good as sony
1,Dont like this player the volume doesn't stay where it is supposed to and if you do you have to stay on volume and you can't change anything and if you do the volume gos down pretty much
1,Extensive instructions don't mention how to copy music files to device.  Connecting cable only occasionally lets computer recognize device files do not copy over. Returning.
2,Hard to operate.
1,I was unable to get the device to work and will be sending it back.The instructions were not clear and customer support was non existent.  When I attached the device to my computer the computer did not acknowledge my device.
5,easy to use
1,After using it one time it now says "Disk Error" and won't play anything. We threw away the packaging so we can't return. Waste of money.
1,Literally broke in 6 weeks.  Came apart and the screen / electronics are ruined.  I didn't drop it or anything- it just stopped working and started coming apart on its own.
1,This item freezes up after only 5 uses. Does not work.
1,WAS OUT OF RETURN DATE BUT AMAZON STILL ARRANGED RETURN ............ SO THANKFULL TO AMAZON FOR JUMPING IN. as the 32GB Mp3 Player with Bluetooth 5.0 - Portable Digital Lossless Music Player seems unfixable.RG
2,The sound is really low.
1,My daughter very much loves it and so far has no complaintsUpdate 2/4/21: Bluetooth barely works. My daughter can't use headphones and when listening to the FM radio station it's mostly static even though we live in town. I'm not very happy especially since it's quality was so short lived.
1,Sound quality is good but it is very difficult to load music on the device.
1,Nothing to like stop working after setting up the player. Stay away from this company and anything made in China.
1,It worked ok until the head phone jack broke
1,So far not satisfied with this MP3 player plugged it into my computer all I get is a file that says USB can't figure out how to transfer playlist from Windows Media player to this player can't create playlists on MP3 player itself not very satisfied.
1,El sonido no es tan bueno
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Not what i expected now after barely a month. The product start to freeze. Anything that i touch doesn't work or respond. I want my money back
1,Would not connect to my Apple AirPods or anything else in my house. I sent an email to support for help and they didn’t respond.
1,Fraud!!!!There’s a card for 30$ amazon bonus ONLY IF YOU REVIEW IT WITH FIVE STARS! It’s a massive waste of time. I bought it due to the review rating only to discover that the thing is slower than molasses once being used as a MP3 player.
1,Received it and it did not last 30 minutes before the screen went black and never came back on and it was fully charged. The numbers lit up but the screen just stopped working. I would give it half a star if I could
1,Very difficult to connect with my Sony Xb 30 apeakers and when I could finally get music to play it would cut in and out.  Could not transfer mp3 files from my computer to the unit.
1,Instructions are bad. Loaded songs after I figured out how on my own. Volume control is absolutely stupid. Tech support had no idea how to use it. Using this for two songs was totally aggravating. Deleted my music and sent it back the same day.
1,the screen wont last for a day
1,the MP3 earphone connection stops working after a month they don't have a phone number where you can call them and amazon denies to help you save your money and buy something that is worth it.
1,Sound quality was good however the user interface is too hard to use. The bluetooth connection needs to be manually connected every time it does not remember the last connection like most devices. Volume controls only work when you find the song playing and highlight that selection.
1,Just received this and I am definitely returning it. At it's brightest setting I can not see any of the menu options in the daylight. User manual is pathetic as well.
1,Arrived broken. Music skips unless its sitting on flat surface. I got this device to go walking and every step I took it kept skipping. Not really happy with this product.
1,Have had this only three and a half months. Bluetooth while moving was awful. Now it is giving me a disk error and so no longer operates. This is with very light usage. Maybe it felt neglected....
1,NO WAY TO  PUT .mp3 MUSIC ON THIS THING  A HUGE TIME WASTER & DISSAPPOINTMENT!NOBODY WOULD BUY SOMETHING CALLING ITSELF AN .mp3 PLAYER WHEN THERE IS NO WAY TO GET TOANY .mp3  MUSIC FILES!CRIKEY!
1,The product is worthless!!! I got it because amazon recommended it!!! It can connect to a device & its blue tooth signal is worthless. All you people are incredible selling CRAP!!!!# SHAME ON YOU ALL!!!!!!
1,Product failed after 8 weeks of very light use so could not seek refund from Amazon Volume difficult to manipulate and volume level at 31 indicated too faint for many situations like running or gym. Disappointing looked good on paper
4,it's not actually that bad for being a cheap dingus mp3 player the inbuilt speaker is crap but if you have any sense you'll get earbuds for it (the included earpod knockoffs arent too great either)
1,zero stars do not buy this product.  played for a while then shut itself off...maybe I got a dud...got replacement and same thing
1,The instructions are uselessIt is totally unfriendly no instructions provided for adding music for editing playlist IT IS TERRIBLEarmband was listed as included but there was no armband in the package.do not waste your money.
1,It was working only seven days. I am thankful to Amazon for easy returns.
1,This would only play out of 1 side of the speakers either 1 headphone or 1 side of the car's audio.  It is a piece of junk and a waste of money!
2,As above
1,Within 3 months the audio jack stopped working properly; it only comes through the left channel with working stereo ear buds. And the return/replace policy is a hopeless run around.
1,This piece of garbage does not work and should be removed from Amazon’s list.
1,Beautiful and easy to work with the controls buuut my laptop wouldn't recognize the device. I tried for HOURS to get it to connect and it wouldn't so I returned it.
1,It sounds great and plays well when it plays.  Constantly freezes up and stops and will not shut down with the power button.  Must leave for hours until it shuts down itself.
1,earphone jack plug in broke in less then a year.  DON'T BUY!!!!
1,Haven't had this very long at all. Maybe 2 months...and it keeps freezing and won't play mucus. Not happy with it at all
1,Received replacement and it works great. Must have originally received a dud.
1,couldn't find on my computer and the screen froze up.
1,I cannot begin to imagine why a company does not spport its products or èrrovide a website for any customer help. The volume parameters and physical control access for this player are inadequate as well. It is being returned forthwith.
1,I have been trying off and on for 3 days to get this working. Instructions are lacking. I have yet to be able to set the darned thing up to play music.
1,Too hard to use directions inadequate would not synch so could not download audio books or music
1,I liked this player while it was operational but it died after 5 weeks and of course not returnable to Amazon. Tried to reset but it didn't work.
1,Touch pad quite working
1,So they sell it but you can’t load Audible books on it. After spending 1 1/2 hours with their support team that’s the conclusion they reached. Nice job Amazon
1,After less than a month.. I no longer get sound on my left ear. I’ve tried the same earbuds elsewhere and they work fine. I’ve tried different earbuds and the same problem happens. Don’t bother buying.
1,The directions to download music onto the player is not clear and I still have no idea how to do this. It's already been a few months since I've purchased this. Super disappointed.
1,This is awful. I can't navigate this product at all. The directions are not helpful. I want to return this.
1,Very unhappy.  Directions nonexistent.  No way to download music or transfer without some unknown software.  Manual nowhere on the web.Likely returning..
1,I bot the player and still cant figure out how to use it.  Cant get it to sink to my computer so I cant record stuff therefore I cant use it.............
1,Same day it arrived was the same day it was useless. As I downloaded my music to the mp3 player it stopped working with a "disc error" message. Didn't have a chance to listen to music.
1,First it would not hold a charge then it would not recharge and finally it would not turn on.  No where could I find a phone number to call the company.  I sent it back to Amazon.
1,I got it on a Sunday used it for Monday and part of Tuesday at work got a disk read error before lunch and returned it Wednesday.
1,This player garbles about every third or forth song played back. It clears  up but continually repeats garbling songs.
1,It would be nice to change the size of the screen text. To small to read without glasses. Bluetooth was cumbersome at times
1,Terrible sound quality. It has lots of memory easy to load problem is you can barely hear it. I thought it was the headphones then I tried it on better quality headphones and it was just as bad.
1,After downloading music it played 30.seconds of 1 song and then stopped playing.  Very poor quality.I wouldn't reccomend in buying this mp3 player  because  its junk!! What a waste of my $39.99!!!
1,If you use a Macbook this is a waste of your time. Customer service is via email and is conducted somewhere outside the U.S. I'm sure. (You wont get a same day response.)
1,will not sync with blue tooth speaker.will not play "playlist" only "all song"would return if i still had packing info.
1,Too many complications downloading music files. Once files were downloading it said it could not read file. Waste of time and money especially for the cost.
1,We have had it only a week and it isn't holding a charge. We have to keep it plugged in to use it.
1,The device stopped working before 90 days and Amazon is refusing to replace even though it says free 90 day coverage.
1,Super frustrating trying to convert iTunes music to this format. It would work one time and then not read the files at all so I returned it
1,I plugged it into my Windows computer the device lit up but nothing showed up on my files or folders. No way to transfer music. Couldn’t try it. Doesn’t work at all
1,thing quit working after 2 days.  now its stuck on and cant change anything and wont even turn off.
1,This came with no instructions as to how to get songs downloaded onto the device and the website you were told to go to for help doesn't exist. I might as well have bought a doorstop. Useless. Had to return it.
1,This product has a lot of features but in the end it is too confusingAlso advertised to play FLAC files and the unit I received could not
1,Charged it one time and it flaked out . Will not even turn on. RETURNING FOR A REFUND. Do Not Want a replacement!
1,It froze up within the first 10 minutes of me getting it out of the box
1,Bluetooth only seemed to work when about a foot from the ear buds. Made it unusable
1,Still in the box! I could not interpret the instructions! I am not a high tech person so I just couldn't figure anything out. I need simple plain english instructions!
1,It looks fine. It does not hold a charge! It is difficult to navigate unless you're a 20 year old techy. The owner's manual is useless.
1,You set a radio station and all you got is static
1,It looks slick and clean but it freezes and doesn't play  the music downloaded
1,Decent enough sound quality but the battery only lasted about 4 hours before it died on me and then I couldn't get it to charge at all after only one use.
1,Does not work with windows. Windows does not recognize it so files cant be moved. Waste of money and time. Merry Christmas! more made in china knock off nonsense. I should have known
1,Piece of crap don't waste your money didn't even last 2 weeks. Cheap cheap and beyond cheap!
1,Lasted a only a few months.  Display not visible outdoors.
1,Worked for about a month then went completely dead. Bluetooth function rarely worked. You get what you pay for. Stay away
1,It stopped responding after the first few minutes. Complete crap. Just worthless.
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift and after only 2 weeks of using it the device simply stopped working. Now all it will do is display the welcome screen.
1,Did not play the files uploaded/ freezes/ I could not get a refund or return
1,Broken even before I finish listening to 1 song!DO NOT BUY!
1,This is useless as I cannot see any of folders when connected to a PC windows 10 unable to transfer audio books or music waste of money you buy you cry.
1,Stopped working / Charging after a month.
1,It's not working after 2 dayes
1,I've used the headphones three times and now only get sound out of one side. Tried with other headphones the jack is the problem.
1,This MP3 player is not user friendly. It is difficult to get to the main menu and after a week it stopped working.
1,Hard to set up as described by many users. Bought it in April and it died in May. Not a good buy.
1,Absolutely horrible!! My grand daughter couldn’t even download music on this!! A waste of $40 dollars!! That she earned to buy this!!
1,FM radio function is not Bluetooth. Requires plug in headphones
1,It would always freeze on me. Disliked this product.
1,The shipment was incomplete the instructions are hard to read
4,YO I love this mp3 its the  best mp3 player I've ever owned
1,Very difficult to put books on it. Definitely NOT user friendly. If it wasn't past the return date I would return it
1,Worst buying experience I've ever had. Couldn't get it to work nor could anyone else to whom I showed it
1,Ok at best you get what you pay for. Bluetooth does not work with my car. Limited features on devices can’t change properties on mp5 files.
1,Not user friendlyfiles got mixed up when uploadingReally unhappy about this purchase
1,Avoid this product.  The only good thing about it was the ease of returning it.
1,Wow. I thought I loved this player at first. Then I dropped it like two feet. Never worked again. Plus I never got my rebate. WTF!
1,Sound when it was working
1,Screen lacks brightness...and cannot be read outdoors.............Font size is so small it requires magnification.......save your money ... cannot recommend it .....to anyone.
1,Sound only came out from 1 earbud only after 1 month after purchase...
1,Junk do not buy.  Good luck when it stops working with trying to get help from them or amazon
1,Randomly turns off. If it does stay on long enough it will not repeat the playlist.
1,The sound does not work at all!!! This was to be a gift for my wife!!!  Stop selling JUNK like this!!!!
1,Garbage. Terrible quality. This is a piece of junk. Never worked properly and then it broke.
1,If I could return it I would
1,Would not work. Sent it back.
1,it just records sound nothing cant get it to work right . sucks
1,Even the set up instructions lack proper review and contain errors in translation.  Let China sell that thing in China.  I tossed it in the trash.
1,After several emails with customer support was unable to get the audiobook playlist to play in order. Which makes this item useless to me. I would not recommend this unit
1,This player keeps locking up. It is pretty much done agter first week.
5,This is my first time writing an Amazon review but this product was just so good that I had to. AIWORTH customer service was incredible as well. They helped me twice when my device had problems (headphone jack static interface) and both times got the device up and working within 2 days of receiving the email. The battery life lasts literally forever. I only have to charge it less than once a month. The sound is pretty loud and exactly the same as how I download it. The interface is clear and easy to use.BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is incredible and so is its customer service!
1,Sound quality is terrible and it does not bluetooth to headphones.  Only a speaker I bought this to use as I workout.  Its not as expected
1,Completely stopped working after 6 weeks 2 weeks after the return window. What a waste! Do not buy this one!
1,Mediocre piece of equipment that broke with light wear. Not worth the money.
1,This item is over priced doesn't work right when I charge it freezes up it's to complicated
1,Was unable to download my music frommy computer.
1,I bought this for my daughter and could not download my own music on it. Not easy to use.
1,Save your money..
1,Ready to send it back.  The one I received is defective - computer cannot recognize it and keeps saying error on it.
1,Complicated
1,Does not work with car Bluetooth.  Witch is why I bought it.  Only works with Bluetooth speakers
1,Poor instructions hard to use. Would not play music when connected to blue tooth only through headphones. I returned them. But cheap buy twice.
1,Headphones thing broke after a couple days. Only right side works. Threw it away. Tried with 2 different headphones.
1,Bluetooth won't work and volume won't turn up very loud.
1,The player does not allow the volume to exeed 31 which is too low if you are listening with headphones in a gym or other places where there is background noise. Too bad. But trust me volume limit is a problem.
1,Sold refurbished broken item I still have to waste my time to return it.
1,Unable to download music from computer would connect and disconnect. Radio did not work. DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!
1,Out of the box it did not work. Screen dim. difficult to operate.

1,MP3 is very choppy. Music breaks up when you move it
1,Having the FM feature is all I wanted in this little device.  It works NO WHERE.

1,Haven't been able to use. Don't know how to download mp3 music

1,worked 4 months warranty 3.  can not get the seller to respond.

1,No longer charging. I have to my daughter for Christmas.  Will be returning.
1,No where on the information did say not compatible with apple yet they pronounce loudly compatible with iTunes. Returned
3,Got this as a gift last summer. It did the job connected with Bluetooth when I needed it to and it was easy enough to add songs. After a couple months though random white lines started appearing at the center of the screen eventually rendering the player unusable. Not worth the money.
1,The audio that comes out is horribly low
1,Does not play .wav files even though the description claims it does.
1,Was nothing like I expected for the price very basic and sooo 2009 🙄
1,You get what you pay for!! Froze after two days of mild use.

1,Horrible it didn’t work
1,To much interference with other WiFi connections! Sent it back!
4,UPDATE: Aiworth contacted me and offered to give me either a refund or new MP3 player.I opted for a new one received it a few days later. So far so good! This audio jack works fine.The player is overall really nice for the price. The interface is...functional. But the sound is verygood when using quality earphones or Bluetooth buds. Definitely pick it up on sale. Solid 4 stars!Let me start off by saying this MP3 player is actually pretty good when used with Bluetooth earbuds.It's the fact that the earphone jack went POOF after a few days that's forcing me to give it 1 star.At first it was the right channel it died almost immediately. Then left one followed. So now...only silence.I tried a half-dozen wired earphones and none of them give me any sound with this device. Sometimes being wired is the most convenient and reliable way to go. Well that's not an option anymore. It's Bluetooth or nothing; well the mono internal speaker works for what it's worth (not much).

1,could be better
4,I like to read the negative reviews first to see if people report the same problems...It seems like some people are not happy with the max volume but I find it to be plenty. It sounds much better through a good set of headphones or higher quality earbuds than it does with the earbuds that it comes with. Active noise canceling earbuds will help quite a lot. My main use will be through a USB speaker which has its own volume control and there is plenty of volume but it also sounds great through better earbuds.As some people have pointed out the documentation doesn't explain how to create play lists. An easy workaround might be to play your music by genre. There are free programs (like Mp3tag for Windows) for changing mp3 tags so you can assign a genre. You can also save music on separate TF cards and switch cards. Remember to click "Update Playlist" when you switch cards because it doesn't update automatically.Seems like some people can't figure out how to transfer files onto the player. Take the TF card out of the player put it into a card reader plug it into your computer copy and paste files. It's pretty easy. You can put the files in a folder on the TF card if you want to. When you click "Update Playlist" the player will find all of the files automatically. It's much easier to add and delete files on a TF card than it is to use iTunes IMO.It does take a little bit of getting used to navigating the menus.Other observations:When Bluetooth is not in use you should probably turn it off because it may affect battery performance. It's always searching for a device when it's on and not connected.It took me a second to figure out the equalizer but as soon as you scroll to a different equalizer setting you will get a preview of what it sounds like and if you select it it will stay that way.I notice that in shuffle mode if you click Next and then Back it doesn't take you back to the same track. It seems to re-shuffle or just pick something randomly. In other words you may hear the same song twice if you use back and/or next in shuffle mode.I do like the fact that it has FM radio and you can save presets. However it apparently uses the wire from the ear buds as an antenna so your reception might not be as good with wireless earbuds.So far I have tried it with the earbuds that it came with headphones a Harman / Kardon Bluetooth speaker BOSE Bluetooth earbuds active noise canceling earbuds (non-Bluetooth because I use them on airplanes) and I have plugged it into my home stereo. Overall I'm very happy with it. It does everything that I want it to do. I'm only using it to play music. I will update my review if I find that there's anything worth adding or changing.
1,Will only hold 22 songs.
1,Hard to program
5,Use this on long flights to listen to music without running down the battery on my phone. Works like a charm and has held up well. The interface takes a little getting used to but it's not complicated.
5,Sound quality was grear
3,This is an ok music player. However you get what you pay for. The headphone jack broke about a month after purchase and I only receive mono audio which is disappointing. The audio quality is lacking especially while using Bluetooth. Even at max volume and with noise cancelling headphones the audio is pretty quiet and surrounding noise can and will bleed through unless you have headphones that completely cover your ears. There are plenty of features which is great but they don't make up for the cheap headphone jack.
5,Just bought a newer car with USB port and screen but no CD player. It was super easy to plug this mp3 player into my desktop and copy 20 GB of music files onto it. Then I  plugged it into the car USB port and voila! An entire library of music complete with artist and album info. No more hauling stacks of CDs back and forth. No more fiddling with CDs while driving. I love it! Thank you.
3,Product does not explain how to download music
1,Difficult to play.
5,Futuristic looking MP3 player that does exactly what its description says. Fits well in my pocket doesn't slip when holding. All features work as described. Neat!
1,My wife bought this for our 11-year-old son for Christmas based on the thousands of good reviews... I've read many of them and can't figure out if they are actually for this product. Let's start with the basics:1) Let's say the user just want to pick up the box turn it on with a touch find a song and play it at a desirable volume. Sounds like something you might want to do with an MP3 player right? WRONG! Yes there is a power button (which at this moment isn't responding on mine... and it is charged and plugged into my PC). Touch the smooth black face and it lights up with icons that appear to be touch-sensitive buttons. WRONG AGAIN! No; the screen is only made to LOOK like it has touch icons. Let's say you get the screen to light up and also figure out there are invisible touch buttons too... time to navigate:2) You use the play controls to navigate the unlabeled menu. This actually works... well it did 15 minutes ago but now mine doesn't respond at all. So back then I figured out that you tap the controls like game system directional buttons... ignore the fact that they look like rewind play/pause and skip... they don't do that right now. They just highlight the unlabeled menu options on the screen above. Now this resulted in my wife blowing her ears out initially because the unlabeled icon thing was apparently set to "radio" on max volume which many people have said is simply too quiet.By poking around you discover your song menu! ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED! "FOUND A SONG." Time to play it...3) Hooray! You click on the play/pause button on the pad below and your song is now blaring into your child's ears at maximum (the default setting). Obviously you need to crank it back to a decent volume... but you can't. See there is no apparent volume control. No physical button (like every cellphone player and headphone I've ever seen)... you gotta search it out in the menu. So song blaring you stab through the menu to locate "settings" and clip the max volume down for your kid.Mind you we still didn't locate the actual on the fly volume control... only the cap.I would go into more descriptions but as I already posted as of right now the little box appears to basically be dead. If I run my fingers all over the control surface the buttons light up but don't stay lit. Nothing works.And there is my description of your first 15 minutes owning this little gem!Save your money and buy pretty much anything else.Merry Christmas!
1,Bought this in 2018 but hardly used it.  Maybe all of ten times in 4 years. When not in use it's been safely stored. It hasn't been dropped or abused in anyway.The music was always sluggish slower than it should be compared to the original song recording. Speeding it up didn't make it sound any better.Now:1. It won't charge all the way because the slightest jiggle makes the adapter fall out. I have to hold it in place for it to stay connected and charge.2. There's no sound at all. I used it the other day and I had sound. Went to use it today but there's no sound. The song is playing it has a charge. I turned the volume all the way up. I checked the earbuds on another device and they worked just fine.This appears to be a cheaply made device don't waste your money.
4,The MP3 Player works as expected. The PDF Manual is in 8 point PDF with all pages in a horizontal layout so it is not printable. All I want is a MP3 Player and these new devices seem to put many more functions in the device than what I want. While the sound is adequate the sound level is less than what I prefer. Not as good as my very old Sony Walkman.
5,Easy to usevery light and I love the quality of the sound. It has a lot of options too.
1,I got this solely because I like MP3 players to listen to while I sleep. I'm a light sleeper in a noisy area and need music to block out sound.So what do I do first thing after opening the box? Check the instructions to see how to put music on it and hopefully put playlists on it as well since it advertises it has playlists.So what do I SEE when I open the instructions? No instructions for how to transfer music. On an MP3 player. They don't tell you what it needs to be able to read the music. Does it need folders labelled specific things? Does it need a program like the video converter they send on the MicroSD card to transfer? Does it work with Windows or ITunes? Dunno. It doesn't say.So I've been fiddling with trying to figure out how to get it to play some damn music. I have music on the card. I can open the folders file and find it that way but opening under the music file? It says no songs found. Great. And the file folder app only lets me look at artist names so finding the exact song I want is a freaking nightmare.And playlists? What. A. Joke. It has 3 that you have to fill out yourself from the MP3 player. Can you upload your own playlists that you've created over the years that encompass literally thousands of songs? Dunno. The instructions don't tell you.I am so mad. I was really needing a new one after my Sony Walkman finally completely died after 4 years of continuous use. And now I have to go try to find another one that is a little more user friendly.
5,Easy to use comes with everything you need at a reasonable price!
4,Work well love it
2,First thing when trying to download music kept getting errors. Emailed support and they said try different cable. Took until third cable then was able to download.Second trying to listen with bluetooth buds it would break up in the pocket pouch of my hoodie ( it would work in the hood) if I had it in the pocket of my smock it would mostly work if I had it on the same side as the bud. If I put my hand over the bud it will cut out completely. I also tried it with BT headphones little better but still lacking. BT buds work great with my phone so not them.Not sure how this got so many good reviews. BUT going back!!!!
1,This would be a great player if you were to just leave it on a desk or in a car or out at a picnic where you just leave it alone and don't touch it at all - but as soon as you do anything active at all such as even having it in your pocket and walking around or in my case skateboarding/snowboarding and jumping around it simply does not work. Even with the included case if you even bump this thing in the slightest it will reboot on you and lose your playlist/song you were listening to. Highly annoying and makes the device unusable for all intents and purposes. I hate giving one stars but I'm disappointed with this product... it could have been so good if they just added a lock feature to the buttons or some other way for it to not reboot. So $50 wasted as far as I'm concerned... maybe they have upgraded the product to have this feature and if that's the case.. then it may still be worth it. One other thing is that it is simply just not loud enough.. if you are out in traffic or anywhere with other noise you will find out this just doesn't put out enough sound to keep up with the ambient noise.
3,Product instructions were not adequate.  I had to go on-line to learn how to operate. Much to complicated for a 90 year old..
5,I am very happy with this product and it was great shipping time response
4,This was purchased for our daughter for her 10th birthday.  It works perfectly for to be able to listen to music and audio books.  She loves that it has built in speakers unlike previous devices she's had which allows her and her siblings to enjoy things together.One problem we did have was that when you put your files onto the device and it builds the database to allow searching by the ID3 tags it seemed to reach a certain point and then stop reading them.  We had to use the file browser once we reached a certain number of files.  That being said once we adjusted to the issue with browsing she's had no issues using it.
1,I bought an MP3 player under the brand "Mibao" a few months ago. It was garbage and wouldn't even play my music or load all my music onto it (and yes there was plenty of storage space.) Returned it immediately.Then my Sony walkman I bought in 2011 finally died altogether. So I had a friend Prime this "Aiworth" one to me. Different brand name different packaging different shell/casing EXACT same software/interface. This one did load all my music but it limited some album titles to only 10 characters. I listen to a lot of classical music and some composers have very long names and I have multiple recordings or various pieces. This stupid thing lumped some of them all together mixing up albums and track numbers without reason.SAVE YOUR SANITY! Don't buy crap mp3 players on amazon. The market has obviously shifted away for these so everything is junk. I finally broke down and just loaded everything on my phone and found Musicolet for Android. Free app that will organize and play your music without all this stupid headache.
5,Used it for my car and on the go
4,It’s a very honest device staying true to its description here not misguiding customers in buying something that they are not aware of. The device is very responsive and for a device so small it has a decent speaker. It’s a very “retro” way of doing things but it works great. Plus it frees up more space on your phone and saves your battery life a crucial thing when outdoors. Would recommend if you don’t mind carrying another device around.
5,This is an absolutely AWESOME MP3 player especially for the price.  I literally had 7800 songs moved to it and conveniently placed in my car and was working in conjunction with my car stereo in a matter of minutes.  I will purchase another for my wife's car.  I am very pleased with this product.
5,Easy to down load  music unto the computer and than load onto mp3 player in right format was a breeze getting around 200+ songs. My son  absolutely loves it. It was a  birthday  gift  for his 13th celebration to teenager mile stone.. he always has it with him I couldn't ask for a better sounding long lasting continuous play and easily transported from place to place.. the price the quality and the life of this product is beyond what I could of ever asked for or imagined thanks for helping with a big step for responsibility and entertainment all in one.
4,First I was pleasantly surprised to get the item a whole day before expected.The size of the MP3 is perfect the font size isn't too small.Very easy to personalize.I was pleasantly surprised with sound quality there were some reviews about the volume not going above 31 which is true but you really don't need it; even with TV noise in the background you can hear the music well and clear at 16 with ear buds.
5,Music  was easily  transferable to device but not so easy to take from device to computer.
4,Great sound for a birthday gift. I like listening to it falling asleep like the built in radio and the sound quality is superb for the price. The menu is a little difficult to use at first but gets easier with some use. Would like to give it a 4.5 star rating but can't. Highly recommended if you need an inexpensive MP3 player. Using my dad's account to submit review - M. Shepherd
2,I got this player And  it did not work as Expected . And because I don't have Device to connect it with the music I wanted will not work with it.
1,I purchased this unit and did not use it for a few months. My other MP3 finally died and so I tried to download music to the device. It charges up but the computer does not recognize it. I tried it on another computer and still  it will not recognize the unit. I have tried everything I know to get it to recognize the unit.  I thought may be my video card had gone bad and therefore I tried another computer. Nothing works. Since the purchase date was past 30 days Amazon wont exchange or refund. I have sent 2 emails and called product support. After 2 weeks still no answer. The reviews say it is great but mine obviously has a software issue.
2,It was nice for a time but having to wake it up just to adjust the volume is rather annoying. And now it can’t even play through the earbuds unless you constantly put pressure on the audio jack.
4,The quality is very well made and it came with the armband and earphones!
4,It's pretty good. the screen turns to the screensaver after a max of 30 seconds and the layout could be a little nicer otherwiserReally good.
5,Great product
4,Very nice mp3.  I would recommend
4,Very small recorder very sensitive to sound so it pics up the smallest little sound even outdoors if recorder is inside. Had it on voice activation for 3 days and still had a little charge.
4,This was gifted to me and it’s great for listening to audio books and the radio. Has good sound quality and easy to use!
5,Received in timely manner. Works great!
5,This was a gift for my sister. I really like the modern design and functionality.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Nice
5,Very good
5,Good quality. Small and can be easily taken anywhere.
5,We got this for our teenage daughter.  It is easy to use and has great sound quality.
1,player will play a song for a few seconds and skip to the next song. this thing will shut down completely without notice.
1,Bluetooth will not stay connected it will play for about 10 to 30 seconds and off for about the same. I have tried it on 3 different radios and 2 different speakers.
5,Very light weight simple instructions.  Looks like the photo. Does what you bought it for.
5,It's a delightful little indestructible MP3 device that has a lot of capabilities that you wouldn't expect on one like this just based off of parents's which I would say might be the only thing that would be a drop at but everything else is quite nice I like how it's got a recording button just on the side so you can automatically start recording wonderful company that I got it from fast shipping a day early and brand new and great quality
5,The sound quality is amazing no issues with the battery.
5,Got this as a gift for my little sister she is very happy with it quality and desgin are very simple and easy to use.
5,Very pleased
5,My old MP3 player and the one before it had what felt to me like flimsy buttons where you could tell that after a few weeks you were going to start having issues and need to press harder to get the player to respond. With this player the build is more robust (without breaking my wallet) and I doubt this will be an issue. Also this player accepts a 128GB card. Now I can stop killing my phone with song files (since I threw my old MP3 out due to it being more of a hassle than it was truly worth) and move everything onto here! The player is solid stores a lot and has decent sound. That's really all I wanted this whole time...
1,I just bought it with a black Friday discount and I am seeing that the purchase was at the normal price.
5,Been looking for a long time for a good player!
5,Very satisfied with this product.  happy to see it's quality
5,No complaints.
5,Very cool music player.
5,I like the size of this MP3 player the screen is large and easy to navigate. I also love that it comes with headphones and a charging cable. The box it came in was also sturdy and nice. Received this MP3 player as a birthday present and I'm extremely happy with it. The sound quality is also very good. I love it.
5,Is such an amazing product fits hundreds of hours of music and audiobooks. Small and great for backpacking.
1,Gave it away. Maybe someone else can make it work.
5,Very happy with the mp3 player. It is easy to use and nice and compact. Anyone will be able to figure out how to use the mp3 player.
5,Very easy to use. Had a little trouble trying to figure out how to get free music and download it but after that it was a breeze! Doing quality is great and battery life was awesome charged again after about 3 days. def recommend!
5,It works good has a good speaker and is very loud
5,This is an awesome MP3 player.  I bought this one to replace an older version by Sony that was running out of storage and required a wired headset.  This Aiworth is much more efficient and easier to use.  I currently have 29 albums on the player and still have plenty of storage for more.  I also love the radio recording function.  When I hear a new song on the radio I can record it onto the Ipod and save it to hear later.  The Bluetooth connects easily and lasts up to about 30 feet when I step away from the Ipod. Overall I am very pleased with this product.
5,I bought this MP3 player to connect to the Bluetooth speaker here at the house. I have genre playlists on the computer and I like playing the playlists in Shuffle mode.1) I saved my music playlists in folders after I connected the device to the computer.2) I connected the MP3 player to the Bluetooth speakers at the house.3) I go to Folder on the device and go to my music folders (turn on Shuffle first) and play the music!Also it has a built in speakers to play music! Really worth the money!
5,Received this as a gift and find it to be very easy to use.  I wanted a player that could handle my over 2000 songs and play on my car radio as an aux. and it works just fine with an aux cable.  I do wish it would turn off when the car is turned off but you do have to manually turn it off.  That's ok because I don't really drive that much but it's nice to have and I can put my e-books on it as well for any long trips.
5,I’ve had the player since Christmas and I’ve had no problems with charging the battery life or the sound. I really like the shape and the way it feels in my hand. I think it’s good for it’s cost.
5,Easy to use and set up. Pretty easy to load songs and even comes with a rebate to fill out. Easy interface even for kids to use. Recommended
5,After one day the unit appears to work fine.  Great bluetooth range.
5,I received this MP3 player as a birthday gift.  It was an excellent surprise.  I'm currently using it in our Teardrop trailer as we travel around before the winter weather settles in.  It works seamlessly with the speaker system in the trailer.  It's a delight to have our favorite tunes wherever we go.  I had a small learning curve to start using it but now it's so easy!
5,Works great!
5,Great sound and quality was purchased as a gift and I love this! Battery life is great for the day at work.
5,Light weight easy to use nice recording feature
5,I haven't used my MP3 player yet because I just received it today.  So I haven't had time to put my music on it.  The package was very neatly packed.  I plan to use this player while walking and exercising.
5,This is perfect! We bought it for my son for his birthday. It’s easy to use and navigate. He really enjoys it and is super excited.
5,Decent mp3 player but does not support m4a files had to convert to mp3.  Other than that seems to be a quality item
5,Stores all my music in one place. Has exceptional battery life. Once you get the hang of the interface it's easy to use.
5,EASY TO SET UP AND USE
5,We use this MP3 player in our car when traveling where there's no access to the internet. It's great to be able to save music to listen to as we travel to remote locations.
5,For music only
5,It was a nice surprise and the design and quality outstanding!!!!!
5,This MP3 player works great.  Getting music onto the player was easy.  Music sounds great.  No issues.
5,Great product! works well
5,Sister got this unit for her birthday as a gift and I liked it so much got one for myself. Takes a lil bit to get use to but once you figure out the button settings it works pretty well.  Has a number of unexpected features like its own alarm
5,It’s a great MP3 player works really well for what I want it to do.
5,Just got it and it's good so far.
5,I just got this for my birthday but it so easy to maneuver through it and add music
5,so easy to use pretty and light!

5,It is just what I was looking for!!
5,Easy to use
5,Good MP3 player no issue. Controls are a little strange but once you get used to them no problem
5,I love this MP3 Player. It's easy to use has a long battery life and comes with so many amenities like a USB cord and earbuds. This is exactly what I wanted/needed plus it accepts SD cards which is what I was looking for. It also comes with a 32GB SD Card. Sweet!
5,I'm a vocalist and need a device that allows me to listen to and rehearse on the go. I don't like loading music on my phone so I needed something I could use in the car as well. Something that connects to bluetooth so this was my choice. I'm very pleased with the choice made.
5,Good sound quality!
5,Very convenient to have on car rides or appointments with my toddler.  this is also very light weight so it did not take up too much space in my purse or make it heavier. Seller was flawless.
5,This is a quality product for a great price!
5,Great MP3. Battery life last for days goes up tp 31 vol touch screen works great
5,The MP3 player is a really good music device. Although I do wish that it was a bit louder. Other than that it is amazing and I love it.
5,I love it I use this product daily mostly for music with my wireless headphones I'm going to start adding some ebooks too.
5,My mother bought this for me on her account and it's honestly way better than the MP3 player I used to use. The range of bluetooth connection is far enough for me the sound plays well in my headphones even the interface looks good!
5,Amazing device I adore this!
5,its great
5,I got this mp3 to replace an old one that no longer works. I am very satisfied with it the sound is great there is expandable memory sleek and stylish design. Would definitely recommend!
5,The fact that this player not only connects via Bluetooth but also has a surprisingly good speaker is great for a 9 year old just getting into music.  No problems loading files and the battery life is great!
5,Great MP3 player.  The sound is really good.  Love that it has it's own speaker but you can also hook it up to other speakers as well.  Good battery life and easy to use.  Worth the purchase.

5,Great product
2,This has a lot of great features but using the earbuds it comes with I can’t hear the podcasts or music over minor outside noise – leaves blown over the sidewalk making a scratching noise traffic on the highway - which is about 1000 yards away etc as minor background noise totally drowns out the music or podcast.  It might work in a soundproof room or very quiet library but not during an outside walk where I want to use it.  I was going to give it one star but I tried better ear buds and can hear it a little better.  I still haven’t figured out how to “book mark” when I stop in the middle of a podcast so I can restart where I left off but supposedly it is possible or get MP3 tracks from any popular site either.  The maximum volume this allows it TOO LOW.  This might work if you can get amplified or good noise blocking earbuds but not as it comes.
4,The reason I bought this device is that it offers considerable bang for the buck as it is a MP3 player voice recorder video player FM radio ebook reader and an alarm clock. With bluetooth for earphones AND a wired earphone jack AND a huge 32 gb card AND 350+ 4.5 star reviews AND was only $40 ... it looked like a good deal.Having all these features are cool but the primary reason I bought this player are:1. MP3 player2. Recorder for oral interviewsand secondarily video viewing on long tripsI am giving this product 4 stars as it accomplished my primary objectives with one star taken off because it does not support MP4 video format....which turns out not to be that big a deal as there is a file converter you use which means one extra step (more below).But I am tempted to add back a star as the tech support is fantastic. When you buy a cheap device made in China you usually buy at your own risk not expecting any manufacturer support. But these folks respond within a day (due to time difference) with real and helpful feedback in good English. Any issues or questions I had were resolved quickly. Also their written documentation is written in real English that is clear and concise.IMPRESSIONSWhen you open the package there is a sleek phone looking device polished shiny black so good eye candy. The dimensions are 4" long. 2" wide. 1/4" thick. It looks and feels like a touch screen but it is not - instead there are pretty simple to figure out buttons below like all others at this price.It fits nicely into any pocket you want to put it in. Included is an armband so if you are a runner you can strap it on. I don't run much less walk so I found more value in the lanyard holes so I can either wear it around my neck and it helps make it easier to find as it is so small. The one thing I wish they included was a lanyard clip as I had to push on a piece of string to go through the lanyard holes and create a circle so a lanyard could clip on. MP3 PLAYERThe loudness without headphones is excellent. I actually turned it down because it was too loud listening in my office. Quality of sound was excellent given the tiny speaker that is included. Shuffle mode is a great feature so the playlist always changes. Adding music was a snap. Just plug in the USB port and it is recognized as a drive. I created a folder called Music and poured 133 songs into it totalling 700 mb which is nothing on the included 32 GB card. I played MP3 music over the speakers for six hours nonstop and the power bar dropped only slightly still nearly full.WIRED AND BLUETOOTH LISTENING OPTIONSI am so glad they did NOT cheap out and remove the standard earphone jack. Since I am pretty sedentary and old school I use wired headphones if listening for long periods. They are cheap and less prone to get lost like small bluetooth earbuds or run out of power.However I did pull out my bluetooth earbuds and it is pretty easy to pair with the player. Go to the bluetooth setting turn on bluetooth search for the earbuds and hit enter. Sets up in seconds.RECORDERI do oral history interviews. Having a small pocket size recorder is good to capture a clean audio track. The features for recording are plentiful .... there is a line in option to use an external lapel mic for optimum recording. Supports voice activated recording so it removes any long pauses if the subject is thinking. Good quality 153kbps which is more than adequate as voices have very little range compared to your music files. Select wav format for uncompressed recording for best quality.MOVIE VIEWERI loaded five movies on it to keep amused when traveling. Totalled 3.31 GB. The screen is only 2.4" 320x240 resolution so don't expect much but it is  watchable. The battery seems to last nearly forever.  Figured it would be perfect to use on trips because I hate draining my laptop and phone to zero just in case I really need them.Documentation says it supports AMV and AVI files. But I could not get the AVI files loaded to work so I emailed tech support and they advised to go to their site. Download in the Tools section Video Conversion Tool compatible with WIN 10. I installed it and it was a snap to convert AVI and MP4 files into an AMV format. AMV video file format is supported on the player. Because of the extra step for conversion I am downgrading one star. Truthfully I will not use the video very often but it is the principal of the thing.FM RADIOFM works only using headphones as the headphones act as an antenna. Reception with headphones were clear and clean.OTHER FEATURESEbook - I did not test this as I never plan to use it. With such a tiny screen and I half blind it would be futile. Other features I don't care about are a calendar alarm picture viewer and stopwatch as your phone is easier to use.Happy with purchase.
5,The player has built-in speaker of decent loudness. Sound quality is good with my own Bluetooth earbuds. Unlike iPhone when you turn off your Bluetooth device the player will automatically switch to use its built-in speaker. Is this good? Up to you. The Bluetooth earbuds do connect next time I turn them on which is good. It will be greater if the control screen is touch -- if the price tag doesn't skyrocketing. Battery life of 8 hours is as advertised. I like the armband included with the player. The included 32GB memory card provide enough space for abundant songs to be loaded onto the player. It would be better if we can directly load the songs onto the player through the cable from a laptop.
5,This MP3 player couldn't have come at a better time. I was offered to try it for free and I'm so glad that I did. Transferring songs and pairing to my Google Home speaker was easy. I didn't need to refer to the manual that came with it. I also listened with the headphones and at low volume it was plenty loud. The earbuds are also very comfortable - much more comfortable than my old wired Apple earbuds.I'm so used to touching my screen icons that I kept trying to do the same with the player's screen at first but you have to use the controls (+ - < > etc) below the screen. These are touch buttons not tactile. Even though this is considered old school it doesn't take away from the player. More importantly this keeps the cost down. However the description does say touch buttons so it's the error of users thinking this should be touchscreen.Overall I'm very pleased with this player.
4,I spent some time searching for an MP3 player to listen to audio books with.  Unless you're using the Audible app you will have to convert to MP3s and manually keep track of where you are in the book by paying attention to the digital counter and making sure you update your bookmarks.  Its easy to jump the tracks with big MP3 files and its a real pain having to start over or fast forward through hours of reading to get back to where you were.  This player has a very functional bookmark feature that's right on hand when you need it.  My main issue with it is the size of the display -- these old eyes could barely make out the digital counter.  The numbers use a red font which is almost illegible.  Also the volume control is one of the indicators on the face (no controllers on the side).  So you have to look at the device and touch the controls to get the vol to change.  If audio books are not your thing this player is larger than most and intuitively functional with a large screen easy-to-read menu and 32G of memory.  You'll like this one!
5,So I ordered this because I needed a new MP3 player. After him hawing back and forth for almost 2 weeks I narrowed it down to this one.  Anymore it's a crapshoot when you buy any electronic items it seems.I received this on Sunday (today is Tuesday) and I just got around to playing with it. There aren't really any real usable instructions (picture 4) which is slightly annoying but still do-able. When you plug it into the computer (Windows 10 PC) it shows you 2 folders and a file (picture 5). From there you're on your own; I just created a file folder called Music (real original I know- haha) dropped 2600-ish songs in and charged it up. I Changed some settings; date/time and volume. ((IMPORTANT make sure you change the max volume unless you want to be deaf. It is default set at 31 and I turned it down to 10. I use SkullCandy earbuds and volume set at 7 is perfect)).Started playing tunes and it was awesome. This will be perfect for my travels. Not sure why it only shows 1700+ songs when I have 2600 (9.5 GB). I did notice several songs showing "error" (picture 8) so I'm wondering if that has something to do with it. Too bad you didn't know what song or why. All my media is the same file type (MP3/WMA).Hopefully it lasts because it looks sharp and the feel is nice. Small hands need smaller electronics.Based on the 5-10 minutes I've used it it seems great. Will find out more after I fly back from FL in 3 weeks.  I'll try to do an update again.***UPDATE***THIS THING IS AWESOME 😎I've used it for about 20 hrs (maybe 25 tops) and it's still going strong. The battery indicator shows it's full still but obviously I don't know what the percentage is. It would be awesome if they made a little case like they do for cell phones So that way if you dropped it or whatever it would have some sort of protection while in use.I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS AGAIN ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
3,I bought this specifically to use the audio jack in my car. I normally would use my phone but found that my phone was filling up way too quickly and I've run out of storage space almost immediately I definitely need a bigger phone card as well. This offer comes with a 32GB SD card so you can include a ton of songs. I've left it in my car for over a week and it's still pretty much full-on battery life so that's pretty great. It connects to the audio jack with no problem at all. I do however have a few complaints I wish that I could feel the buttons or hear a little beat up some sort for an indication when I'm pushing from a song to next song Because often when I'm driving if I want to change the song I just reach over and tap on my phone but on here it's a little difficult you end up hitting some other buttons or turning the music off completely and then I have to pull over and fix it.
5,Too many things I like to list them all but the Lithium batteries are great = 8-hrs of continuous listening and a 1-hr fast charge. The included 32-GB TF memory card allowing storage of 5000 songs.  The Bluetooth 5.0 which works great with the Bluetooth headsets I also picked up. I am really impressed with the overall looks and feel of these AIRWORTH MO3 players the double-sided 2.4” acrylic glass is nice vs some cheap plastic version. The multiple color screen is also a nice touch. The built-in FM radio and the E-Book functions are also nice additional features and they even threw in a recorder as if there wasn’t enough things already!  I hope my grandchildren are as impressed and happy with these MP3 players as I have been getting them set up for them!
4,I have been impressed with the quality of this Mp3 player. The battery life has been great so far the sound quality has been good (except for the radio but I'll touch on that later) the controls are easy to use and it came with headphones and an armband. It is a great little package especially compared to some other entry level Mp3 players. Plus the fact that it comes with a 32 gig micro SD card is pretty awesomeOnly one thing I haven't been impressed with. The headphones it came with are decent but they serve as the antenna if one desires to listen to the radio and to this end they do not perform well. I got a lot of static using the headphones while listening to the radio especially indoors. I don't know if other headphones would remedy this; I didn't try.Overall I would recommend this product as a great alternative to more expensive Mp3 players and contains a lot of value per dollar.
5,I bought this particular MP3 player over the others based upon the following features:  Bluetooth 5.0 capability ability to store up to 32 GBytes user interface is touch key for all functions battery life is better than 6 hours using Bluetooth and playing songs it has a FM radio feature that I use the volume of the internal speaker and the volume through a headset is better than most the memory card is removable so I can change out my playlists it comes with a handy velcro pouch for attaching around your arm.  Things that could be improved:  change the color of the FM frequency to white versus red which is hardly visible change the Japan frequency dial to AM dial.
5,I really like this little mp3 player.  Its compact and packs a lot of features for such a low price.  The only complaint I have is that you can "use it from itunes" but not really.  Its not like an ipod where it recognizes it as a device.  You can go into itunes and convert your files to MP3.  Then copy the mp3 files to the player via file explorer.  Very easy to do but not as simple as just dumping from itunes.  The screen is not a touch screen but once you get used to navigating around its not hard.  You can't do any kind of edits on the device you have to do it from your computer.  But once you get it all set up you have really nice sound and radio.  Remember this isn't a 300.00 ipod!
4,I am always a big fan of MP3 players and do not like to store songs in phone. And this is a perfect upgrade to my 4 years old MP3 player. The sound quality is good but not great. The volume feels sometimes low when I am listening in a place which is not so quite. The storage capacity of 32 GB is pretty good and having it on a TF card is advantageous. Connection with bluetooth speakers is really a plus which makes the sound quality awesome
5,I purchased because the music widget on my Samsung switched to YouTube music. I'd rather not have to worry about data just to listen to music. So I went back in time and bought one of these. I love it so far. It'll take some getting used to the interface as its been awhile I've used one of these. So far I'm very happy with it. I can use it with or without headphones. I haven't yet tested if I can plug it into my car. The screen itself isn't touch screen but the buttons below it.It comes with a manual arm band charging/transfer cord and basic headphones. Transfer process is simple. Plug into your computer and transfer the files with copy/paste or drag and drop and right click to eject the device. That's it! Battery seems to be good I only use this for music so I'm hoping each charge will last awhile. So glad I found this!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I've purchased about 7 mp3 players in the price range of $40-120 and the quality to price ratio is pretty unbeatable:-Music Video and Picture storage-Speaker built in to play music from actual device-Wireless Bluetooth earphones connection (volume rocker and skip track buttons actually work on this one)-Live audio recording capabilities-Ebook storage (not sure that I'll be using that but seems like a handy feature if you're a reader; would be interested to see if any other buyers used this feature)My only gripe is not having a case or some sort of screen protector but if you just keep it in your workout sleeve that shouldn't be a problem. 👍🏾-Comes with an exercise sleeve
5,Love this little device. Very versatile as a blue tooth recorded music player. I was quite surprised at how small it is and super pleased at the portability. Bought it with a small Bluetooth speaker and found that I could leave this device in one room and simply take the speaker with me throughout the house. However it is so small leaving it is not necessary. One of my best purchases in the electronic area. I did give only 4 stars for sound quality but that relates only to the built in speaker which is super tiny so it does not have a chance. Very good sound considering the size.
5,Purchased an Aiworth - MB08 MP3 Player a few days ago. Got it rather rapidly thru my Amazon PRIME acct. It's my first MP3 Player and works very intuitively after quickly going over the User Manual.The charge time was a very reasonable amount of time and ear phones were just like the Apple earphones and had very good sound quality.The thing I like best about the Aiworth MP3 Player is its light weight and sleek design. Also it came in an attractive case where I can keep things until needed. I'm glad I made this purchase - It's a keeper !!
5,I been try to find a MP3 for my girl and also need to have a recorder that are super easy to used.and finally this is the one. (after 4 times different kind of MP3)All you have to do is power on -> on the left side  push up for start  -> push down for finish.Super easy!!Other function are the same need a little time to get used to it.
3,I bought this so I could listen to music when my phone doesn't have service in the car.So far I've had to unpair it from my car and the device then pair it again to get it to connect. To be able to pair a new device I have to have the car in park. It's annoying to have to pull over just to pair the device again.I've tried shutting my phone off completely before I start the car. I made sure it wasn't connected at all to my phone. Nothing works except what I stated before.
5,I purchased this MP3 device for use in my car and outside activities--walking yardwork exercising.  It's exactly what I was looking for.  It's very easy to use the user interface icons are large and the instruction sheet for using is easy to understand as well as thorough.  I appreciate the very compact size and included with the purchase is an armband/belt holder.  I plan to convert all my old music CD's to MP3 format and this a key component to making that happen.  I'm very pleased.
5,The UI is very simple and straight forward. The sound is actually really good a nice level of bass. It came with a 32gb sd card instead of having it as internal storage so I was a little confused at first but this means I can just swap out the storage all together with another sd card so that's kind of handy. It also has a built in speaker. It's a lot louder then I would have expected but it is good for when I forget my headphones. Definitely worth the money.
5,We bought this as a present for our 7 year old as we got tired of listening to the same 3 songs over and over again and he did not. I am kicking myself that we didn't purchase this earlier - this mp3 player is EXACTLY what we were looking for. It holds plenty of music is easy for little ones to navigate and we are thrilled at the volume levels as they are perfect for little ears. He feels super cool that he can put on his headphones and listen to his music like his older sisters do and we get a break from Old Town Road.
5,At first when I opened the package I thought that the player did not have speakers built in and you needed to use the headphones that come with the product. But I proceeded to put music on it and when I played it there were speakers and this was what I was wanting for my dad for Christmas.He is not one to put earphones in his ears to listen to music. So this was a great thing that I think he will enjoy for a long time.
5,I have tried and tried mp3 players for what seems like years and there's always at least one thing that disappoints.  Finally I believe I've found the one I've been looking for.  It's sleek and beautiful and has so many features that I want (see the features list above).  Oh and it sounds great.  I was able to fit my whole catalog on the 32Gb card that's  4092 songs (with 4Gb to spare).  I find the controls easy to understand which is very important to me.  I have found no CONs only PROs
5,I have a music library and play lists on my computer... but when I want to take the music out of my office my only choices are to purchase a subscription with iTunes to broadcast beyond areas where I don't have a wifi signal. This player has a great battery life and lasts as long as my JBL. Now I have my tunes at the beach and on the boat... without draining my phone battery.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I really like this MP3 player it comes with 32GB memory card as large as I can save up to 5000 songs and enjoy my time at the gym and it comes with the perfect accessory that I need to have a walk while I’m listening to the music and also the best thing what I need in these days is the recorder while I’m studying online and I need to record many things to get back to listen to it later I’m really happy with it. Totally recommend it
5,Bought this device for my workout time. Really light weight and simplicity to use is what I like. Love the part that I just need to copy paste songs like any pendrive rather than doing 10 other steps of syncing or going to iTunes etc for getting a song in any apple device Loved the device. Sound quality is great! Comes with charger hand band  headset although I use my Bluetooth headphones with it which make it perfect for a workout music device. Can fit any small pocket so super portable.
5,I need an mp3 that can be used in my car. This is awesome. I connected to the sound system in model Lexus RX350 and found that the quality of the sound was still outstanding and I still had full control to advance songs from the sound system's command center onboard the vehicle.
5,I got the for the gym and running so I don't have to lug around my phone.  It's perfect.  Weighs almost nothing.  Comes with an armband if you like those.  I don't.  So I got a stick-on clip for the back of it.  That's the only thing this is missing.  A belt clip.  But the sound is great.  Interface is easy to use.  And gives you many options for playing music and books.  Plus has a built in speaker for when you don't want to wear headphone.  I love it.
2,I could never get it to work. If you have a Mac just go ahead and keep on scrolling and find something else. The menu is not very good as well. I was trying to save some MP3 music files to this and I could never get it to work.
5,I now have a source to listen to music on-the-go without having to buy batteries for my portable CD player that I had purchased from Walmart on an urgent need. Not only that if I want to shuffle tons of music at home I can charge it on my radio as well and listen to it this way as well!
5,It's always a shot in the dark with some of these lesser known brands but I have to say it does it's job and has good amount of capacity to store music which you can also increase with an sd card.It's nice to have the touch buttons yet I always forget that the screen is not touch also. I mainly use this to send my music to a jbl speaker and it connects well!
5,I got two of these for traveling as it is easier than pulling out a laptop on an airplane.  For the price this was perfect easy transfer of music and for a little hand held music box it has incredible sound.  I would say it rivals the more expensive one-- you know-- that one that is now more expensive than a cell phone!
5,A tiempo y son daños. Buen tie.po de batería. Sonido fuerte sin utilizar audífonos. Se conecta rápido y buena distancia de alcance. El acceso a la música debería ser más rápido al igual de la forma de pasar música. Pero funcionan muy bien
3,I like everything about it with the exception of the volume  it's very weak  I like loud music  but no matter how I listen to it  car  bluethooh or wired earbuds it is a very low volume player . Everything else is great
5,So I originally purchased a little $20 mp3 player on Amazon and immediately regretted it. 2 days later I purchased this guy and it's perfect. The user interface is so much better and it's way easier to use. It feels like a lot higher quality than the other cheap plastic one and my not so tech savvy husband was able to use it without my help. We are excited to have music on our camping trips with no cell service!
5,I was looking for a way to disconnect from my phone but still have some music to listen to while on my runs and this MP3 meets those needs! It even came with a running armband which I was not expecting. It connects to my AirPods with no issue and it sounds great.
2,The Bluetooth didn't work for any of my Bluetooth headphones. I have the new Samsung buds...no worko. Older Sony sport... no worko. All I ever got was error code Bluetooth not compatible.
5,This was just what we were looking fir when our son want to work out with music but has lost his phone priviledges.My 16 year old son found it easy to navigate easy to transfer songs and found the sound quality to his liking.It has definitely met our needs.
5,We have been very pleased with this mp3 player. Its simple to use & has good sound. So far the battery life seems really good and the built-in speakers have good volume for listening to the music. We ordered this for one of our kids & they have loved having full control of their own music!
5,My mother's iPod was dying and the battery quickly goes away so I decided to get her an Mp3 player. So I saw this and the good reviews it had and so I bought it for her and she loves it!! She mainly wants something to listen to her music while she does her activities and she loves how the player looks and that it came with an sd card arm strap and headphones. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone!!!
5,When I ordered this music player I didn't notice it was also a voice recorder. BONUS!!! My order came with the player ear-buds charging cord the coolest arm-strap holder & a 32GB SD card. It was easy to load my songs onto the SD Card then put it in the player. Ready to go! The player also lets you create playlists. It easily connects to my blutooth speaker. There's a nice clear sound! You won't be wasting your money if you buy this!
5,I have been really been contemplating getting an MP3 player versus downloading music on my phone. Decided to go with this and give it a try. I absolutely love it! The sound is awesome. I ride a motorcycle and this gem holds a ton of songs for long rides. Great for the price!!
5,Often a person working in a room too boring also does not have network the mp3 small and exquisite can be worn on the arm when walk or work can listen to don't have to wear headphones you know for a long time wearing headphones to hearing damage listen to once familiar songs feeling young again feeling all right.
5,I just received the media player and first impressions it's very appealing. I love the metal body. The player is easy to use. I will update the review again after giving it a good use. The only thing I don't like out the box is that it uses micro usb rather than usb c but that's alright.
5,It sounds great but I have to keep pushing the power button so the keys will light up its not good when Zim driving to have to take my eyes off the road to skip a song.
5,I need something for downloading podcasts and this MP3 player is amazing. It's easy to use and easy to download from any computer.
5,Excelent MP3 player with a handcase included. This is a very nice product and the features are the same as other high price label. I will recomend to buy this product . The sound are excelent and the desing is perfect
5,I only need music for walking working out and since I love the sound on this little player - it's all good! Luckily I've transferred music over to lots of other mp3 players because the directions with this are not great.
5,I was looking for something small & weightless that could go on my arm during workouts at the gym & was Bluetooth capable and I finally found the one.  My order arrived one day earlier and I was very happy with the product.  It had an armband with the MP3 Player and it was Bluetooth compatible with my earbuds.  The sound output is smooth and loud if you like it LOUD.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend or another person.
5,This MP3 player is smaller than it appears in the pictures which I think is great. It is just over an inch wide and about 3 inches tall and about 1/4 inch thick. It is very east to copy MP3 files from your PC to the player by using the included micro USB cable. Simply plug it into your PC open the folder and drag and drop the files in. The user interface on the player is intuitive and easy to use. The battery seems to last forever and the included strap allows you to keep the player firmly attached to your arm while walking jogging or exercising.
5,Very happy with this product! I got it for my daughter and it came with an SD Cards headphones and an arm band which was an awesome plus. The Bluetooth range is good. When it's in her pocket it stays connected to her headphones. Battery life as expected. Easy to use interface. Having an FM Radio is probably our favorite feature because it's so convenient. If you leave the mp3 player on unattended it will shut itself off too.I recommend this product!!
5,I used to take my phone with me when I'm out for exercise but it is heavy. This MP3 player is perfect. It's small with excellent features and easy to change tracks. It just what I wanted. This would be a perfect gift for anyone that enjoys music.
5,Awesome MP3 player at an affordable price! I couldn’t be happier with this product. Bought one for my mom for Christmas and decided to make a custom song list for her before I give it to her so she can use it with her new radio that I bought for her. Super easy process product does everything it describes. I’m thinking about getting one for myself now! Thanks!
5,I love this nice MP3 player as it is very easy to use and instructions are very clear. I  like it also because it is bluetooth and easy to find my albums. I highly recommend this nice little unit and is has great build quality.
5,A little confusing with the menus but it works fine. I take a 4 mile walk everyday and use this on my walk. I loaded a bunch of Christmas songs on it and we were good to go. I like it.
5,There are many more expensive devices. This unit supplies my music needs and the device is easy to use.  You will need a TF Micro card reader to interface it with another computer. The best are less than $10 USB readers specifically made for TF Micro cards .
5,Pretty good MP3 player. I bought it as a gift for my son. Perfect for recording and listening to music very reasonable price. so far he’s so happy with it. Looks cute and expensive. Comes with small container to store it in it. I will definitely recommend it
5,Love my mp3  player I found that Google is changing the music to YouTube so I brought this to save my music works great I actually forgot about mp3 players so glad I got it I have so many song I get to keep now and with the battery life I can listen to it all day.
5,Love the small size which is great for working out. You can’t beat the quality for the price either. I probably have to charge it every few days after using for an hour workout a day.
5,When I purchased this Mp3 player I was very surprised with this item. Because of its bluetooth capability I was able to sync it with my wireless speakers.  It has 32 GB memory with the capability of adding more. The battery life is decent. Finally I didn't realize that it was a voice recorder also. I highly recommend this item.
5,I owned my first mp3 player ten years ago and I missed it very much until I saw this mp3 and I decided to buy it. It did not disappoint me it is very convenient to use I can easily download music through the data cable. Its light and smooth appearance is also one of my favorite advantages. I like it very much
5,I wanted something that can help in saving battery for my phone. as I use my phone a lot for listening. Now I can listen and enjoy without worrying about the phones battery. I also wanted to use it for my bluetooth speaker. The mp3 player is easy to connect and use. This has no built in memory which I dont like.other than than a good mp3 player with lot of battery life and functions.
4,En ocasiones presenta problemas para conectarse al Bluetooth del carro pero es probable que sea el mismo carro.  Del resto presenta buen sonido y la batería tiene buena duración sin necesidad de recargar
5,Bought for my teenage son for Christmas.  He absolutely loves it. Little difficulty in transferring his songs from his computer to the mp3 player.
5,This has turned out to be a great replacement for my old Mp3 player! I've already transferred all my favorite albums onto it and have been enjoying listening on my daily walks.  It's much easier than using my phone to play music and it holds so much music. Battery life has is also great just as advertised. The built-in speaker is a nice bonus too. % stars from me.
4,This is a great MP3 player for beginners but fairly difficult to read the instructions. Overall it works great for the price. I got this for my 7 year old to use while running. It took us 2 hours to figure out how to put music on it and hopefully my son likes the same 10 songs for a while because I’m not sure I could manage to put more on easily. Ha!
5,The flow unit works great. I downloaded all the songs off of my iTunes and it only took two or three minutes. So far so good.
5,I forgot how handy these lil guys are! It keeps me from killing my phone battery!! Its super easy to use!..I only gave it 4 stars since i really didnt use it long enough for battery life!! Def worth it!!!
5,Works as well as one would hope.  Easy to use but the instruction manual could be written out much better.  For those who may not be very techie.
4,This would be the perfect gift for the littles who want their own device for music. Battery life is amazing and would be a wonderful addition for a long road trip to keep your little one entertained!!
4,Nice small size. I got this for going running with. It’s a little work to get the songs transferred to it but it’s so nice and light compared to taking your phone running. It’s kind of like an iPod nano in size.
5,The player is for my 8year old to play songs to her Bluetooth headphones and be able to dance with no cords. She also likes to sing so the recording function is awesome. The download is going smoothly to transfer from iTunes to the player. Overall thrilled right now.
5,So super groovy cool!
5,I switched to converting my music to mp3s and I quit streaming through bluetooth on spotify in my car and it's like day and night. Music never sounded this good to me before now. The mp3 player is the perfect size and weight as well. Easy to read and navigate through the menu screen.
5,Not a fan of the interface. Was expecting it to be full touch screen especially with how technology today. Otherwise then that. The mp3 player worked great and the sound was fantastic. Plus the fact that it already came with an SD card helped alot.
5,This was need for work place to play music and its works really well.It's has a lot of function to play with.
5,So far we think its great. My husband set it up and he found it very easy-to-use. The sound is great.
5,I'm really impressed with this small MP 3 player I received as a Christmas gift. it easily will fit into your pocket. the 32 gig card holds plenty of music for what I do outside on a daily basis and the battery life seems to last for quite some time without needing charging each and every day. it paired easily with my ear pods and has really good sound quality. couldn't be happier
3,This is suppose to play MP4 video. It doesn't. I emailed customer service with no response.
5,You can plug in headphones or it plays out loud without them from a speaker. My daughter is 6 and she loves music. She feels so big using this MP3 player.
5,Its easy to use and its sounds great. I like that it came with earbuds and an armband to hold it I was not expecting to get those things. It was easy to connect it to my computer and add music to it. I can connect it to my car so I can listen to the music on it while I drive.
5,Nice little MP3 player. Great sound quality long battery life and rfeally nice featurers
1,Cheap. Knockoff product. Not user friendly interface. Programmed by someone who speaks English as a second language.
5,Muy buen producto me encanto!!!
5,Bought two of these for the wife and I Loading songs was easy and it paired quickly with our new ear buds. I like all the extras that come with it
5,Very pleased with the design and the software. Got it up and running in just a few min.
5,This will be excellent for storing all my music albums and videos into it.
5,Bought it for my son. I loves it. Has an FM player also. Nice MP3 Player
5,This is a good MP3 player and is current in tech.  I had to send one back because it didn't work with Windows 10 and was made in 2014.  Simplistic in design so easy for my daughter.
5,It's quite handy.easy to carry and use.
5,I don't want my daughter to have a phone yet but this is perfect instead!  She can listen to music take pictures and i it is so easy to use!  So glad I got this!
5,This project is a phenomenal MP3 player. Top of the line. Best purchase ever.
5,the functions are easy to use ands the design firs nice in your hand
5,I bought this to use with the radio in my car so I wouldn't have to use my phone. So far its easy to use paired with my car  and sounds great. It was worth the money.
5,Bought this for my son for Christmas. It plays mp3 also has a radio and a speaker so u don't have to use head phones. Also has Bluetooth to connect to a speaker. The sound quality is good this is a neat mp3 player.
5,I like how easy to use and accessible. And the battery life is unexpected in a good way. My dislike volume is low and they’re no hold button so it press buttons. Bluetooth very easy to set up as well
4,IT COMES IN DEFAULT CHINESE LANGUAGE. be warned about that but after that was taken care of it works like a charm. connected just fine. Be careful to not record accidentally with the side button but other than that works like a charm.
5,This MP3 surprises me. It has more functions than I thought. Music video ebook FM record. I could enjoy theses things without the distraction of my mobile phone now. Very light and easy taking.
5,Bought this for my son for Christmas. He LOVES it. Easy to use good sound easy to download songs. He discovers more he can do with it every day (set an alarm listen to the radio etc.). So far very happy with my purchase!
5,Good product
5,excellent service too great price.
5,Awesome value for the price

5,Nice little device. I wish it played MP4's since it shows MP4 on the screen.
5,I use this product mostly for listening to music and audio books. I like that it is thin and I like the case because it hooks on to your arm. I am a 9 year old boy using this product. It even has a calendar.
5,NICE SMALL UNIT
5,I am very satisfied with this mp3 player and recorder. It was just what I needed. My only complaint....it is not very user friendly when you want to transfer music from your computer to the device.
5,So excited to get this! Love the ease of using it! Especially the bluetooth capabilities.
5,Really enjoying this MP3 player the built in speakers aren't the best but I use this mainly to connect to a Bluetooth speaker and it sounds much better like this it also comes with a legacy 3.5 jack which is nice as well.
5,It's $30 all I wanted was that it easily paired with my bluetooth headphones so that I could hear ocean sounds etc. without needing to take my phone to bed.  It does that.  Job done.
5,I'm totally satisfiedThank you!
5,Very nice item easy to navigate. Radio works well indoors! Recorder works hooked to bluetooth easy. Can't wait to load with music and have it all with me.
5,Really good!  I use it to play Flac files

5,. The sound is very clear and connects to bluetooth qiukly

5,I purchased this mp3 specifically for the radio feature but I am very pleased with the recorder as well as being able to make a playlist.

4,Smaller than I thought.Still figuring out all the settings.
1,Not worth the money at all I'd rather have an Ipod original
5,Got this b because it has bluetooth and can  be paired with wireless headphones and earbuds. Old iPOD is no competition for new updated features.

5,Everything about it I love the music on there that I can add and the books I can fall asleep listening to them.
5,Works great!
5,I love it and so does my kid got it for his birthday totally recommend
4,Cannot adjust the volume to a high enough setting for my liking.
5,Excellent sound quality and battery life. Easy to use
5,What I dislike is the very poor directions on the so-called user manual.  I think downloading MP3 music should almost be automatic.  Not so with this machine.  "via connected the line in cable"?????? what the heck.  Device refuses to recognize bluetooth on my laptop.  Have spent hours trying to download Amazon purchased music.  Not happy with Amazon or the device.  After hours of frustration and web surfing for help I finally got it.  What a relief.  Need to walk now.
5,Connects to my headphones fast battery life lasts days for me sound quality is incredible very satisfied
5,I'm loving my new mp3 player. I got it for the Bluetooth connectivity upgrading from an older SanDisk model. The display is nice and bright. It does take a bit of getting used to but once you get the basics down its very intuitive. I love the larger display too. Solid choice!
5,Easy to use and I have over 900 songs on it
5,Great product
5,it's good the sound quality is great and it sure is rlly small. but overall ITS VERYYY GOODODOD. i can literally sneak or carry this thing everywhere.
5,This mp3 players was one of the best electronic purchases ever! So easy to use that I didnt even need the instructions!Battery charges fast and stays charged. Holds way more music than I even need but glad to have that option. And with the audio book feature I can finally hop on that trend! I'm going to get 1 for each of my 4 kids next. Thanks so much!
5,It's easy to understand and use. The sound quality is great with or without earphones.
5,Was looking for a simple Mp3 player for my niece that has good sound and can hold a lot of music.  This one was the winner! I have been downloading and listening to the songs on it and I am very pleased! I cannot wait to give it to her for her birthday loaded with music and ready to go! Comes with an easy to understand instruction book and all the accessories you need for it as well.
5,I use this when walking my Pug.
5,After looking for a while locally decided to get this product and love it.  Is exactly what I was looking for.  More than enough space to put your music.  Easy to use.  Bought is as a birthday gift for my daughter and she loved it too.  Now I need to order two more one for me and another for my mother. :)
5,Good product
5,Haven’t used it yet but came as described and looks good.
5,Upon receiving my MP3 player I was a tad worried about the quality and didn't know the full range of features. To my pleasant surprise the MP3 has been great to handle and i have owned it for about a month (give or take a week) and have had zero issues. The battery life is long and it has the ability to play pretty good quality video given the screen type. Music has been nice and loud just how i like it despite the volume maxing out at 31. Overall i have been very happy with this purchase and running up to random people and using the record lever just to ask them "And how does that make you feel?" without context has been very fun!
5,Great product.  Love to use it while working out.  Easy to maneuver.
1,Lasted only a few months before it would refuse to hold a charge. There is an input lag when tapping the buttons which could be instant could be a few seconds really annoying when navigating menus. If you're someone who has a lot of songs saved on an SD and want to select a specific song GOOD LUCK you can't fast scroll the menu it skips like 2 songs at a time.But the fact that I was able to basically shuffle 6k songs on my SD card rather than 2k at a time like other ones was nice for as long as it lasted.
3,Once you get past the somewhat strange interface the music player is a joy to use. I only use it for music for when I'm walking. I haven't tried the video or e-book features. But for music it is great. I've saved over 50 hours of music and the playback is crystal clear. Getting music on the device was a little non-intuitive. In my case my music was on my Windows 10 desktop. The music was arranged in folders where each folder represented an album. I used the USB cord included with the device to connect to my desktop. Windows found the device and recognized it as an external drive. Then I simply cut and pasted the music/album folders from my desktop to the player. Of course the player needs to be on during this operation. Then connect your headphones and go to the main menu on the player. Select "Folders" not music (the music note icon). You will see your albums under the Folders icon (second row far left). Again the interface takes some getting used to but the device is attractive light inexpensive and best of all reproduces music beautifully. I'm very happy with the purchase.Edit (4/2/2021) While there is a lot to like about this device I have to knock two stars off due to a faulty earplug port. After almost daily use for months the sound recently started cutting out randomly. I thought it was my Apple earplugs--the kind you get with the older iPhones. So I bought a new pair of earplugs. Same problem. The port has become loose so the earplug plug no longer fits tightly. I like this little device enough I may end up buying another one. I'm sure the manufacturer won't stand behind the one I have. It's too bad really otherwise I would give this 5 stars.
5,For my daughter. She loves it
5,This is a gift for my.12 year old Granddaughter.  She is thrilled. It has good sound quality and is easy to set up.
5,Great little MP3 holds lots of songs and great sound it does get loud if you turn volume up!
5,to pair with bluetooth headphones
5,Great battery life and fun for the gym or distant travel.
5,I love this mp4 it is great small fine and very elegant acceptable sound it connects quickly to the wireless headphones with a card included enough to have many songs even videos.  I am happy I made this purchase
1,This player might be good for a 12 year old who wants to listen to music but not for recording/playback of books on line.  It will record the chapters out of sequence and then when you want to listen to the book it plays back out of sequence.  Couple that with no customer service and you are wasting your money.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 when I try to play a song it freezes I mean it's useless
5,This thing is pretty nice. Transfer process for songs is quick its compact with a steel frame and easy to store. Great alternative to the growing restrictions in music ownership nowadays. No internet no monthly charges no load-times. Just play and go.
5,Quality product. Didn't expect much so I was pleasantly surprised at the software and features! I can set it to pick up noise at a certain level so I can record myself snoring. The ability to bookmark a track is awesome for audiobooks. 10/10 would buy again!
1,The player is to sensitive. Hard to keep on when in the pocket.
5,Basic kit.
5,I bought this for my mama for Mother’s Day because she talking about she wanted an MP3 player. So I bought it I unboxed it I put music on it and I played with it. And OMG i love it for myself. It’s so easy to use and it’s Bluetooth capable and it comes with a memory card…YAY I FREAKIN LOVE IT!!!
5,We have received the product in perfect conditions. We loved it! It arrived on time it has high quality.
5,This is very good music player. It contains all the functions you need. It's very convenient to use. It's worth the investment.
5,Great product can't wait to see if this company comes out with anything that is shuffle only
5,I was looking for something that I could get for my daughter that was simple to use and could play audio files  and not have too many additional features. I ended up purchasing this because it looked like exactly what I needed. My kids are home schooled and a lot of their learning is by listening to audio following along with the curriculum.This seems like it has decent build quality and should last a while for what we need it for. The audio is good even when used for listening to music. The menus and functionality works well and is pretty easy to get used to. So far we have used this to listen to mp4's and it has worked well.
5,Good product.
5,Great product
5,This was a very easy product to use works great!
5,Very nice ❤️
5,I bought this for my son. He loves it so much! Has plenty of features to load his music. It files them by Artist and places music alphabetically. Songs are easy to find and connect to bluetooth in the car.
5,I love how small and how good the battery life
5,Great product. Quality sound without the buds. And battery life is better than the last one different brand I had.
5,Everything about this is good the battery life sound quality to the user interface. The best thing is that this gives off an iPod type of vibe to it.
5,Great product
1,I guess for the price it will be ok.
5,Great size fast shipment. Great buy!
5,I really love it!!! Really like that I have an arm wrap to put it in when out walking.  Thank You
5,Its good and small MP3 to take with you like a small cell phone. Nice and slim
5,Looks good. Havent downloading my music to it yet
5,Excellent MP3 player. 32GB is plenty for holding a large library of songs. I originally bought on of these for my son and decided I needed one for myself. Battery life has been great the bluetooth functionality allows for a wide variety of applications  and the sound quality is excellent. A great player for the money and highly recommended.
5,Worked out of box
2,It stopped working after 3 months.
5,Just what I needed. Works great for listening to the radio or any music I put on it. Love taking it with me for all the walks I go on. Couldn't ask for a better product.
5,Easy to use small item works great on the motorcycle for long trips
5,I really like how conveniently sized this mp3 player is. The face that it came with an arm band was awesome. And love the fact that it has a radio option and that you can download ebooks on it.
5,I liked all it would do.It was a little complicated.But good for price.
5,The user interface is great quality earbuds with great sound quality. The battery life is amazing so you do not have to plug up to a charger all of the time.
1,Does not par all the time with my computer and it does not pick up where you leave off on songs..not user friendlySound was good..
5,Good sound quality easy to use arrived fast and good battery life!
1,After initially reviewing this device as 5 stars it went down to one star. the reason for this is after trying to use it I found the navigation very hard to use and confusing there is no manual that can be easily followed to show you how to use the device. Also be aware of the scam that you can get $30 in Amazon credit if you review this device at 5 stars its just that a scam.
5,Easy to use and great battery life
4,I like this item It's just I have yet to figure out how to put music on it. My laptop doesn't have a slot for CD's. One of these days learn how.
4,El reproductor me agrada lo utilizo para escuchar música camino la trabajo
5,Gave as a gift.
2,I got this to replace a similar player I got 18 months or so ago.  (The previous one was starting to fail... headphone jack was hit-and-miss power button was problematic.)  It came packed in a sturdy attractive box along with some cheezy-looking earbuds and the USB connector cable instruction booklet and an armband holder.  (If you wear your player on your arm the holder looks well-made - wide elastic velcro strap clear plastic to view the front of the player and a reflective strip around the perimeter for nighttime visibility.It comes with a 32GB micro-SD card.  Apparently no onboard memory.  I pulled the 32GB card and inserted my 128GB card (used in the previous player) charged it up and powered it on.The interface is fairly straightforward.  There are "touch buttons" to navigate the icons on the small display screen.  I set the calendar and clock.  (Not particularly useful... but it DOES have an onboard alarm that I might use at some point.)  Some other "features" that won't be useful to me (primarily due to the tiny display): book reader and video player.  It has Bluetooth; I haven't tried that yet but expect it to be straightforward.  It has a "recorder" feature - might be handy.  I bought it primarily for portable hi-fi music delivery so that's what I checked out first.I powered it on quickly navigated to the "folder view" (my default - I have my MP3s in "album" folders).  Decided to go with something very familiar... "Help!" by The Beatles.  It sounded GOOD!  Even better when I set the "rock" EQ setting.  I gave it a "road test"... put it in my default rig that hangs about my neck (see photo) and took it on a 2-hour bicycle ride.  It performed just fine... and at the end of the ride the battery-charge indicator hadn't budged.  That's a promising sign that battery life is LONG as advertised.  (It claims 8 hours of continuous playback... that would be adequate for my needs.  A little longer would be fine too.)Some of the reviewers complain about limited volume.  When bicycling (not a particularly noisy environment but not monastery-quiet either) I had it turned to 11 - pretty low.  I sometimes listen while motorcycling (MUCH more ambient noise!)... I'm cautiously optimistic it'll work fine.  (In the settings there's a maximum volume limiter.  Hopefully the people who didn't have enough volume are aware of that.  And if you need it to play louder I'm pretty sure you are putting your hearing at risk long-term.)  Oh - and when no phones are plugged in you can hear the music through a tiny onboard speaker.  But believe me - it's NOT adequate for a quality listening experience.I've currently got my 128GB memory card about 3/4 full - 23367 tracks.  It seems to take it in stride... at least in the "folder view."My first impression is quite positive.  My concerns - and time will tell - durability.  Portable MP3 players have a pretty harsh existence.  Changes in temperature and humidity bounced around a lot.  It's a "torture test" for the life of the player.  We'll see if the components - switches earphone jack etc. - stand the test of time.  Also I'm always concerned about whether the display is scratch-resistant.  This one claims to have "2.5D Double-side Acrylic Glass" whatever that means.  The previous one was quite obscured by the end of its life - you had to hold it at just the right angle to minimize glare to read the screen.  I intend to UPDATE this review with my long-term observations.---UPDATE - August 2021I purchased this MP3 player on January 9.  It failed on August 10.  It is now a shiny black brick.  So I s'pose if your expectation is 7 months of useful life this player might be for you.  I'm quite disappointed.  (NO apparent damage... no drops or soakings etc... just doesn't respond to the power button any more.)I contacted aiworth's tech-support using the email address.  They quickly responded... but it's become quite evident that no help is forthcoming.  (They keep asking me what I see when I power it on - NOTHING - and asked me to send a photo.  I sent a photo of the shiny black brick.  I doubt it helped.)Fortunately I paid a couple bucks for an Asurion protection plan.  I contacted them; they are refunding my money which I'll use to try a different brand MP3 player (and buy an Asurion plan for it!).
3,I use this mp3 player for music. I think the screen needs to be easier to read. All wording is not very clear unless you have great vision. I will probably not be able to use this device outdoors during the daytime. It is impossible to see the screen outdoors especially on a sunny day. I have an older Sony MP3 player that is very easy to read.I am still learning how to get the best performance out of it. Sound from the tiny speaker is ok and it sounds great on some decent Bluetooth speakers. Would be nice if it came with better instructions as well as guidance to download songs. Not a touchscreen device as advertised. You touch directional arrows below the tiny screen.  This product is not very expensive so I can’t be too critical. Overall it does a nice job for the price.
5,I ordered this to use at work in a noisy factory setting. I am 62 and not all that skilled with new electronics. But this wonderful little device arrived with the most informative instruction sheet I have seen in forever. I was comfortably able to navigate thru it all.  Thank you!
5,I bough this for my daughter who is 7. She has no problem managing it in her own. Very easy to transfer music files to. Sound is very good
5,Buy it now the best one of the 6 I had
5,This is easy to use for my 13 year old. It comes with headphones which I didn't expect
5,I purchase this as a gift for my significant other but also tried it out for myself.  The music quality is great and added music was a sync.  There are some other great features to that you can try and use.  Thinking about getting one for myself to use at work.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a great MP3 player.
5,Great for a radio in an older car.
5,Bought this for my father so he can listen to the old radio show "The Shadow Knows" while he's driving.
1,I first time look no working power not good quality
2,Worked fine the first night I had it.  FM radio was ok.  Sound quality was so-so but I put that down to the radio.  Put some flacs and mp3s in and played them the next day.  Very underwhelmed with the sound.  Tried my good iems my bluetooth speaker and plugged into a sound system.  Sound quality was lacking overall.  Not good in the lows and bass region.  Not very detailed in the highs and mids.  Tried all the eq options available and heard very little difference.  Then the player started stopping by itself.  Powered itself down several times.  Battery showed fine and I had charged it fully the night before.  Not worth anymore effort.  I returned it.
4,Just got it and it seems ok
5,Ok so it’s my first MP3 player. Who ever thought I needed one of these! I will never scratch a cd again…awesome. It shuffles thousands of songs and plays on every Bluetooth device I have. Great storage easy to load with music. Handy little gadget you need one.
5,This Aiworth digital audio player (DAP) is amazing considering its very low cost. I purchased this Aiworth DAP to replace my 11+ year old Sony Walkman DAP. The Sony Walkman still works well but the battery will no longer hold a charge for very long (after 11 years I have no complaints). The Aiworth DAP sounds great and the battery will hold a charge for a very very long time. The digital audio converter (DAC) chip in this Aiworth DAP sounds very close to the Wolfson DAC in my Fiio X3 DAP when playing high quality FLAC files. However even MP3 files at or above 256 kbps sound really good on the Aiworth DAP. The interface on the Aiworth DAP is very basic and it is very easy to figure out without reading the included instructions. The interface actually looks a lot like the Sony Walkman's interface that the Aiworth replaced. The lighted capacitive touch buttons are nice and very responsive but the screen itself is not an actual touch screen. The Bluetooth connects to anything audio that will receive Bluetooth signals with no issues at all. The built-in speaker is loud for its size but it sounds like an old transistor radio speaker. However the speaker is good for "testing" newly transferred audio files. The included headphones are decent but not great. I dislike "earbuds" anyway and prefer to use the Aiworth DAP with my Sennheiser over-the-ear headphones or plugged/Bluetoothed into external amplified speakers. This Aiworth DAP  will get very loud with quality headphones  or external speakers and it sounds really clear with no distortion. There is a seven setting "graphic equalizer" and also a peak volume limiter function in the sound settings menu. The Aiworth DAP is plug and play. Just plug the USB cable into the Aiworth and a computer and it will mount like an external USB drive. Then drag and drop the music files from the computer to the Aiworth. The Aiworth DAP recognizes "most" popular digital audio file formats but it will not recognize AAC or M4A files so Apple users are out of luck. However any music file format can be easily converted  (type not quality) with free online or downloadable conversion software like "Switch Audio Converter." The Aiworth DAP does have trouble recognizing file structures with folders more than 2 layers deep and also folder names with special characters but this shortcoming is easy to work around by limiting folder depth and keeping folder names simple. The Aiworth DAP seems to be able to recognize any music file name though just not every type of file. The Aiworth DAP will "shuffle-all." You just have to scroll to the very top of the "play all" music library listing to find the setting. Creating playlists on the Aiworth DAP is a painstakingly slow process. It is easier to just create "playlist" folders on a computer and then transfer the folder to the Aiworth DAP. The Aiworth DAP does not have any internal storage but the company includes a generic 32 GB Micro SD (TF) card to store files on (upgradable to 128 GB). Transferring music files by USB cable is convenient but also very slow. If you have a lot of files to transfer you are better off getting a good USB-3 to Micro SD card reader and transferring files without directly using the Aiworth DP as the transfer interface. The speed difference in the two file transfer processes is around six times faster using an external Micro SD card reader. I don't use the voice recorder or e-book features so I can't really comment on how well those functions work. However if they both work as well as the audio playback functions then they should be nice features for someone that can utilize them. Overall I would say that the Aiworth DAP is a very nice music player especially at this low price point. Yes there are "better" DAP companies out there but some of those devices can cost hundreds of dollars (like my Fiio DAP). I had never actually heard of Aiworth before purchasing this DAP. However if the longevity of this Aiworth DAP is as good as the functionality and sound quality then Aiworth has found a new and very satisfied customer for life.There is one caveat to note:  The Aiworth DAP does not have a "normalize" setting to level the gain/volume on all music files so songs don't all play at the same volume. This is one feature I really miss that is on the Sony Walkman and also on many other DAP brands. However music files can be "normalized" on a computer by processing them with "MP3 Gain" (MP3 files only only) "AVS4YOU" (all music file types) or another audio file processing software before transferring them to the Aiworth DAP. Then all music files will play at the same volume level.
2,Doesn’t do the music shuffle on resume or very well otherwise.Does not have a lock after choosing a function there for if touched will switch.Hard to create a playlist.
4,Overall solid.  Sounds is good. Battery life is fantasticThe Bluetooth seems ok.  Some in and out.Biggest thing with this player is the screen is very dark and is really hard to see outside. Would be great if there was a brighter screen
5,I'm pretty skeptical about buying off amazon but this is byfar the best mp3 player ive ever had and was a good price for what i got. super sleak and classy looking too!
5,Works great with my Bluetooth earbuds  holds a lot of songs
5,Sleek design conveniently comes with headphones and cable
5,This MP3 player is very easy to use and down load music to. Delivery was fast and ahead of time. Would recommend this item to everyone.
5,Only short coming was the direction did not say how to download from computer file.It showed how to record a single song only.
5,Exactly what I wanted
5,Everything as advertised
5,The Mp3 player has an easy-to-use interface sound quality is good and it is a good size. Good option to listen to your offline music!
5,I am very satisfied with the Mp3 player it was a gift for my daughter. If needed I would purchase it again.The sound quality is worth the buy.
5,I gave this to an elderly relative as a gift so they could listen to music at night through their earbuds and they are very happy with the sound quality.  Their only quibble is that it took a little time to learn how to navigate the interface because it was a bit cluttered.  They would have preferred a simple PLAY button but it took only a few minutes to figure out how to use it.  We downloaded plenty of music for them so they have been listening and enjoying it with absolutely no real complaints.  All in all I have to say that if you want a straightforward MP3 player (with a few extra bonuses if you want or need them) then you can't go wrong with this one.
2,Sound distortion and difficultly with Bluetooth
5,to listen to music
5,Really good I got this for my fiancé as a Christmas present and she really loves it as well as the arm band that came with it for working out. Small and compact.
5,This item was so easy to set up and I was instantly enjoying the great sound and the smoothness of the device and its features.
5,Great little MP3 player!
5,Really good
1,I had high hopes for this player based on the great reviews and features. They were immediately dashed as soon as I tried to turn it on. It completely charged in less than two hours but it always said it was trying to charge every time I connected it to my laptop. That was its second problem. My HP never recognized it no matter how many times I tried. Not that I had much time to play with it because it completely shut down within ten seconds every time I turned it on. Needless to say I immediately returned it. Maybe I got a bad unit and maybe I should have ordered another one but I just couldn't bring myself to give it another shot. I'm so tired of cheap Chinese junk but I don't want to spend the money for an iPod. So I guess it's on to another unit.
5,I love this product! The sound quality is great! Better quality than some other players that I've had. The battery life is very reliable. I like that it last for his of continued play. The user interface is nice. It's easy to use and colorful. I would recommend this product!!
5,Bought as a gift for my mom her new vehicle didn't have a CD player and she was lost without her music and books this worked wonderful for an older woman that doesn't like technology. SIMPLE and light weight. Does exactly what I needed!
1,I dislike that I can not connect to my phone. I’m also not happy that it did not say it comes with earphones so I ordered some. It looks cheaply made and the directions do not tell you how to download music to it. I went to my order and tried to return it but it won’t let me. Very disappointed.
5,Got this as a gift for hubby and he absolutely loves it and can listen even without headphones since the speaker is super loud. Wish it was touchscreen but was a great buy nonetheless!
5,Love it. Not cheap but I have no complaints. Matched with the fa9 they kick ass...
4,Nice product. Easy to use. A touch screen would make it much easier to work with though I am sure it would cost more.
1,The mp3 player doesn't want to connect to the computer to receive music it only charges. My husband managed intermittently to get some music on and then it says "disk error" and erases all the music. Garbage product! Very disappointed!
5,Walter Williams very easy setup easy blue tooth hookup good sound quality nice display
5,Straight forward. Seems like a good piece.
5,No issues with this guy works great. Battery life is amazing. I used it all day streaming on bluetooth on the first day and it was still showing full charge. Perfect as a media replacement for those that don't want to waste space/battery on their phone. Bluetooth worked well. Support was very helpful and responsive helping me update the firmware to the device.
4,Pros:- lightweight design- affordable price- comes with a micro SD card- you can take out the micro SD card and add your own larger size- speaker so you don't need to put on headphones- comes WITH cabled headphones if you want to use headphonesCons:- file names are not song names- not a touch screen which would have been nice but it is easy to navigate.- screen and back are made of the same easily scratched material mine got scratched just being in my fanny pack and i also dropped it and it got scratched. get a case if you can.- no volume button on the sides not really a mandatory thing but if you're interrupted it would make sense to have buttons on the side to just put the volume downI have not tried the bluetooth i thought my car had bluetooth but apparently it does not.I tried the voice record a little bit and it would come in handy for taking notes but I'm not sure if the built in microphone is the best.I have not tried the "ebook" feature but others say you have to put in txt files.I had transferred my old ipod music to this one and there were some video files it does not play those videos they were in the wrong format. The song files I had were named 4 letter names like "IXVK.mp3" and "SMNH.mp3" and that is what displays on the screen instead of the song title.Other than that I am impressed with this little device. Again get a case if you get this I wish I had
5,It works well unlike the mp3 I've received before. I definitely recommend!
5,This is a nice little device at an affordable cost. It is very light and small so portable.A few features it had I didn’t realize: fm radio ebooks and radio.Came with an armband and headphones which was an unexpected plus.Has Bluetooth so I can pair with wireless speakers.
5,I've had this for a little over a year now. I typically don't leave reviews often but this is a wonderful product. The sound is clear even without earbuds. I love it! It works well even to this day and functions as a good gift. Very easy to use as well.
5,Perfect size but get the case. Is pretty durable but the case makes it nice.
5,compact light wait
1,Says it connects to bluetooth headphones but it's been nothing but problems. Claims to play many formats of music but apparently that's not true because it constantly says FORMAT NOT SUPPORTED. Waste of money and won't be ordering anything more from them. I don't even wanna give it 1 star!!
5,I love this little thing! I bought it to have music to listen to as I work out. Soon as I got it and turned it on I really liked how it looked and felt. The capacity is very large and holds lots of music probably more than I'll listen to...lol. This little thing will get plenty of use for sure.
5,Excellent product. Easy to use. My son loves it. Great price
4,Nice looking player but had to email their support to get instructions for downloading MP3 files onto player.
5,It's a great product. You can download the music directly or onto SD card and then onto the MP3. light and easy to handle it comes with 32G of data in an SD card you can upgrade a great deal for the price. I take it jogging so I don't break my phone if I trip.
5,Good appearance I do not know how it works because but I have not used it yet
5,What i like is that it will easily connect to my car via bluetooth and organization is easy all you need to do is create an Artists folder and put another folder with your artist ex: Artists/Ramones. also you can create playlist of the device which is pretty cool
5,This MP3 player is perfect for my needs.  I was expecting the front to be completely touchscreen but the top half isn't touchscreen.  The buttons are touchscreen on the bottom half of the player. Nevertheless it is pretty easy to use.
2,Got it a the start of October worked beyond expectations. A week later I can't get the screen to come up. The buttons light up and I can hear music showing it still works but I can't get the screen to come up.
5,Amazing battery life. Product works very well and I recommend.
4,This thing works great don't use data from my phone account. It also records - It is working pretty good - ha Cons would be cannot read the screen in the Sun.
5,I like the look and feel.  I felt like the instructions could have been given for how to get files to the player.  Luckily I am tech savvy and was able to quickly figure out to just drop the music into the root folder of the player.
5,Set up was very easy.  Works well with decent sound quality.  Well worth the money...
5,Great for our 10 year old son! Battery lasts plenty long for road trips!
5,Works Great!
5,I bought this to connect to the Bluetooth on my 2013 Yamaha Vstar Deluxe and it works great.  It had features I didn’t even know about like a built in speaker and microphone that can be used as a recording device.
5,I really like the fact that I can load music to this unit  plus have the FM radio feature to listen to music and news
5,Acabo de recivirlo y al parecer sera una excelente compra...
5,Needed a replacement when my ipod died.  Great replacement at 10% of the cost.  Sound quality is robust no trouble with bluetooth connectivity and an FM radio as an extra  Used while running outside with no issues.  Would recommend
5,This MP3 player is really worth it love it .Thank you Amazon 😊
5,Everything is great
5,works good. i use it for music.
5,Easy to use
5,Bought for my dad. He loves it and used his 128gb microSD card and works well!
5,I love this product it is a very high quality product and it is very convenient and easy to use.  I will definitely would be buying more and 100% recommend. I love the style the quality and everything about it go ahead and buy one its worth the money!
5,very good mp3!
5,It's easy to use arrived on time not sure of battery life yet
5,Small but great sound and quality!  Thanks.
5,I Can Not get this Damned thing going!!!!
5,It does what it is supposed to and does not break up when you are moving around.Buy it!
5,User interface battery life sound quality great. Easy to load music.
5,We bought this MP3 player for our son for Christmas last year and he loves it! It is still working great almost a year later.
1,I am 70yrs old. I couldn't figure it out even with the instructions. My young friend tried he couldn't figure it out.  This item is NOT ADVISED FOR OLDER FOLKS like myself.  The learning curve is simply too long. Sorry but I am returning the item.  I'm sure it's great for some but not for me.👎
5,You would think products like this are obsolete however this purchase was awesome. Sound clarity was great for such a cheap price and I love the touch screen feature. This is what my kids will have until they can graduate to bigger gifts.
5,Good little MP3 player. Very easy to use and download music on. Also has good sound.
1,Junk that is hiding the actual battery capacity
3,As my title states: I had an old itouch4 which I've used as an mp3 player for the last 12 years lost it 😥 so got this bad boy!EDIT 9/13/21: When the device overheats it get's stuck in Voice Record mode. If you ever find it doing this cool it down and then try again. Also Shuffle isn't entirely random. If you select a song to start playing music shut down the device and select the SAME song to start music again you'll find it playing the same "random" songs in order. To fix this start playing music with a different song.EDIT 5/3/21: To make playlists create a folder within the directory and place desired music there. Onboard software only supports 3 playlists and adding songs is slow and arduous because the controls aren't the most responsive.Was seeking a cheap mp3 option which replicated an itouch4's capability: 3.5mm jack bluetooth playlists a lock button... and this is it! The screen isn't as responsive as an apple touch screen but once you get the music playing you just lock it and go about your business.
5,This was a gift and the person who received it is pleased with the unit.
5,Okay product a little disappointing
4,It should have a clip so I can hang it on my shorts but generally I liked it so far.Also looks like they did not put a lot of thoughts when they were placing the buttons on it (a little confusing).BUTWorked like a chime.Bluetooth connected right away.Transferring music files is simple as I expected.It is light and thin.The sound (volume) is just perfect.
5,The size is about the size I expected it to be which was what I was most worried about. It is almost unnoticeable when It is carried around so perfect transport ability. no to mention that it connects to Bluetooth so it is super convenient to carry it around without the cable.
4,Fairly simple to us.  Blue tooth connection was an issue.  Even in my pants Pocket the connection was intermittent.
5,Very easy to download music I like the option of playing my music using the speakers in the player.
5,I was tired of buying MP3 players that either break due to made from plastic or quit working. This player was more expensive that the ones I usually purchase but it is durable and the sound is excellent. Very well pleased with the purchase.
5,My son enjoys listening while he’s at work.
4,Sound could be much better but for the price ok... I guess
5,Help!!  I bought a128 GB card to use in this player.  I drag and drop using a windows 10 laptop.  Seems like all .mp3s are on the player but the user interface on the player does not see all my music.  I have tried transferring 4 or 5 times now.  My patience is beyond wearing thin.  Same thing happened with the pre-installed 32GB card.  I suspect the UI to be the culprit here.  Every time the player goes through searching(2/28/21) Update: I have discovered a solution!  If you have multiple .mp3's on the player with the exact same file name the UI on the player will fail rebuilding the music library.  Make sure all .mp3's have unique file names.  It's a nasty nasty chore.  But necessary for the music library to search/rebuild successfully.  I'm now very happy with the player.
5,The directions are easy to follow and it works like I had hoped.  Just use it for music so no idea about videos.  I have bought 2 other inexpensive mp3 players which failed soon after I used them.  So far so good on this one and sure hope it continues.  Am very very happy with it so far!
5,Works great and simple to use
5,I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for a trip so 9 didn't want to get something super expensive that could get broken or stolen. This was perfect. It easy to use and the battery last a really long time. She loves it and uses it all the time.
5,The screen is sometimes difficult to see in bright light. The volume control could be easier and louder. Getting to the shuffle takes too many steps. Lots to learn to manage this player.
5,Amazing Mp3 player. Highly recommend!
1,I do not know why this product is best seller  I bought it for my son to listen educational music from youtube but when I download music it doesn't play at all this product is not working. Menu is very slow and is loading long time Radio is not working at all air pods are very low quality. USB is too short and its uncomfortable to use with PC. can anyone explain why this product is bestseller?
4,I have a number of Mp3 players so the UI of this one was very simple to me.  There are not many bells and whistles with this player it just does what it is meant to do play music.  It plays FLAC files which is the only thing I really care about.  I don't use shuffle or make playlists so that is not a complaint.  Some of my music will not play because of the format limitation of the player but I have higher priced players to solve that problem.  The player is pretty loud and most of my earbuds have dedicated volume so the volume limit is no problem for me.  If you want audiophile quality music on the go with a few limits this player is worth a go.
5,I wanted something small to listen to music on and or radio instead of my IPhone when I do for a run.I also let my 5 year old son use it as well.It kind of reminds me of my smaller apple ipod nano.Yet I love the sleek look to this MP3.I would recommed if your looking for something small and sleek to listen to your music and or radio stations.
5,I can't speak for the bluetooth radio or  e-book function since I only use this device to listen to music but the battery life on this thing is incredible! The controls take a bit getting used to at first but after thirty minutes of tinkering with it I find it easy and simple to use. The speaker is amazing! Very loud and good quality so no need to use headphones if you don't want to.
5,This devis is soo cool the battery life is awesome.  Sincerely this is the best MPc I have bought soo far . The touch screen is soo cool the fm works soo welln
5,bought this for my son to use while running. Easy to use pairs with wireless headphones. good price.
3,Comes with great accessories but is rather expensive for the quality of the product. Does not come pre-loaded with any digital files. Does not have exterior volume adjustment controls.
5,Really great value for the money! My kids love them.
4,I needed a MP3 player to loop a few things that were on my hard drive. The instruction weren't clear to me or others who attempted to help me. I wrote customer service and they responded quite quickly. The challenge was that I had never seen a charging cord double for a transfer cord as well. They also shared with me to try a different USB port. It worked. The sound quality of the unit is not so great although when played through an outside Anker speaker it played well.
5,Was a Christmas gift for son and his words were “ just what I needed”.  Bluetooth to a big woofer and very pleased.Easier to navigate than attempt to follow instructions.  Terrible layout of instructions.  Works great so far.
4,Just got this and the first day went well it was charged and it loaded songs ok sped not the fastest.but i was having issues with the Bluetooth right away it wouldn't find any of 3 devices we have for this to work with about 2 hours into retrying it finally found the Yamaha ATS-2090 and connected!great! it was doing good but has a limited volume and sounded kind of toneless at times but nothing really bad unless like me i love sound and want to hear it all as it was intended but all of a sudden the connection was clipping at less then a foot away from the sound bar! i tried moving it away a bit and that failed  so i was about to stop the player and it corrected it self and so far working ok 3 times. thats all ive got so far. more to come as i use it more an with the other 2 speakers we have.
5,Everything works great but the Blue Tooth doesnt like my Sound Rover speaker system which this was intended for so.... Still a decent product for price.
4,I love this player but the interface is giving me problems and not sure if its defective or not-Can't get English on it and there are ZERO characters on the screen to even choose anything to doAny ideas?
4,Very nice mp3 player but not a touch screen if that is ok highly recommend
5,Great for listening to audio books. The sound is and it has the Bluetooth for connecting with all kinds devices. The UI takes some getting use to as navigation through it to find things is a bit of work. Some files will need converting before playing. It doesn't look bad either.
5,It was really easy to set up and get everything started
3,The Aiworth 32GB Mp3 Player with Bluetooth 5.0  is good in so many ways but ultimately is inferior to my old Sony NWE395. It has a nice form responsive interface comes with 32gb of storage etc. But where it counts it falls down. For one thing it doesn't automatically reconnect with my Bluetooth headphones when it has been powered on. But most of all it just doesn't sound very good. I have tried with both OTIUM bluetooth and Sony wired headsets. The sound is just very mid range oriented with thin bass. None of the equalizer presets add much bass to the sound and there is no custom equalizer setting. And the volume is barely adequate. This player has a lot of attractive features but sadly playing music is where it comes up short. Pass. I returned it.
4,Bought two of these for my younger kids and so far so good. Work just fine.
4,It's a great buy. The user interface is straight forward and very easy to use. On point. The  sound quality for the speaker is louder than I expected. The only thing is I would say is I am struggling with putting videos onto it. I know it takes amv/avi format. It shows up when I put the videos on the device in one of the 2 formats but when I click on it all it says is format error and doesn't work... If anyone could help me out with this it would be greatly appreciated...
5,Great Aiworth MP3 player...love the size of it easy to use and it plays great music and loved the price too....holds a ton of songs...just added over 2000 songs and there is still plenty of room for more....would definitely recommend this product!!
5,Purchased as gift - recipient likes it and uses it everyday to listen to music. Especially nice to be able to use bluetooth headphones for a wireless experience.
5,Good
5,The long life battery last for half a day. Quality sound not the best but worth the price.
4,Good
5,WOW! This is something else. I have never seen such an attractive media player like this! I am just floored with the crystal clear sound and the ease of use. It is so small I can vary it in my top pocket. I will have to hide this or my wife and sin will want to "borrow" it! It had a clear film covering the screen and the whole device to prevent scratches or smudges. Comes with ear phones and charger and a nice sturdy box to keep it in when traveling. Will hold thousands of songs with perfect clarity and no static or surges.
5,It's a well designed device that does exactly what it says. Simple to setup and no complicated controls. Useful when I want to play media and not drain my phone's battery. Easy to use and works great!
5,My son 13 year old  thinks it awesome! sounds great small and compact and can play videos very user friendly
5,Love it husband uses at the gym
5,I fought to get music on this MP3 player. I just couldn't figure it out. My boy came over and humbled me once again. You have to look at the display when you plug in the device so you can put music on the device.
5,The player has lots of features my old one did not have.  The blue tooth is great and I know longer have to use my cell phone for listening to music on my walks
5,Love the quality of sound.
5,Bought this for my son who is autistic and listens to music when he sleeps. This thing has been on all day and hasn't died yet. Easy for him to use as well.
5,I wasn't really expecting the product to be as great as it is. It works perfectly and the battery life last for a long time. It's easy to figure out without using the manual that's provided. The audio quality is great and there's many different features that come with it. I'd totally recommend this to a friend with no hesitation!
5,Could not get it to sync via Bluetooth in my car. Only option was Bluetooth address and it took forever just to tell me that it didn’t work. Takes a bit to get used to but it’s still pretty cool and I like that fact that it will hold so many songs!
1,It was broken in 9 months. It is not easy to use. It was a piece of junk.
2,I liked the prompt delivery. However after putting music on the micro SD card that came with the player I keep getting an error message (see photo). I dont know what I did wrong but all I get is an error message. I was so happy to have a mp3 player that could play music via bluetooth. I have yet to hear music on the player since the error message I keep getting. I'm not happy! Im not sure if I have a defective player.
4,After initially having a problem with it locking up after loading the wrong file format I let it sit for a while and it's working fine.  I loaded the correct file format and everything is working great
5,Haven't used it enough to know about the battery life but after getting used to the touchscreen buttons and how to navigate the menus it is very user friendly.
5,I clean windows for a living and I want my music or Audio books to come through crisp and San disc has never let me down.Since my books are mp4's I bought this little 16 gig MP 4 playing San disc
5,Very good quality. My son has it with him all the time edoecially when he goes out for walking.
5,User friendly excellent battery life & sound was fabulous!  Definitely recommend this mp3player.
5,Easy to work and to upload music too and great sound
1,Not the most intuitive device but I got used to it pretty quickly. Unfortunately the on/.off button broke (just sank into the body and became inoperable) after very light use in just two months.
5,Ordered item and it was received promptly. Directions were easy to follow and the sound quality is amazing.  This item was purchased for something to play music on for my new vehicle. I am very happy with the product
5,Pairs easily to my bluetooth headset. Good sound quality. Very convenient for listening to music on the go.
5,It’s easier then using my phone and that’s what I needed. We Used this on long road  trips so no one fights over songs and we don't waste data from phones. Setting up playlists was really easy and now everyone can play their own songs. it didn't kill the battery fast and great screen quality.
5,Bought the main reason is to want to give the child to listen to the story with just take the hand feel is very good the work is very delicate folder player can let the child choose his own favorite story but also can adjust the playing speed really super practical don't want to let the child stare at the phone all day can get this
4,Came on time. Looks just like the photo. Easy to hook up. Love the bright colors. Came with a arm band that we didn't know which was really nice
5,Nice mp3 for the price.
5,I am really enjoying this mp3 player. Easy to use and the sound is great!
5,I like the interface and the sound and the battery. I like the way it charged up so fast. The sound is great. I love the mp3 player. Now I can listen to 97.1 in the morning. The Steve Harvey morning show. Love how small it is.
5,excellent all around!
5,I used this product to listen to music.
5,product arrived timely.works well. is easy to figure. is just the right product.
5,Husband is loving it. It is hooking up to all his devices without a problem plus the Bluetooth feature is a bonus
5,Very easy to use and works great!
5,Awesome product. Super light and easy to use
4,The look and the feel of This MP3 player the FM tuner sounds great the only issue I'm having right now is trying to Bluetooth my ear buds but I'm sure they are compatible
4,The sound quality was very good and I enjoy how long the battery life last as I use it almost everyday.
5,Plays music outloud
5,This is the very first Bluetooth music player I own and I love it!  It has almost everything I want it. Just disappointed no earbuds came with it but I have a pair of my own.
5,With Covid we are unable to sit inside our favorite bar / restaurant so miss hearing the jukebox since we are all outside. This inexpensive mp3 player allows us to store and listen to our favorite music without using our data plans and battery life to stream music. I can also leave this with my friends so when I am not there everyone can still enjoy it. It is very easy to transfer data and syncs seamlessly to my BT speaker so we can all enjoy the music. It also comes with the capability to listen to FM radio that uses a wired headphone to act as an antenna.
5,Very handy and easy to install/operate.
5,Great features for such a low price! Solid case 5.0 Bluetooth large capacity (32gb) even an armband. Quality sound with my bluetooth wireless headphones.
5,Bought this to replace my iPod classic that was 20 years old and it is a suitable replacement
5,Really nifty mp3 player. It's so convenient to use when working out. It has 32 gb data is enough for listening all type of music. I am usually using it while on my walk very good sound system.  I have been taking up storage on my phone with music and this was a great device to transfer my music to free up phone space. Really find the product to be impressive so far has really good sound quality.
5,This has a nice design appearance feel. This product is amazing easy to use and sound quality from it is superb! I use this when working out and love that it’s super lightweight a small bag to put the mp3 player in and even a runner's arm pocket. On top of that the battery life is amazing! I used it for 9 hours straight for music the first day and the charge only dropped about an eighth of the way down. I highly recommend!
5,If you are looking for an MP3 player for working out or running this is a pretty good choice.  It comes with a small charging cable arm band and head phones.  The arm band is decent although I had to poke a hole for the head phone jack but the buttons are easily accessible though the clear screen. The sound quality is decent. It won’t be replacing your smart phone anytime soon but for working out its good enough.  The only draw back is that I can only get 3 play lists and it does not recognize m3u files.  There are also other features like a voice recorder Bluetooth radio and small speaker.  They may not be use full for working out but kind of need to have.
5,it's a very well made machine.
5,Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!  It's small lightweight and has a ton of space for all of her music.  The color is very nice.  It feels to be of solid quality as well.  Excellent Christmas gift.
5,This MP3 player produces great music quality it is user friendly and pair great with my wireless headset. Great product & quality
5,The operation is very simple it can be used simply the sound quality is good it looks good the feel is also very good the memory is very large and it can store all my songs. It's really great.
1,2nd one I have bought and it does not work at all. It just freezes!!! Was suppose to be a gift for my brother and he can’t use it at all. Anyone else having this problem??? Really sucks! I’m going to have to return it again!
1,This product was very bad it only work for  four daysI just want to return it for a full refund
5,Bought this for storing my favorite MP3s and portability aspects.  Sound quality is sufficient for my needs which include linking with my Bluetooth headphones during outdoor activity or linking with portable speaker units at various locations within the home.  Very satisfied with this product and thinking of getting one for my wife as a present.
5,Has all of the great features I was looking for and a good price. Memory was a must and I still have room for music. Great product.
5,Great player.  Has many functions.  Easy to transfer music from my laptop to MP3/MP4 format.  I'm happy with the sound using Bluetooth or plugin earbuds.  I mostly use it for daily walks and hear the music just fine blocking out all the outdoor sounds.
5,I bought this so I wouldn't need to use my regular phone for music anymore and it's awesome. I love the bluetooth capabilities and that it comes with a case already. Very easy to use and setup. Take it wherever I go now.
5,Still working on transferring music
5,Love the sound and large storage only complaint is when you hold up or down it can go too far when scrolling.
