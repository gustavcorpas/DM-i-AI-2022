5,Comfortable to use just the right touch on the keys not loud like my older keyboard and convenient shortcut keys.  I bought this one to replace one with a broken key but I may purchase another to replace an old noisy one.
5,Quiet and comfy
4,I very much like the feel of this keyboard and it worked out of the box without any special drivers or customization.I dropped my rating to 4 stars for two reasons:1) The layout of the volume control buttons (which are the ones I use more often than anything else) is a little awkward.  I would much prefer they be separate from the others - or at least all on the end of the row. (Yes this is a quibble)2) More seriously the manual claims that the Music button launches the default music player.  It does not.  It launches Windows Media Player - and I've found no way to change that.  So that button ends up being useless to me.  (Again a bit of a quibble)Overall though I recommend it.
5,I  like the older style big key keyboard.  Hard to find these days but this definitely beats the newer chicklet style keyboards.  I do like this keyboard and definitely would recommend it.
5,Compare to Logitech and Microsoft keyboards I've purchased in the past this keyboard rates high with them. Very sleek includes the wrist rest and spacious keyboard and responsive buttons is a purchase I am happy with muchos gracias üèùÔ∏èüáµüá∑
5,This keyboard is just like the one I had from HP.  The only difference is it is much better with the build in wrist rest that doesn't come off.  All features are excellent  Great value for the money and you just plug it in and play.
4,Nice keyboard and works as expected. I love that it's full size. I gave it four stars because it is a bit loud. I would not consider this a quiet keyboard. If the sound of the keys doesn't bother you you will be fine. I would have prefer one with "quiet" keys and this is not it. Regardless I plan to keep it as it works as expected and was a good price.
5,Very comfortable to use.  No keys with errors.  Replaces my original IBM pc keyboard and I don't miss it.
5,I called the factory and they were very responsive. Amazon replaced it with no hassle. Works well. Super deal for the money
5,Well designed plug and play.  Met my expectations.  Stands out among wired keyboard choices.
5,So tired of any device with batteries.  I previously had 2 Logitech rechargeable keyboards.  What a hassle.  This one is wired ergonomic and slim enough.  I love it!  Only slight wish is for illuminated keys. What a good price responsive keys and good looking.  Just plug and play.  No drivers needed.
3,I've had a little trouble with the enter key getting stuck. I use Autodesk civil 3d for work and the other day I entered an "undo" command and the enter key stuck and wiped out about 20 minutes of work.üòê
5,Sturdy and substantial. Very ergonomic and easy to use. I like the wrist rest even though it increases the footprint of the keyboard.
5,Nothing bad to say on this at all. Love it!
5,I am very happy with this keyboard. It is exactly what I was looking for and is good quality at this price level. The keys do make a clicking sound which does not bother me. I've had it for a couple of weeks and everything is working just fine.
3,I bought this keyboard because it said quiet keyboard but it is anything but quiet.  I guess you get what you pay for but I will be switching back to my old keyboard that came with the computer because this one sounds like I‚Äôm slamming on the keys.  It‚Äôs a fine keyboard but is a loud one
5,works perfectly. love it would buy it again if needed
3,The keyboard quality seems good but the key click is pretty loud.
4,I like the bounce back of the keys and the ergonomic design. I wish it had USB ports but for a plain keyboard it does the trick.
5,Great keyboard. All I had to do was plug it in and it was ready to use. Love the size. And the keys are easy to use. Would recommend to anyone that wants a keyboard a bit larger than what comes standard with most computers.
5,This is a quality keyboard.  It is like the one I replaced and I love it.
4,I like this keyboard.  It doesn't have a Sleep mode button which I appreciate because my cat has a tendency to walk over my keyboard and press keys with her paws.  One thing: the Scroll Lock light is always on even when Scroll Lock itself is not on but I've gotten used to that.  Also the wrist rest is built-in so if you were hoping for a small keyboard with no wrist rest this isn't that.  But overall a good keyboard very easy to press keys.
5,product was shipped quickly and packed well. works infinitely better than my old keyboard- much quieter keys don't stick.
5,Great keyboard.  Extra short cut keys are a +.  Quiet as well.
4,I‚Äôm done with wireless keyboards that after a while lock up and can‚Äôt keep up.  This keyboard has a good feel and not loud at a great price
5,Needed a quiet keyboard that wasn‚Äôt expensive. This one is perfect
3,PROs:  Like the fact that the keyboard has good rubber "feet" so it does not slide around on a smooth desk.  Also is quiet and keys have a soft touch.  Like the ~2" of wrist support on front side of keyboard.  CONs:  Expected NOT to have a couple of USB ports on the edge of the keyboard (like many Dell keyboards) but adding those would be a boon to some. The raised plastic nub on the F and J keys are not nearly prominent enough -- should be easier for the index fingers to find without looking.  Also was disappointed that one of the "legs" (for elevating the top of the keyboard for better ergonomics) broke off after just a few days of use.  Must have put too much pressure on the keyboard at some point but prospective buyers should not depend on that feature lasting more than a few days or weeks.
5,This is the BEST keyboard
5,keyboard is great. delivery was prompt and I appreciate both.
3,I returned it because I realized I needed something much higher quality. If someone needs a cheap keyboard this could work fine. I wouldn't have bothered to write a review but the description says quiet keys and the keyboard I received did not have quiet keys.
5,Bought this as a gift for someone who has been working from home on a company laptop. A wireless keyboard was not permitted but the laptop needs to be elevated to a proper viewing height. This keyboard plugs into the laptop so it‚Äôs easy to install and comfortable to use. It allows the laptop and the keyboard to be used at different heights. It hasn‚Äôt been used for gaming so I couldn‚Äôt speak to its usefulness there. It was a really good price.
5,So I bought this keyboard to replace my old Microsoft keyboard I didn't feel like paying a lot of money for my work keyboard. I was pleasantly surprised on how well this keyboard works The keys are sensitive it's comfortable and I like the click sounds of the keys when typing. This is a great keyboard for the price.
5,The wrist rest is a little smaller than I like. But all in all very good feeling. The keys aren't all that loud. Very responsive. I use this for gaming. Love the extra keys at the top who doesn't need a 1 button touch calculator in their life?! (seriously I use this all the time for online D&D on Roll20)The only thing left is the test of time. This thing goes bad to fast I will be updating my review. 2 weeks in and all is well so far.
5,Just what was wanted
5,I'm finally happy with this keyboard after trying a few others before it. You don't have to push down too hard on the keys to get them to engage the letters aren't wearing off and there's an ergonomic bar for your hands to lean on while typing (which I didn't know I had any use for until I had it... it's not bad!).
2,So loud when typing. Also you have to press down aggressively to hit your letters. Had to send it back.
4,It came on time and so far it works very well.
4,Just a typical keyboard. Works great but it‚Äôs not ergonomic at all
5,Best wired keyboard ever! Has all the extras probably more then you`ll use(lol). Very happy with this board very comfortable to work with... Hope this helps you...
5,I bought this keyboard to replace a plug in Logitech I was using at home for work that was so hard to type on it was driving me nuts. This keyboard is exactly what I needed! Very responsive smooth and quiet.
2,It feels cheap and they used stickers that will wear off quickly
5,I needed to replace my wireless keyboard as it stopped working.  Decided to go with a plug in.  So glad I did. This came as expected and is exactly what I wanted.  Comfortable keyboard and is perfect for my needs.
3,I put it on the shelf and went back to my 15 year old loud long travel Compaq keyboard.Too many typing errors too light a touch required.
5,I bought several "name brand" keyboards thinking the quality would be better. This one is comfortable quiet has a hand rest and inexpensive.
5,I like how the placement of number keys on the keyboard.
5,This is perfect.  The wireless keyboard I had before was always freezing.. so this works perfect..
2,The keys on this keyboard were too close to feel comfortable typing. I tried but got a cheaper one that works great
5,Great keyboard quiet and slim.
1,The keyboard which I've been using for three months will either skip keystrokes or gets stuck on a key and repeats itself about 20 times. It's very frustrating.
5,Great keyboard.  Good value
5,Great feel solid construction comfortable use
5,Keyboard works great.... So far....
1,Some buttons stick down others don't go down unless you aggressively smash them down.Oh and the keys are LLOOOUUUUUD AF! Complete waste of money.
5,Nice and smooth typing
5,Great keyboard and great value at this price.
1,Unfortunately the keys stopped working in less than a month and it broke. I did not return it in the 30 day time frame which I should have to receive a refund. I still have it in a new box to return it but I'll just have to throw it away now. I had to rush to a nearby store for an even lesser quality as I was taking college courses and it was extremely necessary to have the keyboard as assignments were due. I learned my lesson to always have a back up keyboard just in case it breaks in the future. I will not be purchasing from this company or brand again. The keys were easy to use and I enjoyed the keyboard so it was disappointing.
5,works great
1,Nice except you can't tell if caps are on. Light stopped working.
2,Difficult to use - the keys are spaced far apart and seem too high profile - I bought two and I'm returning both
1,Large and chunky. The keys were awful and very loud and the design wasn't comfortable. I returned it!
4,This keyboard *finally* has what I've been looking for but is hard to find: the "F" and "J" keys have little raised dots on them so you can find your place on the keyboard by touch rather than having to look at it. I'm very pleased by that. It has a nice built-in wrist rest and is a nice size. I'm having a little trouble typing and need to get used to it's touch but seems workable. The final test will show up in time: whether the letters remain or get scratched off easily as happens on many black keyboards. So far so good. May update.
3,To be honest looking at the pictures I was hoping this keyboard had a bit deeper keys. It's more of a typical soft touch membrane keyboard the typing experience that can best be described as "mushy" but smooth. If you're looking for thicker heavier keys more like a mechanical keyboard on a membrane model this isn't the model which is too bad because it is what I was hoping to replace.I will say on the nice side it has a good set of extras for media control and the function key shortcut works great to let you do stuff like zooming text in/or and other features easily.If the typing experience was more like I was looking for it would be a great keyboard but as it is it's just one I think I'll replace eventually and keep as a backup.
5,I love this keyboard. I had to replace my original and this is even better. It‚Äôs a larger size easy to tap on keys which makes it easier to type fast. I love the wrist space. Definitely a bargain for the price.
5,It works well.  If you want a lengthy review then you are clearly indecisive.
5,arrived fast and easy to use
5,A niche application led me to the X9. We needed to be able to raise the computer system volume without removing the focus of a PowerPoint presentation which would stall any multimedia playing at the time. The X9 seemed to have good reviews and a plethora of features besides the volume control that we were looking for. The rest is well pretty darn mundane: it plugged into the USB loaded up and worked like a charm. Don't you just hate when a product does what it is supposed to do and you can't write a snarky review about it or the customer service? We were very pleased when we hit the volume adjustment on the keyboard and PowerPoint didn't know the difference. Problem solved. Thank you X9.
5,WELL WROTH THE MONEY
5,This was a gift for my grandson. He was and still is thrilled with it. He was very complimentary about it and says it‚Äôs very easy to use. Thanks for a great product and super service!
5,Feels great. Do not play games with it but I do lots of writing.
5,I wish I would have bought this sooner
5,This is a vast improvement over the HP keyboard that came with my new computer. The HP keyboard was only 4 inches wide; my typing is poor to begin with the HP keyboard made it much more difficult requiring many more corrections.
5,I was looking for a keyboard that would allow me to control the volume of music played on my computer. This keyboard has buttons for that. In addition it has a smooth quiet action for typing. It's perfect for what I need.
5,I had needed a new keyboard for quite awhile but was hesitant because I was afraid I would not be satisfied with the quality. I was pleasantly surprised as this keyboard is absolutely wonderful! Highly recommend it!
5,I needed to get a wired keyboard for at home work and I came across this one on Amazon and decided to give it a try. So glad I did. It's awesome! I love it.It's easy to type on this keyboard. The keys are a comfortable distance apart and there is 10 multimedia keys to do various functions. Open default web browser open your mail open the calculator volume up and down and more.There are shortcut keys to copy and paste zoom in and out print or dim the display lighting.This keyboard is a winner!
5,I like the keys
5,Keyboard works great and has a contour to aid in reaching the keys fast and easy. I like just the right amount of pressure required to work the keys and not have hard or easy touch to be sure you're getting it done.
5,This keyboard is comfortable and sturdy. Not a cheap model. Works great! I would buy this again.
5,Facil de usar
5,After trying out two other keyboards this one comes as close to my old Acer as any of those. [My acer did have more resistance but...] A real full-size keyboard good key action...and the same layout as my old one. Just received it so if anything falls short I'll be back.
