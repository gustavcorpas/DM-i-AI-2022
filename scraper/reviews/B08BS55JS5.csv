5,Used it to clean the heads on a VCR to get the picture back.  The old tapes I was playing back had soiled the heads so much that the picture went dark.  Ran the cleaner through it to restore the picture which it did.  I've had to do this a few times now and it worked everytime.
4,Very easy to use on vcr built in to a 12‚Äù tv
5,Yes. We have a great library of VHS Tapes. This cleaner has kept them all rolling on!
5,Gets the job done and provides a clearer picture.
5,A few years back I purchased a different brand through Amazon an it trashed my VCRs. I still had one of the VCRs that kind of worked. I used this product on(in) it and I now get a good quality recording!!
5,Sound in Walmart sound and picture of the quality product was good
5,easy to use
4,so happy with it
5,This product was easy to use; it did a very good job cleaning my machine so I could watch the games I had taped years ago. It arrived ahead of schedule too!
3,did not clean well left a film on heads and rollers
3,A good seller fast shipping & well packaged. But it did not work at all even tho I followed the directions closely. I won't blame the cleaner because my VCR is old probably beyond usable but worth a try.
5,I'm happy to report that this VHS Head Cleaner was just what I was looking for!  Due to the sharp decline in VHS Players: Cleaners for them are extremely hard to find!  In fact: Even the major stores no longer carry them!  Consequently: I was delighted and relieved to find one still available on line from Amazon.  As for the product itself: it did a fantastic job cleaning the one-and-only VCR I stil have!  The sound quality of the Video was as good as new!  Consequently: I'm a proud and totally satisfied owner of this product.  furthermore: I plan to use it to clean my VHS Player for as long as I can.  Although I obviously just received this cleaner: I can't help already wondering if one will still be available the next time I'm in the need for it?  As usual: I suppose only time will tell!  IN closing: Let me say that I highly recommend this product; and would recommend it to anyone in search of a suitable VHS Head Cleaner.  Furthermore: I'd like to express my sincere thanks and immeasurable graditude to everyone who was instrumental in making the obtaining of this phenomenal product possible!  I'll never be able to thank you enough!
5,Like quality
5,Great picture quality sound and easy to use.  Good for 30 cleanings too.  Buy it!ü§†
4,This product worked the first time I used it.  However the second time it did not work at all.  I emailed customer service at Arvista and received a prompt reply with the choice of replacement or money back.  I chose replacement and another disc was sent right away.  I am pleased with its performance and really impressed with the excellent service I received.
5,Cleaning tape worked really well on OLD VCR.  I really like the note they included with the instructions that speaks to them being a small family owned business that stands behind their product!  Perfect.
5,It helped in bringing in a clear picture.
5,Okay picture is perfect thanks r
5,Cleaning our VHS unit.  Exactly what we needed
5,Just what I ordered
5,Liked
1,Today was the first time that I decided to give this VHS Video Head Cleaner a try and I was not expecting it to go well so I  wasn't surprised when it did NOTHING. That's NOTHING like... it wouldn't even PLAY FF or REWIND for more than 2 SECONDS...and that was shocking. When I tried a videocassette tape to see if there was any damage done to my "Vintage VCR"; thankfully it just showed a scratchy looking playback instead of being majorly wrecked.  I then threw my very OLD but very GOOD vintage Scotch VCR Head Cleaner Plus into my VCR to clear away that scratchy playback and it did the job as always. I don't get how a Brand New Head Cleaner isn't worth anything compared to an OLD (many years old) Scotch VCR Head Cleaner; what can I say...they don't make some things the way they use to. I'm done trying to find a replacement for it because Scotch isn't making them anymore but the one I have must've been the best one they ever made No Joke.I don't even feel confident in asking for a replacement for the Arsvita Cleaner nor do I want to be BOTHERED to ask for a refund because I don't want to waste my time anymore than typing this review.
4,I'm happy with my purchase but I find it astounding that there were no instructions with the package.I didn't know whether to run the cleaner tape on the "Record" setting or the "Play" setting.  So I did both.Also  there is a cleaning cloth that came with the package that feels like an eyeglass cleaner however I still don't know what to do with it as far as cleaning my recorder heads.I tried to submit this review without choosing a star rating but it  wouldn't allow me to do so. I just chose the middle stars for the heck of it
5,VHS player worn-out cleaning tape can't fix that
5,What these products to see if it would help my tapes and CDs play without freezing up a lot I see some improvement but I do believe my VCR is just too old
4,It is easy to use without pressing the on button.
4,None
2,It doesn't clean the tape
5,worked well in the first use going to use it again to see if pictures clear up any but id buy it again if i knew someone needing it!
5,We had an old VCR recorder that was not playing correctly so we needed a cleaner for the heads.  This works perfectly without adding any liquids to the tape.  We ran the cleaner through twice.  The VCR works perfectly now.  It works!
4,Ordered to clean my studio machines (Sony VHS and JVC S-VHS).I figured the Sony would take a few passes to clean and with this HC took six passes and the machine works like new again.As for the JVC it won‚Äôt accept this cleaner.  Won‚Äôt make it past initial insertion and then spits it right out.So YMMV but in my case it did the job on one machine and is unusable on another.Four-Stars for the job it was able to do.
3,better than nothing
5,My VCR would not show a picture and now it actually does!
4,Amazed this still exist
4,I expected a lower price but it works fine.
4,Wonderful! The device exceeded my expectations.
5,I used this for my son‚Äôs vcr/ tv which for some reason doesn‚Äôt have a tracking button on it. The VCR cleaner worked very well I just wish I could figure out how to do the tracking so that my son can see his Disney movies completely.
3,This works great. But not for very long.  It's perfect for a few uses then it's all over.  To give credit where it's due this was used on an old vhs recorder that I got at a second-hand shop and I do not know the history on the machine. But when I use this cleaner it worked great for a few times and after about 4 or 5 cleanings it no longer worked and was back to the way it was. I tried the cleaner 3-4x and got "some" improvement on picture quality and tracking.  I think it's the head cleaner. Just not worth it for a couple or three uses.
5,Have an old tv with built in vcr player. My tapes would play but the picture would be just gray lines with sounds. I put in this cleaning tape and played it one time and the movies played perfectly fine. Would recommend people buy who still use vcrs.
5,We have been looking at old VCR home movies to have them transferred over to another type of media... ie... flash drive cd etc.  Our VCR machine suddenly acted up with the tracking going off and the picture was staticky.  I ordered this cleaner tape and to our surprise it worked!  The tapes are now playing and we are continuing our project.  I highly recommend trying this before getting rid of your VCR.  New ones are expensive to purchase!  There is no liquid to apply just pop it in and let it run!  We have yet to figure out why they include a little cloth with the tape‚Ä¶ There seems to be no need for it!
5,did the job love it
5,What I like about this vcr cleaner is that it works! I had already tried a different one before called Clean Doctor but unfortunately that vcr cleaner didn't work.
5,Bro! I got the cleanest head on the block! Now I can watch my Mallrats tape without the audio coming through all crackley-like.
5,For those who still have VHS tapes this was a quick and easy solution to the problem with the VCR. Now my mother in law can watch her old VHS tapes!
5,So happy I don‚Äôt have to throw away my vhs player . I only had to run it through once and it worked wonders .
5,Product arrived on time was easy to use and corrected the problem.
5,I like the fact that you can still use this product to watch VHS tapes from a llong time ago!
3,Not sure if it worked
5,I'm transferring old VHS home movies from tape over to digital. Besides the normal noise of the recordings i was concerned the 2nd hand VCR was also displaying some artifacts. I definitely noticed a difference with the tapes after running this product through. Just play let it do it's thing rewind repeat. I did it 3 times and saw some of the  noticable artifacts disappear. I'd recommend especially if you plan on capturing some priceless memories blowing out your VCR with an air can and running this guy through. Atleast you'll know you are capturing the tapes at the best possible quality before it's too late.
4,It seemed to clean up the tracking well on an old vhs player. Head was dirty on all the tapes I tried. Put this in and cleaned it right up. Says 20 uses. I ran it twice. 4 stars cuz it's probably really cheap to make. But they stick it to the retro old school.
4,Clean the head on my VCR.
5,I don't understand what it did but it worked.  My VCR "ate" 2 of my VHS tapes so that when I ejected the cassette the tape was pulled out of the cassette.  I ordered this put it in my VCR and let it run 5 or 6 times then tried an old VHS tape to test it and the tape played perfectly.  I plan to use the cleaner regularly so maybe I won't ruin another tape.
4,My vcr stopped working. I found this dry cleaner after only one use it fixed the problem. The price was very reasonable compared to other cleaners I found for vcr‚Äôs. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the reason it came without any instructions
4,There were no instructions included in the package on how the product works. There is also a piece of cloth included but no idea how to use it either. My VHS  does not work and this did not fix it. However this product is a cleaner and that may not of been the problem.
5,Needed to clean old VCR heads BOOM .Vcr works again.  Think of what ever you want.
4,Worked fine as advertised - had not used the VHS player in several years - ran the cleaner twice - VHS player working fine -
5,I have a very old head cleaner and I wanted a new one in case I needed it.  I have used it one time and have noticed no difference.
5,Cleaning was simple but used canned air first to clear any dust since I haven‚Äôt used the dual VHS/DVD since the VHS chewed up a tape. Only used the DVD. After cleaning I played a VHS and picture quality was good sound great and this was well worth the money for me. Now I can enjoy my VHS supply
4,This worked well enough the first handful of times I used it. It definitely improved the quality of the picture in my old VHS tapes. However after my 5-6 use of it I stopped working and the VCR wouldn‚Äôt even recognize it and would just eject it.
4,This product came with no instructions whatsoever. I had to look at the product info on Amazon to find out that you press play and let it go to end then you can rewind and play it again for a better effect.
4,Have 2 vhs players and used the cleaner on both of them. Seemed to help and then one of the players started acting up so did the cleaner again. So it does seem to help but time will tell for how long.
5,Liked. Used to clean VCR üëç
5,Some are shipped with cleaning fluid and all cone with a cloth for cleaning your screens.
4,I took a chance and sprayed some rubbing alcohol on the cleaning tape.  There are warnings about the sensitivity of the video head but mine was pretty bad and improved dramatically after the cleaning.
5,i havent use it much as of yet but i will give you  stars
4,This video clean did very well for time I used it. My VCR is old and my tapes are old so I would give this a good review because it was helpful to make viewing good.
4,Did not fix the problem
3,Like most products from China this product did not come with any instructions whatsoever. i still do not know what the cloth is for. head cleaner spins I guess it is cleaning the heads no idea.
3,The tape kept getting caught in vcr but after a second time it worked. Don't know for how long. For the price I guess it wasn't too bad.
5,Not much we can say about this product‚Äîit does precisely what it's designed to do! Can be used both wet (with proper cleaning solution NOT WATER) and dry. Keeps the ancient VCR running well.
2,Ran once and wouldn't run again.
2,I ran it through several times and it didn't help my VCR with terrible picture quality.
3,Haven't used it alot but did find out that it only worked in half of my VCR's.  But in the two that it worked in  I would say it did it's job and my tapes show much cleaner than before I used it.  I am still happy that I bought this product since I have been watching so many old tapes during this lock down.
5,My little TV/VCR started having static on everything I played on it. Used this product for less then a minute and it made the picture clear again. There's no liquid like other kinds so it's very easy to use. Had to use it twice since I got it and it worked right away both times. If it stops working I'll update this review. So far I would recommend it.
4,Just okay- no issues found
3,didn`t help us
1,Unfortunately this tape does nothing. You're supposed to Play for 30 seconds in order to clean but the tape just shots the machine down. Returned it and getting a refund.
5,Busted out the old vhs player and thought it was broken because the movies were all static and barely visible. Bought this on a whim used it once and player was good as new! It is VERY quick I thought there was something wrong at first because it only takes like 3 seconds to work so just a heads up thats not a fault just how it works!
3,Cleaner worked just fine but absolutely zero paperwork/instructions which may be needed since because of the practically obsolete/ancient technology of vcrs is needed.  Last time I used the vcr was possibly 20 years ago and I don't claim to still have the memory I used to.  A one paragraph instruction sheet stating how long to run the cleaner would be nice.
5,For an RCA VCR.
5,My old vcr would not run a tape but after using this cleaner the tape worked great!
5,I‚Äôm not usually a product reviewer unless the product is garbage like most people.This however worked wonders!I will say that my Sayo vcr wouldn‚Äôt accept the tape or play it. So no go on that one. My Sansui vcr worked perfectly! It went from barely able to see the video from all the static to as clear as when it was new with only one run through!Happy customer here.
4,Great product. So glad I found your VHS Head Cleaner cassette. The sound and picture quality was so greatly improved.
1,tape is frozen in the case. it won't play or rewind. I can't get the tape to move at all even manually withassorted hand tools. It's basically a plastic brick. Don't waste your money on this. After a half hour oftrying to get the tape to move it's going in the garbage and I will clean the video heads manually as I shouldhave in the first place instead of wasting my money on this piece of JUNK.
4,I bought this to clean my vcr before playing old home movies worked well and have had no problems with playing them
5,this worked perfectly
5,It work perfect thank you
5,I found my old VHS/DVD combo in the garage. I wanted to watch my kid's home videos. It was very bad quality. So I've ordered the vhs tape cleaner. It arrive in a few days. I popped it in the vhs. Because it's been so long since my vhs was used I ran the tape cleaner a couple of times. It worked like a charm.
1,It didn't work for me. It just made a buzzing sound when I inserted it in the vcr. I don't think the tape actually moved. Mine could be broken  but I'm not sure.
5,Worked as advertised
5,Works great recently found my VHS player and decided I should attempt to clean before use.  Played all my 20-30 year old video cassettes without issues.  Definitely make sure to clean the heads on bus player before use especially if it‚Äôs been awhile...not like to can just go to Target and buy a new VHS...so take care of it
5,I found some VHS tapes packed away and forgotten about. I had  a VCR/DVD Combo that I never had used.  I ordered the head cleaner and was very surprise I received it so quickly.  It's exactly what I wanted and needed. Thanks for the fantastic service.
5,I'd been looking for this product. Glad to find it here. It was very easy to use. Gave me a great clear picture. The sound was great. And no skipping either. Very well worth the price. Now I can watch my old movies. With every thing going on now. A good movie night is truly in need. Thank you for this product.
4,the fact that we can find these two items is phenomenol
4,All is good.
1,When I inserted the head cleaner cassette into the VCR it was immediately spit back out. This does not happen with video tapes. Tried multiple times with the same result. Tried holding it in but that was not effective. Returned cassette.
4,Helped my DVD to work better..
5,Easy to use
5,This does what it's supposed to do it cleand the VCR heads.
5,All of a sudden my VHS had sound but no picture nothing  I was ready to purchase a new one when I decided to try a head cleaner  After trying the head cleaner I had a beautiful clear picture once againGreat Product
1,This product simply doesn't work on any of my three VHS players.  Insert it into the player press the PLAY button and the screen as it should goes blank for the brief "play" period but nothing audible happens inside the device.  Either this is a very very quiet cassette or it's just not moving.  "But wait -- there's more !"Try to REWIND the cassette and nothing definitely happens.  Try to EJECT it and again nothing happens.  Tried the EJECT button on a remote and on the record/playback device itself but this cassette just sits there inside the slot like a brick.  It will eject only if I power the player OFF then restart it.No visible improvement in tape playback after three tries.  Finally resorted to an ancient Maxell cleaning tape that did clean things up a bit.This product arrived without even the barest instructions sheet and there are no instructions on the cassette.Gave this one star only because Amazon doesn't make provision for NO stars.  It's a dreadful waste of money.
5,Works well
5,cleaned the heads of my tape recorder
5,Recently bought a used vcr that had significant tracking problems and static lines. Ran this tape 4 times in it and hit the interior with a shot of compressed air. Took care of all the image problems right away. Worth the $12ish I spent.
5,I‚Äôm not sure what is meant by ‚Äúsheerness‚Äù ‚Äúsound quality‚Äù or ‚Äúthickness‚Äù - this is a VCR cleaner and should not be have any of these qualities. It has done a great job cleaning my VCR heads though! We were able to play 30 year old tapes and cleaned the heads every few minutes to get rid of the old funk!
3,needed to clean heads with alcohol.  Next time would choose cleaner with liquid provided
5,My VCR got really fuzzy I bought this to clean the VCR. It's back up and running without issues. I'm trying to make a digital copy of our tapes. We don't know how long this VCR will last and they're expensive now!
5,I have an old vhs that I what to bring back to life because I have old tapes that I need to convert to a more modern device.  When I cleaned the head of the VHS the picture was a lot clearer on some of the tapes.  It made a big difference on all the tapes I've seen.
4,Works well
4,Mom died and we wanted the video player to be in good shape to give to someone
4,I used it on an older recorder and it worked well.  No issues to report.
5,Love it
5,I was really pleased with this Arsvita Video Head Cleaner. My video pic & sound had stopped working. I used this Arsvita Head Cleaner once and the sound and picture returned. The sound quality was better and the picture quality was amazing as well. I would recommend it.
5,Great product easy to use good price
4,Worked great and fixed my vcr issues
4,Value for money
4,This product doesn‚Äôt use liquid cleaner and can be run dry.
5,So...for those that still have a VCR in their possession this is a must have to keep the heads clean. You don‚Äôt need any messy chemicals-just insert the tape and hit play.  It‚Äôs gonna help us keep the kids VCR for many more years
5,I bought this for my father who has a TV that is 20 years old and so is his VCR.  This head cleaner did a wonderful job. It worked the first time. My dad is happy to watch his oldold tapes.  Thanks a lot!
4,I love that it works without the need of liquid.
4,Works well for cleaning VCRs.
4,Just put in like an ordinary tape and let it work!
5,I've been digitizing old home movies and started to notice a lot of bad tracking and color distortion. After running this through the VCR a couple times things cleared up so much (relatively speaking) that I decided to redo the last batch I converted!
5,After an old vhs tape messed up the head it cleaned so further tapes work
4,Worked great
4,Works as described. Video picture much improved.
4,Works very well
5,Very pleased with product. Quick shipping.Thank you !!
3,Not exactly as good.
5,I have many old vhs tapes that I  now copying into dvds. I purchased this to keep the heads clean on my vhs/dvd recorder so that I could get the best quality copied. I am very satisfied it works and quickly!
5,I was able to pop this in and clean the VHS player that had been sitting for years. Got rid of some of the tracking and popping issues. My old one broke being 20+ years old. This one did the trick. üëçüèª
5,VCR was acting up so found this on Amazon. Decided to try it and after running it through VCR 1x the VHS tapes played much better. Liked the fact it didn't need any liquid to work like the old ones from the 90s.
3,Works fine but has problems ejecting seems to be related to weight. Any of these that require a battery will likely have the same problem.
5,I have a cd/DVD‚Äôs player that was acting sluggish snd buffering instead of playing.This was the tool I needed to stop this problem. Thanks for making vhs cleaners bc I still have tapes that I have not upgraded.
4,Worked great
4,Ok
1,Did not come in full it did not come with the cleaning solution that a wast of money when you don‚Äôt get a complete product
3,No suggestions or advice.
1,The device did not perform its prime function -- namely cleaning the VHS head.  Furthermore there were no directions attached to indicate how the tape cleaner could rewind to put it to additional uses.  I put another VHS video into my JVC player and once again the Arsvita mechanism did nothing to remedy the problem of an unplayable (i.e. dirty) cleaner head.  At least I'm only out $10.
1,We have ran the tape 6 times and it still says heads need to be cleaned.
5,Arrived on time & priced right.
5,The cleaner arrived on time. I popped into the VHS player and pressed play. A minute later it was done. From that point on all my pld tapes played cleanly.
3,It didn‚Äôt work but that could also be because there‚Äôs something wrong with my vcr not a total bust
5,This video head cleaner really helped the quality of our VHS tapes of old home videos. They were very dusty and by cleaning the heads it made the sound quality as well as picture quality so much better.
4,Works fine
3,Arrived defective! I fixed it by opening the shell. Re-threaded the cleaning tape. And it worked fine. Probably damaged during shipping.
5,I'm not sure if it really worked because I think our VHS part of VCR went out. Bought to see if cleaning would help get it to work. It didn't. Don't think anything wrong with cleaner head.
5,I purchased this VHS adapter cassette to watch old home movies fromVHS-C cassettes. The cassette arrived in good condition and works perfectly. Now we can enjoy those old memorable movie moments again.
5,Just like we all remember from the 80's!  Excellent "Dry" VCR head cleaner. The ribbon used now seems a little less abrasive than the original ones. Works like a champüëçBe kind always rewind üòâ
5,I used this tape to clean my VHS tape player. IT WORKED !! I was wondering but it did !!
5,Till you take the time to convert your tapes to CD this keeps you watching your favorite home videos : )
3,I've used only two of the cassettes.  The first one produced a jumpy picture and scratchy sound.  The second was just fine.
5,This product did what it's supposed to do. It had been a while since I'd used my VCR and the head cleaning cassette helped get it in good working order.
5,I‚Äôm very satisfied with this VHS HEAD CLEANER! I had one years ago and lost it. It does an excellent job of keeping my player clean and ready to be used at any time!
5,Arsvita VHS cleaning Tape  works very good .  I'm glad that I bought it.  Thank You.
5,got what i was expecting
5,Purchased VCR that had a little fuzz and sound distortion during when playing a VHS. Cleaned the noise up after a few runs across the play head.
3,Worked pretty well.  Still some issues with viewing tape but may be the tape.
2,This cleaner would not even play to clean!
2,This didn't really help clean the heads and after using it the situation was worse with the audio being disrupted.I opened the tape recorder and found white fluff from the cleaning tape in the recorder and the sound returned after I removed but the image was still poor.  I used rubbing alcohol on the tape heads and rollers and the image restored.
5,I didn‚Äôt think it would work but I was very satisfied with the cleaner.  My tapes that was thirty years old played fine. Thank you
1,It only played for a few seconds and I could not rewind it.
5,Worked great took a few cleaning rounds and my VCR was up and working like 1980‚Äôs
5,Does what it's supposed to do. If you have any old VCR technology and want to keep it up and running smoothly you need to get this product.
5,Worked great! I didnt know my vhs was so bad! Very impressed with video and audio results!
3,Did a nice job on the vcr.
1,I followed the instructions and inserted this into my Panasonic VCR.  It made a noise as if it were turning after it was inserted but before I even pressed play.  When I pressed play as instructed it made even louder noises and then the VCR turned itself off!  The instructions say to press play and then it should automatically stop and eject itself.  I tried several times and every time the VCR turned itself off after a minute or two.  The video quality did not improve.  Since it made noise before I even pressed play I tried just leaving it in for 15 minutes.  Of course that did nothing either.  Basically this didn't work at all.
5,Video Cleaner worked perfectly on my vcr.I now can digital upload all my vcr tapes to my computer.No issues here.
1,Inserted it into a high-end VCR and it started making crunching noises before I even had the chance to hit play. The spools on the cause a lot of resistance or in my tape are not functioning properly. After about 20 seconds my VCR powered itself down with an error code. At first it wouldn't even eject the tape but eventually I was able to retrieve it after enough power down/up attempts. I thought it may have broken my VCR so I anxiously threw a real tape in there and thankfully it still worked. But this cleaning tape is a huge liability. Not recommended whatsoever!
5,The cleaner worked as described after one use. I have a Sony VCR.
5,The product was fine and worked well. What I objected to was the packaging. A plastic bag does not protect breakable objects. HoweverAmazon"s service is A+ for me!
1,Buyer Beware! I had a working VCR with a slight line through the bottom of the screen. I bought this thinking maybe it would fix the line.After trying this tape my VCR no longer has a picture. To recap: before I put the tape in my vcr worked. After I used this tape cleaner it didn‚Äôt.I emailed the seller and got this response:1. You can play the cleaner for several times.2. If it still doesn‚Äôt work I suggest you ask the video recorder manufacturer whether it‚Äôs the video recorder's problemOkay let me call panasonic and see if there‚Äôs anybody in tech support that knows what‚Äôs wrong with my VCR lolSo now I‚Äôm on ebay looking for a new VCR. I‚Äôm a bit angry.
5,We have 4 older models of VCR-DVD combo's some purchased at yard sales so a good cleaning was needed. This seems to have work for us.
5,I'm in the process of converting my visa tapes to dvds and each time I convert i clean my visa player with this cleaning tape.
5,Works  used on two VCR‚Äôs that had not been cleaned  recently üëç
3,It worked well enough for the price
5,Dusted off the VHS player and tapes to send to the grandchildren and was able to get the insides cleaned up too with this head cleaner.
5,I got this for my mom for Christmas. She enjoyed it very much. She likes the dry cleaners the best and said it was great.
5,My vhs player wasn‚Äôt working and once I used this cleaner it‚Äôs back up and running good as new!
5,Was lucky to find this at this price. My videos were skipping and grainy. Ran the video cleaner and saw results immediately.
5,Same  as  headline
5,Purchased item to fix an old Panasonic tv with a built in VCR. Had to run it a couple times but it worked great.
5,This was a vhs cleaner tape. Insert and run and it cleans the heads. It did just what it was supposed to do!
5,Cleaned the heads and picture is much better!
5,This did the trick.  My VHS tapes look as good as new after one swipe with this head cleaner.
1,Did not work
5,Improved playability
5,Received quickly. Worked perfectly. Packaged well. Great customer experience.
1,I just wanted to clean the picture up but it didn't work. It would seem like it was playing for five seconds and then stop. I tried fast forwarding and rewinding but nothing got it going. Then I realized it's not coming out and I tried for almost an hour. Frustrated that it took out my vcr. The exact opposite reason of why I got this cleaning tape. I want a refund at least and can't seem to figure out the option since I can't pull out the tape to return it.
1,This didn't work so they sent me another one right away.  It didn't work either.  They promptly refunded my money though.  I'm grateful that they were prompt in trying to fix the problem then gave me my money back.
5,Works great!
3,So so
3,Would not rewind properly but got it unstuck
5,Put it in and clean the tape head and get a clearer piture!
5,All I had previously was fuzz and static and after running this thru pic is perfect again
3,This item should work but appears cheaply made.
5,Arrived quickly my teen used it to clean an old VCR recorder. They said it improved playback quality.
3,No instructions !
5,Did an acceptable job of cleaning the heads on an older VCR. Notice improvement on the quality of videos played.
5,Got for my aunt who still uses vhs. These are getting hard to find. She was happy with the performance
5,I wasn‚Äôt even certain I could get a VHS cassette tape cleaner. But I had this in two days. Great service!
5,Our special needs son watches Disney vhs tapes and this cleaner helps clean the player
5,A EXCELLENT PRODUCT
5,The first time it came broken probably due to shipping. After it was replaced it has worked just fine
5,Worked great!
5,The product did exactly what I bought it for-an effective cleaning of my VCR heads.
5,Like it. Works real goid. Cleaned a old vcr head and niw my vcr tapes play well.
1,Our vhs cleaner from Arsvita only worked one time.  It would not rewind. Do not buy.  I tried to contact company and they would not respond to my email.  Again DO NOT BUY FROM RHIS COMPANY.
5,I used this to clean an old vhs head.  It cleaned amd now works great
5,Product worked as intended and seemed to clean vcr heads adequately for my needs.
5,It worked exactly like it says. It made for better playing of the VHS tapes my daughter watches.
5,I ran it through twice and it brighten the picture a lot. Very happy with the product.
2,Insufficient cleaning strength for dirty heads. Probably useful for regular preventive maintenance. Dirty heads require opening the VCR case and manually cleaning the heads.
5,I needed to clean the heads on an old VHS player and it did the job.
5,Did an awesome job
5,This vhs cleaner worked perfect. Cleaned the heads on my player and my tapes are playing great.
5,Sound quality & video is great after using this  VHS cleaner!
5,Has been used every day for 6 hours a day for two weeks Zero issues. Great price

5,Great value works perfectly
5,Did a great job cleaning the VCR head.  Video loved much better after cleaning.
5,It worked great! I had a lot of dust in my VHS player!
1,I used this on my vhs player and now get no picture at all. Only audio. Very upsetting since I have so many home videos I have been watching::((
5,Awesome! Cleaned my VCR.
5,WORKS LIKE A CHARM!!! It cleaned my vcr head perfectly. Thanks üôè
5,It made my player look clearer.
5,Seemed to work.
1,Dont buy did not come with cleaning solution...junk
2,Cleaning process to short have 10 year old cleaner works better
5,Worked great. Now able to watch some OLD home movies!
5,This was a great help with making my VCR run better! Thanks üòä
1,I appreciate the company asking for candid feedback.  The product is a miserable fail.DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED.  DOES NOT REWIND FOR 30 TIMES REUSE.  RAN FOR 10 SECONDS THEN LOCKED.Makes me wonder whether the company has ever heard of quality control.  Sell them short!!!I would give 0 stars for the first time here - if only I could!
5,Works really good sound quality good I would definitely recommend
5,Great product. Works exactly as it says.
1,This worked for one cleaning and then jammed in the cassette. Would not order again
5,The service and product were excellent.
1,The cleaning tape will not play fast forward or rewind. Apparently jammed. The little instruction manual is provides no help or clear operating instructions. Don;t buy.
1,Shipping carton arrived in tact but on opening it; I noticed that the white box containing the VHS Head Cleaner was ripped open and pieces fell out.  It appeared to had been previously returned based on the damaged packaging and the cut-away of label or sticker removed from the packaging.  Other items appeared to be ok.
5,Did what it was suppose too
1,Hit play and just instantly stops doesn't work.
5,Work good
5,Great item just like name brand
5,Exactly what  I needed.
5,I got this for my uncle Christmas present
5,Works Great
5,Works perfectly
5,Quick and easy to use.
5,Sound quality is great.
5,Finally a cleaner that works very easy to use!
5,Exactly what I needed and worked like a charm
1,I tried it out on my vhs machine and wondered why my machine kept turning off! Found out the tape was stuck! I didn‚Äôt move!
1,Didn‚Äôt help
5,Clarification of tape
1,The VHS cassette looks to be new and in excellent condition however it didn't work. Not at all. First it comes with no directions so I came here to the description and put it into the VCR. I hit play nothing happens. I try rewind it doesn't seem to move at all. I tried it repeatedly even putting the tape into a seperate rewinder nothing. It seems to be basically an empty cassette with a line of white tape stretched from one spool to the other. They don't seem to move.
5,Great job doing it‚Äôs job. No complaints.
5,Does the job.
1,Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Popped in VCR ‚Ä¶it popped out right away. Tried several times. Ran for 2.6 sec. Popped out again. Tried again and turned off my VCR. Ok ok maybe ‚ÄòOperator Error‚Äô but the more I tried the worse it got. Bet you‚Äôre thinking it was my VCR right? Nope. Just a laughable time remembering the 80‚Äôs.
5,Really cleaned up our dvr player!!
5,I like it
5,Good stuff
5,Worked like a charm
5,Works grwat
5,It works great!
5,This works perfectly.
5,Worked well
5,Worked great
5,Easy to use. Arrived quickly!
5,Did the job
1,Opened the package put the head cleaner in the VCR hit play and the VCR just turned off. Turned it back on and it auto-ejected. Tried again same thing. Put it back in and tried to rewind same thing. Next time I want to clean the heads on a VCR I'll just light $15 on fire take apart the VCR and clean the heads myself. At least then I'll take out the middle man. You suck.
5,Works well
1,This product was a joke. Prior to using this cleaner my video was decent but I thought since my unit was old I‚Äôd better clean it. Now the audio does not work and the video is glitchy. I am transferring all my video tapes to digital and the video & audio is now crap. Luckily I started with me sister-in-laws wedding tape. However now I have to find a new vcr to play my tapes while a transfer my videos.
5,Great product.
5,Cleaned my vcr great
5,Seemed to work!
5,Ease of use
1,Do yourself a favor and don't buy this it does not work at all.  Get on YouTube and find a video with instructions to pop off your cover and clean the vcr from the inside.  All you need is some rubbing alcohol and a piece of paper.  Turns out it was pretty easy no extra product needed.  I am transferring home videos and wanted to make sure everything was clean so I can get the best possible digital recording.
5,It was perfect
5,Worked as advertised.
1,Does not workMail another that worksThxJeff
1,The product was faulty.  My money was promptly refunded.
1,First off there was a rattle in the box before opening it.  Next it wouldn't play then when it was ejected the tape got stuck in the VHS player. Tried to let Arsvita know instead of giving a bad review but web site looked like it was sending me to places that looked unrelated.
1,This tape is NOT as described. The cleaning time is about 1 minute not 30 minutes. And it will NOT rewind (as other reviewers have noted in the questions). The only way I have been able to rewind it has been manually -- which only is doable because the cleaning tape is so short. I started a return and now I have to drive it across town to the UPS store before I can get my money back.
5,Worked out well.
5,Cleaned my tapes nicely.
1,The VHS cassette looked like head cleaners I had used before. It wasn't! The head contact could not have been more that a few seconds. There was no noticeable change in sound or picture quality on my player.Amazon/Arvista would have made a much better impression if they had a brief video segment directly on the tape or some old-fashioned written instructions. Robert in Rockville
5,good
2,Only ok.
1,Did not perform as advertised. VCR functioned worse after using cleaner.I took starlordcd's advice. Watched YouTube opened up vcr and cleaned with alcohol paper and bottled air.  VCR now works like new.
2,It would not play  it would just eject everytime I put it in.
1,Device did not recognize this product kept turning itself off. Tried several times most of which resulted in the cleaner getting stuck inside. Turned out most of those times was because cleaning ribbon was tangled inside. Would love to return but casing cracked trying to get this garbage out.
2,No instructions included
1,Product arrived busted in pieces. Of course accidents can happen in transit with anything but this was a fairly fragile product that had no protection in its packaging. The way it was packaged it logically could have busted at any point in transit. Very disappointing!
1,I would like to give it zero stars.  Did nothing so I watched a Youtube video took apart the VCR and cleaned it myself.
1,Didn't change viewing and the "tape" didn't seem to advance. There were no instructions on the screen
1,it was trash on the first try
1,My VCR was working fine before I got this. When I put the head cleaner in it got wrapped up inside and after taking it out my VCR eats up tapes now. I had tk get another vcr.
1,I have a wet cleaner that‚Äôs getting old so decided to try this dry only cleaner.  It had no effect in the quality of my tapes and used the old wet protect and saw an improvement. (I have multiple VCR to digitize old tapes and tried it on each one).  Returned the cleaner.
2,Did not work
1,Because there are mixed reviews on this product and because I'm desperate for my VCR player to work I ordered this.  It doesn't do anything.  Literally.  It doesn't play rewind fast forward.  It does nothing.  So if you decide to take a chance on this product make sure there are free returns.
2,No instructions whatsoever
1,VCR went from having some horizontal white lines before using this to having no picture at all afterwards just a snowy mess.
1,Inserted the cleaner.  Heard the buzzing as the tape went around.  Did nothing for the video I played later.  Same problem.  Tried it again same result.  Tried to contact the company per the site they include with their directions just like the cleaner nothing.  Very dissapointed.
1,It did not appear to work on either of my two VHS players. The old cleaner had worked on both nice and straightforward
2,Didn't do the job. Prefer liquid cleaners.
1,This does not work.  I tried it on one unit and it would not even go into the VCR.  I tried on another VCR and it made the tape not play.  Going in the trash.  Also no instructions or information comes with the product.
1,The only reason I gave this item a one star is because I did receive the two VHS tape cleaners I purchased in the mail. I bought two VHS tape cleaner. Neither of them work. I‚Äôm Very disappointed. Total waste of money.
1,Did not perform cleaning even slightly well.Also got stuck when I tried removing it from machine. Tape was partially torn.Totally disappointing. I have used similar products in the past and found them useful
1,Item was delivered with no protective covering of any kind. Cardboard container coming apart on one end.Would not work in my Sylvania VHS/DVD player. I question if this was a previous return from another customer due to the way it was delivered even though the label says it is new.
1,Doesn't work at all head isn't cleaned or doesn't spin at all with the tape. Just take the top off your vcr with some rubbing alcohol and a soft cloth for real results.
2,product did not resolve my issue
1,It didn't work it's a VCR VHS head cleaner once in the VCR  VCR didn't even run and movies still play like heads needs to be clean.
1,This does nothing but make a terrible noise. It actually created problems with the audio heads so now I have to manually clean the heads and demagnatize them.
1,Sadly have to recommend avoiding this. The device fell apart inside the VHS player after one use and did nothing to clean the VCR. Stick with the old method of taking apart and cleaning with rubbing alcohol this doesn't get it done.
1,Absolutely garbage.  Plays for about 5 seconds and shuts off.  Don't waste your money.
1,it did not work
1,My VCR could at least play videos before using this product. After running this cleaning tape the VCR no longer displays video. Who's gonna get me a replacement VCR now!?
1,Didnt clean
1,When placed into the VCR and hit play to start cleaning it turn the VCR off and did nothing. Complete waste of time.
1,The video tape cleaner ran once and the cleaner strip broke off inside of the cassette so never really ran and couldn‚Äôt use again. Don‚Äôt buy
1,This was a VHS video player head cleaner. Broke as soon as I pulled it out of the box! Did not come with the liquid cleaner either. Will not attempt to purchase again.
1,Tape didn‚Äôt even touch the machine so it didn‚Äôt work.
1,does not work
1,The one I received was a dud.  It was locked up and would not turn at all.  My money was refunded.
1,It literally destroyed my VCR. The VCR became completely unplayable. After opening the VCR and manually cleaning it the problem still persists. I am pretty sure this is a scam.
1,I‚Äôve used this kind of cleaner tapes before but this one just didn‚Äôt work at all!
1,Don‚Äôt waste your time
1,Does not work. Waste of money.I want my money back.
1,It did not work. and you cannot use it other than 1 time
1,Cleaner did not work.  Would not play; would not rewind.  no instructions with it.  Looked up instructions online.
1,Complete garbage!!  First time in a good working VCR it jammed my machine and I had to disassemble the VCR just to get the tape out!!
1,Stop sending old products to people! The 1st tape had a cracked case. The 2nd wouldn't play. The boxes for both tapesmlooked like they'd been opened before. Sending these back!
1,Came with no instructions. After inserting and playing and rewinding several times my VHS was no better. Try another brand
1,I got static loud buzzing and then it shut my player off. Not worth it.
1,I picked out the one with the liquid you put tape to clean the heads. This one is dry. I already have dry ones and they don‚Äôt do anything
1,Did not clean my tape head.  Forced to try something else.
1,Worked once but after it kept turning the power off of my vhs/dvd dubbing system.
1,This product didn't work at all. It was a 1-time use. (7-8 seconds running time). On top of that it would not rewind.
1,dosenot work at all
1,Doesn't work. Won't play. Tape not even half inch. Take the cover off vcr and clean it properly with qtips and isopropyl
1,will not useagains.  busted my VCR after using it.
1,The item does not work
1,No funciona no es recomendable no me gusto
1,It did not help at all. This brand is not a good one.
1,The tape only has a short white strip doesn't look completely real. Did not work on my VHS player no improvement at all.
1,This item did not work.
1,I took a chance. It does not work.
1,Cannot tell if it works on any VCR
1,Followed instructions and used it once on my functional VCR ended up scratching the heads. Do not recommend.
1,Did not work on either of the vhs players on which is was used. Both still require head cleaning.
1,Unfortunately this product didn't work. I had to use another.
1,Cleaner locked up caused VCR to shut off for safety reasons.
5,I wish all businesses were like Arsvita. Great customer service.I had a couple of questions to ask and Anna was right there to answer them. I didn‚Äôt have towait a week for an answer.I probably won‚Äôt be using the head cleaner a whole lot but for the price I thoughtit would be nice to see some of my old videos every once in a while.
1,Pesimo. No sirve usado y viejo mala compra.
1,Terrible kept jamming in my vcr and not working
1,Used it to clean  VCR head. Did not work. Also no instructions with product.
1,Not sure what this supposed to fix or clean... but It does not do it.
1,Reels were frozen and it would not work.  Had to return.
1,Cassette was broken in four places and the cartridge was sprung open
1,Did not work jammed on first use. Trash.
1,Did not work
1,This cassette does not clean the heads on my vcr.
1,Item stretched and quit running on first try. Waste of money
1,Tape was damaged and did not run.
1,It did not work
1,Did not work for me
1,Didn't work. Had to manually clean heads
1,Did not work!!
1,Very cheap!
5,We are in the process of cleaning up old home videos and these head cleaners are just the ticket to clean the heads on the vcr after running old tapes.
1,Didn‚Äôt have anything to clean the heads with was just a vhs tape waste of money
2,Did not help with cleaning. The VHS PLAYER had not been used for several years it was my hope a cleaning cartridge would help. This one is what is known as a ‚Äúdry‚Äù cleaner no cleaning solution. When I placed it in the VHS player it became stuck. I tried to eject but would not fully had to pry it out which luckily damaged the cleaner cartridge not the VHS player. Now I will do what I should have done in the first place.Take apart the player and clean it properly and how I can put it back together properly.
5,It is hard to find a VHS head cleaner these days as VHS players are becoming obsolete. It does the job of cleaning the heads as needed.
5,On delivering it was on time. But using it my VCR isn't working so can't try it out of as now.
5,I bought this VHS cleaner to clean my Player.  It works well!  Great product.
5,Good price and works well.
5,Does just what it is to do.
5,I thought it was for smaller cassettes
1,Didn't help at all.
5,Clean my device
5,Works great was able to clean my old VHS heads for a clean picture.
5,This item help us clean or VHS and now we are able to see all our tapes. It works great!
4,as advertised
5,This is great
1,tape broke first use. waste of $$
5,Easy to use.
5,I liked the great results the product provided! I used the product to clean my VHS/VCR Video Heads!
5,Thanks.  absolute gratitude
5,we had an old player used this a few times and now our old vhs tapes are working good.
5,no review.
5,At first it didn't seem that I didn't get any results but it did the job after re-inserting the head cleaner 2 to 4 more times.  Very good results
5,Worked great for an old VCR I found in my dad's closet and wanted to see old family videos. It improved the quality of the sound and got rid of that annoying jump the tapes would do.
5,My videos would not play at all; no picture the sound would skip. I used the Arsvita VHS Video Head Cleaner and it did a great job. I would recommend this product.
2,the unit failed to rewind after first use and then got caught in the tape player. after taking the cover off the player I got it out. then I looked online on how to take the tape cleaner apart to repair and found the big metal spring had come off and was jamming the tape wheels. after fixing it worked fine.
5,works well
2,I noticed no difference after one cleaning. After several attempts there was some improvement but not satisfactory. I bought a liquid cleaner and that worked very well the picture quality improved significantly. I will never try a dry-cleaning Head Cleaner again.
1,The tape inside didn't move/play. I ended up getting a refund.
1,I can only get this to work one time I could never get the tape to rewind to use a second time.
5,No dislike for new product.  However I must have another problem which I will follow up on.  No picture from VCR.
5,Extremely easy to use.  Cleared up VCR tape immediately
5,Nothing bad to say. Cleaned the VCR as it needed so my kids can watch the videos I grew up watching.
5,worked great
5,Worked great to clean out old vhs player
5,Just what I needed
5,Product does what it's supposed to do and easy to use
4,These dry cleaners are hard to find works great VCR is back working with good picture & sound quality
5,I had to step back and revive some old equipment to recover some old tapes. I bought one of these tried it out. It worked so well I bought three more‚Ä¶each has a finite use‚Ä¶and I was not going to push the longevity. I‚Äôd rather have a clean machine playing my decades old tapes. I have been a professional video/media person for over forty years.
5,Bought an old vcr from goodwill to watch some 13 year old home movies seems like it improved the picture after i ran it
1,It didn‚Äôt do anything!
5,good product
5,its good thanks
5,Good
5,My grandson wanted so badly to watch my VHS tape of the movie White fang my old VCR would not play and I was going to throw it away but before I did I thought maybe it was dirty so I came to Amazon and bought a cleaner it cleaned it and it works perfectly! So glad I gave it a chance to just be cleaned.
5,Worked great
1,Trash don‚Äôt wast your money
5,Did it's job cleaned the heads
5,Didn't work initially but after about 10 runs it fixed the problem so 5 stars from me
5,New VCR'S have become mega expensive. Most people no longer have VCR tapes so it's a nostalgic thing. I am not about to buy a new one at 600 plus $'s.  I found and purchased an old VCR DVD combo off of "offer up" to convert some old VHS family movies to PC. The family member in those movies has passed and it was very important to have those movies for the family.  I purchased this to clean up the heads to protect the movie and it made a HUGE visual and audio difference in the quality of playback. I ran it through 3 times. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a VCR that wants to maintain the quality of your machine and protect your old movies.
1,The VHS tape was damaged (cracked on the left side) the box was ripped the tape a little dirty. I put it in the VCR it popped out and the VCR turned off. I hope it doesn't mess up my VCR.It was NOT mailed out in a secured bag.
5,i was having issues with the sound coming from my VHS player. This cleaned the heads perfectly
5,My VCR needed this so bad and the product delivered what it said. Thanks!
5,Para tener mi m√°quina de video en optimas condiciones
5,I searched and searched until I found what my mother wanted. Yes we still own VCR's lol.. This cleaner did the job and didn't get stuck in the VCR. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Thanks!
5,I love how u just put the tape in the vhs box and it cleans it ..
4,If you're buying VCR's from thrift stores & yard sales for resale then it's good to have a cleaning tape on hand. However many times these units are beyond the superficial cleaning a head cleaner like this can provide. So set your expectations accordingly. These are NOT miracle workers. Most older VCR's need to be manually cleaned & even then you will still have issues. However every now & again you will snag a lucky unit that requires only a quick cleaning. That's when you'll be glad that you have one of these in your toolbox!
5,Good quality and easy to use -works pretty well.
5,Good product but no product instructions
5,Excellent product perfectly and securely packaged Great quality will buy again thank you
5,It cleans the VHS heads
5,Works on my Panasonic 4 head VCR. (Other brands did not work.)
5,BUENO
5,Cleaning a vhs vcr
5,Hassle free and it works as seen.
