4,Update #1 - 9/22/02It's been about two months this I installed this camera at our cabin in the woods.  The location consistently shows just one bar of 4G reception but I have yet to have any major problems accessing the camera remotely and viewing live video.  Due to the poor reception there have been a very few times when I haven't been able to connect but that's the nature of the location.  Cellphones barely work at all there either.  The solar panel keeps the battery charged to 100% every time I've looked at it.  Once in a while a motion detection video will record locally but not upload to the cloud and generate an alert...  I assume that's because of reception issues.  My main annoyance with the camera continues to be the fact that you cannot delete individual records off the SD card.  The secondary annoyance is that every time you log in and live view or review a video it creates a recording on the SD card.  Weird...  Nothing that would prevent me from purchasing another one of these though.  I'm still happy with the overall performance.Let me start by saying that I really like the camera itself.  It seems very sturdy has good night vision and reasonably quick motion detection.  I like the option of having a visible light come on at night OR standard IR for a more stealth installation.I was a bit worried about the location that I wanted to mount it...  In the middle of the forest in Northern Wisconsin where AT&T TMobile and Verizon all have poor coverage to watch my cabin (and do dual duty for watching wildlife).  I must say despite some of the reviews my camera averages between 1 bar and 2 bars and I've always been able to connect to it and do live via an SD stream and re-aim the camera if I choose.  It's already survived a pretty decent thunderstorm and it appears to be working just fine.  The solar panel has kept it charged at 100% during the day.If money weren't an issue the $1.99/month cloud service (7 day retention) isn't really that bad... but it chews up the data pretty quickly which is what actually get expensive.  I opted to just save video to a 32GB SD card and you are able to connect remotely to view the video and download them locally if you like.Now we get to the software...  I am NOT impressed with the software.  Some of the terminology is a bit off but I can live with that knowing its a Chinese product imperfectly translated.  What I dislike about the software is that while you can delete individual cloud-stored videos there is no way to delete individual videos from the SD card.  The only option is to complete reformat the card.  This seems like a completely unnecessary restriction.  The software does hound you for permissions every time you startup unless you grant them permanently.All in all if you deal with the odd SD card issue and don't mind paying EIOTCLUB for data to access the camera remotely (why else would you buy a $200 camera?) this seems to be a good option.
5,Out of the Box this was a good quality camera.  Really no assembly needed.  I plugged it into 120v to fully charge the included battery.  I installed the Application on my phone and scanned the camera to add the device.  The pre-installed SIM card was activated which came with the 100MB of data as described.  I installed at my property as designed.  The location of the property is such that I only get around 1 or 2 bars of signal from the AT&T/TMobile tower but the camera functions flawlessly.I have one suggestion for future upgrades/changes....it would be great if you could integrate the Data usage directly into the Camera Application software.....I find it cumbersome to have to constantly go to a saved webpage on my phone to see how much data I've used.
4,Using my Mint Mobile Sim and 32Gb SD card from already working other brand 4g cell cameras (solid 2 bar 4G signal)Pros- Good picture in both SD and HD (wide) angle is good for viewingGood range of motion in the PTZ and smooth movement real plus.Good solar charge Good battery life.Easy & quick set-up to iPhone 13 with 15.6.1 IOS.Good bright white led spot; toggles to bright night time IR wide spread.Timely notifications to phone when alarm gets triggered.Microphone is a bit directional  thus background sounds can be faint. Speaker sounds typical squawky small.Included 100Mb sim is only a sample and lasted several hours to a day before you MUST purchase more data or another sim service. 2GB to 4GB monthly works for me checking camera 3 times daily.I have not tried their cloud service yet.UBox app for camera to smartphone NEEDS improvements. Font is way too small thus needing magnification and light grey on white background is horrible. Some features are hard to understand thus a youtube Ubox tutorial is a necessity.Motion detect is mediocre Low-Med-High and would be much better with zero-to-10 scale and user defined area.EDIT— This is a revised review. 1st camera received had bad microphone. Customer Service Dept did eventually solve problem to my satisfaction.
5,This camera surprised me with how easy is was to set up install and use. It works great and does literally everything I wanted. And it does it well. Easy peasy. I have a beach cottage in another state that I will be leasing annually. Utilities will no longer be in my name so will lose internet access myself. The 3G/4G/LTE allows me to see streaming live both my beach AND my house by panning tilting zooming night vision (in two modes via white light for color or infrared for less noticeable black and white). It is my favorite gadget hands down. Bought an inexpensive SIM card and the cheapest data plan available from one  of the recommended carriers and — bam stylin’ online feeds to my phone!  I am going to buy another for the home I live in up north.
5,If you're looking for a remote camera without wifi and no power this is the camera system for you. I have 20 acres in a remote area with no power and no internet and this camera preforms better than my cameras that have power and internet.The picture is super clear in HD mode and you can control the camera with instant movement from the controls on your phone. The camera is super easy to use and comes with everything you need to get started. The sim card only last a couple of days but you can reload the card using their website and the plan only cost $100 for an entire year of viewing or cheaper options are available.  I'm so happy with the camera that I purchased 4 of them.I strongly recommend this camera system for anyone that needs a remote camera that doesn't have internet or power available on the site you're trying to protect.
5,High quality camera sleek and works in remote areas. I'm very happy with it. Instant peace of mind
5,I got this as a birthday present from my wife. At 48 this is the kind of stuff we get excited about!  I thought it was just a security camera at first but as I started setting it up I kept discovering new things … you can toggle it night vision motion detection!  We have a property that is very far from where we live and I can’t wait to set it up there so I can enjoy the views when I can’t be there!
5,Great buy. When you run out of data on the little card it gives you upgrade to a bigger plan. Scan that QR code and it pulls right up. I did the 1 year plan. It's the biggest one you can buy with that sim they give you. Great quality and nice unit
5,The camera was quick and easy with the app and included SIM card warning the included SIM card has only 100 mb of data for trial so it is used up quickly pay for more data on the website or switch to your own cellular carriers plan. The app could use a data used and remaining for their SIM card plan in my opinion. Scheduling the camera operational times isn’t straightforward it’s arming time and you can’t run it overnight without making two schedules since it’s on 24hour and won’t let you extend past 24:00 into next day so 20:00-24:00 then 1:00 to 6:00 to cover 10pm-6am. The app could use a few upgrades in my opinion. The camera function is very good as is picture quality. super easy setup. I recommend fully charging camera first before initializing it in the app and setting it up. APTZ all worked well easy to use tutorial on the app was easy t follow.
5,I have a hangar in a remote location with no electricity or wifi.  This camera is working great for me to monitor the setting.  All the features work very well and exactly as described.  Recharging the SIM card that came with the unit was also very quick and easy.  I'm so happy with the camera and the customer service that I'll likely get another one!
5,Easy to install and set up
5,This camera is a good purchase. I had an issue with sharing it to a family member that they took care of right away it wasn’t the fault of them it was my user era. They responded quickly and even went over and above to help me. You need cell service for it to work correctly. It comes with everything needed to get started and was very easy to install and get going. I may even purchase another one for another spot. Thanks guys!
5,4g cameras typically do not hold a signal NOT this one.  NOT a cheap plastic camera toy its a serious part of a security plan without WIFI.  The mounting bracket and solar panel and battery life is excellant.  Very easy to set up.  Don't buy a cheaper version this has great PTZ.  Good quality sound.  The app is reliable and free.  A small annual fee gets you cloud service for a year.  About to put the second in service.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy set up awesome function and features A+++ customer support!Great picture/video quality and you can communicate thru the app/camera!Money well spent and functions great despite having only 1 bar for signal most of the time.Highly recommended!!Needed support to figure out my connectivity issues but as it turns out I had run out of the free data. Refilling the SIM card was very easy though!Photo and video taken from the app. Had some guys camping on my off grid property.All around very pleased with this camera.Time to retire my Spypoint junk!
5,So I wanted to get a camera for the back of my backyard and stumbled on this unit there is no power and the house wifi won't reach. It's great just assemble the unit and mount it to anything it powered up go itself online and linking it was easy as scanning the qr code on board. I can keep an eye on the dogs at night and keep an eye in case someone trys to enter my yard already planning another one for my garage.
5,I really like this camera. Super easy to setup and the image quality in HD is good. For the money it does a great job. My use will be for watching deer and turkeys in the woods. I’ll be buying another one (or 2 or 3…..)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I really can’t say enough about this camera. We use it as a security camera on our site location. I was a little hesitant at first because of the price however I took a chance and I’m glad I did. No problems whatsoever great camera all the way around. Will get more for my hunting properties.
5,Throwing RING in the trash.
1,The camera seemed to be registered before therefore I was not able to add it as a new device into the requested app. The app is called UBox and has overall bad reviews. There was no memory card included as well.
1,Unit was purchased for security on a property. It seldom notified me of movement. Several times I drove right by it without activating the camera or giving me any alert. Waste of money if you need it to work
4,The camera worked great for a couple days and then stopped working completely. The app said it was offline and the light on the camera kept blinking purple. I deleted the device on the app and tried to reinstall it but it kept saying “device not found.” When I bought the camera on Amazon I noticed it came with one “100M” SIM card or 30 Day Trial. I thought it meant 100 minutes.. not 100 megabytes (MB). It should have been clearer so people realize 100M is 100MB which is super small! I finally find the SIM card information and the website said the SIM was suspended! Little did I know that when I was setting up the camera it ate that 100MB immediately. There was no indication that you would have to pay an extra $100 for a full year of 24GB of data. It was very misleading! Other than that the camera quality is great.
3,IF BUYING AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE make sure AMAZON knows that you are because it definitely will not active for that person and  and they can get ABSOLUTELY NO HELP UNTIL the person that bought it  CALL THEMWhat do i like I dont even know because it wad a gift and i CANT ACTIVE IT this has been the worst experience ever im in day 4 and still it says no Smart device found when trying to add it to the app  the company said put the sims card in my phone to activate it um it should have came activated what if i didnt have a phone i do but its locked to my provider the sims card was already installed whichakes me think its a return item someone else couldn't get going  😡😡😡😡😡The company did finally help me fix the camera and get it going it's just aggravating that it took so long but over all a good customer service rep contacted me and done a great job so yes it's a great camera still haven't got it to follow movement but at least it works
5,La cámara me parece perfecta para mi pero quiero saber si funciona con el servicio de Internet de otro país por ejemplo yo estoy en república Dominicana.
2,Not reliable. Very limited features. You will be disappointed if you use it as security surveillance camera. Maybe ok for taking photos for wildlife as a hobby.
5,This camera works great.  The solar option helps so I do not have to remove and recharge the camera.  This company also really stands behind their products.  I previously bought a different camera from them which had problems charging and I contacted them and they sent me a brand new one.
5,Ich suchte eine Überwachungskamera die überall zu verwenden ist ohne daß man ein vorhandenes WLAN Netz benötigt oder einen Stromanschluß und stieß dann auf dieses Modell von Xega.Ihren Strom erzeugt sie über eine Solarzelle was auch ziemlich gut funktioniert. An einem kleinen Ladelämpchen sieht man wann sie läd was sogar schon der Fall ist wenn man sie im Innenraum in Richtung Fenster hält. Somit würde sie bereits bei diffusem dunkleren Licht z.B. im Wald nachladen. Über einen fest eingebauten Lithium-Ionen Akku soll sie aber auch je nach Benutzugsintensität mehrere Wochen ohne Nachzuladen überbrücken können.Die Installation ist relativ einfach es liegt alles dabei was man braucht auch eine Sim-Karte für den Start ist schon eingebaut. Ich benutze sie mit einer Aldi-Talk prepayed Karte das billigste Daten-Paket gibt es dort für 499 EUR im Monat. Wichtig ist daß man anfangs eine entsperrte Karte ohne Pin-Code einlegt.Über die dazugehörige App kann man auf die Kamera (und auch mehrere Kameras) zugreifen. Dabei kann man alle möglichen Einstellungen vornehmen sich die aufgezeichneten Fotos und Videos anschauen oder auch ein Live-Bild sehen. Die Kamera läßt sich im Live-Modus in alle Richtungen schwenken sogar ein Mikrofon und ein Lautsprecher ist eingebaut sodass man über das Handy (oder Tablet) über die Kamera sprechen kann. So kann man die Kamera als Gegensprechanlage verwenden wenn man sie an irgendeinen Eingang hängt (z.B. den Eingang des Schrebergartens).Je nachdem wie man sie einstellt meldet sie auch Alarm aufs Handy wenn sich ihr jemand nähert und zeichnet gleichzeitig Video und Bilder auf. Man könnte sie also theoretisch sogar in den Wald hängen und als Wildkamera verwenden auf die man von zu Hause aus Live-Zugriff hat. Auch ist es möglich eine Sirene zu aktivieren dann fungiert die Kamera als einfachere Alarmanlage.Die große Stärke dieses Modells gegenüber der WLAN Version ist vor allem diese völlige Unabhängigkeit von vorhandenem Internet und Strom. Sie funktioniert überall wo ein Handynetz ist. Gleichzeitig ist sie klein und unauffällig und hat durch die Solarzelle den Vorteil daß sie absolut wartungsfrei ist. Hängt man sie einmal auf arbeitet sie praktisch dauerhaft ohne daß man Akkus wechseln muß. Man kann sie also einsetzen um das Ferienhaus zu beobachten den Schrebergarten das Boot die Pferdekoppel den Hühnerstall unbewohnte Immobilien den Wohnwagen auf dem Campingplatz Handwerker könnten sie als Baustellenkamera verwenden um Baumaterial und Maschinen zu schützen. Auch geeignet z.B. für Schausteller die viel reisen. Man kann die Kamera auch im Wald an einen Baum hängen um einen Wildwechsel zu beobachten einen Hochstand oder eine Futterstelle. Man kann sie auch irgendwo anbringen und Zeitraffer-Aufnahmen machen.Die Bildqualität ist sehr gut. Ich überwache mit der Kamera einen Teil meines Gartens. Das Bild ist gut und scharf sowohl am Tag als auch in der Nacht. Die Kamera hat mehrere Infrarot-Dioden die so stark sind daß ein großer Gartenbereich hell erleuchtet wird. Das Licht dieser Wellenlänge ist für Mensch und Tier unsichtbar die Kamera eignet sich also auch für schöne Tierbeobachtungen man könnte sie sogar durch ein Loch im Deckel eines Nistkastens filmen lassen. Sie hat aber auch 4 weiße LED die farbige Nachtsicht ermöglichen. Die Lichtempfindlichkeit bei nahezu völliger Dunkelheit ist beeindruckend.Die Auflösung der Videos und Bilder ist 1080p sie hat auch ein 4 fachen Digital-Zoom. Bilder und Videos werden auf eine SD Karte aufgezeichnet. Es gibt zwar auch eine Cloud-Funktion diese benötigt man aber nicht unbedingt. Die auf die SD Karte gespeicherten Filme und Bilder kann man z.B. über das Mobilfunknetz über die Handy-App abrufen man muß also nicht wie bei einer Wildkamera immer in den Wald fahren um die Bilder auszuwerten und Batterien zu wechseln. Der Datenverbrauch ist auch nicht sehr hoch. Mit dem billigsten Prepayed Datentarif kann man die Kamera schon einige Wochen über benutzen.Leider hat sie keinen WLAN Adapter sodass sie wirklich nur per Mobilfunknetz funktioniert aber das ist auch gleichzeitig ihr Vorteil weil sie dadurch völlig ortsungebunden arbeitet und man sie auch schnell mal mitnehmen kann und woanders aufhängen. Den Zugriff auf die Kamera-Bilder kann man auch teilen also wenn beispielsweise mehrere Personen auf das Bild zugreifen können sollen.Ich benutze die Kamera mobil für verschiedene Einsatzzwecke und würde sie jederzeit wieder kaufen.
5,Die Kamera ist nun seit wenigen Wochen im Einsatz. Wir nutzen sie zur Überwachung eines Grundstückes hinsichtlich Personenerkennung.Mit Hilfe eines Verlängerungssets ist das Solarpanel ist an anderer Stelle montiert als die Kamera.Die Kamera gibt zuverlässig einen Pushalarm aufs Handy wenn sie eine Bewegung erkennt. Wenn die Empfindlichkeit zu hoch eingestellt ist meldet sie allerdings jede Bewegung von Blättern der Bäume. Wir haben sie inzwischen so eingestellt dass sie nur meldet wenn sie Personen erkennt und Fehlalarme nur noch selten vorkommen. Die Bildqualität tagsüber ist gut auf die Entfernung hin (ca. 30m) ist es unscharf aber alles bis ca. 10m ist scharf und alles ist klar zu erkennen.  Nachts ist die Bildschärfe in Nähe der Kamera (ca. 5m) auch gut. Die Kamera speichert bei Bewegungserkennung Videos automatisch ab. Wenn man sich ohne Grund einloggt nimmt sie ebenfalls ein Video auf und speichert dieses. Die Gegensprechfunktion funktioniert einwandfrei. Die Fernsteuerung der Kamera (Schwenken) klappt gut allerdings mit etwas Verzögerung was ggf. am Funknetz liegt. Beim Abspeichern der Videos gibt es auch etwas Verzögerung was aber nicht stört. Insgesamt eine sehr gute Kamera mit sehr guter Verarbeitung. Wir sind sehr zufrieden. Hervorzuheben ist auch der außerordentlich gute support des Kundendienstes. Wir haben auf Englisch geschrieben und es gab sehr kurze Reaktionszeiten. Als wir uns noch nicht so gut mit dem Gerät auskannten und einige Fragen hatten wurden diese in maximal 24 Stunden beantwortet. Wir können die Kamera auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen.
4,The Xega camera itself is pretty good the Ubox app is terrible - but I've given it four stars because of the excellent customer support.Pros: - A very capable / full spec camera - it does what it says it does - Solar panel keeps the camera battery topped up at 100% - even in cloudy weather - Infra red and motion-detection work well - Free cloud service for 12 months - and it's only around $20 a year after that - Low cellular data usage - I used a £6/month SMARTY SIM - Great customer service - more laterCons: - The Ubox app is horrible - it works but it's not intuitive to use at allI had a problem with the solar panel after a couple of months and the email support from Xega was really first class.  They shipped me a replacement with minimum hassle.  Unfortunately this didn't solve the issue and they promptly replaced the entire unit the next day direct from Amazon.  At this price-point I really didn't expect much in the way of customer service - a really nice surprise.
3,I have had the camera for a few weeks and I feel I am in a strong position to write a fair and accurate review. Its a mixed bag with a couple of deal breakers for me.The positives are there is a lot or really good things about this. If you are in a situation where there is no WiFi then the SIM option is a great way round this just go for a well known network in your area and not the SIM provided. Not only will you save heaps but you will get a stronger more reliable connection.The camera itself is pretty decent its zoom is still clear at quite a distance and the nigh-time camera is crystal clear. Even the voice works better than I was expecting its not great but people can hear and talk to you.The basic camera functions in the app are ok not great not good just ok. Moving the camera about is a breeze but that it as far as the positives.The motion detection one of the most important part of the system is quite frankly the weakest link. There is no point having a security camera that doest not come on where there are intruders. If the camera is anything above 3 meters it is inconsistent even set to high. Who puts a security camera lower than 3 meters where people can easily access it and break it? This for me was a fail for me. The detection should be good for 10m minimum otherwise it's just a party piece and not fit for the job.You have to subscribe to get any video saves and accessed and oh my god what a PITA this was to actually get to work. The app failed to process my transactions with PayPal. The only way I could get this to happen was link the phone to my PC and use the WEP option. Personally the camera should be free is its going to be a subscription and I would gladly pay more for a system that works well.You also have to give them a lot of your personal data for what? Its a camera.So a lot of good things let down by poor movement detection and a terrible app. But this is one of the better option on the market they just need to improve a couple of points and it would be perfect.
5,This solar security camera is fantastic for me! No power supply needed so you can literally put it anywhere.I love the look of this unit and it looks great without attracting too much attention.The camera is easy to install and the accessories are easy to assemble. Another cool feature is the 4G cellular feed meaning that it will work without WiFi.  Installation of the app is easy and you can get the app for Android and IOS meaning I can view the surveillance screen anytime anywhere. The picture quality is clearer than other brands on the market with HD mode.The motion detection function is very sensitive and can trigger monitoring accurately and there are almost no false alarms.As a wireless camera fan I have them everywhere but the XEGA brand beats the lot.Yes I would recommend it to others.
4,Overall the camera does what it says the day vision is excellent but nigh vision is hard to say because my camera is some distance away from the house however it pick up any cars or people like it should so i really can't complain so i would recommend this camera
5,This security camera is amazing. All the features you could ask for at an amazing price. Very easy to set up really like the ability to control the camera remotely and record direct onto phone or cloud. The two way communication should be a real benefit. Not had to use it yet but I will be able to express my satisfaction to any trespasser and let them know there image has been captured. Should help solve my petit theft and vandalism issue on a remote piece of land that I own.
5,Perfekt für die Überwachung unseres Hauses. Und ein tolles Service vom XEGA Team wenn man Fragen hat.
5,Great quality product for low money
5,Macht ein hochwertigen Eindruck.  In HD sind die Videos in guter Qualität.  Akku hat immer 100 Prozent durch das Ladepenel . Bewegungsmelder hat eine gute Reaktionszeit.  Bewegungsmeldung kommt sofort auf das Telefon.
5,Being from the analogue era the initial set up lasted a little longer than I wanted however with a little help from the XEGA help desk and in particular Celia Qu everything turned out just fine. The camera is proving to be a excellent purchase.
5,Surveillance sur un voilier
4,XEGA 3G/4G Kanera:Phantastisches Bild tagsüber und nachts mit weißen LED oder IR. Dazu kommt dass die Kamera tatsächlich ohne Internet- oder Stromanschluss auskommen kann. Flüssige Bedienung beim Anschauen der Videos. Erkannte Bewegungen werden per push mitgeteilt.Die Software hat noch Luft nach oben
5,Sehr gute Kamera und auch ein sehr guter Support. Ich würde die Kamera auf jeden Fall noch einmal kaufen!
5,Sehr gute Kamera und überall dort einsetzbar wo man keine Internet Verbindung hat. Bildqualität bei Tag und bei Nacht ist sehr gut.Durch den eingebauten Akku mit Solarplanel ist man zudem noch vollkommen unabhängig von einer Stromversorgung.
5,Ausgezeichnetes Produkt alles Lob. Kann ich jedem empfehlen der eine gute Kamera sucht. Exzellentes Bild HD-Auflösung und mehr. Ich habe nicht die geringste Beschwerde
5,I had a Wi-Fi camera originally but moved to the property behind me and the camera was struggling to pick up my Wi-Fi. So I brought this camera it works like a mobile with a SIM card I have connected it to my family plan on my network provider in the UK and I can gift data so it doesn’t cost that much and it’s always connected . It was so simple to set up and I found the app easy to use.  And to be fair the picture quality is good perfect night vision and because it’s charged with a solar panel i can just forget about it.
5,Der erste Eindruck ist gut die Einrichtung geht schnell
5,Great camera for sheds and garages where you don't have power or the WiFi signal doesn't reach.ProsComes with a SIM card preloaded with some data so you can take it works straight out of the box.Detailed instructions.All tools screws and brackets you need to fix to the wall.ConsNo WiFi capability so you do need to pay for a data-only sim once the free data runs out.App user interface can be a bit buggy on Android.
5,Die Kamera macht einen sehr soliden Eindruck!Einfache und selbsterklärende Einstellungen über die App!Die Bildqualität ist super sowie die Steuerung .Das Solarpanell versorgt den Akku mit Strom auch bei Bewölkung .
4,This wireless outdoor solar CCTV camera is a multifunctional tool that provides clear imaging and audio that is effective as a safety measure.The XEGA smart solar CCTV camera employs a highly-sensitive PIR motion sensor that can detect movement at a distance of 12 meters wake up in 0.2 seconds and record all human motions while greatly decreasing false alarms brought on by rain insects etc. An IP65 waterproof that ensures adaptability in adverse weather conditions. It is wireless and only supports 2.4GHz WiFi and notifies you in a timely manner using the UBox application. Considering that it has a large-capacity battery the integrated solar can recharge it when placed anywhere that is 3 meters or less from the CCTV camera. This product comes with a free 30-day cloud storage trial that supports up to a 128GB SD card.Additionally it features a wide field of view that eliminates blind spots at 355° Pan 100° Tilt for angle accessibility and Two-Way Audio with a built-in microphone and speaker to allow users to hear and speak to anyone in front of the camera in real-time. This features two 1080P HD night vision modes: IR night vision and highlights colourful night vision which only supports IOS and Android software.Overall this CCTV camera has all the features I've been looking for. I can utilize a remote control to check on the status of our home and alter our security measures whenever I want. All users can receive notifications when it detects movement and it also supports multi-user viewing using Android or iOS mobile devices only. The recording then is not continuous  24/7 and only starts when motion is detected or programmed.Despite these minor problems I will still suggest this one because I believe it has a lot of assurance for protecting my family
1,The instructions are poorly written and the backup support is basic and unhelpful. I bought 2 cameras over a week ago and still unable to pair them. Asked why and got a very unhelpful answer. I am very disappointed.
5,I was really quite surprised at how clear the image is with this camera there isn't much difference in picture quality compared with a hardwired camera in my opinion.I've got 2 ring flood light cameras and they aren't much better than this to be honest yet the cost considerably more and I had to hardwire them in which took up quite a bit of time so based on the picture quality and ease of install this is definitely very good value for the money.Setup in straightforward enough as with most tech like this now you simply scan the QR code which takes you to the app and follow the setup instructions.The beauty of this camera is also it's potential downfall though you can install this pretty much anywhere that gets reasonable sunlight however you also need wifi so if you have a large garden or weak wifi signal this probably wont work at the bottom of the garden.I really like that you can control the cameras viewing angle from your phone it makes adjustment so much easier than having to get the ladders out to reposition like I do with my ring cameras and the two way audio is really quite clear (again this depends on wifi strength though).All in all this is a really good camera for the money in my opinion.

1,Dopo un paio d’ore di tentativi per farla funzionare mi sono arreso e l’ ho resa  ringrazio amazon  per la veloce risoluzione con conseguente rimborso utilizzato poi per aquistare un altra camera di un altra marca piu costosa la quale in 10 minuti e stata configurata e montata . GRAZIE AMAZON
5,I was pleasantly surprised by this security camera. Given that it’s powered only on solar power it works remarkably well.Taking the camera out of the box I noticed it had a good weight to it and felt pretty good quality. Set up was straightforward - the instructions manual has a QR code which you can scan to download the app. Simply register an account and then the app will search for the camera. Then it’s time to put the camera into your desired position.The camera comes with the screws and plates required to drill it in but I’m lazy so I used Gorilla tape. If you haven’t used that stuff it’s time to get to know 😆 It’s a double sided tape which permanently grips both inside and outside. I’ve used it to hang solar lights camera doorbells and now this camera with no issue and with total peace of mind. Wait... I’m supposed to be reviewing the camera...Anyway the picture quality is really great for a solar powered device. I’m sure you could get better picture quality from other cameras but then you’d be looking at paying a lot more and it would probably need to be wired in. It depends what you’re looking for really but this camera is great for our needs. We have a summer house in the garden so we’re using it to watch for any potential intruders.There is a monthly subscription that you’ll need if you want to automatically record footage. You’ll also need an SD card for storage. Without the above though you can view the feed and manually press record if you see anything going on. The camera will send a notification to your phone if it detects movement which is a handy feature. It is super sensitive though and has been picking up the tree blowing in the wind a lot. You can adjust the sensitivity of the motion detection feature if you wish though.Overall super pleased with this device and happy to recommend 😊
5,I needed a solar-powered CCTV camera for the front of the house.  I wanted a simple solar-powered CCTV system for ease of installation.  This product caught my attention with its high-capacity lithium-ion battery and specifications.The instructions were easy to follow and the box consisted of a solar panel CCTV camera and fixtures.  The camera unit is made to a good standard and feels good and looks good.  It gives a surprisingly crystal sharp clear color image which surpassed my expectations.  The multi-direction remote-controlled camera is awesome and the zooming-in gives very respectable image results.  The inbuilt lithium-ion battery has a 14400mAh capacity is very large for a CCTV.  I found it easy to slot in my own large micro sd card and to plug in the solar panels USB-C plug.  The templates for sticking on the wall helped me to drill accurate holes.The solar panel is lightweight easy to install and charged the CCTV camera nicely.I found it nice and simple to follow the instructions to Bluetooth to the camera and be up and running in moments.I found the detection too sensitive so I switched it to low function via the settings wheel. Now only movement near the camera will alert me.  I like how when I check the camera it can still give a color image when the LED lights switch on as I view. . I could also change over to infrared view too.  Scrolling through the on-screen menu settings was simple and having a look to see if I need anything else adjusting.  The 1080p HD image as you can in the gallery photos is sharp and the zoom and directional on-screen arrows pad worked nice and felt good with very little lag.The two CCTV WiFi antennas picked up my WiFi signal very well and maintained a strong signal.I like how I get alerts and can press the microphone button to speak to the courier friends or postman when I'm out.I can take screenshots and videos via the features on the screen.I felt at home with this CCTV system so quickly and have already shared the app. with my family members so they can also have access to the camera.This product represents excellent value for money and I highly recommend it for extra security for your home.  You can buy extra units and add more to your app.
5,An external solar powered camera suitable for erecting on and keeping an eye on your property especially outside.The camera allows you to connect via 2.4 GHz WiFi it’s solar powered via a separate solar panel with 3M cable so it can be located away from where you need the camera located this way you can locate the panel to get the maximum sunlight that it needs. It has a pan and tilt 355deg view a spotlight PIR motion sensor super HD night vision and compatible with 2 way talking it’s also up to IP65 waterproof.Please be mindful though that you need to erect it where it will receive maximum sunlight to keep it charged and give it enough power to function even in the winter.The camera is operated via the "UBox" app and comes with Cloud and Micro SD Card secure storage and remote access. It supports up to a 128GB SD card although this is not included which is a pity but they are cheap enough these days which always makes me wonder why they don’t include one maybe it’s to make you buy the cloud storage.You can also charge it via USB especially handy for the winter months when the sun may not be strong enough to fully charge the camera.I wanted this camera to keep an eye on my garden area as it’s difficult to locate power cables out to an external wall without drilling large holes this solar setup hopefully is the answer if our winters allow it to keep a decent enough charge. I have a garden that faces east/west so it can track the sun all day and I believe it will charge even on the cloudiest days. I will report back now that summer seems to have ended and let you know whether the batteries get enough charge. But as stated you do have the option of USB charging either from a power bank or other mobile source but I’ll be able to update as winter arrives.The camera and panel were easy to fit with the the supplied screws and connected effortlessly to my Wi-Fi I didn’t have to turn off my 5 GHz setup for this to happen.The camera is easy to operate via the app on your phone or pad even from afar.A great solidly built piece of kit that hopefully will be as reliable as it looks.I’m happy to recommend.
5,This camera has everything you could need for keep an eye on certain areas of your home and some great features.The main camera module is a good size and well made with a strong mounting bracket on the back that can be mounted in two different ways but I do recommend the larger area against the wall as this gives far better stability and you need that for windy days and to allow the camera to pan and tilt smoothly.The camera is best placed high up so it can look downwards and that gives it the best pan and tilt range which to keep an eye on my garden (when I don't have any windows facing out on it) I have found it perfect for when I just want to check on it. I wouldn't rely on it as a security system style camera although it can do it I think more expensive cameras are better for that but the motion detection is good and the light comes on at night to light up the area very well.The app works well and does give good images while the pan/tilt is easy to move but it would be a little better if it could work with Alexa as well to view the camera footage.The solar panel is really nice and sleek with a super thin panel and a wall mount for it and the cable is a good long 3m cable which has the modern universal USB-C connection to put into the main camera module under the rubber waterproof covers and the solar panel if you angle it right and in an area with good day/sun light you will never have to charge the camera at all (it does have a normal USB to USB-C power cable in case you want to charge it without the solar panel).Overall for only £49.99 I think you get a lot of camera for the money with some good features and the solar panel especially makes it pretty much maintenance free.
5,As this camera has a solar charging it doesn’t require any power support from the mains which means it's simple to install and will only require some drilling. The instruction manual is quite simple to follow and it includes bar codes to video support of all the main steps from installation to Wi-Fi connectivity.The camera comes with all the stuff needed for installation. The main thing is that the camera needs to have a decent wifi connectivity and as my router's wifi signals were a bit weak I have installed an additional WIFI range extender to support it. Video performance has since improved.The night vision gives a clear view although like most other cameras the recording turns black and white. The camera has a zoom option which give a clear view. The camera allow storage on a memory card to be installed on the camera or the cloud storage option however that needs to be subscribed.At this price the quality is decent and so far it's delivering so overall a good camera.
5,The camera arrived well packaged and all parts were present.To get started you need to download the Ubox app which enables the camera to go live.I positioned in my back garden to optimise the solar panel especially coming up to autumn now so fingers crossed the solar panel soaks up all available sunlight.The camera can be put in any position desired to cover your needs. Mine captures the whole garden which is what I wanted.Picture quality is great even at night and to make sure you optimise its potential I recommend buying an SD card to capture any moments you require.I wasn’t expecting too much for the price to be honest but I have to say it’s comparable with higher end units like my ring doorbell camera.Easy to set up easy to use and a must have for peace of mind.
4,It is a good camera however it would be even better if it could use wifi as well. This can only work via sim and this is a bit of a letdown. It's great it has this option but having wifi as well would be 5 starts for me as you'd avoid extra cost of data sim. Overall recommended if this is what you have in mind.
5,This is a well-made full Wi-Fi Motion sensing ONLY CCTV camera with tilt & turn plus pan along with infrared for night time viewing sound is via the two way audio output this supports up to 128gb sd card not supplied and you must down load the app or you will not be able to connect or use its easy to set up a user account and you could sign up for the clous storage but this is down to you the camera is powered by an on board battery charged by the supplied solar panel with a USB c 3mtr connected lead or you can on first use charge via a USB c lead power source but no matter what it will need a full charge it's easy to set up on your local Wi-Fi network and easy to use via the app you must down load this to a smart phone or tablet NOT a PC overall this appears to be well made with easy to follow fitting & usage instructions I feel this might be a bit high in price at £49 compared to other brands sold but other than that appears to work well see close up pictures to show the full camera
5,This is a really easy to use solar security camera that provides an excellent image quality in both day and night mode.Because it’s solar powered it means you don’t have to worry about wiring it up. Just plug the solar panel into the camera and it will keep the internal camera battery juiced up.The camera is very easy to set up via the app and it provides easy to follow instructions on how to connect to your WiFi etc.once connected you going full access to the cameras settings like image quality notifications PTZ control etc.overall this Is a very good camera for the price.
5,The product is as described. Quite easy to install and perfect picture quality. Connect seamlessly with mobile phone. 2 way audio with motion detection feature. value for money product
5,This is very pretty looking camera and on first look it seems be well designed. It's body is sturdy and protected from weather conditions.Camera comes with solar panel which meant to charge the camera. The panel looks typical and is good quality. I was pleased to find out that this camera is powered by usb type C cable connection. Micro usb ports are less popular now. Camera should be charged from main before installing outdoors to make sure it has enough power to set it up and to extend its battery life.The camera will require an app to download. App is called UBox App. Through this app we set everything up as it will show us step by step. Once set up we can customise other settings the way we want.The manual instruction book is nicely written with details and images so it helps a lot. App is easy to set up and customise the settings. I don't think you will struggle with it.There is also separate instruction how to install but more details we can get by scaning QR code on that installation leaflet.This camera can be installed to ceiling like surface or to the wall. There are both options available on the cameras back bracket. This camera has its weight so I rather recomend to drill the holes on the wall to screw in this camera into rather than sticking it by tape. It's more safe and secure this way.Solar panel has 3m long cable so I suggest finding good sunny place for it. Camera can be like 2.5m away that's not a problem as long the solar panel gets enough sun light to charge the camera. Bare in mind that during winter there is less sun and days are shorter. So I will install my camera somewhere near the window upstairs so if battery gets low I would be able to connect long cable and charge it from main. I don't want to unscrew the camera from the wall for the charge so the cable placed through the window should be good enough. I don't fully trust this technology and I know that one day it may stop charging (foggy day rainy day etc) so back up from main power will be essential.Camera supports SD card which is not included but if someone already has Cloud subscription this can be used for this camera instead of SD card. I'm going to put SD card any way.Quality picture is good even at night. Camera can be set to record only during certain times. For example from 9pm-12am or whenever suits us. For the remaining times camera will not react to movement. We don't need to use this option that's just suggestion to save the battery. Sensor is sensitive and sometimes records even bird flying around so every camera activation uses battery to record and save the recordings.All in all this camera has good potential and I like that it uses sun light to get the energy. Even if I still will need to occasionally charge it from main power plug I think it still worth to have this camera. It's good quality and the battery inside is quite capacious so hopefully it will not let me down any time soon.
4,I already have several security cameras which run off of the mains via a hole drilled through the wall but I wanted a camera at the back of our house and the only mounting place that works for the correct area for capture is away from any power source so I needed a fully wire free camera since this one came complete with a solar panel which will cut down on the amount of recharges needed I ordered it.On opening this security camera kit comes with everything required to install it to a wall post or fence. The main camera is a separate unit from the solar panel so if the camera is shaded then the solar panel can still be positioned towards the sun on its own mount a small cable then connects the two units.The build quality of this is about average so I would put this into the area of being a budget camera that said this is waterproof so it can be used all year round I can't comment on the value for money as this is listed as unavailable at the time of writing.I would recommend a full charge via the USB cable before fitting it and setting it up then the solar panel should help to maintain the battery level depending on the position it is facing and the amount of sunny days. I did find that the solar panel wasn't working at all on overcast days so a lot will depend on where you live and if it's south facing.Once the camera has been powered on it can be paired and setup in the free app which can be downloaded to a smart device. I had no problems at all in pairing this although I did this before taking the camera outside for mounting so it was close to my router and phone this is the way I would recommend doing it.Being as this is a battery powered camera a lot of the normal options are not available that would come as standard on a mains unit most of these are to prolong the length of time between charges. The main feature that isn't available on a battery camera is the ability to have constant recordings which is understandable as it would drain the power quite quickly. The recordings on this are all done from the motion sensor which when triggered will start the recording for a set amount of time. The motion and recording times as well as several other options are all accessed from within the app.I always prefer to record locally rather than to the cloud so I fitted a 128gb SD card and formatted it ready for use if required this does have the option for cloud recording at a small monthly cost.As this is a PTZ camera it has the ability to be panned and tilted into any useful direction all from the smart device the picture can also be zoomed but I find that the quality drops so it's not something that I would normally use.Overall this is a very nice budget security camera kit with the added bonus of including a solar panel hence reducing the amount of recharges so when comparing prices this does need to be taken into account. The HD picture is at 1080p and streams via 2.4ghz wifi without t0o many hiccups this will depend on the router setup of coarse. Along with a pretty decent daytime picture this also has an automatic night mode using infrared which again is clear enough to be able to make out features for identification should the need arise I found this far better than some other budget cameras that I have used which at night all I could see was what looked like blurry ghosts lol.If you can't run mains power or just need the convenience of a cable free option then you can't go too far wrong with this set I will say though that a mains option is always the best way to go if at all possible.
5,This home security camera comes with a solar panel and fixings. You need to download the ubox app and register an account. The camera was very easy to connect to my wifi just needed password and the camera came live. I set it in may garden and I can control the angle of camera rotate it and zoom in on the app. The volume can be set  and the microphone made to go live. The app allows notifications. I added a micro sd card so that events can be recorded.£49.99 at the time of writing is a good price for this solid piece of kit. I am very pleased with it.
3,The pros for this camera:- it talks you through the setup. very easy to do.- comes with everything you need- Includes the solar panel which is usbC- has a battery so constant power isnt needed- includes a usbc cable in case you want constant power or to charge the battery if you didnt get enough sunlight- has PTZ control which is very easy to use via the app- good image quality- Night vision- share live view with others- notification system for motion/events- two way audioCons:- need to pay for their cloud storage service unless you have an SDcard- sdcard cant be very big it only supports up to 128gb which pushes you to use their service unless you check it regularly- doesnt come with an sdcard- you cant integrate this into any other systems- you are only allowed to use their app.- the app sometimes freezes when starting it.- you can only use 2.4gz wifi  5ghz just isnt supported unfortunately- cloud based makes it a security riskSo would i recommend it ?if you want to use this for pet watching or in an unimportant area/temp camera. Sure it does the job.if you want to use this for watching your child or security of something important. Id avoidCompanies need to start allowing access to be used with local systems and stop forcing consumers to use their cloud services which need their own branded app.This solution is okay for a quick setup but in no way i would call it a security camera if anything it creates a security flaw.
4,This is another super product made by XEGA.This solar powered cctv camera is an all in 1 camera which doesn't need anything else added to get yourself up and running with very capable cctv coverage.Take a look at the following functions that this camera has and tell me it's not worth it!Pan tilt and zoom (regardless of fixed position you can see where you want and control the camera position at any time)2 way audio (listen to or speak via the 2 way mic and built in speaker)Night vision (using infrared leds which gives superb black and white picture quality) as well as colour night vision (using the built in white flood lights again giving great video quality)Motion detection and recording (sensitivity can be set from low medium and high and switched on and off at anytime)Share the camera with friends and family.Free Ubox viewing and control app (available on iOs and android)The app can also connect multiple cameras that use the same appWifi connectivity (2.4Ghz only)Record to the cloud (free trials available) or record to an SD card (which slots into the camera)Very efficient solar panel (even charges the camera up in low/cloudy light conditions) battery indicator shows charging and battery level.Wall mount for the solar panel and enough wire attached to the solar panel to position perfectly for maximum efficency.Kit comes with easy to use sticky templates for drilling/fixing positions.Camera and solar panel are weather proof and are fine in any weather.Choice of HD and SD definitions for helping to improve connectivity issues if they arise.Choices of muting volumes which again can improve connectivity issues.App allows you to view record take pictures communicate zoom in and out (digital zoom) move the camera expand viewing to fullscreen push detection notifications to your mobile as well as choose lots of different settings from image flip to choosing night vision options.Camera saves power by only using power when you are viewing and low energy for motion detection.Infrared or floodlights turn off when there is no motion but switch on when motion is detected. The camera effectively enters a sleep mode for maximum energy efficencyMotion detected siren alarm warning any intruder and effectively scaring them away and it's loudDedicated reset button (located under a rubber bung next to the SD card slot)Dedicated power switch (protected by another rubber bung)Type C charging cable to solar panel2 x movable antennas for improving WiFi connectionThis is a fantastic bit of kit the unit looks solid robust and professional and there is no need to trace wires through the house or buy anything else. And it's free energy powered :-)Price wise is currently £109.99 and whilst I have seen another review who stated that this was actually just under £50 at time of their review I would still pay this.This relies on a good and stable WiFi signal so please check that your WiFi is capable of reaching the area you want to install this and that the signal is good.As this utilises HD definition its important to have a good WiFi connection.Picture and video quality from this is super even at night.If it's one thing I'd improve its the free trial cloud storage which will only detect and record motion in a maximum of 30 second video files.That's why it's probably better to buy and insert your own SD card (maximum of 128Gb capacity)Super kit and well worth it.
4,I like this outdoor camera because it is solar wireless and the lens can rotate up to 355 degrees it has a motion sensor and night vision and the 1080P camera shoots very clear video a great outdoor camera. But also because it relies on solar energy to store electricity when it encounters continuous rainy and cloudy days the electricity it stores will be in short supply. If it has a plug that can be connected to the power supply it will be better if it can use solar energy and power alternately.
3,I was quite pleased with how the picture quality was when this was set up - quite clear during the day but the night vision did let it down.It was looking at a street light and the glare from that would mess with the light exposure of the image and essentially render it useless for a while.The solar power is a good idea but during times of little to no sunshine you will need to recharge it to keep it operational.As it doesn't use WiFi you will need to use a SIM card with mobile data to get this to work though it does come with a 100MB sim card to give it a trial run.This does add on a recurring cost just to be able to use this camera each month.Following that it does also require a paid subscription to a cloud service to be able to save videos.The alternative is to use a memory card to save videos.The app isn't bad but it lacks a lot of functionality that other apps are able to provide.It's currently on a deal for £154.99 at the time of this review with its original price being £199.99.I don't think this is worth that price in my opinion - other cameras have similar functionality but have much better day/night camera quality better cloud storage facilities and better app functionality.Overall it's got a good design and premise but I think it's been executed poorly. It should have a backup power source or allow the users to have it hard wired rather than be solely dependent on solar power.On top of that if it had WiFi functionality alongside its mobile data SIM card function it would make this camera a much better one.
5,This outdoor security camera from Xega is of good quality and feels robust and sturdy when secured in place.We have fixed this in the edge of our woods high up a tree to keep an eye on the pigs since there is always the stray or the odd person who is too inquisitive.The Solar Power charging makes this possible and we have also a bank of mobile chargers to boost should the weather be too overcast for a good charge.I love that I can speak to anyone I see nearby that shouldn't be there. They don't usually call againThe App is basic but functional.There is a good tilt to allow me to see all around the wood.Obviously wifi is required and this we have in place in a small office close by.Night vision is very good. It's also interesting to see the nightlife that wander around the wood. Fascinating in fact.Definitely a good buyRecommended
4,I think it's a good idea to have the built in solar panel to help with power  it looks a bit unsightly and not as sleek and compact as our other small security camera.We have this set up over our patio area as our other camera wasn't able to reach this darkened corner of the garden  so this is and at that area of the garden and covers it well.It's great that it's wire free and the battery power is good to so your not having to recharge your battery all the time and it can last months especially with the assistance of the solar panel.The camera has a wide angle view  you can choose spot light or IR video to capture motion of people coming into your garden.It's easy to set up following the instructions  you and others in the family can then view footage on your phone of any notification or movement in the garden the camera has good range and the footage is as clear as our ring doorbell 2nd gen.You get a 100gb memory card to use in the camera  we prefer a better quality memory card but they can be picked up cheap these days in the sale.I'd prefer the camera a tad smaller and a more rounded and sleek design but for what we need it for it's perfect for looking over the corner of the garden  footage is clear and easy to see and it's performing as it should.It's not the cheapest but the good battery  wireless design and solar panel make it a good option for added garden security.
5,This is a great camera. The set up was easy on my phone which is android.Once the app was on my phone and I had linked it to the camera my husband put the camera out on the shed to look out over my bee hives. I couldn't belive how clear the picture is.We have put the solar panel out to one side to pick up the most sun.Great idea and so far is working perfectly.Recommended
3,In less than a week (ordered for review on the 7th August 2022 and writing this review on  the 13th August 2022) this Xega Smart Solar Security Camera has gone from £49.99 to £109.99. Not sure how that is justified by the manufacturers but here is my review.This is the second Xega security camera I have owned and reviewed and I have also owned and reviewed multiple other security cameras. This Xega camera is easy to install. The camera comes with clear instructions a solar panel a solar panel wall mount etc. There is a handy drilling template that you can use for the two mounts (camera and solar panel). I had the camera installed on the front of my house very quickly and. because I had previously owned a Xega camera I found connecting it to my home wifi and phone using the Xega UBox app very straight forward. However I was disappointed that the app is still very basic which is a shame as the camera is of okay quality.What is better about this Xega camera compared to the other Xega camera I have reviewed is that the solar panel can be place in a different location to the camera which suits me. My front door is east facing but on the corner of the house. Therefore the solar panel could be placed on the south facing wall and therefore make the most of the UK sunshine (or lack of it). It is for that reason this this Xega camera gets a higher review rating.But there are still a few other issues for me hence only 3 stars. First the app that is needed is far too basic. Second the camera image quality is good but not amazing (but also it is not the worst I have owned either). But the biggest issue is the significant price increase in less than a week. If this camera was £49.99 still I would have given 4-stars but at over £100 I have had to deduct a star as I would have wanted near perfection at that price.
5,I had been looking for a good camera for some time now mainly to monitor any activity by my car motorbike and partners car which is situated just outside our living room window. Neither of us have invested in a dash cam yet so we wanted to have some level of protection should something happen.The camera is strong sleek looking and appealing to look at. The camera is to be used outdoors however we live in rented accommodation so we have restrictions on attaching things to the exterior of the house so we have opted to use this indoors looking out of a window onto our cars. We had some issues with glare and reflection at night making it impossible to see out of however we searched how to avoid this and it was actual night mode causing more problems and once we switched this off it was perfect. The night mode would be perfect if it was outside however behind glass it reflects weird so simply turn this off.The camera was well packaged and protected on arrival is comes with instructions and operational tips. I was really impressed with the simplicity of setting this camera up I had the app downloaded and linked in around 5 minutes which is fantastic.The app is just a basic camera view that you do have options within to adjust such as full day monitoring or motion detection setting parameters to create alerts. The app works well and does everything I need to it has a bit of a strange layout but once you figure out where everything is it works fine.You will need to insert a SD card if you want to store or capture video recordings this was simple and worked fine there is also the option to store via a cloud service but as I had the SD card I did not need this service.The image is clear and works well the night vision is also really impressive.  You could also use this as for a multitude of uses there is also the ability to talk via the microphone if you ever needed to which is a great bonus. This is a great quality safety camera.Great value for a quality camera very happy indeed!
5,Nice to jkeep an eye out on your property if your at home or out
5,So far I have been very pleased with this Xega Wi-Fi 1080P security camera. I have fitted this solar powered camera on the corner at the rear of my house I positioned it at about fence height as I didn’t want to invade the neighbours’ privacy. In this position I’m still able to swing the camera to view the whole of the rear garden and around the corner to view my sheds. Lucky I can point the solar panel south for maximum charging so far this has kept the 10000mAh battery at 100 percentage charged I won’t really know whether it remains charged until the winter months.Setup was very easy after downloading the Ubox APP from the Google play store I turned on the camera and followed the instructions within the APP. Following entering the password for my BT home hub the QR code was then presented to the camera which was recognised instantly the flashing light on the camera then went out. Although this security camera operate at 2.4Ghz I didn’t have to turn off the 5Ghz on my dual band router/home hub when doing the setup this made it very simple.Operation of the camera within the APP is very good I can swing the camera up/down and left/right and the speed at which this is done can be adjusted. Image quality can be adjusted between SD and HD I only ever use HD and at this setting image quality is excellent for a 1080P security camera. As this camera supports micro SD cards I fitted a 64GB SanDisk high endurance micro SD card and this has enabled me to view all motion detected captured footage. Very occasionally the camera becomes unresponsive I’m not sure I this is a network thing i.e. Wi-Fi signal to my phone or camera this does normal resolves itself within a few minutes. Away from the home I can now monitor the garden if necessary using mobile data this works very smoothly either using a 4g or 5g signal.Overall this Xega Wi-Fi 1080P security camera works really well has very good image quality and can be fitted anywhere due to its power source and in my personal opinion is good value for money.Alan
5,I love this security camera! We have put it above the garage door pointing down the driveway and it has given us such peace of mind as a couple of weeks back my son heard a noise outside and came down the stairs to investigate. The security light was on and he also put the downstairs hall light on. Later the next day when my son told us of the incident my husband checked outside and we noticed the door frame had marks alarmingly similar to a crowbar indented into it. This was obviously unnerving so this camera was a very welcome addition. I love the fact it is large and very obvious and there is even a setting on it that allows it to set an alarm off that is quite loud when it detects movement. We did end up turning this off though as it was giving the postman/delivery drivers a heart attack every time they came up the drive lol.The picture quality is really good nice and crisp and although we have not used the audio feature yet it is good to know it is there. I for one feel much more at ease knowing we have a security camera in the driveway to alert us if anyone decided to approach the door at night and we can view it at all times via the phone app.We have encountered no problems whatsoever with this camera and have been really pleased with its performance so far. In light of this I would not hesitate to rate this the full 5/5
5,Took this to my holiday home in abroad and i just love it! Now i can watch it through the app in the uk and get notification if any movement around and also i can turn the camera which ever direction i want.. picture quality is impeccable and the night vision is also spot on. Defo recommended!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 An absolute gem with all the latest and innovative technology built in.  It is the best security camera I have got that is fully wireless and self sufficient with Solar power panel to charge battery so I don't have to keep taking it off to charge every 2 months.What a beautiful design as plastic used on this device is a premium quality material and it comes with all the fittings including a paper template for drilling hole to ensure perfect installation.  It also comes with an extra USB cable just incase you need to charge it using a USB charger but my camera was 100% charged on arrival which shows that there is no battery consumption when it is off as well as battery not self discharging.What I love the most is that it has a fully motorised head so you can use your mobile to pan the head in all the directions to check what's going on outside.  I am very impressed by this feature because all 4 security cameras I have are just fixed in one direction so you can only see in one direction hence I had 2 camera on front and one on the back and side of the house.  This one camera will cover my whole house front and or back. Also no waste of expensive electricity as it is fully self sufficient on power thanks to solar panel provided which also protects it as a shield or canopy against harsh weather elements.Only thing missing in this package is a Micro SD /TIFF card and you are all set to go.  Very easy straight forward installation. Just make sure your router is set to 2.4 wireless protocol when installing.*PS I didn't receive SD card nor a SIM card stated in description.I am very impressed with the design and functionality of this premium quality wireless and Solar power camera by XEGA.

5,Fab little camera for the price comes with 14 days free cloud storage and sd card slot I have attached a picture of both day and night as you can see both have a clear view.The solar panel is definitely a great addition I fully charged before putting it up and havnt had to charge it since the battery has kept at 100% wether that's the same in the winter months I don't know.It was easy to put up and came with a template for easy drilling it has 2 way speaker so you can speak to intruder if needed and also has a light all runs through the app which was really easy to setup
5,I'm currently living at home and wanted a camera outside of my house and to be honest I was quite pleased with this camera. It's what you would expect for this price and does the job.The picture quality is decent and more or less quite clear. As someone who is not tech savvy this was surpisingly easy for me to set up and install especially it being solar panelled so less changing battery was required. An instruction manual was provided which was easy to read and follow..The only drawback for me was establishing a good WiFi connection as my WiFi is shared with a lot of people and the connection is not the greatest... Apart from that it was smaller from what I expected it to be but overall this does a decent job and does exactly what you would expect it too. Would recommend 👍🏻
5,This is a fantastic piece of equipment. Its solid and sturdy which is always a good thing when wanting a camera specifically for security purposes. It was very easy to use and set up. The solar panel works well and keeps it going. The picture is very clear and it is very weather resistant. Overall I am very happy with this fantastic piece of equipment!
3,At the time of this review this camera is £199.99 which after setting up and using i find considerably over priced. It was a bit of a faff to setup with the app etc. It does come with the SIM card loaded with a bit of data but when you run out you need to pay for extra. There is no option for Wi-Fi so its data only. The motion detection isnt great so if using this to catch out potential burglars I think id give it a mess. IN theory this camera should have been amazing but being honest it truly wasn’t worth the price tag. Id probably put this about £90 until things get improved.
5,Really like this great for a non-hardwire option. 10000mAh battery is good and the solar panel is quite big. I had to investigate where was best to place it for security purpose but also to capture the sun.It’s good quality build with relatively easy to follow instructions. It looks decent installed on the wall & using it is straight forward.Connecting to it is easy connect to wifi & pair with the app. Easily to view & can configure notifications for movement if required. Perfect to view car front door etc from away.
5,This is a very well made and engineered device; it's solid and heavy. The solar panel can be attached to the camera (above) or mounted separately on a wall. The camera can be charged via usb so you don't have to wait for the solar cell to charge it. WIFI range is adequate but requires a 2.4 channel router and a phone/tablet connected to that channel for setup. There's also a requirement to install an app so that you can view the camera's video via the Chinese servers that it communicates with. Image quality is fine but only 1080p that reduces the power consumption though; useful for a solar charged machine.
3,This is a solar powered security camera.  Useful for areas where you have no mains power or if you don't want to use main power.  It has a large solar panel on the top but this is on a cable and can be detached and placed a little way from the camera to ensure best position.  The camera is run by a sim card which is included and doesn't run on wifi.  The sim card is preloaded with data and you get a certain amount of free trial data before you need to purchase additional data or use your own data only sim.  Personally I would only ever place this camera in a wifi area so would prefer to have to option to use wifi with it as opposed to only a sim card.  The camera is good quality and provides good coverage picture quality and motion detection.  Its very simple to set up and comes with QR codes instructions and access to an app. You can use an SD card to save the footage or you do have to option to use their cloud services for an additional fee.  It is a good camera very useful to have it as wireless meaning it can be placed anywhere.  But it is very expensive and there are additional costs after the initial free trial has run out which pushes up the prices higher.

3,Security cameraThis looked like a fantastic security camera with a 1080P 355° view a solar panel to charge a massive built in battery perfect for when the weather isn't great! Motion detection human detection night vision two way audio and more. It's waterproof which is absolutely necessary in the UK! The design is nice and a good size at roughly 15cm x 16.5cm x 10cm so it's obvious too which I like as it helps deter unwanted people. The solar panel is also quite a good size at around 22.5cm x 16cm.It seems well made durable sturdy and with such an easy installation it really did seem perfect. Unfortunately when I downloaded the app called 'Ubox' I couldn't get past the part where you need to scan the QR code I'm unsure if it's because the code is so small so maybe my phone struggled to pick it up it doesn't show you a preview of what your camera sees so it is a bit of a guessing game. After many many attempts I gave up. There was no other route past this I think a code as an option to type in would be good but I couldn't see a way around it so that was a shame. Up until that point everything was running fine the camera was ready to pair and talking away.This could just be my phone and if it is it's unfortunate there was no way around the QR code. Other than that the camera is a fantastic design and I don't doubt it's camera quality is as good as you'd expect it to be given the look of everything else but hopefully they fix the issue with the code.
