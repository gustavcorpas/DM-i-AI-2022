5,I bought these for a relative whose new phone didn't come with a charger (crazy I know).  Summary: the charger charged a new phone from about 70% to 100% full charge in less than a half hour which is fast.  Seems like a well built charger it is UL listed and a great price at $12 for three chargers..More detail: I tested the charger using my personal phone the charger was putting out about 1500mA or 1.5Amps which is about the maximum my phone can take.  1.5Amps x 5volts equals 7.75watts this is same as the factory Samsung charger that came with my phone.  The charger is compact so it would be good for travel although the electrical prongs do not fold inward which is fine for me.  Overall seems like good quality 2amp 5volt 10watt USB charger which will work good for standard charging (not fast charging such as 15 watts or higher).  Note the USB receptacle on the charger is USB A (same type as most computers and standard USB cables).
5,I have an architects-style LED desk lamp that came with a 5 volt DC 2000 mAmp USB-A power adapter that failed after less than a year.  Bought a 3-pack of these adapters based on specs and price.  The first one I tried works perfectly.  I assume it's putting out the right voltage and amperage because the lamp's light quality is just as good as it was originally.  And this adapter doesn't get hot like the original one did.  I haven't tried the other two; I'm just holding those in reserve.
5,Son una gran herramienta nunca tengo problemas con mis dispositivos para cargarlos funcionan muy bien de muy buena calidad y potencia una gran marca.
5,I have a bunch of USB-powered micro drone battery chargers and these adapters are perfect for them. They’re compact and lightweight and it’s quick to charge my batteries. For a 3-pack it’s a great deal and means I can charge many batteries simultaneously. I haven’t had any complaints about them and they do the job for me.
5,The FONKEN Battery Packs were easily Installed into each of my Xbox One Controllers (2). They were Already Pre-charged so I was able to use both controllers for days before both batteries needed a charge.Both Battery Packs are performing Flawlessly and the Battery Charge Last a Long Time before Needing Recharged.The Only Distraction Noted was the FONKEN Charger and the 2 Batteries with USB Cable Did Not Include a Wall Transformer. For me this was a problem!I use my Xbox One Primary for Streaming a Major Network with an Additional 5 Major Movie Networks that I can Access 24 Hours Anytime I Desire. My Xbox One is No Where Located near my Computer. I Assumed a Wall Transformer was Included. We all Know What Assume Means so in the End My Bad... Meaning I Should have taken the time to research what the kit did and did not include!Anyway ordered a 3 pack of Wall Transformers for $12.00 and that fixed the Problem.The FONKEN Charger with 2 Battery Packs and USB Cable is an Excellent Value for the Money. I always Focus on Consumer Ratings. The Greater the Number of Customers Rating the Product the Better. This Fonken Product was Rated by Many of Thousands of People and Rated High on the Rating Scale!Also Important if this Product is Ordered and if you plan on Purchasing Suitable Wall Transformers for charging your Batteries Please use Proper Wall Transformers with Required Outputs.Each Battery Requires 5 Volt 1200 mAh (1.2 A) Input. This is Critical Minimum Requirement.So the Purchased Wall Transformer MUST Have a Minimum Output of 5 Volt and 1200 mAh.The Voltage Must be at 5 Volt. The Minimum mAh must be 1200 mAh or Greater! Anything Less the 1200 mAh will result in Under Charging of the Batteries Taking Longer to Charge Charger Not Operating or Damaging your Charger! A Higher mAh Rating is Fine your Charger  Uses Up to the 1200 mAh Rating Uses What is Required for the Rated Requirements for the Batteries.I purchased Wall Transformers with 5 Volts 1500 mAh (1.5 Amp)  Outputs and the FONKEN Charging System is Working Perfectly. I can recharge both of my Controllers at the same time with ease.Noting there is No Wall Transformer Provided with the Packaged Unit I Recommend The FONKEN Charger 2 Battery Packs with USB Cable A Good Value for the Money!
4,The Fonken 5 volt 2 amp USB power supplies I received work satisfactorily. Two of the three units I received tend to have slightly higher than standard output voltages at around 5.3 volts each. This is higher than the standard high limit of 5.25 volts but not dangerously so for most devices. Consider also that the length and wire gauge (conductor thickness) of your USB cable between the power supply and your phone or tablet reduces the voltage somewhat. So what is important is the voltage that is actually reaching your device when charging particularly at high charging rates. If you are using a cheap skinny (high resistance) USB cable then a higher voltage power supply like this may be just what you need in order to get the correct charging voltage at your phone or tablet. You decide. Recommended although with a reservation.
5,I would buy again if needed  works great
5,Nice size and charges super fast! Couldn’t be happier!
5,it works
5,We use these adapters all the time now since a lot of gadgets and other small appliances use a usb cable to charge.  It's a great value for the price since you get 3 adapters.  The prongs are permanently out which I like because that means they won't accidently fold in when I'm trying to plug in something.
5,Worked well for my application.
5,I needed something stronger than the regular phone charger for my Fender Acoustasonic guitar. This did the trick. Charges the guitar in a few hours instead of a couple days with a regular phone wall charger. If you have a device that requires more power to charge this just might fit the bill.
4,The 3 pack is a great value
5,Great to have laying around the house. Low-cost device
5,They arrived quickly and there were enough of them that I have a couple in reserve very good bye I'm very pleased
