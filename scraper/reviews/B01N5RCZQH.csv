4,This little unit is really handy and works as advertised.  I bought it to use on a cruise but I've found it useful for one other task which is connecting a PC without wifi to my home network:  The TP Link TL-WR902AC connects to the wifi and an Ethernet cable runs between the TP Link and the PC.  The TP link provides an IP address to the PC and then acts as a wifi client on my wifi network. Most people aren't going to need this but I work on old PCs that usually have no wifi adapter in them.Up front I will add that the directions for the TL-WR902AC are very good and should guide non-technical users through the steps to get things running based on their specific needs.I also used the TP Link unit on board Royal Caribbean's Liberty of the Seas ship in July 2022.  The idea was to purchase wifi for one device (the TL-WR902AC) and then use the TL-WR902AC to allow multiple devices to connect.  The design is simple:  The TL-WR902AC is the single client on the ship's wifi network and then it broadcasts a new/different wifi signal and SSID that you can connect your devices to.  I used a laptop PC to connect to the TL-WR902AC with an Ethernet cable to navigate the admin web interface on the TL-WR902AC and configure it to connect to the ship's wifi.  This technically all worked but had at least a couple of problems with usability.  First the ship's wifi drops the connection after some amount of time of inactivity and requires that you log in again in the web interlace where you provide the username and PIN that you created when purchasing a wifi connection for 1 device.  Because the TL-WR902AC isn't a PC or computer there is no way for it to hold open the connection with a continual ping or similar.  It might have been possible to leave the laptop PC running all the time and have it continually reach out to the internet to hold open the connection but the second problem was that ship's Internet access was slow and intermittent.  Even from a single smartphone the Internet access was bad inconsistent and slow.  So that complicated the use of the TL-WR902AC because it was not always clear where or why the connections were breaking down.  This is not the fault of the TL-WR902AC however.  If the ship's internet connection had been more reliable I might have been able to more effectively troubleshoot using the TL-WR902AC to share the connection using the single device.  Being on a cruise I did not take a ton of time to troubleshoot all of this especially it became apparent that the ship's Internet connection was poor.  Technically the TL-WR902AC worked so I won't ding it there.I do wish the TL-WR902AC had a few more features:  First it would be good if it could show you a status of the devices using its wifi:  Device IP name (if available) Kilobits in/out last connection time etc.  Yes you can call up the DHCP table but that was just one piece.  Second it would be great if the TL-WR902AC could be configured to make an intermittent ping or http request to an IP address or http link that I provide on a schedule of every few seconds or minutes.  The idea would be to hold open a connection out to the Internet over the wifi connection on the "WAN" side.Third I could not find a way in the TL-WR902AC's web interface to reconfigure the WAN wifi login information without going to setup wizard.  This ultimately isn't a problem but it it would be nice if you could find the config without the wizard.  You CAN do this with the wifi networks that you configure for  your devices but not the wifi network that the TL-WR902AC is the client on.So bottom line this unit works but you need to have some experience with working with these kinds of things and have some understanding of what you're trying to accomplish technically.  The included directions are good to help novice users get running but like many technical things when you run into problems then it helps to have a technical background to troubleshoot.
4,I’ll start off with this - if you aren’t reasonably technical then this may not be for you.  You need to understand networks and troubleshooting when things do not work.  It’s the nature of the beast.This thing works and it worked fairly well over a multi-day cruise. Shared one main connection with three iPhones and two iPads.  What apps work or get blocked is also to the provider.  In our case YouTube TikTok music streaming and general social media/news sites all worked fairly well. You could tell they block a lot of specific traffic though.This travel router is small and easy to hide. Mine stayed in the room most of the time but I also had some success keeping it powered with a charging brick so I could go mobile.Some things to keep in mind ymmv based on the network you’re connecting to:- If you are planning to share a connection you may need to log in and authenticate from your main device and then connect to the wifi from *this* device and then clone the MAC address from your main device over to this router.  Basically just make the router appear to be your main device.  If you’re lucky you’re can just log onto the travel router wifi and authenticate right there and ignore MAC cloning.- You will only be able to have network connectivity through this device if you and your other devices are within range of this device.  If you walk away just like any other wifi router you lose signal.- I had to reboot this thing a few times when it went catatonic on me.- If you’re trying to walk around with this router it may not work and you might need to reconnect.  In my case we were locking on to a specific access point and there was no handing off from AP to AP when I moved out of range.- On IOS:  A tip that helped:  Remember to shut off private browsing on your phone/iPad wifi network settings.  It shouldn’t matter but it did for me.- Change the basic settings and consider shutting off the SSID broadcast to stay incognito.- The TPLink landing page never worked for me Always had to browse to the 192.168.x.x address to log into the admin console.- If you are way out to sea the parent connection may not be working at all even if your travel router is configured correctly.Anyway one part review one part tutorial two parts advice from experience.  Good luck.
4,The router was purchased to be able to log into public (rv park) websites. It appears to be a versatile  piece of hardware but with versatility comes complexity.Initially the instructions seemed vague and the intervention of a TP-Link  customer service representative at Amazons behest was very helpful to get me to the next problem. At many of these RV sites the login process requires a password as well as an email address and sometimes a room or site number. The TP-Link instructions only provided for a single word login.  I can’t remember the video that I watched (not TP-Links production though) that showed how this is accomplished wirelessly on a laptop and the authority of the laptop login was transferred from the laptop  to the router.  Not the kind of thing that you would reasonably expect to have happen.  The upshot is that the little router worked perfectly and for four days stayed locked on to its signal.The  implementation of the internet service  that the park used  was through Tengonet.  It must be easy for the parks to implement  it is fairly common to run into it. I never thought Tengonet was particularly friendly to use and  I thought it was made that way to prevent people from using multiple devices and outside routers.  After an hour or two I had hooked the router to the Tengonet system - wirelessly with a MacBook Air.  I wrote down most of the steps of the process in hopes that I can cut that time down in the future.  A descriptive manual  showing a login to a Tengo type network is what was needed.Reviewing my choices  the TP-Link travel router  seems to be the most versatile of the line up and if I was a road warrior I would definitely have this product. The learning curve is a little steep for a senior retired person traveling in an RV. If you dig deep enough you can find solutions.  It is too bad that the TP-Link travel router doesn’t have more documentation.  I am glad it worked though. I purchased the router  with my own money and received no promotions to write this review.  TP - Links service was prompt when I needed it.One old guy dislike- Its not just TP-Link but this is done by many manufacturers ( Apple is the worst) :  Miniscule light gray printing on a white low contrast background.  It's serial numbers default passwords and model numbers.  I wish this would go out of style.
5,I got the TP-Link N300 Travel Router (without the USB port) specifically for my Xbox One S. I didn't expect it to be this good!My university uses an indirect wi-fi login system (we connect to the open university network which brings up an internet page asking us to login with our university ID and password to authenticate — similar in system to most hotels and airports) which the Xbox can't handle. So I decided to create a small internal network in my room that has its own SSID and password. I went with a mini router rather than just a range extender because this mini router has greater functionality for around the same price as most extenders.Size: As you can see in my pictures the length/width is a little more than that of two quarters side-by-side and the thickness of 3/4ths a quarter. I was surprised by how small it was when I opened it.Accessories: It comes with an ethernet cable USB charger wall adapter (though this is a bit clunky for modern standards) travel pouch Wi-fi Info Card and the standard instructions.Setup: Quick and easy though you'll need to have a computer (I'm not sure if it works on a smartphone/tablet) to access the setup page. It took me about five minutes to set mine up in Access Point Mode. Basically you plug in the router for your preferred mode as per the image/instructions. You then connect to your router from your computer using the password on the Wi-Fi Info Card and go to tplinkwifi(dot)net to do a quick setup. Here you can choose what mode you want to use the router in change your SSID password etc. Then reboot to reconfigure the router.Modes: There are five modes -- two for travel and three for at home use. I went with the Access Point (AP) Mode for my uses but I probably could have just gone ahead with the default Wireless Router mode. The ethernet port in my room was too far away from my Xbox to use Client mode. Regardless it’s working great. I’ve attempted to give explanations for the different modes below but I’m not particularly knowledgeable in this so please correct me if there are any inaccuracies.For Travel:1. Wireless Router (default): Basically it turns a wired internet connection wireless.2. Hotspot Router: I would best describe this as taking an open (and unsecured) wi-fi connection and making it password protected (personal hotspot). The router takes the unsecured wi-fi connection and creates a secured wi-fi/wired connection and you can have one device connected directly to the router and have the rest of your devices using your protected wi-fi at the same time. Useful for connecting to the internet in public places like cafes. I believe it's also great for hotel rooms where only one device can use the internet per room. Connect this and all your devices can use the internet.For Home:3. Range Extender: Similar in nature to the Hotspot Router Mode -- it goes wi-fi to wi-fi except this mode uses your home's network and maintains the same password as your home's AP. It's to extend your home's wi-fi to reach any wi-fi dead spots in your house (like the attic or basement or that weird corner of the room where you like to huddle and binge watch Netflix but just happens to be the same place where wi-fi connectivity is super sketch and the video never loads). You can use the router for both wired and wi-fi connections simultaneously.4. Client: Sort of the opposite of the Wireless Router mode -- this takes a wi-fi network and makes it wired so that devices that don't have wi-fi capabilities can connect to the internet. It's great for smart TVs game consoles printers.5. Access Point: Same as the Wireless Router mode takes a wired network and makes it wi-fi.Speed: There wasn’t really any compromises made with the download speed. My university has incredibly fast wi-fi (though my dorm isn’t as fast as our libraries) so I’m glad that wasn’t sacrificed. The upload speeds weren't as consistent but still not bad. You can see the speed test results in my pictures.Overall I'm really liking this mini router. The size is perfect for travel (it's smaller than my Macbook Pro's MagSafe adapter…!) and the setup was straightforward. Definitely a recommended buy.
4,I bought this to replace my big bulky Apple Airport router because I'm trying to streamline my case. This tiny thing looked to be the perfect thing for the job.If you have a Mackie DL1608 then most likely you've stumbled upon this review because you are trying to determine if you should buy this OR you are having problems getting it to connect. That is why I'm leaving this review because I initially had issues.I set mine up as an Access Point. I had it connected to my Mackie went through all the setup steps in the tp-link site but I still couldn't get the Mackie to show anything other than "Disconnected" in the Master Fader app.I finally turned off the Mackie and turned it back on and once I did that I think it recognized the new router and I was able to connect to it via my phone and 2 different ipads.So yes this router DOES work with the Mackie DL1608. Just used the Access Point operation mode and turn your Mackie on and off to get it to register the new router. Once I have a chance to use this unit out at a show I'll update this review with my comments about distance and reliability of the connection. But size wise this thing is amazingly tiny. It fits in the palm of your hand.
5,Good dayAfter a trip to Aruba where the Wi-Fi can be hit or miss depending on where you stay on the island and at which resort I was looking for an all in one Hotspot/Extender to improve the signal that would drop in and out. The Resort we stayed at had sketchy coverage and the best signal was near the office. After reading the reviews and watching numerous youtube videos I selected the Dual Band WR902AC. The packaging is quite compact and simple and all the needed accessories required for connection and travel.I first attempted to connect the unit through my Home Network as a repeater and I was successful. I then configured the device as a Hotspot and was successful. The GUI interface does not have all the bells and whistles but we are not configuring Cisco and Juniper routers here.I am travelling over the Labor Day weekend and will be staying at a Marriott property. I am looking forward to testing the unit and working through the Hotel Wifi and bypass their potential security measures.I did find that attempting to connect via Cisco AnyConnect VPN on my work laptop through the unit caused a few DNS issues. To resolve this I had to connect into my HQ server. I have been burning-in the unit for 2 days now and it has not dropped the signal. I will need to run up/down speeds to get a better picture of bandwidth utilization.Overall not a bad product. Looking forward to the Hotel Test and the Aruba test.
4,This worked well with the resort WiFi. It's super convenient to have all my devices connect to the same device regardless of where we stay. It even worked well with streaming. I stopped short of giving it 5 ⭐ because this model doesn't allow you to use a separate VPN service ...kind of important when you're out of the country and want to stream the stuff you're used to watching.
5,This does a bunch of things most of which honestly isn't really useful.  There's two main reasons to buy this IMO.1. To turn a wired internet signal into wireless.  Like if you're in a hotel in another country (if you were in your own country you probably have signal through your phone) and they offer you internet but it's an ethernet connection then this will let you change that ethernet connection to a wireless.  This is nice if  you're with other people and you all want to be on your devices.2. To turn a wireless signal into a wireless signal.  This is why I bought this.  And you're probably like "huh?  Wireless signal into a wireless signal?  That's stupid!  It's already wireless."  Yes... but you see this is the thing.  Some places like cruises you can pay for internet service and that internet service is given to you through WiFi.  But... you pay for ONE DEVICE.  Meaning if you have a phone and a tablet you can only have one connected unless you pay for another connection (which on cruises is like $25-30 A DAY).  With this little device you can take that one device connection and create your own wireless access point so as many devices as you want (that's within range) can connect to your access point and have internet.The latter is why I bought it and it does work!  But of course this isn't as great as it sounds because it needs a power source (either plugged in or you have to plug it into a battery pack if you want it on the go) and if you're somewhere like a cruise (which is mainly where this issue crops up) then the internet is really slow or spotty anyways (until they start StarLinking I suppose) and it means multiple people are sharing a slow connection making it even slower.
3,This is the first AC travel router I've purchased but also one of the only ones I've seen on the market.  I've had it for a few days and put it through some of its paces - configuration packing for a trip etc.  I want to love this router but it's just OK.  I'm not even sure I'll replace my 2.4Ghz Wireless N travel router with it at this point because of one of its pretty big physical flaws.PROs:- As with the other TP-Link travel router I owned this seems to be a fully functional router in a compact package.  It does MAC address access lists for the wireless DHCP reservation port forwarding port range forwarding DMZ etc.- It's almost as small as the 2.4GHz travel routers I have.  I have a case that fits my router a 2 foot flat Ethernet cable a micro USB cable and a USB wall wart adapter.  This thing fits in that case taking up only a little more room than my 2.4GHz router did.- Some other major brand/highly rated travel routers here come with very little in the way of what's needed to work out-of-the-box.  This router like the other TP-Link I had comes with a flat Ethernet cable a micro USB cable and a micro USB charger.  That means if you order it while away from home you still have everything you need to get up and running.CONs:- There appears to be very little documentation on this router.  When I go to TP-Link's United States website it doesn't even come up in a search.  When I searched on the router model in Google it took me to TP-Link's United Kingdom website.  There is a new firmware available for this router but it says it's EU specific.  So for now apparently there's no US support for firmware or documentation for this router.- While the wireless MAC address access list is listed as a PRO up above it's implementation is somewhat of a CON.  It gives separate access lists for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.  If you want to add a device to both you have to do it in each place; there's no way to tell the router to add to both lists at the same time.  With a medium to large list of devices this is cumbersome.  Also the MAC list can only be seen 9 devices at a time so searching through the list to make sure everything is on it becomes tedious.- The micro USB power and Ethernet ports are on different sides of the router.  This doesn't sound like a big deal but when using these things in many different travel environments and thinking about other travel and even home routers this isn't really ideal.  In some places I have to put the router near the bed.  I've started putting the router in its case with the power on and running in order to not see the bright blinking lights at night.  The placement of these two cables prevents that from working out.- The micro USB power port on this router seems to be recessed further inside the unit than it should be.  The cable barely plugs into it and I've had it slip out multiple times just by bumping the router.  I've tried multiple micro USB cables with it so I know it's the device. Looking inside the router it doesn't look like mine has a manufacturing defect it looks like it's the design.  This is the one con that I think will make me either return this router or not use it to its fullest extent.  Over time all of these type of connectors wear and the connection isn't as solid as it was in the beginning (cell phones are a prime example of this).  If this thing has a problem with loose connection out of the box over time it will get worse and probably won't stay in at all without some external device like a rubber band holding it in.UPDATE 20170420:  I ordered a second of these routers just to see if the micro USB port issue was isolated to the first unit I received.  Out of the box I found that the second unit has the exact same issue as the first: the micro USB connector is seated so far into the router that any micro USB cable plugged into it has difficulty staying seated.  One cable I had barely "clicked" but did not stand up to any amount of tugging.  Another didn't click at all and fell out on its own.  The cable provided with the router is no different.  Apparently this is a design flaw with the router.
5,This is a nice compact travel router highly configurable and with very good speed.However I had one issues: it was supposed to be new but did not come in a box (it arrived in a clear plastic bag with no branding info) and it had to be reset before I could connect and begin to configure it.  It is in like new condition (except for needing a reset) so neither of these were important to me.
