4,The suction cup would not stay in place.  I don't know if it was because the inside of the car was too hot. After it came off it left a little residue on the dashboard.  I did not like that.  This is an expensive car and I want it to look the same as a new one that I bought.  Just in case I ever decide to trade it for a newer model. Even hooking the phone mount to the air vent is questionable too.
4,cuando lo recibí no tenía instrucciones  entonces sea leí las reseñas y no eran muy buenas  lo pegue en el tablero y de inmediato se fue al suelo junto con mi teléfono  me desanima y pese regresarlo pero mi hijo lo pegó en el parabrisas y se quedó muy bien pegado y desde ese día ahí se quedó  pongo mi teléfono. cuando manejó y desde ese día no se a movido de ahí
4,When the dash board is in the sun when the car is parked and ac is off the holder comes off and phone lands on the floor.  It doesn't seem to hold as well on a slightly textured surface.  I have a small space to put a phone holder and that is why I purchased this one but there is very little totally flat area.  Pros:  Holds phone securely adjustability of arm and rotation.  I am still searching for a holder that will work in my car does not block any instruments or audio visual displays and is easy in/our of the phone.  I have a Porsche SUV.
5,There is no built in GPS in my vehicle and it is unsafe to have to look down at my phone.  I have attached this phone mount onto the far left of the windshield so I can keep my eyes on the road with very little blockage.  It has stayed secure not wiggling or loosening when traveling on bumpy surfaces.  Would absolutely recommend.
4,Works as intended.
5,Works perfectly. A little trouble with the grip of the device as you squeeze it to hold it in the carrier.
4,Does what I wanted it to do. Phone in good position to view without taking my eyes off the road. Holds phone securely and ease to place phone into holder. Easy removal of phone. Threaded clamps that hold it in position tends to loosen over time.
5,Excellent.  Easy to install and use.
4,Working great rattles a little but gois
5,Florida heat no problem you not be disappointed
3,Will only hold phone if you have a cover or case on it you'll need to remove to use this device. My LG V60 was to heavy and often leaned
3,It was simple enough to install using the suction cup. Worked great for an hour or so and then *thunk* it all came crashing down... Wish the suction cup worked better. It's annoying having to just use the vent clip. In retrospect the vent clip saves this product otherwise it would've been a wasted purchase!It does rattle if you don't have your phone in it and the arms aren't closed which can get annoying!
3,Dislike not sticking to dashboard
2,Kept dropping down. Tightened every day and one day the tightened screws broke off. I do not recommend this item
5,Makes my phone easy access for navigation and hands free. Easily installed
5,Hard to install
5,Great product. Durable fits in my car
1,As soon as I put this thing on my dashboard and put my phone on a little screw popped out and went into my defrost event that I cannot get back.. This thing fell apart within seconds of putting it on my -. I would not suggest this one bit
1,The adhesive did not stick for more than 2 minutes.  Very disappointed.
1,It doesn’t come with directions!
1,Doesn’t stay up and suction is terrible!
1,This is pissed off sheet bad Items not good
5,Todo bien
5,Easy to install and use daily. Great hold
4,This phone holder works great if you are going to install it and leave it in the first vehicle. If you plan on moving it between vehicles it loses adhesion and will end up on the floor. It securely holds the phone even when it hits the floor. Samsung Note 10+
