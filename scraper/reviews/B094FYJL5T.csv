3,I ended up having a replacement sent because the first one did not function properly.Both units arrived fine. Installed easy and looked great.Tried to turn it up using the buttons on the unit but that did not work. One volume changes the mode the other volume does nothing (that I could tell) the power button turns the volume up and the mode button returns you to the home screen.Needless to say all the physical buttons on the device are wired incorrectly. But if I use the remote the device functions properly. So don't lose the remote if you buy this because I had them send me a replacement and it is wired the same way.Both units make a horrible background noise when you select Bluetooth mode I even grounded the stereo to the frame of the truck to make sure it was not a grounding issue causing feedback. The second one I received still makes the sound when nothing is playing but goes away as soon as a song connects so that is ok but I am still going to return both items and try my luck elsewhere.
4,This stereo works great and fit in my 02 TJ. I had to modify my inside dash a little bit was easy.  Android screen mirror does not work if you have updated Amdroid.  I can not find firmware update for stereo.  This is only downfall
4,este radio suena muy bien pero lo único malo es que no se conecta mi teléfono Android y por eso lo he comprado para poder conectar mi teléfono pero no se conecta de ninguna forma por eso solo le doy cuatro estrellas
4,Got it for my son for his birthday and he absolutely loves it
4,The product was easy to install however there is an interference noise that won't go away even after purchasing a new wiring harness
3,Very  poor wire diagram speaker wires explained OK but power connections make no senseA1 Back in....I assume this is " power from back up lights to turn around n cameraA2 Brake.....this is normally used when a DVD player is available to not allow playbackA3 Key.....?????A4 Battery+..I assume needs power always for clockA5 Antenna...power to activate power antennaA6 ILL....?¿???????A7 Ignition switch.....+ 12 switchedA8 Ground...B- ( got one correct)They need to hire an American to write instructionsOtherwise OK for the price I am using for a dedicated rear view camera only.
4,It works. Not much to say about it. NOT APPLE CARPLAY. Just mirrors the phone and at a bad quality. Sound and picture suck when linked. Links automatically when plugged in. Don’t get your expectations high for this. Cheaply made cheap quality
3,This radio comes loded with isles features and looks great if you want to impress your friends it looks great if you just want to listen to the music go for it you will be very happy but get a pro to hook it up the instructions are incorrect and un clear most of the features require adding
3,The cameras were pro installed but nothing worked for my vehicle.  The leads don't work for the camera install but everything else works. Wished it had GPS but that's on me.
4,Took me awhile to install the bluetooth connect right away at start of the car which is good but the mirroring does not work even with a mirror link device that I bought sepperately that has worked on other cars. Does read usb drives that I have with music insalled. Back up cam works pretty good but quality is not the best. I tried to get the gps working and that would not work either. Volume is decent. I know people that would be upset with this purchase but personally I don't mind it because it is for my work car and as long as it plays music from bluetooth ill be fine.
4,I think I would really like the radio install was easy video looks good. But the audio wire harness plug has a short and doesn’t work properly if plugged completely in. Going to reach out and see if someone will fix the issue.
3,Can't figure out how to adjust the clock. If anyone knows how. Let me know.Everything else is good.
4,Great stereo for the price. Only down side is that when playing music through Bluetooth stereo doesn't show song title artist or album just displays unknown unknown unknown. Have tried with both android and apple. Screen display is nice.  Fuzzy/out of focus when started in landscape but just disconnect and reconnect with phone on home screen in portrait and then rotate to landscape.
5,Great Stereo for a great price! I just used it for our rental cars and it was great. The installation is very easy the performance of the stereo is very good. Nothing bad to say. If you are looking for good quality at a low price here is the best. top rated Customer Service very pleased.
5,Touch screen and back up camera
4,This is a 60 dollar radio not a 300 dollar one so don't expect the same sound and support as a high cost stereo.  With that said I have found this radio to quite impressive in sound quality even better than the factory stereo that came with the car.  The touchscreen is highly responsive and the Bluetooth connects without any issues. The only issue so far is a bit of an echo picked up by the mic that has been reported by someone on the receiving end of my call. Perhaps better installation and user instructions would be helpful as well.Overall I am very impressed by this radio and would definitely recommend it anyone who is looking to replace theirs at an affordable price.
3,Got it hooked up wires all matched up... turns on and functions great. Except for the fact that when I cut the vehicle off it stays on... I've even opened and closed my door multiple times and tried locking and unlocking while closed. It just stays on. Any assistance would be appreciated.
4,Works as should
3,Can not find a installation kit or faceplate to fit this radio for a 2013 f150
4,Great product for the price
5,La conexión de los equipos Bluetooth ✅
5,Buena inversión
5,Best purchase I've made in a while
5,very good system. easy to follow instructions. great price
3,Sounds good everything is great about it the only problem I had was finding the right installment to fit that particular unit every time I found one of our supposed to say mounting bracket and all calls for installing it does not match that is the donut problem I have is very hard to find installments it can fit that project for unit
3,Hard to get it to cut on. Can't change the time. It does not mirror your phone screen.  Bluetooth does not automatically connect.
3,This radio came with the USB not working. It doesn't recognize any files or music. The the SD slot works and recognizes my music. USB does not. The people from this stereo will respond saying to reachout to them to make it good. Truth is you cannot get ahold of them.
3,Bough with a double din conversion  for a dodge  ram. But  the radio is to large for the fit. Not sure which is at fault.  So far the function of the radio seems good.  The cable for the back up camera was to short.  And when the back up camera is on it cuts music.
4,Unit is good but does not have apple car play only mirror other than that its an awesome product
5,Great radio sounds great and was a great price for a very quality radio
4,easy install havent used camera
2,For the price it’s hard to complain. However I’m going to share my experience… rear camera did not work(tested wires to make sure they had power.) No way to control sub. Does not fit 7 inch dash kit. I didn’t bother with any other features because I’m going to return. Overall I’d give it a 3/10.
2,I wanted to give this a try and i cant connect to mirror. Usb doesnt do anything. My 12 " subs along with 6" mids and 2 6x9 sounds like a factory system. The so called eq is only bass and treble. No other sound options are on it so if you have a larger system dont bother with this. Reinstalling my single din kenwood that isnt touch screen or Bluetooth but the sound setup option are awesome.
5,Excelente
2,The sound isn’t good always have to adjust treble and bass don’t stay where you adjusted it! Every time you have to download your contacts. At least I can Bluetooth my phone.
5,Easy to install works perfectly and love the back up camera built into the display screen
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I purchased these 3 items together bc they said most ppl buy all 3. Well the radio worked although its got a grey background but the other 2 parts go to a whole different vehicle. I have a mercury mountaineer n the other 2 parts go to a gmc vehicle. So don't make the same mistake I did. Make sure all ur parts fit the same vehicle.
5,Good quality
5,La camara de rreversa no funciono da la luz de rreversa que incluye al rrededor del lente pero no da imagen. Ya he conectado un radio con camara de rreversa antes y todo vien entonces no puedo decir que esta mal conectado.
2,Se queda la pantalla trabada y no funciona la conexión automática con el celular
5,This was installed in a 2001 mustang GT equips with a Mach sound system it sounds amazing great value for the money very pleased with the level of quality that went into this unit !
5,Not bad installed in a 2005 Silverado.  Simplelight weight. The Arizona heat will test it120-140deg inside cab summers.
4,No se puede conectar con mi telefono en. Modo espejo
5,Me agrado
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Lo recomiendo súper fácil de usar muy buena calidad
2,Stereo freezes with phone connected have to reboot radio the station shows 000 so can’t preset stations cause u can’t see what station is on only the blue tooth works but doesn’t show what’s playing reverse camera works but I guess for price I can listen to music at least
5,This is the best yet affordable car stereo I have come across yet.  We ended up purchasing two.  One for each vehicle!
1,Firstly I wished they would state that you should buy a double dinn adapter cause after receiving it I had to wait another 3 days for one to connect it. I wasn't willing to cut off my factory harness to splice wires.The main reason is that it won't connect to the phone. The app is supposed to auto prompt to install on your phone when you connect it. You can't find a link or a number in their manual cause if you have trouble connecting your phone you obviously can't get the app.All I have is wasted cost in buying another wire adapter an aftermarket housing and a radio that I can only use as a radio. Minus the use of me using my steering wheel controls. Was better off with my factory radio. I had use of the steering wheel control and had my phone contacts stored in it. Oh ya even connecting the radio via Bluetooth could not store contacts while following provided instructions.
2,Lo tuve que devolver porque nunca me sirvió para usar el link mirror
3,For the most part it’s pretty decent but the fact that you don’t have a volume knob and it’s a push button sucks even though you have a remote
5,My car
3,Sad that I never got to try this unit! It will not fit in dash of Windstar van without major cutting of the factory dash. The measurements are incorrect in listing. No problem returning which was a blessing!
5,The item was proud! Notably prime delivery. Quality of the wrapping was optium!
3,It’s ok
5,is actually a good radio for the price at first I was very skeptical but once I got it installed it I’m pretty satisfied with it
2,When I first looked at it it seemed good for the price it should be a mid range radio but the look the conectivity and functionality is not the best. My phone does not connect as it has a newer version of firmware. They should put that in big letters or just stop selling it. I would go back to my old radio if the hassle wouldnt be that much.
5,Love it
3,Rear camera doesn't work
1,Looks cool. But so do I. But in reality it's actually not worth a dam. Couldn't mirror link it to save my life. Instructions are like voting . Useless. You know I'm actually done buying stuff off of here. I buy things to actually use. 89 bucks for this. Can't believe they charge250 to install this crap. Then u gotta buy the harness and other crap . May as well Buy a pair of head phones. I bought it for the gps . Don't work. Always unpaired just not with the frustration
1,This is a car radio so technically it isn't lying about what it is. Its not horrible. But factory was better. I have had it for a few weeks still haven't figured out how to change the clock on it. And when you try to screen mirror it tells you watching media is prohibited while driving which struck me as odd because the car was in park and not running. I'm gonna replace it within the year because honestly this thing blows. Don't waste your time or your money. Have a good day random person reading this.
2,It is an okay unit and does what it's supposed to do for the most part.Connecting to it is a process .It glitches every once an a while like the screen just to a different section without you even touching it .Overall I got what I paid for .Not the best but definitely not the worst stereo ever
5,Works well. Fit right in with no modifications in my 2006 RSX..
1,This does not fit into a Honda Odyssey radio replacement kit. The trim piece for around the radio has no clips. It just sets in place and can come off at any time. Do not buy.
5,I love this stereo...can't say enough good things about it
3,Se frisa cuando contestas el telefono
4,Muy completo y buen sonido
1,I mainly purchased this unit to replace my CD player. This is not a unit for amp/subs. The backup camera doesn’t work at all
3,Didn’t link to my iPhone for mirroring option but other than that good buy for the price
1,Gente no compren este producto por muy barato que sea no vale la pena se mutea no suena se queda en pantalla negra luego de activar la cámara evítense dolor de cabeza
5,Su diseñoY
1,Unit did not come on at all. I've tapped it to just power to get it to come and would not power up. To say the least I'm an electrician and know how to make a connection. Put in for replacement will update feedback when I get new unit and see that it functions properly.
1,The Bluetooth connection is spotty like it goes in and out and the mirror mode or whatever you want to call it is garbage like it literally shows you exactly what is on your phones screen and if you have your phone standing up right you can't see what's on the screen plus you have to keep your phone unlocked or the screen goes black i would not recommend this to anyone I hate I even bought it
1,Radio will not turn on
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             When playing it's great but keep powering down (shutting off )open to welcome and goes no further
5,I love the fact that I fit like a glove n my girlfriend's 2001 toyota camry and my 2001 chevy blazer ..great sound volume goes up to 50 ..good stuff
1,With modern technology and casting how can you expect customers to use a cable to see what on the phone via the radio. Worst purchase I ever made. Throw it in my storage as I will not install or even give it to some as it's now worth it.
5,Sound quality is 60-40 compared to my last head unit. But this ones a nicer looking unit. Back up cam on this unit seems to lag a bit
1,After I spend $250 with parts and installation. End of the day is not working. Touch screen is not working. Totally waste of money. How Amazon can make up my loss ?
1,It doesn't fit nor does it wrk like it's said with my vehicle.
2,This radio is okay but overall junk. None of the buttons on the radio do what they say they do volume buttons don’t work mode button doesn’t work over all unsatisfactory. Was going to put another one in my Honda but definitely will be going with a name brand
2,I didn’t get passed removing it from the box. The wiring directions are not included but there is a picture of what the wires connects to. If you can understand the abbreviation you might be able to wire it.
1,Sound quality is poor at best and would not fit in the standard double din mount but it is cheap
5,Great radio came with everything you need to install even electrical tape
5,I liked everything
1,Cheap radio cheap quality
5,Easy install. Easy to use and navigate. Still figuring things out but satisfied with sound and wireless connectivity.
1,It is not as described does not have mirroring capability as described
5,
1,Bad camera
1,Does not mirror does not download contacts very minimal options got 2 as one to be sent back and it's cheaply made stay away 0 stars tried everything to get it to mirror it does not work as avertised false claims false advertising junk
5,Great item for the money paid
1,My RV
1,Was used for the Bluetooth but it stop connecting for some reason.  Not a good product for the money.
1,The antenna hole isn’t even the right size to plug in the antenna cord
1,This is the second radio I tried none of them works after some minutes the sound good away rear camera never works
1,This is useless after it was installed at Christmas. Screen has gone blank so you can't use it.Did a factory reset and nothing. Funny how it is 2 weeks out of return date.Stay away  not worth the savings.
1,I returned this product because it didn’t fit my car Without a lot of work
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Alguien le metio una patada al radio pantalla rota
1,Would not recommend. We got this radio for my sons truck. It stopped working when the warranty expired (just 3 months after we purchased it). Very disappointing.
1,Says 60 watts in description and once you get it it’s actually 45 watts
1,Just didn’t work with my RVBackup camera wasn’t compatible
1,Have to order new connectors the ones that came with this stereo  don't fit my yukon so another $60. Later when I get this .I'll let ya know
1,Came broken in the box
1,This was a bad unit that was sent had to return it
1,Ports in back was broken when I received the item
1,This stereo sound like I got it out of a CRACKER JACK box....  With the volume turned all the way up  it sounds like i have it on level 3.
1,Trash radio but you get what you pay for. It sounds ok but it’s like a 10.00 radio in quality
1,No me gusto
1,Bought 2 of these and neither of them would put out any sound. The plugs in the back of the radio were faulty
1,I doesn’t work powered up and nothing
1,Sound quality is trash
1,Sucks
1,I had this radio for less than 24 hours! It doesn't pick up radio station because the radio station doesn't end in "zero" for example 98.30 or 84.70... the radio station in Exuma Bahamas is 98.03. The remote doesn't work! I opened a pack of brand new  batteries and nothing! This is useless to me. I paid for the radio plus paid for it to be shipped to the Bahamas which was an additional $57. Soooooo disappointed. Also it doesn't connect to my phone! The Manuel is horrible at explaining it's like it was horribly translated to English! I should've listened to the reviews! Guys plz listen to the many bad reviews and save your money!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               No hace la función de espejo con el celularMuy pobre calidad de sonido
