5,Great product! Exactly what I was expecting. The silicon key chain keeps the tag snug and safe. It does not look like it will fall out and only thy front of the tag is showing. I'm going to use it for travel and should be perfect!
5,When my sister and I were able to set these up so easily syncing to our iPhones you just know these are as user-friendly as advertised.  The next thing we knew we went out to dinner and got a text stating that our Airtags were left behind at our home address.  Aha!  They work!  Then I was on a domestic flight with a layover and I was very happy to know that my luggage changed planes when I did!  Great little travel accessory!
5,Great no problems. Airtag fits inside securely and we attached the hooks inside our suitcase with no problem. We use them for luggage so can't attest to any other functionality. Glad we have them otherwise that airtag would be floating around and no doubt lost!
5,I like like the color coding silicone sleeve is easy  insert but holds tag well.  The clip is solid enough to clip inside a bag (it may work outside a bag but if a checked bag- who knows.  I bought them because they would be easy to find in a bag.
5,Usually on my keys but in my luggage when traveling and clipped to my dog's collar when he's at the dog sitter's. It's a comfort to know I can find the dog if he runs off. These fit the air tags perfectly.
5,Tracking luggage at airport and while traveling.  Great value.  Can used at home on tool kits handbags briefcases laptops etc.
5,A great way to attach an air tag to your luggage (inside) or to your keys
5,Owned for three months. Have used for Apple AirTags. One on key ring and another on my dog‚Äôs collar. Satisfied.
5,These are just what I was looking for - great value for the cost.
5,No need to spend more.
5,We used these AirTags & holders on our luggage for an overseas flight with subsequent European cruise. The ease of installation & use was incredible! Being able to locate our items at all times was a huge factor in the enjoyment of our trip. Thank you AirTags
4,Over 10 months the air tag has popped out about 5 times.  Once in my pocket and several times while caring more than just my keys causing me to grip keys at a harsh and odd angle.  Thankfully it was always in my house and I noticed quickly.  The good news is I can always find the lost air tag but if I did not notice that  it was no longer in the holder it would be difficult to find my keys.  Going to buy a sturdier holder now.
5,Dislike Apple pricing.Does track items that we have tested.  We are planning on using them in our luggage when we travel to Europe next week.
5,Flexible material makes it easy to insert air tag and colors help to tell them apart. Sturdy key chain.
5,Good value for money. Durable. Was able to protect my air tag and fit in my checked luggage. The ability to track my luggage gave me piece of mind that it would not be lost or stolen
4,The first order was lost and it never showed up. I had to contact Amazin about the delay and they said it must have gotten lost. Amazing re-shipped another set of AirTag holders and they were received very next day.. The product appeared exactly as I expected and worked just fine.
4,Use them to keep track of your luggage they are great!
5,very practical easy to put the AirTag in hard for it to come out  that's good! easy to put on your luggage. seems sturdy enough to last a long time . time will tell but seems near perfect. now using it on luggage the car( to find where its parked!)
4,Sadly only 3 of the 4 purchased Work.
5,Lightweight; easy to insert Air Tags; performs as described.
4,None
4,I like the silicone material it won‚Äôt damage my car while driving because I have it attached to car keys and one had a glow in the dark feature
4,Needed new battery only one month after purchase.
5,I bought these because I need to keep track of my AirTags inside my backpack and luggage.  I don‚Äôt understand the small number of reviewers who said the AirTag will pop right out or the spring on the ring is too weak.  These seem to hold my AirTags very securely and the spring latch on the ring seems fine for my use.  If you are afraid of the ring opening you could always replace it with a solid ring.
5,Love them. Great for the price.  Easy to set up. Just want my refund for the two day shipping I didn‚Äôt get.
5,I like the design and it is useful to attach to a variety of things.
5,Nice quality and easy to use
5,Got these to put in luggage it is very strudy and fits the princes cruises tag
5,Good value.
4,The holder seems to protect the air tag and make it easy to attach to something like luggage.
5,These were the cheapest air tag holders I could find.  They worked well while I was on a trip and had them on luggage and in my purse. Sometimes you get more than you pay for-shock!
3,Very cheaply made but will hold together if you don‚Äôt move it around. I would NOT recommend for a key ring dog collar or something with a lot of movement.I bought these in July 2022 put into backpacks & suitcases pockets in early August. After opening one of the metal clips (the large ones) it snapped in two and broke. Since I was using all 4 I knew I was opening and closing them correctly.Conclusion: too cheap for much movement or opening & closing of the ring. Okay for stashing into a pocket.
5,I went on a long trip abroad and wanted an added means to keep track of my luggage. After doing some investigation I decided to use AirTags. I also didn‚Äôt want to just toss the tags into my bags and let them drift around and possibly get lost. I chose these holders to keep the AirTags secured inside each bag. They worked great. I always knew where my luggage was and the AirTags stayed put. Success all around. These worked perfectly for my purposes. I recommend them for this type of use.
5,Fits tags perfectly. Tags are secure inside.  Easy to attach the tags to other items!
5,MUY BUENO
5,Great thanks
4,Bought to protect Air tags inside luggage. The silicone is sturdy but the metal ring breaks easily. Recommend replacing the metal ring with higher quality attachment like a carabiner or S-clip.
5,The product was shipped in a timely manner and we were satisfied with the quality
5,Very durable and did what we needed for tracking
5,Attached to luggage keys and purse
5,Metal ring that came with it was junk!!!!changed it out with a double lap ring any hobby/Fabric store should  have it!! Silicon housing nice fit!!
5,Worse great with electric screwdriver or battery operator screwdrivers
5,These in two days to secure to my car keys my wife‚Äôs purse and her car keys.  They hold the AirTag securely and are attractive.
5,I like the easy to use ring that allowed us to attach them easily inside the suitcases. We were able to know our bags were on the plane and still with us.
5,Easy to insert AirTag with a ring to use to attach keys.  It appears to be well made and should last a long time.
4,Good price and easy to use
3,I'm getting a lot of good use out of these AirTag holders.  But their durability is about what you'd expect.  I use for my car keys and while it does the job it's designed to do there are a few things I wish I could change about it.  For one the key ring is way too thick which means the silicone surrounding it is thin.  If you fidget with things in your pocket like I do you might soon discover the silicone around the ring is beginning to tear.  You could spend way more for a higher quality product from Belkin or something but these do an adequate job. So why spend more if you don't have to?
5,Cumplen su cometido muy bien‚Ä¶
5,I am an accidental fan of the Apple Tags after losing my wallet in an airport and being able to track it until it arrived safely back to me...minus the cash. These are a handy but obvious way to attach an Apple Tag to keys and purses.
5,Fits on easily. protects AirTag. Easily attaches to whatever you need
5,You will not be disappointed.  I will be buying more!  I especially like the unique clips and little ring for an individual key.
5,It is exactly as stated in description. The variety of colors is nice.
5,Good product and great value!
5,I have the apple leather keychain and while it is a lovely product in typical apple fashion the leather is starting to show signs of wear. These silicone cases are much cheaper and seem to be better suited for everyday use. My nails appreciate the hinge keyloop; jury is still out on durability. But so far for the price and initial quality I can‚Äôt complain.
5,Seem to be a good quality and inexpensive.
5,Great AirTag holder
5,Very happy with them... they cost a lot less than the ones at apple and they have the same or better quality.
4,I didn‚Äôt realize it but the Apple tags speaker is on the back of the tag. So I had to flip the tag around so it faced out the hole. Then the insignia was covered which is fine. It‚Äôs just an aesthetic thing for me. But I guess it also hides the fact that is in Apple tag and maybe people will be less likely to steal it or take it off your bag etc. I used it for a plane trip and they survived the trip! I use them on my keys and wallet and haven‚Äôt torn fallen or broken off!
5,Perfect and fast
5,Damn good product & Deal üëçüèæüòé
5,I‚Äôve been using this for my AirTag on my keys for the last month. It has held my AirTags and I haven‚Äôt experienced the air tag popping out. I would buy this again if I need more AirTag holders.
3,Three out of four work.
5,These are user friendly and work well.
5,Sad that i have to buy these. Buy the airtag holders too. I used all four. I glued one in my wallet so now i have a lumpy wallet. Better lumpy than lost. Im sure George Carlin would have something to say about losing my stuff.
5,Works great. Exactly what we needed. No more hubbie losing his wallet and me my keys
5,This is a soft silicone fob that is perfect to use with your air tag
5,Works and looks as advertised no complaints.
5,As expected
5,Keep my keys my dog Jessie easy to find
5,work as described.  great quality
5,Easy to insert the air tag and good material
5,Good stuff
5,I bought these because I liked the colors and I had an experience earlier this year where I lost my keys for a few hours‚Ä¶the holders are on par with the size I‚Äôve seen around the internet without charging the premium prices I‚Äôve seen for more mainstream brands‚Ä¶I‚Äôve only been using them for a week but I feel confident I have nothing to fear.
5,I like the clip on it.
4,no smart ass funny reviews here on this product. it was what I expected for the price and worked well as anticipated. one thing I did was use split key rings instead of the quick clip but that's just a personal preference not a fault with the product. BUY IT !
5,This product was reasonably priced and adds to the usefulness of the AirPads.
5,Fits the Apple air tags perfectly.
5,These key chains work well. Simple easy to use and clean. I would recommend
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I have bought the 4 pack case for about 3 months now. The metal ring quality is GREAT. I have tried other products that were much cheaper and found the metal clip would not close after multiple usage.WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW is that there is a gap in the center on one side of the face to show the emoji or initials on the tag. This is the only vulnerability part of the case where it can get scratched. The case feels rubbery but great with the grip and bounces of the ground when it gets dropped with no damage. It also does not dampen the sound of the find my apart.Over all: it‚Äôs a great product for the price you are paying for. It‚Äôs worth it.
5,Muy buena durabilidad.
5,Fits the Airtag perfectly and holds it securely.
3,Holds the AirTag just fine.  The included key ring is worthless.
3,The holders will definitely hold the Airtags securely.  However compared to other vendors the silicone is thicker.  This can muffle the Airtag sound.  Product is OK other than that.  Not a deal breaker for my purposes.
4,They can‚Äôt be ripped apart easily but mild sharp objects like pens and stones cut them like butter.(Note: I tested one)
4,The only reason I dropped to 4 rather than 5 stars is that the metal key ring is too thick for one of my keys and almost too thick for my car's Key Fob.  Otherwise this case worked well for holding the Apple Airtag and the price for 4 tags was very reasonable.While the ring will fit on to my FOB the FOB wants to stick out from the FOB at an angle.  I suspect that the ring is not perfectly round so it fits more loosely in one direction.  This could be easily fixed by replacing the ring or using a secondary ring.For the rings that fit the ring is very easy to use once you realize that it has a push/spring latch feature so you do not have to pry the metal open and slide the keys in like on many rings.
5,Great air tag holder and the variety of colors
5,Works exactly as intended to. I got these to 1) protect the airtags and 2) be able to hook it inside stuff vs the loose airtag. I like that it fits snug and hasn‚Äôt fallen out (but I place them inside bags not hanging off). Since my airtags were engraved I actually flipped them around so you see the engraving and it‚Äôs still holds them sturdy. My kids love the different colors as they know which is theirs that goes in their bag. Great buy at a fraction of the price Apple was charging for their cases.
5,Like
5,One problem unable to find directions if  it is too far. Is not like finding people type more complicated with AirTags.
5,It works. I just don‚Äôt lose my keys but if I do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
4,Quick ship and order was as described. Runner like enclosure holds AirTag but does not have cover or other design to hold 100% secure
5,So far they are great. Holding up well to my use
5,These work great.  Very happy with the quality of the silicone thickness and sturdiness of the product.  Would definitely buy again.
5,Great Product! Very durable and sturdy for a great value.
5,Will order again
5,Cumplio con mis espectativas!!
5,These are great holders for Air Tags.  The Air Tag is easy to put into these holders and keeps them secure.  I use them in my luggage and these make it easier to quickly spot them in my bag and are versatile enough to then use them with my keys or backpack once I get to my destination.
5,Smart buyers need to buy this
5,Perfect
5,Great product
5,These AirTags holders are pretty good. The tags feel secure in them and don‚Äôt fall out. My only complaint is the closing clasp. I feel like they could open and fall off in the right scenario ( hasn‚Äôt happened yet). However I like the ease of swapping the tags from keychain to keychain.
4,Product was supposed to come with 1 pink and 1 white  I got 2 white .
5,These are pretty great and especially considering they came as a three pack for less than a single product from Apple or some of the other big brands. They have a strong metal ring that doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs going to break. The spring that keeps the ring closed is also high quality and feels like it keeps it firmly closed. The silicone feels good to the touch and fits the AirTag pretty well. You simply fold the rubber back and slide the air tag into this. I could see the airtag potentially popping out there was a lot of heavy and aggressive movement but it should be good for every day use I think. Clipped one on many baby stroller to keep track of it at Disneyland.
5,I use this on my car keys haven‚Äôt lost one yet after putting this on
5,El material es bien agradable al tacto y duradero tiene muy buena calidad
4,I. Bought a silicone case for air pod pro and attached the air tag with it . It fits perfectly and suit its purpose.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Air tag fits nice and snug. Rubber feels like it‚Äôs good quality and won‚Äôt rip anytime soon. The sound played  to locate the tag is cut in half once inside this pouch.
5,The fit is great material is standing up to daily carry on my key ring and the snap ring appears to be well made however the sound is muffled causing the sound to not be heard until later in the cycle. If I purchase additional holders I will choose a model with vents that will not muffle the sound.The glow in the dark holder is bright when glowing but the glow does not last long.
3,I really love the way that these are designed. The spring loaded clip works great the hold the airbag snugly and they are just the right size to be useful but unobtrusive. Unfortunately I have to question the durability. I added this one to my keychain in mid-December and it has already torn in half in less than 3 months. Real bummer.
5,The quality is a smooth matte silicon that is nice to touch. The AirTag fits perfectly with no risk of slipping out but it is easy to manually take them out if you ever needed to. The carabiner clip is sturdy and has never opened up accidentally even while on my keys or in my pockets.
4,A smaller key ring would be better
5,Funciona al 100 y protege el AirTag  muy bien le recomiendo que coloque la parte blanca arriba me refiero al AirTag para que el cromado no se raye üòÇ
5,These are so easy to use!  It is simple to place the air tag into the holder and then attach the holder to a key chain.  Perfect solution!
5,The product arrived on time and was as advertised. Very well made. Good fir works well. I would buy it again if needed from this vendor.
5,Love it just wish that it came with hard screen protector bc I use 1 for work and the keys scratch it.
5,I am pleased with this product. It does what is is supposed to do.
2,They easily detach. Two came off of bags - I found one but the other was lost.
5,These were easy to put together with my Apple Finder Buttons. The colors make them easy to find while firmly encased. I can not rate the durability because I have not used them long enough to test it.
5,It is expected that it will protect the air tag satisfactorily
5,Good fit seems durable - works as described!
3,The clip does not always stay shut. I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll lose my key right off the clip
5,Airtag fits well.  Stretchy enough to get the tag in there and holds firm.
5,Great quality
5,These holders have proven to be very protective sturdy and practical. It would be nice if one could buy four packs of all one color but this is not a deal breaker.
5,No problems so far since we‚Äôve gotten. Plus east to clean because of the silicone.
5,Good buy !
2,Purchased this for my Apple Air Tag I put on my dog in case he gets lost and the circle opening in the front does not keep it secure and I lost the Air Tag.
5,I've been using these since the Apple AirTags we're released and I haven't had any issues with them. They fit perfectly and they were a great value for what I paid
4,Good product. Met expectations. Only annoying thing when on car keys is it is rather stiff and sits like 90¬∞ to where your other keys on your keychain sit. It has a rather fat ring compared to most keyrings. It‚Äôs tolerable although a bit annoying.
5,I love the colors and the material
5,Super easy to install plus it feels secure inside holder easy to clean as well. If you have AirTags you will NEED this product!
5,Easy to use and clean.
4,Constructed well. Getting it in takes a little bit of work but other than that it is good snug and difficult to remove without trying or bending the case and has a good key chain.  Like the quality.
5,Got them as gifts and one for me.  They work!  Nice product
5,Durable and soft. Not too big and not too small
5,Was impressed with how well the glo in the dark holder glowed.
5,Look and fit good!
5,It worked as described. so far so good!
2,The ring is very easy to be broken used one and kept exchanging the rings from the rest
5,Good
5,These AirTag holders worked great. I like the different colors and that the silicone provides a snug fit.
5,everything was as expected
3,I wasn't sure what would need. I love the airtags but I think I need something more sturdy long term at least for the one in my pocket. My bag one is fine but the the pocket one is beginning to break down.
5,I‚Äôve had this for a few weeks now and it does it‚Äôs job pretty well.
5,This product was very good quality! Worth the price!
5,Holds the air tag tight
5,These holders are really well-made. I have complete confidence that it will hold the tracking device. All the mechanisms work flawlessly. This might be the best value on Amazon
4,the rings to do open up real easy may be a problem
5,Keys are always being misplaced. Bought these to share with the family as we all have iPhones. The find my fob fits perfectly.
5,fit well and look great!!! the glow in the dark one glows very bright!!!
4,So far it is what I expected and delivery was prompt.  Thank you.
5,This has been one of my favorite low budget items. My AirTag is safe and secure. The colors are vibrant and the clamp is strong and sturdy
5,Several months later and they still look good and are durable for very active fog
5,Was what I needed at a great price
5,This is just what I wanted!
5,I can‚Äôt misplace my keys! I tried!!
5,Easy to use.  Fits well.  One thing though - when the silver side of the airtag is out the sound is muffled.  I punched a 1/4" hole in the holder and that fixed the loudness.
5,Got these for a set of the 2021 AirTags. They‚Äôre made of silicone. The Tags are easy to put in and stay snug once in place. The ring is a clip type similar to a carabiner which is nice. The colors are a bit subdued compared to the pictures but still accurate. Very happy with the purchase
5,It‚Äôs been on my dogs collar for three months now and hasn‚Äôt fallen out or budged once
5,I really loved these when they arrived. The colors were perfect and exactly as pictured. I have had these for over a month and they are very durable. They still look brand new. Its true value for your money.
5,I haven't had it long enough to form a valid opinion
5,One in my wallet camera bag binocularsetc.
5,These are great and cover the product nicely while protecting- a good purchase!
5,I love this thing. Sends you a text when you leave it behind
5,Value for the money
5,Dry durable and strong. I don‚Äôt see these ever breaking even if someone tried to snatch it with all their might.
4,tags pop out very easy edit 6/28/2021 got sent a updated revision much better than the first batch.
5,Great way to hold your air tags. Snug fit around the tags and the rings are nice quality
5,These have been great.  Cheap effective holds the airbag in place perfectly.
5,Very happy with these. I believe they are designed to hold the AirTags with the silver side out but what about the customization?? I put the AirTags in with the emoji out and they still feel secure. Does it feel like the best material? No but I think they will hold up. Will update if I‚Äôm wrong.
5,I would recommend.
2,Key chain pops open tear able design
5,They look great feel great and work well. Quite a good value for the money.
5,Great product for the price
2,Fist of all the diameter of the ring is large enough that many keys will not fit on the ring.  Second the latching design of the clasp on the rings is a nice idea but it doesn't work great. One of them was so out of alignment that it hardly stayed closed when I took them out of the package.  I doubt the others locking mechanisms would last.  The durability of the case itself appears to be pretty good. Be sure to put the air tag in with the Apple symbol inside and the plain white showing or you will never be able to hear them ringing. Definitely a case of you get what you pay for.
5,They are well made and work great!
5,It makes it quieter when a sound is played on the air tag but I guess that‚Äôs to be expected. Used one on a dog collar for a week and it held up great
5,What a time saver!!  I am no longer looking for my keys.
5,Items were as described.  Too early to tell on durability.
2,The metal ring that holds the plastic holder to my dogs collar doesn't hold up.So far two of the metal pieces have broken. The plastic pieces are okay but the part that holds the carrier to the thing you want to keep track of should be much better made. I broke two without much effort. A 30 dollar tag needs a better holder. I am going to use a regular key ring to solve the problem.
5,These have held onto our cats through vigorous napping and occasional movement. Glow in the dark is pretty bright for the first 10 minutes.
1,Put it on my dog‚Äôs collar so I was sure not to lose my dog at the beach and while my dog was running around the tag was lost. Unfortunately we weren‚Äôt in cell range to be able to find the air tag so it got left behind‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt buy these holders for your air tags; They are a piece of scrap and the clip is extremely weak.
2,I loved the convenience and price of these. But they don't seem to perform their basic function well: Secure the Air Tag. The AirTag we had mounted in the car slipped out and is somewhere in the car seat. Someday maybe we'll find it with some quarters and popcorn or suck it out with a vacuum. Meanwhile the case is hanging empty in the car.
5,Good product and cost benefit
5,Considering how overpriced apple air tag keychains are these are a steal. I had them for a couple of months now. Works great
3,Doesn‚Äôt always pick up signal in rural areas
2,All the key rings broke within a week of purchase which is extremely dis hurting as they really looked nice and had good quality I had to buy new key rings that were just more basic generic the silicone body that AirTag satin is really good quality and they look pretty nice as well
5,The tags went into the holders easily but not easily enough that they fell out easily. The clip was sturdy.
5,Now have peace of mind that we won‚Äôt lose our dogs wearing these. They are durable and lightweight. Constantly being asked about them from other dig owners. Highly recommend.
5,Quality is most likely better then the apple version. I‚Äôve left the apple version and seems very cheap and far more expensive
3,I wanted to save some money and get AirTag key rings from Amazon versus getting them from Apple.The key ring is the only nice thing about these. The silicone you insert the AirTag into is flimsy and I find that AirTags slip out very easily. I'm going to have to try another style. Don't want to have to worry about losing AirTags!
5,Good deal and good material.
5,Provides excellent protection and utility for my AirTags without compromising their effectiveness. I use them for my keys primarily. The carabiner-style ring is particularly useful for quickly changing attachment to different items. The price makes the case a real bargain.
5,Title says it all. Do not pay the ridiculous prices that are out there. These get the job done.
5,Keep track of personal items.
5,they're great.
5,Works great - holds the tag securely and material/finish seems to be high quality.
5,I loved this product it is amazing it protects my airtag very well and is also very durable.
3,Not really thrilled here the holder is soft rubber and the Airtag fits in there   I think I will just put my set in a drawer For what it is too expensive.  The metal clasp is again spring attached and for some people perhaps but again  ...
5,Price. CHANGE
3,Good case so far no issues
5,Very good product !!
1,Air tag fell out within 30 mins of putting on my dog. I didn‚Äôt realize until a day later but thankfully I was able to find my airtag .
5,These protective silicone air tag key rings work really well and look good.  They are an excellent value. I highly recommend them.
5,Fit perfectly. I have one on my keys and it‚Äôs been durable no complaints
5,Came faster than purchasing from apple & what the expected arrival date showed here! Also cheaper (;
3,It‚Äôs durable but the air tag constantly falls out especially with my dogs
1,The rubber case got loose and my air tag fell out several times but luckily I was able to track it. After second time I quit using this key ring.
1,The key ring it comes with is cheap and has fallen off the key chain multiple times. Also doesn‚Äôt secure the air tag as it‚Äôs propped out multiple times. Defeats the purpose of the air tag
5,Very nice product. I would purchase again.
5,they‚Äôre so cute & it holds the airtag really well . i would buy again
2,The latch on the key ring is flimsy and does not latch tightly. It often comes unlatched when jostling in pocket and keys go everywhere. Replaced with a more traditional keyring. Neoprene covering seems good and is working well so far.
5,Less expensive than the Apple offering and does the same thing.
3,But seem adequate for the task and are priced appropriately.
5,Great buy!
5,Works fine and good quality!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It‚Äôs good replacement for original one. Fits perfectly.
5,Apple Air Tag Cases Sold As described Quick Shipping Good Price.
5,Recommended!!!!!!!!
5,Great product
5,excelente producto
5,Worth the cost
5,Arrived promptly and on time. Quality appears good
5,Perfect tag holder for my need.
1,The rings on 2 of the 3 that I purchased broke within the first week.  Additionally the design is poor and the rings don't stay closed.  The air tags easily pop out of the silicone case. There are many other options out there that have a better design and overall better quality.  Do your homework to avoid frustration.
5,Perfect fit
5,It holds air tag pretty good
5,Perfect
1,My bad for not stopping using this key ring sooner. One of my car key fobs had occasionally fallen off this ring. It was the fob directly on this key ring. Well today it did it again and the fob is gone. $300 to get a new one. The latch gets easily pushed opened if the AirTag holder itself gets nudged towards the ring. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
1,I lost an AirTag at a restaurant due to the airtag popping out of the holder when I was sitting. By the time I read the notification that it was left behind I went back and someone took it and disabled it. $30 down the drain because this thing failed at doing that one thing it is supposed to do hold the airtag.
2,key ring has popped open a few times keys fell on floor. NOT STRONG ENOUGH for 4 keys.
5,Amazing quality
1,Not secure
1,Over time the rubber loses its resiliency and it becomes easy for the AirTag to fall out. In one case I was able to recover the AirTag. I. Another I did not notice the AirTag was missing for a couple days ‚Äî by which time the tag had been found by someone and deactivated.Do not recommend this case.
2,Affordable but not durable
2,The idea is great and I love that they're not as expensive as Apple or Belkin products but they don't work very well. The silicone doesn't go around the Apple Tag far enough which leads to it easily coming out if rubbed/bumped against something else in your pocket.
2,fits airtag well hinge on keyring falls apart
1,Product is flimsy easily torn off.  Looks sturdier than it really is.
2,I used these to hold air tags on my dogs collar. One kept falling out (like 3 times in the first week) we eventually gave up. My other dogs stayed in for almost 10 days but didn‚Äôt hold up either.
2,Flaw with this item is that the tag slips out very easily the rubber is too soft and flexible.
2,Decent product for the price but the chains are pretty flimsy.
2,Cheap metal broke before I even put it on the dog. Yikes!
2,low quality ! Opens all the time
1,one of the tags key chains broke before I even got the chance to put the tag in the case.
1,I wanted it to securely hold my new AirTag. Ironically it spit out my tag and I had to search for the tag. Poor quality control; not well made.
1,Only had this for 1-2 months and they‚Äôre already rusted. One broke and is completely useless now.
1,The ring on one keychain broke at its bizarre connection design
1,This isn‚Äôt worth the money and I would not recommend. The latch opened and came off my keys in my pocket same thing happened to my wife‚Äôs keys in her purse. Returning items now.
1,Item came and it smelt like chemicals extremely pungent smell that hasn‚Äôt reduced after leaving it in the open to air. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend
1,Didn‚Äôt like material
1,This is easy to use but totally not secure. In less than two months I lost two tags as they simply pop Out.
1,Clip does not stay on lost an airtag after a week of having this clipped to keys whole keychain came off.
5,We put out Apple air tags in this product. Fits perfect
1,They are breaking easily at joints. I took 4 & 2 got damaged with in a month
1,First day putting it on and i lost my airtag. Too flimsy to stay on anything.
1,Your air tag will pop right out of these
5,My brother likes mine better and his are leather and cost much more.  Easy on and no stitching to wear.
1,
5,Great for the price.
1,Very cheap and does not hold airtag.. I ended up losing my airtag because of this cheap holder and my airtag ended up getting ran over!! Don‚Äôt buy.
5,Come with 4 different colors and the blue just great for me. It‚Äôs really a good deal for this case with a nice quality.
4,I bought the four pack of black sage green white and luminous. I didn‚Äôt realize the ‚Äúluminous‚Äù was clear and glows in the dark. I bought it for my Dad because he wanted a bright green air tag case for his keys. I‚Äôm a little disappointed but they seem well made at least. EDIT: Customer service heard my complaint and changed the photo on the listing to show that the case is clear but glows in the dark. I appreciate them taking the time to fix that.
2,Works fine.
3,These are made out of rubber. They don‚Äôt hold the airtags well and they keep falling out. In all good price.
5,Works well at a good price. I like the different colors so I can quickly identify which tag goes with each piece of luggage (we place them inside the luggage--we do not use the clip)
5,Sturdy and very nice but used the apple brand so the apple logo and engraving can be seen.
5,These are great - don't put on the outside of your bags - hide air tags inside your bags or luggage ! Use these cases
5,Well made works very well and costs less for a 4 pack than many other charge (overcharge for a single AirTag holder.
5,I had a set of four leather ones. Overtime the leather reps and you can lose it.
5,I love these cases. Great quality and feel!
5,Works perfect for airtags. Fit snug and a fraction of Apple branded.
5,Good price and item as described. Delivery was quick
5,Excellent
5,Cheap and great for the product
5,pretty as expected
5,A lot easier than the 30 dollar plus SINGLE holders from Apple the glowing one works well!
5,Durable and inexpensive. I used one for my dog on his collar and he leaves it alone. Durable and thick around the key ring to hold.
5,One fell apart but the rest seem to be holding up well.
5,Worked perfectly with Apple Airtags fast shipment great price!
5,The case is durable and a perfect fit for my Airtag!
5,These are great values if you have more than one Tag.  Easy to put the Tag in and the circular ring is very solid.  I like the different colors but that's me.
5,Received exactly what the product was described as
5,bought these to hold my 4 airtags so they'd actually be a bit more substantial in my travel bags. These do the trick with the added bonus they can be used as keychains too.
5,Fits my airtag perfectly. Airtag allows me to find my keys. This product allows me to store my airtag. I like the colors and texture of this 4 pack great value.
3,Thick material and seemed durable. However tag is kept in place with a lip around the holder which just didn‚Äôt seem secure.
5,Good designHad another type that failed it was leather with a rivet that came apart.  This design is one solid rubber like material that is solid.
5,You just need a case to be sure your airtag stays put (OK... it's not like you're going to lose an airtag but still) and these are soft effective anve a nice latch on the keyring to relocate when needed and stay in place when you do.
5,Work great
5,My husband and I shared this pack and we like the color combinations! Seems to be a great value for the money!
5,Works like a charm
5,Using for Air tags they feel very sturdy and I like the colors.
4,Does it‚Äôs job and doesn‚Äôt cost a lot.
5,These worked just fine for holding Apple airtags - held up well and cheaper than Apple brand.
5,Nice product. As described.
4,A silicone case for your AirTag‚Äôs. Worth having at this low price even if your not using it as a keychain.
5,Iam giving this gadget 5 stars cause it holds 100% I bought it last year  never had this before but they give me this tracker for Christmas now this holder @ apple cost $$ but hey I saw it here @ Amazon good price good material Good price me personal I definitely recommend this
5,the colors and material is good and it holds my airtag pretty well
5,I got my family a 4-pack of AirTags for Christmas this year one each. I was wanting to get a keychain attachment too but Apple's are almost expensive as the AirTag itself! My girlfriend got these and showed them to me and they seemed like a perfect alternative to the official Apple ones. They still look great and they function exactly how they're supposed to. My family loves them and the color variety they were able to choose from. Definitely recommend!
5,These are silicone airtag keychain holders in four different colors. The colors are bright and the keychain is easy to open with a spring loaded latch. I can't speak to the durability as it is a new product but the product is a bit longer than you might expect.
5,Items came on time especially with the holiday rush.  Worked as expected.
5,Items came on time especially with the holiday rush.  Worked as expected.
5,Great quality
5,These are compatible with the Apple tags and fit nicely. They seem durable and sturdy.
5,Nice holder for my air tags
1,Not only my package was late and it‚Äôs was also damage
5,We used these for a recent vacation. We attached them inside our luggage and travel backpacks. They have a nice easy access ring that stayed secure. They hold the AirTags snuggly.  I will now attach to our car keys.
1,The metal clip keeps opening and falling off my key ring. If you don‚Äôt want your AirTag to fall off your key ring you should find something better.
5,Love the colors and the multiple ways to connect to keychains bags etc. is handy as well. AirTag fits perfectly inside too.
5,Does it‚Äôs work! Bought 4 airtags and needed this. The og one from apple is wayyy to pricey so i bought this. The silicon texture is just like those phone cases - which is kinda nice.
5,I like these tag covers sturdy and attractive colors
5,I like these tag covers sturdy and attractive colors
5,I haven't used this yet so I wasn't able to test it for durability or sturdiness. But it looks to be of good quality and perhaps it will hold up when I start to use them. And they are much less costly than others offered for sale.
5,Great value for the price and works exactly as intended.
4,These are terrific. Simple. No frills. Excellent for holding AirTags. They come with the keychain too. If you are looking for AirTag holders you can‚Äôt go wrong with these.
5,My kids used them for their keys and inside their car while away at college since the lots are so busy it‚Äôs easy to forget where you parked last
5,Worked as advertised. It has bright colors. The snap on ring feels cheap/weak so I upgraded to some stronger rings.
5,Although this is a new purchase so I really can't comment on the long term sturdiness and durability the price was right and they seem really well made.
5,I needed a simple case/holder for my airtags to secure inside my luggage. This was the perfect one for me. Everything you need nothing you don't. I was looking for something that would keep the airtags inside of my luggage without the risk of them falling out either while TSA rummages through the bag or while me and the kids are digging for swimsuits on vacation. These cases and clips were the solution. The airtags slipped right into place in the silicone holder. I didn't have to force or wedge them in but they are also securely in there. No concern with them falling out of the case. They are also very sturdy and the clips are the perfect size for securing onto straps/zippers/loops on the inside of our luggage. These are a great value very durable and very sturdy. It's an added benefit that these also give some great protection to the airtags.
4,There is not much that I can say about a few silicone "holders" for Apple AirTags. They are okay with what they are intended to do at a reasonable price. And I guess the colors are okay as well.
5,These look good have a lever locking ring that makes it easy to add or remove but remains secure. Holds the Air Tag securely has already helped find a misplaced item once. Great set at a great price. Buy a four pack or tags then add these to complete the package.

5,Received the keychain covers quite fast. They are of high quality materials. My Apple Air Tags fit perfect in these Case Keychain. They beat the price Apple is charging for their key chain covers.
5,honestly compares too the apple brand ones and much more cheaper
5,My sister needs a key chain so I got this one for her. It‚Äôs a mixed match she likes it a lot. The style.
5,I‚Äôve had mine for months now. No sign of being worn down and they‚Äôre still perfect. I love them!!
5,These look nice. The key ring is sturdy. Compact & easy to use.
5,
5,Great product
4,Value for money. Costs only a fraction from more well known brands. Does its job perfectly.
4,i bought this because it sits flat when in use
5,I like the colors for ‚Äúat a glance‚Äù identification. Soft and pliable too. The ring itself is very sturdy. A good price and must wait to see about durability
5,Colors are kind of lame but they work great.
5,I purchased these to keep track of some Apple air tags we used on a trip.  They are a soft rubber material so the tags can easily be removed and the ring can be useful to attach to an item.  The order was quick and reasonable cost.  When I setup the tags on my iPhone is was nice to note which color was for what item too.
5,Queda exactamente con los AirTags y el material es muy resistente duradero y facil de limpiar
5,These were exactly what I was looking for!  They fit my Apple Tags very securely...I have one hanging underneath my electric moped one on each of my daughters' backpacks and one attached to the headrest in the back seat of my car. The included key ring worked for all of my applications and I have no worries about the tag getting lost. As soon as I can think of more things to tag I will purchase some more...highly recommended.
5,Love this Air Tag key chain. Great product and Great Price.
5,This set comes with four vivid colored cases for the liking of the whole family. I picked the blue one as it is my favorite color. They are sturdy to protect the air tags while smooth enough to feel good in hands. The size is good as the air tags fit well and is assuring to us as we don't worry too much about dropping the air tags on a hard surface.This set is of good value as each case is only about $4 and we are satisfied with this purchase.
5,Great
5,These  Apple Airtag key chain style holders do a perfect job of attaching an Airtag to a key chain holder.  They are made of silicone and allow the Airtag to be easily inserted.
5,Easy to use and not so bulky that they get in the way.
5,Price quality
5,Product works as intended the key ring that it comes on is risky if you move around a lot. It will open up and whatever key ring is attached might slip off. Try using a traditional key ring and it should work out.
5,Very good product
5,Good size good material
5,This product has no problems whatsoever.
5,I purchased these to go with AirTags I purchased for my team as a Christmas gift.  Very durable great colors at an excellent price.
1,This isn‚Äôt such a good deal. I will be returning as it just doesn‚Äôt work so well. The problem is when you insert the air tag it covers up the speaker on the back. I had to put it in backwards to be able to hear the tone when lost. There are better ones that are open on front and back making it easier to hear when lost.
5,Just had them a few months but so far so goodBought 8 and all of them have held up well so far
5,Have put my house keys on it. Tested it all day and it tells me exactly where I left my keys. What a relief for me and others misplacing or plain out losing keys. Apple Air Tags fit snugly into these holders. Get them and forget about forgetting where you left your keys.
4,My only complaint the air tags can get knocked out/squeezed out easily.
5,These AirTag holders are the best! They feature a high quality clasp and durable silicone. They fit the AirTag perfectly and provide a much better value than the the Apple branded ones as far as in concerned. Don‚Äôt hesitate to order these!
5,They are Easy to use and to put in the AirTag in.  The rubber is not too flimsy it‚Äôs more on the thicker side which is great to protect the AirTag
5,This is a great product. Manufacturer could easily double the price and I would still buy them just don‚Äôt tell them I said that.
5,F√°cil de encontrar en la cartera.
4,It was a gift. I like the multicolors
5,Outstanding! Fit our Apple Air Tags and secured to the inside of our travel bags perfectly!
5,It came faster than I thought it would. I received my air tags on Saturday and I received the holders on Monday. So far to my are pretty good for the price. No issues yet.
5,Seems to be doing the job. Good quality.
5,Performs as expected.  Great housing for baggage sensors etc.
1,Received the product with envelope partly openedOnly received the casesWill return
5,They work just as well as the apple official ones!
5,The same as description
5,Purchase this for my apple AirTags works good! Exactly what I need it for better price.
1,Broke after a week. Lucky you can track the air tag. Do not buy!
5,Sturdy and fit
3,I like them
1,Weak product broke on day 2. AirTag falls off easily. Not designed for daily use and wear.
3,The air tag fits nicely into the flexible plastic however the spring loaded ‚Äúring keeps opening and I had the air take fall off. I replaced the ring with a standard solid split ring and that did the trick.
5,Simple & good
1,Put the first Air Tag in and then the loop snapped as soon as I tried to open it to attach to suitcase zipper. . Returning and will purchase holders from Apple store.
4,Cheaper then the ones from apple but on day 3 my boyfriend lost his already lol. Somehow he lost the tracker for his keys but still had his keys. I guess it slipped out but luckily it was in a friends vehicle.
5,The product is exactly as described.  Air tags fit perfectly.  They arrived on time.
5,Good quality key ring.  Should last a while.
5,These air tag holders work great for what they are. They offer great a lot of protection to the tags without blocking the signal. Keep in mind these are key chains. Although that should be obvious you need to consider how the tag is going to be stored and attached. The keychain makes it difficult to attach to luggage or bags. This should have no bearing on the rating of this product just keep that in mind. When using an AirTag with luggage I simply place it as close to one side of the suitcase as possible. Inside an outer pocket is preferred. These keychains offer decent protection for that usage. Otherwise these are perfect for attaching too‚Ä¶.. that‚Äôs right keychains.
5,üëçüëçüëç
5,Great deal.
5,Worked exactly as stated. Good purchase to keep our Air Tags protected!
4,Good product which is inexpensive but does the job.
5,As described.
5,The colours are as in the pictures
1,If you are in the airport it doesn‚Äôt work
5,Used these for my trip to Italy and I was able to track my luggage along the way.
5,These Apple AirTags are great!They fit my AirTag Perfect!Nice colour combo too.Very easy to attach to anything.Definitely recommend these.
5,Its cheaper and does the job
5,works and looks good
5,Nice colors!
5,Yes the fit is good seems like good material
3,Would have preferred the ring that attaches the surf tag was stronger. Opens too easily
1,Not bad keychain but clasp on.  the key breaks really easy don't waste your money like i did it's good thing they're cheap
