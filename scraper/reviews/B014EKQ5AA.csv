5,I am very happy with the two pack that I purchased. I enjoy the pretty white color and they seem to be put together nicely.The only negative is that the cords are much shorter than the wire out ones I am replacing.
5,My daughter has more cords that I can count and I usually use insignia for this application but the Amazon products are doing very good.
5,Honestly did not expect 6 feet to be this short. Maybe measure before buying so you know the exact length you need.
5,Works great as advertised
5,Super Affordable. Great Quality. Sturdy and well made.
5,Perfect for the price!
5,This is a great power strip combo for college dorm rooms.
5,good value
4,Love that it came with two. Cord length was enough for what I was looking to do.
5,Great value great price.. better than what walmart has to offer
5,Works as you would expect. It does feel cheap regarding the plastic materials used. And it's super lightweight which makes me concerned about durability. But it was inexpensive and served its purpose.
5,It just was a bit shorter than I wanted but it worked out ok.
4,It’s works as designed but I wish the cord length was a little longer. As long as you aren’t trying to plug something in far away this will work well.
5,Does what it you would except need one say anything more?
5,Adds additional plug capacity without the cord being too long and cumbersome.
5,These strips were well made heavy duty good strips
5,Exactly as described. Arrived quickly.
5,Use in my garage for battery chargers. Work great. Gave more flexibility for the one outlet I have.
4,Great product great price
5,Love the fact it has an ON indicator light.  Just the on/off switch doesn't help during a failure when you're trying to figure out the source of the failure.  Seems inexpensive but working.  Like to have the option of a 2-set.  Love the cord-length option and I had ordered shorter than comfortable but it's still doable.  It was my issue underestimating.
4,The product is very good but the cord could be longer
5,We like the short cord. One was used on a TV the other on a refrigerator.
5,Good
5,It's great!  Does what it's supposed to do.
5,Amazon was the only place I could find a basic two pack for under $10!! I really like them! They are exactly what I was looking for!! Amazon Basics For The WIN
5,I wanted a cheap piwer syrup cane in a 2 pack….perfect for my need. Wifi? No idea why they ask as it’s a basic power strip….
5,What was needed for my system.
5,Get 2 for price of 1
5,We needed a short cord on the surge protector to use behind our TV stand since we had a new TV mounted on the wall.  This did the job.
5,Can't go wrong for 5$ a piece. Great for what I needed.
5,Works great
5,Great product and nice to have brand new fresh ones periodically I highly recommend
5,Nice extension cords for when you have several things close together to plug in.I have a clock lamp noise machine plugged into one of the cords into the wall socket and then a fan plugged into the other wall socket with out having a long cord to hide away. Keeps it neat
4,The outlets work great just be sure you read that the cords are short.
5,They seem fine.  Working so far.
4,Not bad for a cheap splitter
5,Arrived Fast. Great Product. Love it.
5,great
3,they were a nice size but when i opened it it had looked like the power cords had been used. some searches and dirt were already on them. not that big of a deal since they are hidden anyways
4,Auxiliary power outlet that could be turned on/off at my disgression
5,Pretty good for the price considering it's not just a power strip; it's also a surge protector.  A lot of strips at this price point are often just used to distribute power to multiple sockets without actually offering any protection.However with that said keep in mind it only offers about 200 joules of protection.  While it's better than nothing this is a very negligible amount (many 'real' surge protectors START out at almost 1000 joules).  So don't use this to protect your expensive stuff such as your gaming computer or home theatre/TV.  This is more for like extending the distance from a wall outlet from which you can put your table lamp (that sentence was awkward to phrase) or for turning an unprotected wall outlet into a somewhat protected outlet for say your USB charging hub for your phone/mouse/etc.I personally use one of them for my microwave (it's very very old so I don't really care if it gets destroyed - I kind of want it to so that I have an excuse for replacing the almost 20 year old piece of technology); the other I keep with my Wii U for when I bring it to school and connect all my accessories - the wii u the gamepad charger a miniature monitor (runs on USB power) speakers and at times even my projector (instead of the mini-monitor).  I probably should upgrade to a better surge protector for my projector but realistically if there's a thunderstorm I don't go outside (and I generally only use the projector outdoors when I have this surge protector with it) so I guess the likelihood of getting into a situation where my projector gets hit by a huge spike is very very very low.So basically - if you are looking for a cheap way to slightly extend the distance that you can plug something in or because you need to turn a single/double outlet into multiple outlets for relatively cheap devices that you don't losing if your home gets hit by a lightning spike this is the way to go.  It'll improve the odds of your devices surviving a power spike but don't expect TOO much from them (but again some potential protection [no pun intended] is still better than no protection).
4,does the job nothing too special about it
5,Great product.  Works great
4,The protection is apparently created by having enough permanent wiring (30 feet or more) between the main panel and this power strip -- flaky.  The LED is bright enough to roast marshmallows but can be dimmed by two layers of white vinyl tape over the recessed hole where it shines.  It is also possible to disable the light on the switch by opening the strip to de-solder the switch terminal connected to the white wire. but of course that voids any warranty
4,The red power light is SO BRIGHT... there's no way you're going to hide the fact that you're using a power strip with this one
5,Hi there. I recently purchased these for my bedroom. I will sort this review into separate segments to make it easier to read.-PackagingOverall the packaging was great. Every Amazon basics product I purchase is always easy to open. It came in a low profile recyclable jewelry type box. The sticker on the product package showed me what the product was with a brief description. To open it all I had to do was pull the tab across and lift. The power strips were packaged very neatly. I have to say I was very impressed with this packaging.-ShippingThe package was delivered to me in two days with Amazon Prime via UPS 2nd Day Air. It showed up right on my doorstep on time. The package was handled very well and had barely no impacts on it. Great job UPS!-ProductThese power strips are absolutely great. They come with a fairly long AC120V cable and plug. The plug is angled ideal for use horizontally. It has a nice matte finish and low profile design. The outlets are very smooth and easy to plug in although slightly difficult to remove (good if you want a solid connection). I have had no problems so far. I have had a couple power surges that these power strips have protected. An alarm clock that I use now has a damaged LCD because of a surge without a surge protector.-My Personal UsesI personally use this for the two nightstands on the sides of my bed. I used to use outlet extensions because I had 5 or 6 utilities on each nightstand. Now without all the fire hazardous outlet extensions I have protected my electric utilities and my family.-ConclusionIn conclusion these Amazon Basics surge protectors are a great solution for your home. It comes in gorgeous packaging has a low profile design and is very effective. I will and have recommended these surge protectors to homeowners that want to protect their utilities and safety and get the best bang for the buck!
5,We love stocking up on power strips as you can never have enough. Especially with the number of projects we have running around the building here. One of our golden rules though is "skip the strip" and buy a real surge protector no matter how small the job. They are just too affordable to put the risk elsewhere (on other devices that are typically more expensive). One less reason to buy that replacement plan on the many electronic devices you might buy into.Compared to the price of a plain (non-surge protected) power strip this isn't that much more and works great for simple solutions you have running about. I wouldn't plug a powerful computer or entertainment system into it (for that I'd go with something better/bigger and more joules of protection). However for all the basic stuff it's perfect to have these running around.Just pay attention to the cord length. These are only 2ft in length (which was exactly what we needed when we bought more of these). They are available in longer lengths if you need them.**If you have found our review helpful please vote it as helpful below so we know. This helps us to provide quality feedback in the future.
3,I do like that the night light feature can be turned on or off. But the light is very dim compared to another similar product that I purchased recently. While a nightlight doesn't need to illuminate the entire room it should still be brighter than what light this provides. I would not purchase another. But if you're looking for a dimmer night light this would be good.
5,perfect size for my use.
3,This is your basic surge protector. It is small light and solid. Some come with power switches others do not (this model does). The switch allows you to kill ALL power without having to unplug the cord. I have dozens of these from various manufacturers and have bought these for years. The key here is the word "Basics" in "Amazon Basics." There is a red light that comes on when you turn it on. This light says "I am protecting your devices—but just once." If you have a power surge the strip will protect your appliances BUT the light will go off and power will remain to your devices. THIS CAN BE BAD. If you have *another* power surge before you reset this switch your stuff will get fried. So we have the convenience of "always on" electricity meaning that in the case of a power surge that gets past your circuit breaker somehow you will be protected (once). You won't lose power to your PC or whatever 'always on" device you need "always on" but you had better hit the reset button to get that red light on immediately. Otherwise you are now unprotected.If this is unacceptable to you (surge protection for your devices is more important than them always being on) you should buy something else. For the price these are adequate. They work and they are cheap. They will serve you well. They are better than a power strip (which has no surge protection) but not as good as a real amperage/voltage spike protector which will cost a bit more money. It is important to know what you are getting when you buy devices like this. Anyway I hope this helps. I got this from Vine to test and while it is a solid piece of equipment it is not "all that and a biscuit."
4,good to use cheap-made
5,I am increasingly concerned about the quality of the electrical service where I live.  I have had several items damaged by surges on the line so I have also increasingly needed to use surge protectors for many sensitive items.  These surge protectors a relatively small and fit into places where the big fat ones for computers can't be placed.  There is a nice switch on the top so I can turn off the whole strip at once.  Great for light duty.
4,Used for computer wifi TV stereo etc...
4,Looks good and good quality. Comes with 2 surge protectors at a good price. I have had them for over a month and not a problem.
5,Great for the spots where I need lots of cords and don’t work about damage of power goes out
5,I got these to reach an outlet behind a bed and it's been working well. I got it to replace a faulty one so I was scared but this ones normal. I got the black ones with red lights.
5,Definitely is a power strip. Does all the typical power strip stuff. Didn't explode.
3,What's amazing is that you can order an AmazonBasics 6-Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip 2-Pack 2-Foot Long Cord 200 Joule and have it arrive at your door ON THE SAME DAY!  So what is it that you get for the money aside from avoiding the hassle of leaving the house going to a store and standing in the checkout line?With a product like this it's not uncommon for physical heft to correlate to item quality - this surge strip is VERY light.  You get a very short cord no angled plug closely spaced outlets and a really low surge capacity.  I bought a couple of these strips to use in guest bedrooms to enable guests to plug in all of their various chargers.  I didn't need a longer cable but an angled plug would have been nice.  Even though there are 6 outlets you can reasonably expect that some of them will not be accessible if you use anything larger than just a regular sized plug.  As far as the surge protection goes I would say that the advertised capability is not really that valuable.  The 200 joule capacity is most likely provided by a single inexpensive MOV... it's better to think of this as just a regular power strip.  If you're going to plug in anything of real value I'd recommend going to something that handles 600+ joules.As it is I have no idea how they can make these halfway around the world package and ship them here and deliver them to you at this price.  As amazing as that is these are as no-frills as you can get.  That said there's nothing wrong with these power strips as long as you know what you're getting.  I bought 4 of these and didn't have any DOA units.
4,There are never enough electrical outlets in a house. We are constantly fighting to plug stuff in.  It seems like everything you buy now has at least a cord or two that needs to be plugged in.  We needed a cheap quick solution and found this power surge protector strip on sale.  This is not the best strips I have purchased but for our needs it works great. The cords are long enough to help keep the actual outlet hidden which is great as I hate seeing them out in the open just begging for more stuff to be plugged into them.The plastic is cheap feeling but other than that for $10 bucks you can’t beat turning one outlet into six (unless it is a stupid power block). Remember that this is a basic power strip so do not expect fancy gizmos on it it just multiples your availability of outlets.  If you want something more heavy-duty than you will need to increase your price range.
2,Bought these for my daughter to bring to her dorm room.  Received them quickly packed them with her things and brought them with us.  While moving in and unpacking the first one we went to use didn't work.  Tried the second one and it did work.  Being that she needed one we left it with her and now Im returning the broken one and wondering if I will receive any refund.  Hopefully the one we left continues to work.
2,Standard drywall screw heads nor any of the other screw heads in my stash fit in the mounting holes. You'll have to rummage through your bin to find some ten pennies to mount these.Also its amazon basics... They are trash.It still delivers power so it gets 2 stars. Design oversights wont let me give it any more. Buy a different one.
4,The bad  - amazon  delivered this to my neighbor.The good - the picture of it sitting on the welcome mat allowed me to figure out where it was delivered and I tracked it down an hour later.Product -  It is a 6 outlet surge protector with a lighted switch so you can see when it is powered up.I need this as I'm setting a home office due to extended work from home as a result of the pandemic.I find the power cord to be short - maybe 2 feet.  I would not consider this convenient for traveling... too bulky and the cord is too short.  Perfect for home use.  I have two external monitors my laptop and a docking station powered and have one extra slot open.  I lost one slot because of the shape of power brick for the docking station.
5,I bought these for my office and my house I figured these are just the same price as other knock-off brands. They are pretty well built. One CAUTION would be if you plug the router in while unplugging other electronics you wifi would be disconnected for good 5 minutes.
5,Everything I ask for a new and no complaints here
5,Great product service and delivery. 5 out of 5 stars!
2,Don't buy this if you intend to mount it (e.g. under a desk) it will only frustrate you. The pictures tell the story the GE picture shows how a properly designed surge protector can be mounted. This Amazon Basics one is not designed correctly for this use case.
4,I was looking for a surge protector and at the time I only needed one when I saw this 2 pack at a good price. The cord is a little shorter than I normally look for but suited my specific needs at the time. I ended up using one where I needed it and putting the other with my travel case. I'm always looking for extra outlets when I travel so this strip will come in handy for that. To sum it up the strips work exactly as I'd expect so they get the job done and with two in the package it's a great value.
2,Works fine but what's up with the red ON light being so bright? Don't think I'd have chosen these particular power strips of I'd have known how bright the light is. My other power strips aren't as obnoxiously bright
5,wonderful
5,What can you ask out of these things? They work and they're fairly priced. You never know if the surge protection works until it's too late but they're doing what they're meant too. Something I did like is that the space between the plugs are spaced out a bit more than I've seen on others had no issues plugging a power cord into each one.EDIT: Ok these were DEFINITELY worth the money. My ISP came to my house to fix my cable he unattached their wire which was acting as the ground wire for my house (mine had broken and the cable guy said if that happens their wires can do that. I don't fully understand it but that's what he said). As soon as he undid their wiring everything in my house went haywire. Lightbulbs were popping some of my old crt televisions started smoking as the glass tubes inside of them started heating and popping etc.. The ONLY ELECTRONICS in my entire house that kept working were the ones attached to these power strips. Luckily my newer televisions computer etc is what i used for these so only some old junk I had was destroyed but my god I'm thankful I bought these. 15 dollar surge protectors saved a 2000 dollar computer 500 dollar television etc...
5,Surge protector works well with entertainment electronics. Came on time and was very reasonably priced.
3,Amazon Basics 6-Outlet 200 Joule Surge Protector Power Strip 2 Foot Black - Pack of 2ok
5,Great 2 pk power strips at a fair price !!
1,We took a lightning strike on our property and had two cameras plugged into one of these. The surge went straight through the surge protector blew the power adapters out melted the cables and almost started a fire.I understand these are only rated to take a certain amount of electricity but the crazy part is that although our equipment is dead and the cables and adapters are burned— this strip still works! It even has the “protected” light shining still. Obviously not true. So it’s almost like the surge just bypassed the surge mechanism altogether.At best I expected this product to protect my equipment from getting fried. At worst I expected it to sacrifice itself and take the hit instead of the attached devices. I would have just had to buy another cheap surge strip. Instead I just had to buy hundreds of dollars of replacement equipment.So I say if you’re buying this I would purpose it for just a power strip and not really rely on it to protect anything.
2,The ones I received had a very short gord and black makes on them I wanted to buy two before purchasing the amount I needed will not be buying more
3,One of them died after two years.
5,I decided to invest in these several months ago.  They had mostly positive ratings and were incredibly affordable.  Fast forward to last week and we had a terrible lightning storm where we actually believe it to have struck very close to the house.  My parents ended up losing several appliances including TV's and possibly their kitchen stove.  Everything on my side of the house was fried or halfway fried  EXCEPT what I had these two protectors plugged into; my desktop and my samsung smart TV.  Both are completely safe.  The red light on the surge protector to my TV went completely out and the one connected to my desktop got dim and was flashing but both appliances were totally fine.  All of this goes to say that these power strips DO work as long as you keep an eye on the red lights attached atop each protector indicating their lifespan.  I just replaced these myself and I would highly recommend these to anyone else.  Hopefully you won't ever truly NEED them but when you do.  You will know that it is a good value for peace of mind.
5,This was exactly what they said it was and did what they said it would...very happy
4,My two wishes with these power strips is that the outlets should be a bit more spread out to accommodate bigger plug heads (as some will inadvertently hog two spots due to their size) and the plug head of the power strip itself should be flat so that it could fit behind pieces of furniture up against a wall without having to move the furniture forward and lose space. Other than that they work as advertised and have a decent cord length to give you some flexibility. While you can't beat the price I would recommend spending a few more bucks on a power strip that has rotating plugs so you can truly take advantage of all six outlets or perhaps even a smart power strip if you like the automation. But if you're going for the basics this does the job.
5,Just what I needed.
5,I used it for plugging power adapters into
2,The holes on back will not hold #6 sheet metal screws  I need to mount  no screw so far will slide over unbelievable
5,Not a whole lot to say about this item.  It is a power strip with a 2 Foot cord.  Solid construction the On/Off switch feels very sturdy and both surge protectors work great out of the box.  Couldn't ask for anything better especially for the price.If you aren't taking advantage on the price/quality of AmazonBasics products you are really missing out.  I have never purchased one of their items that I am not thoroughly impressed with.  And lots of times they are better made than similar items that cost a lot more.  If you haven already tried an AmazonBasics product order one and you won't regret it.  I used to purchase them because they are cheaper than most similar products made by other companies.  After a few purchases I realized they are the same or higher quality than similar products that usually cost a lot more.Note - I am in no way sponsored by Amazon receive free/discounted items from them or have any ties to the company.  I am just a fan of the AmazonBasics brand and you will be too.
5,Oh I thought I would never write about a surge protector but here I am. You know when you don’t know you needed someone in your life until you met them? That’s me with these amazon basics surge protectors. I long battled with the struggle of having to decide between charging my phone or plugging in the tv not to mention the countless other plugs from my soundbar internet box xbox dvd player etc. It was a game of priorities. But now I can plug them all in. I can enjoy the symphony of power. I can charge my phone binge the office on netflix with the soundbar on full volume and smell my pumpkin spice wax melt all at the same time. Pure bliss. Thank you amazon for reinvigorating my life through dispersed electricity.
5,Just what I needed.
4,This two-pack of AmazonBasic surge protectors offers great value.  Each has six three-pronged outlets and an on/off switch that glows red when on.  The outlets themselves are too close together for non-traditional power cords such as the power packs that come with some electronics so you may not be able to use all six at once depending on what you plug into them.  This however is a common issue across brands.  The main reason that I deducted a star is the stiffness of the short power cord.  I found it difficult to get mine to lie flat on the floor and had to jockey it to get there.  This process was especially frustrating since I wanted it behind a cabinet out of sight.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
3,This is an adequate power strip for connecting appliances. The strip body is made of plastic whose build quality is not great but it does what it advertises for this price. The body is made of plastic and feels just strong enough. There is a power switch which also lights up when the power strip is turned on. At this price this pair of power surge protectors seems to be a good buy. The power cord is 14 AWG (American wire gauge specifying how much the wire can carry current) and is stiff which is probably good since it won;t bend and crack easily.Right next to the power button there is an LED that lights up when strip is turned on. The LED specifies whether the power surge protection of the strip is functioning or not. If the strip experiences any voltage spikes then the surge protection feature will kick in making this strip inoperable and the LED will stop lighting up.Dimensions:Power cord length: 2 footSpace between each outlet: 8mmMaximum Current: 15 ampMaximum Power: 1875WTHINGS TO BE AWARE OF BEFORE BUYING THIS STRIP1. The power cord is little on the shorter side. At 2 foot long it would be good for installations where this power strip is not far away from the power socket.2. I found the each outlet to too close to each other. The individual sockets are 8mm apart and a slightly bigger big plug can easily cover up the next socket on the strip.
5,Worked as attended
3,It is good for short cable management but not for extension cords for long reach.
4,Good quality reasonable price - not much to say about a power strip.  As MANY people have noted the mounting holes are somewhat oddly cut.  Some people have modified the holes I think that's overkill.  Just use a flat-head screw instead of the countersink or V-shaped screw heads.  As another tip put a piece of painters tape (or masking tape) on the back side of the power strip.  You will be able to see the mounting holes through the tape.  Poke a small hole through the tape at the very top of the mounting hole (to ensure both holes are at the same level in the mounting hole).  Then just peel the tape and apply it to where you are mounting the power strip and drill through the holes in the tape - perfectly aligned mounting holes.
5,works great 1 plug into the wall and 3 plugs
5,Easy to use simple surge protector for unbeatable price.
4,They don't grip things plugged into them quite as much as I'd like and the cord is a bit short. The light is also somewhat bright if that matters to you. You could always color it in with a marker if that was an issue but anyway...Despite some relatively minor flaws they're pretty good surge protectors. If you don't mind the short-ish cord and it won't get jostled too much I'd say go for it. Decent enough cheap product. Above average. Good value.
5,Works fine
3,These things are cheap but that's probably why you're considering them. The cord length is short but it's fine an okay-ish power strip. If you're connecting a few things that require a lot of electricity look elsewhere.
5,It is as expected
4,They work they power things. THey are built fairly cheaply you can tell so you're getting what you pay for. If you're just powering a few things these will work perfect!They have a really annoying bright red light to tell that they are powered. When dark you can see the Led light up the wall a bit. I had to put electric tape on mine to block it out.
4,If you need inexpensive but functional power strips these are what you want!  I’ve used them in several places including behind TV’s and night stands and they do the job.  They seem built well and don’t spark or buzz or do anything that would lead me to believe they are unsafe.  The cord is not very long which is actually a good thing for where I’m using them.  Make sure you check how long you need and read the specs!!  In summary... simple power strips that do what they’re supposed to do.
4,The outlet design for the Amazon 6 outlet surge protector is a little too crowded for large plugs that will cover up neighboring outlets but the price was a great value.They're cheap enough that I ordered a couple packs so it doesn't matter if one wall wart power supply covers up an additional outlet.They have sockets for screws on the underside  so they're easy to mount on a wall or desk no more running messy tangled wires down to the floor outlet or needing extension cords.I also save power by flipping the off switch when I'm away for awhile. Lots of appliances are power vampires that suck electricity even when they're not turned on. The Amazon surge protector prevents that expensive polluting wasteful use of electricity.Plus theyre made to Amazon's quality control. My house family and small appliances are worth more than saving a few cents on some off brand power strip from the dollar store.
4,Wellall in all i am satisfied this item . If you are planning on protect devices that use a lot of power like a desktop or a gaming laptop or maybe even a console I recommend the 790 version plus they last longer. Both versions come with a $10000 warranty. The build quality is good just like on the photos. But the 200 joule version would be better fit for something like lamps or phones or even a tv set basically things with low power consumption. These surge protectors work but are feel super cheap. Cheaper than those cheap ones you get from ikea.
4,Good product for the price. I am happy with it for what i needed it to do. Just note the two screw holes on the back for wall mounting are a bit tricky you need to use the right size screws for it to mount correctly. I had to look though my screw jar to find ones that would set right in the holes. But still a good product.
4,They are probably 15 or more power strips in my home and most of them do not have surge protectors. When I saw this at this price I purchased for total and it is a great product for the price with the safety feature of the surge protector. I only wish the cord was another foot or too long.In order to solve this problem I'm using the 1 foot extension cords so that Amazon. The 1 foot extension cords have came in handy in so many ways also a requirement for me with the short cord on these surge protector power strips.All in all a great deal at a good price!But:Now that I know what Joule represents calling these a "Surge Protector" is a STRETCH!This don't have enough Joules to be any good for an actual lightening hit....200 VS 1400 recommend!
3,One item arrived with a broken on/off switch. Probably why it was returned. I can use it as is because it’s broken in the ON position
5,Look no further! This is the perfect power cord/surge protector that you need. It's got the perfect length for a typical home and has good enough spacing where you can fit most outlet plugs.Obviously you may have some issues if all your plugs have a huge block but there's enough spacing where it doesn't cause too many problems.I had an old power cord where I blew out the fuse from plugging too many things in and then plugging my heater in...terrible mistake so this was the perfect thing I was looking for and you can't beat the price!No ragrets.
5,I needed something to allow me to plug in a few additional electronics in my bedroom and the old surge protector I had went kaput. They are usually pretty expensive but these are more than fairly priced and it seems like you get two for the price of what one used to cost.This fits nicely has good spacing for my PS4 Xbox satellite box and TV and it is saving a lot of irritation and enables better cable management.Something I’ve learned; no surge protector is going to save a strong indirect or direct lightning strike but it can mitigate the number of items damaged. These are great and the price is the icing on top.
5,Look and act exactly as you would expect. For the price compared to competitors this was easily the best deal I found in a pinch. It's a "basics" item and it's pretty darn basic so I'm not sure what else I can say about it. The red light is fairly bright when on so if you want it hidden or less noticeable this may not work. In most cases I can't imagine how this could be worth paying for something more expensive though.Though I ordered the black they sent me the white. I'm just not in the mood to deal with a return and they're fine for what I'm using them for but that's the only complaint I could find if you count it as one at all. Considering they're going to hide behind an entertainment center I'm happy.
5,I use this power strip in my dorm room and on the one cord I have almost every plug used but it still works great and I have never had any issues with it. I've had these for almost a year now. They are short but that isn't an issue for me. They are very durable and the cord is strong and I doubt will ever break. I love the surge protector on it. I highly recommend buying this!! It is an excellent value for the price!
4,I've had nothing but good experiences with AmazonBasics products and this one is no exception. Very well made and a great value. My only criticism are the mounting holes on the back. I wish they had designed it to mount with the cord coming from the bottom instead of the top. It would be a much neater installation with the cord going straight to the floor rather than looping upward and then down.
5,Even though we have a large amount of outlets in each of our rooms in this growing electronic era we didn't have enough at central spots. In addition we needed to replace some existing power strips that I have had around for years. The existing ones weren't only showing their age but they also that just weren't built well (even though I paid more for them than I'd care to admit).I ordered four of these Amazon Basic Surge Protector Power Strips; (1) TV Cable Stereo and Internet Area (2) 30+ Gallon Fish Tank (3) 20+ Gallon Fish Tank (4) for our Computer. In a quick comparison it was obvious these strips were built better than the ones I was replacing (and cost a whole bunch less). The cord plugs fit in tighter without wiggling and the black cord makes it easier to hide behind black furniture.
4,Having worked in the tech field for a number of years I've seen/used my share of different power strips.  These were neither the best nor the worst I've ever seen.  The quality is reasonable but there's a somewhat "cheap" feel to the molded plastic and fit/finish. For the price though they seem reasonable and I don't expect that they'll give me any problems or be a safety hazard of any kind. I've just seen other AmazonBasics products that seemed of a slightly higher quality.  I'm still happy with my purchase and would likely buy again.
5,Seems like a great surge protector so far. I mounted mine to the side of my work bench in the garage. The product overall feels like decent quality and the switch feels nice and solid.I noticed a few other reviews where people had difficulty mounting the power strip with screws. These do indeed have a strange mounting hole but modification to the power strip is not necessary. I found that using screws with a flat head made much better contact (see pictures) compared to a screw with a conical shaped head. Mine is mounted with the screw pictured from my local hardware store (#10 x5/8in "PAN HEAD" self drilling screw) and it is rock solid. I can yank plugs out of the power strip and it has not budged yet. However it is still easy to remove with a firm nudge in the correct direction.
4,I saw the reviews about the packages and crumbled chunks but ordered anyway.  My package arrived crumbled somewhat powderized and in a plain baggie (with inner plastic bag also for each one pound).  However after I opened it up and prepped for making white chocolate I realized that the crumbliness didn't really matter.  I made some white chocolate out of it and it is nice crisp fresh pure cocoa butter.  Makes very good chocolate.  Don't let the package fool you.  This is good stuff.  Yes I'm a real person - yes it is delicious.  I ordered another one as soon as I had tasted the first.
5,Good surge protectors for price. Safe and work good uptil now for me. Would like if they had a longer cord though!Update :- 3rd Purchase of same item this year all of them have worked flawless. You really love to see it. Great work with these affordable surge protectors amazon!Update 2 :- during the recent snowstorm in upstate ny the electric fuse blew off but anything that was plugged into my surge protector is still good which was everything. Product works.
5,I’ve got more than ten of these that have been going for up to 5 years now and I’ve never had to replace any of them. I have a lot of audio equipment (mixers channel strips effects etc) and never see any noise issues coming out of these. They also stand up well to being knocked around and such.I wish these came in a style with a right angle plug but those adapters are easy enough to use with these.
2,I wish I had just gone to walmart and gotten the $8 ones they have there because those were actually stable. I got these because I wanted to have my pc and monitors connected to the surge protector to avoid damaging the motherboard and USB ports. My PC runs almost constantly even through the night as I usually have something playing in the backgroud. One night I woke up in the middle of the night to find my PC was off and so was the TV. When I pressed the power button and nothing happened I thought that it had damaged my power supply but after unplugging it and connecting it to the wall the PC came on. So one of them doesn't generate enough current to power a PC and TV so the only thing connected to that surge protector is the TV.As for the second one I noticed that whenever I turned off a space heater (that was set on low) it would cause my PC and everything else connected to it to turn off and I'd have to reset it. So I had to disconnect the space heater and connect it directly to the wall to stop this from happening every time I turn the heater on and off. I expected them to be better quality since they come with the Amazon Basics tag on them but fraNkly I'm disappointed and I definitely DO NOT RECOMMENDWith something like this don't go cheap. Especially if the electronics you're trying to protect are expensive
5,Works great
4,I looked into buying a new power strip with anti-surge a couple of years ago and looked at all of the office supply stores big box stores and hardware stores. Every place I looked wanted at least twice as much for one power strip than I paid for the two I bought on Amazon. Not sure why I didn't look here first. I only gave 4 stars as I reserve 5 stars for really great items and deals. I would definitely recommend this item.
5,Fire Department Says Replace these every 5 years so after you put in service add five years remove from service also the Caution on this product is  Do not exceed ratings of 125 Volt AC 15 Amps 1875 Watts- Do not install this device if there is not at least 10 meters (30 feet) or more of wire between theelectrical outlet and the electrical service panel.- This device features an internal protection that will disconnect the surge protective component butwill maintain power to the load - now unprotected. If this situation is undesirable for the applicationfollow the manufacturer's instructions for replacing the device.If there are any problems in getting the surge protector to work properly stop and read thetroubleshooting section of these instructions.
5,And for $5 bucks a piece i Buy More.  Computers charging devices TV and Sterio Equipment  i had extension cords on top of extension cords and it looked like spaghetti.  P.S. I checked the Joule Rating for Surge Protection and this one is just fine.  You don't have to pay $20 for better "Protection" because none of them work against Lightning Strikes anyway.  P.S. P.S. get a a UPS Power Supply for your Computers.... they eliminate problems with Brown Outs and Black Outs
4,It's a good product at a good price.  The outlets are in line with the strip though so if you need to plug in something large it covers other outlets.  Most power strips have the outlets turned to the side.
4,I travel with this all the time and carry it in my computer bag. It’s great when you find an outlet at the airport gate and somebody else may have already heard the outlet this way you can just have them plug into your charger and everybody can be charging up a storm while traveling. It’s small enough to work great and seems to be relatively durable. I’m glad I brought this
5,I purchased this so it could reach around my room to connect my printer. The length is perfect so my printer works great without having the cord cut across the room (I only have one outlet in the room and my printer can only fit in one spot... the opposite side of the room from where the outlet is). So this long cord works perfect!
5,I use these Amazon 6-Outlet Surge Protectors at home and when I travel. I have a handful of them at home in my bedroom kitchen family room. When I travel overseas I use take on along with my international adapter. The adapter supports the different shape plug and this 6-Outlet surge protector provides a) surge protection and b) 6-outlets to plug my electronic devices. Keep in mind that these do not convert 220V to 120V. Your laptop charger or phone charge will do the converting. I would highly recommend this outlet for travel as it makes any hotel room a charging station for the entire family. Actually my teenage kids now have their own when we travel together.
4,I bought this to replace my 2 multi-outlet cords the power my computer. the cord length is by far my biggest complaints and it's my fault that I did not look into how long it was going to be. I managed to figure out a little bit of a support system for them but I have never had to do this with any item like this in the past. I'm not going to return them but I wish the cord was longer.
5,I was recently told that surge protectors do go bad after 4-8 years by a friend. Google said it was less than that but considering the one I was using was about 15 years old?? Definitely time for a replacement. I had sticker shock at the price of the cheapest model from a well-known store at $9 ea. That was a no frills 6 outlet unit. Now one with USB ports was more but I have wall units so that would be useless for my situation.  Anyway.. jumped on Amazon found these 2 packs for about $2 more than a single. Was a no brainer for me. So far it is in excellent working order no issues.
5,I bought these for my vanity and TV set up. I was worried seeing all the negative reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. These came in great condition and work perfectly fine. I've been using them now for a few weeks and haven't had any issues. The only thing I don't love is how short the cord is but you can always get an extension if needed. Great price great product.
4,They could be perfect except for the short cord. Make sure you check the cord length before purchasing so you won't be disappointed. I do love the customer service. They didn't hesitate to resolve my issue. No question asked. I will definitely buy from them again but this time Ill get one with a longer cord.
5,Arrived quickly as expected with Amazon Prime.  Packaging was basic but did the job to keep the contents safe during transport.  Purchased these to install in my garage as part of a garage “remodel” upgrading my man-cave.  I built a bar out of a pre-fab countertop and needed power strips for above and below.  Mounted one on a flat surface above the bar and the other on the wall below the bar.  These were perfect and the black color was a great fit for my black and red color scheme.  These are exactly what you would expect from Amazon Basics - great quality at a great price.  I have purchased several of the Amazon Basics products and they never disappoint.  These were just what I needed as part of my garage remodel project.
5,If you're at the store (Target Walmart Best Buy) trying to price match/compare a 6-outlet strip on Amazon then look no further. This is the cheapest thing you can find on Amazon that is comparable to the ones at the store. It is about a few dollars cheaper than the cheapest outlet you can buy at Walmart. It's not the most sturdy outlet or with numerous features but it does the job. Definitely a "basic" household item that is totally worth the price.Definitely recommend!Like our review?

4,The plugs are the cheapest ones out there. I recently moved to a place and wanted an extension cord. This work just fine. I just wish the Length of the cord would’ve been any longer. Overall I don’t have any problems with this. Amazon basics are just about right to get things started.
4,These are pretty good power strips.  The only knock is the direction in which they can be mounted.  They have to be mounted either with the cord on the side or on the top.  This can put strain on the cord.  Other than that these are perfect.
5,These are Basic models but they work perfectly.My only criticism is the power cords are only 3 feet long. I knew this beforehand and bought 6-foot extensions to compensate. That said the pair of these with the pair of extension cords was still less expensive than buying power strips with 6-foot cables.I bought these to rework the DC power adapters for the hard drives on my Plex server. In coordination with 6-foot power extensions to plug these into the wall outlet and 1-foot extensions to plug the adapters in it's a match that works well for me.I won't hesitate to purchase these again next time I am in need of them.
5,What can really be said about a basic typical surge protector?  This is a good price for a basic product.  You aren't getting any extra frills or any fancy design features - just a basic functional plastic surge protector that does the job it was made to do.  I have limited electrical outlets in my basement and purchased the surge protectors to use down there for additional outlets.  I don't anticipate using them for the surge protection capability but it never hurts to have that additional protection.  The 2' cord length is fine for my intended use.  I only really needed one but for the price I figured I'd might as well have another around just in case.  The product arrived quickly and works like I would expect.
4,The product is just what I was looking for. Nothing fancy but it serves the purpose. I have been using the product for the past six months and it never gave me any troubles.
5,Have been impressed with the framework and form factor of this product.  Most surge protectors are really bigger than they need to be but these are quite pleasing.  I was able to setup a dozen in a small business office needing some bending in some creative ways and each time they worked for the intent.  Even had a power surge when a truck hit a power pole outside the office space and we had not received our UPS batteries yet.  Lost a microwave that was not connected to any protectors but all computers and LCD tv all had no problems.I do not recommend letting your toddler stick paperclips in the holes though; that the surge protection does not seem to help with that as much as I would had hoped.
4,For the love of God....just .. turn .. the .. outlets .. sideways!!! I know there are others that are but with a much larger size foot print. How hard can it be?! Two wall warts take six outlets.
4,These are an excellent value for the price but the red power light is really really bright. If you plan to use these in a bedroom that you keep dark at night you'll get a bonus nightlight!
5,This isn't anything fancy the material isn't heavy weight either. However I needed a surge protector for my office to plug my monitor printer power cable into and this does the job great. I also use one in the living room replacing a much bulkier one I had. With everything plugged in it fits under the console table (something about seeing wires and cords everywhere freaks me out). I haven't had it that long to know how long it will last but I don't think it's going to give out any time soon. I will probably buy a couple more around the holiday season to plug in all the indoor lights.
5,As many other people have said the plastic is molded so that the mounting holes won't work with regular screws.  Super easy to fix.  I put a screw that I wanted to use in my drill.  Stick the screw head into the hole and run the drill.  Now move the screw to the position you want.  What happens is the screw heats up the plastic grinds it and gives you a seat for your screw.  Took all of 2 minutes to fix both surge protectors.  I was able to mount them securely to the wall using the same drywall screws.  Piece of cake.
5,With a couple of other power strips these can be tied to a stick and function as a flail - perfect for defending your hold against marauding goblin hordes.Or you can plug them into the wall and other things into them (boring).  The rocker switch will enable/disable power to the rest of the strip and the LED on the face just above the socket connections will light up to announce that your electronics are protected.  Without having disassembled the housing I'm presuming that it isn't merely an LED tapping VCC.The cord lead is just long enough to reach the power outlet to the floor with a little wiggle room.  (wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle!)
5,So the cord length is a little short but it’s two feet. Two feet is all I needed so it works for me. But I see people say how short it is so they obviously didn’t read the description before they bought it. Compact and easily packable for travel. Good quality for not a lot of money. I saw another cord just like this one but it was 1 cord 2 feet for $12. This was a better deal
4,These are a good deal for surge protectors.  They are as pictured on the site.  I have a lot of electronics and feel like I can never find an open outlet when I need one.  So these are great.  I like plugging things into asurge protector because it is easy to turn off a lot of things at once by simply flipping the button.  My only complaint is the cords are a little bit shorter than I would have liked (although it was accurate in the description).  An extra 6-12" would have helped me out a bit.  But still a good deal and worth the purchase! I would buy again!
4,Cord could be a foot longer and it would be more useful. Not a lot of surge protection but adequate for my purposes. I would recommend on with greater protection and a "Surge Damage Warranty" if you intend to use it on expensive electronics that are very sensitive to electrical surges.
5,My husband really likes these strips and so do I. He usually complains when I get more but we always wind up using them. I like them being black bcs they don't stick out as much as the traditional whitish colored ones. They blend in with things so it's less obvious it's there. The cord is actually longer than other we have and we both like that. My husband really likes them because they have more outlets and reach farther but also they're a great price. They are apparently easy to hang as well. I don't know what we use for hanging but apparently we do.
4,These seem to be a perfectly fine product. The only initial complaint I have is that the screw hole slots on the back for mounting aren't actually big enough to accommodate a normal sized screw. Tried sheetrock screws and 2in number 8 deck screws. Neither fit.
4,Wish companies would make these things without bright lights built-in. I had to tape over the bright red lights with black duct tape so I can get some sleep. Apart from that everything is as it should be. 200 joules seems pretty low but I only have low-energy items plugged into mine anyway.
5,Don't plug in your computer without a surge protector.  I learned this many years ago from experience.  This Amazon Basic is no frills and utilitarian.  For me it's an insurance policy.
4,These are just as they say basic.  I did not need a super power protector for all my electronics as I have a more expensive one for that just more of a multi-extension cord for simple things by my night stand.  If there is a surge you do have to manually reset the switch.  Works perfect for what I need and a great price!My only complaint is that the cord is extremely thick and heavy while the base is lightweight. Cord was hard to run behind nightstand while keeping the plugs laying flat. And very short- but I didn't want extra cord laying around.
5,Gonna be honest when I added this to my cart I was hesitant. My internal monolog went something like this “Well it’s only ten bucks for two of them… that’s a pretty darn good price in general even if it wasn’t delivered to my door. Alright think of it this way if it’s junk then you spent 10 dollars on a test to see if the Amazon basics stuff is in any way useful and that’s all.”And I’m happy to say holy cow Amazon this is actually a good product for crazy cheap. I’m a little afraid that you are utilizing slave labor in Southeast Asia to produce it but in case you’re not go you.
4,I was pleasantly surprised to find my order actually came with 2 surge protector whereas I only thought I bought 1. They work. There's not much else to say about them. The power cable is kind of small and the thick cable makes it difficult to sit flat on the floor in certain positions. But otherwise you really can't go wrong.
4,These power strips work like you would expect them to but my one main reservation is that they don't put more space between each receptacle which is often necessary especially if you use 110-to-USB charger bricks.Also the lit switch seems especially flimsy though so far it seems to still be working after a few months.
4,What do you expect for $5 each? You get it. So the surge protection level is not the highest offered by Amazon Basics. So the build quality is not the highest offered by Amazon Basics. It cost $5. It works. With our local utility's occasional issues even cheaper electronics deserve protection. I'm not plugging a $15 dot into a $50 surge protector. These are perfect for some less expensive items seem to be put together reasonably well and look fine stuffed behind furniture out of sight.
4,For the price you can’t beat anything else then this. Works great and have not had any issues with this product so over all a satisfied. If your on a budget I would highly recommend these and if your not the. Maybe go for something a little better quality in material wise. Other wise 9/10 product
5,High quality product - well designed and works great.Easy and convenient to use. Plug ins go in smoothly and stay secure.Would definitely recommend if you need a high quality power strip for your devices. 5 stars and will buy again if I need more for my house.
4,Just a power strip plain and simple. Only issue I've had so far is that the outlet tolerances are a bit tight so you have to firmly push some plugs in. On the plus side they don't come out too easily!
4,It's a bit too sleek and flimsy for my liking. Does the job and has 6 plug points but would have like something with a wider base (sometimes if I have 3-4 heavy adapters on it it invariably topples over)
1,Amazon sent me used power cords. They work so I kept them. But they had clear marks dings and scratches on them. They even had some gummy substance on them. I’m
5,measure how long a cord you need won't work if you need lto go a long way. My items are just above the outlet so it works perfectly. energy saver if you want to turn iff when gone you can stop the constant flow of power if you like. I loved that the pack xame with 2. I only expected one because tlof the price. you get your $$ worth.
5,After reading some of the reviews I hesitated. Thinking it was going to explode on me or burn up. Nope. I've had it for about two months or more and four items are plugged into it. No problems. In fact quite the opposite. It's the real thing. Works solidly and consistently. The slots for the prongs on the plugs are a really perfect fit. The black color does camouflage it a bit. I'd feel comfortable recommending it. I bought two strips. Both of them are as I just described. I may just purchase one additional.
4,I ordered this on accident when I meant to order the 790 joule version. If you are planning on protect devices that use a lot of power like a desktop or a gaming laptop or maybe even a console I recommend the 790 version plus they last longer. Both versions come with a $10000 warranty but I haven't had to use it yet. The build quality is good just like on the photos. But the 200 joule version would be better fit for something like lamps or phones or even a tv set  basically things with low power consumption.
4,I purchased those surge protectors three years ago and they still work perfectly in my house. The first year I was concerned about safety but everything went smooth. The material is definitely can be better but if you looking for something affordable just to expand outlets and protect devices then you in the right place.Design 4/5Quality of material 3/5Safety 4/5Quality of product 5/5Useful? 5/5
5,I purchased these extensions to use at my desk and nightstand. They're great basic extensions if you're not looking for anything special. I hung one under my desk upside down with 3M stickers and it hasn't fallen even my laptop charger is plugged in and its not to heavy for it!
4,Great basic surge protector. No issues with performance. It does what it should. My only gripe is the red indicator light is super bright! I mean blinding. I ended up taping over it.
1,The first time I plugged this in it blew a breaker and nearly lit on fire. I'm an electrical engineer by trade and in my professional opinion these power strips feature a great deal of shoddy craftsmanship. I opened them up to share with you all.The power strip on the left is missing a solder pad connection or possibly even a pin to some component. I didn't investigate further as turning the electronics around would probably damage the plastic housing. Needless to say I have not plugged this one in yet and have no intention to do so. The power strip on the right comes with an additional solder bridge between the earth ground and the hot line of the AC connection in addition to all its other features. We are very lucky this didn't catch on fire when it got plugged in. It's totally unacceptable and dangerous to let products like this out the door. I don't know what manner of QA Amazon requires of it's products but it obviously isn't terribly rigorous. I would warn everyone from purchasing these. If I could give 0 stars I would.
5,This product is better than I expected. And with a pack of two it's good to have a spare one if for some reason the first one stops working. It's good so far and both of my power strips are perfectly good and in a working condition.
5,Got the 2 pack for $12.99 and so far I like them. Would be nice if the main cord was a tad longer but it's not a big deal. I'm about to get a lamp with a 6 inch chord anyway. Great purchase so far!
5,For the price these really can’t be beat. They work perfectly and I haven’t run into any problems. The cord is a little short but that’s not too big an issue. I’m just happy to have found decent power strips for such a good price.
5,It's not super long which read the description and you'll know that but it's great if you just need a little extra length or if you need more outlets.. use it for my charger next to my bed so I'm not stuck holding my charger above my head while it's charging and I use it in class so that I can get that little extra length and multiple people can charger their laptops. And it's two for one so yes buy!!
5,This is one of the reasons why I love Amazon it forces companies to compete when customers can see other companies selling the same product they start pricing competitively what can I say about the product it’s great they both work great I’m using it right now and had no issues out of them.
3,These were cheap enough that I picked them up without thinking. Once they arrived I realized that thanks to the hodge podge of sizes and angles manufacturers create plugs at using all six outlets was near impossible. Also compared to other power strips I had in the past they seem closer together than normal.If all you need a strip for bog standard two-prong plugs these strips will meet your need easily. Once you deviate from that you may find yourself at the mercy of how odd your plugs are.
4,Two to a pack these 200 Joule 6-outlet surge protectors are an easy way to expand capacity. I use one to expand one electrical socket in a kitchen "appliance garage" (an under counter pull out shelf behind a closed door). It allows me to keep three small appliances (crock pot and two types of mixers) at the ready. For higher priced electronics PC's and such I would use a protector with a higher Joule rating but for our cheaper small appliances these are a great buy.
5,I set up home office recently and noticed that we have hardly any outlets to use.  After filling up all the outlets I needed to get a surge protector.  These are perfect.  I like having two since my computer corner has a lot of electronics and chargers needed and I use the other side of the room to house my plants and use heat lamps to start my seedlings before transplanting or eating the micro greens.  This has solved my problem and now I can plug in everything I need without worrying about burning the house down or tripping the breaker.
4,Well I has them a wait but I final put them where they suppose to me for my TV CD and sound system.I just think it something good to have it you have expect thing in your home because I done last year lighning strike hit my New Flat Screen TV and I thought the TV was out so the next morning I took a cord and hook it up to an other sock an tI turn on the TV and it was fine but Out Surge Protect Power Cord. Burn out.
4,Definitely would have been nice to have a longer cord but the price different was significant so I went with the short ones. Seem to work well reasonably attractive.
5,It works and it is well-made. I was thinking about buying a cheaper version of this at Home Depot but the reviews for this product was so much better that I jumped in on this just for a few dollars more. Whether it works or not I can’t really tell you because I don’t get too many surges here.
5,wow..didnt know i was getting 2 for the price..works out fine I will keep one and give the other to my daughter she needs one..i also have a few more coming in this week--a bit more expensive more joules..so many electronics ..it never ends.
5,Needed a few surge protectors for our office area and did a quick search.  Several of the retail outlets around town sell just one of these for the price I paid to get two from Amazon in their Basics brand.  They arrived in a brown box and were easy to open and use.  The cable is long enough to allow space between the power outlet and your destination too.  If you have power bricks you'll need to get some of the extension cables like the 1' cables so that you can fully utilize all 6 of the outlets.  Overall this has been a great product for us and for a great price!
4,I know they are Amazon basics but they are a little more cheaply made than I thought they would be. I had a hard time inserting the cord cables and I really hope that doesn't cause a problem later on.
3,Simple enough- plugs switch and long enough cord to sit under outlet. But what’s with the ultra red light? Did I buy the gates of hell!? I have two of these portals on opposite ends of a small 8x12 room and the red consumes the whole space. Not only is the switch red but there had to be an extra red light because... RED. Anyway I may or may not return them let’s see what happens at night. User beware.
4,Overall it's a good powerful strip regarding the price~ The white is a cream white~
4,Checked all the areas other reviewers complained about and mine are perfect.  A little on the light side but what can one expect for the price?  Did not purchase these for computer or TV related items...just for a fan and 2 wine refrigerators.
5,These are great power strips for my fish tanks. I like that they are also surge protectors and that there is a switch that turns the whole strip on or off. The short 2' cord works for me in this sitation.
5,I needed a surge protector power strip for traveling and I got two for the price of one with this Amazon deal. I often travel to other countries and some of them like Mexico New Zealand Vietnam will only have one two port outlet for the entire room. That doesn't work very well when you have several devices to operate and to charge at one time thus the need for the power strip. This particular one works as advertised and it is engineered well. And you certainly cannot beat the price. I highly recommend this surge protector power strip.
4,Best value on the net for surge protection.  2 for a good price.  Does its job and has a nice feel. I have them all over my house
4,These are absolutely great. Nice size charges well fits needs perfectly. I took off a star because the cord needs to be much longer. Your outlet has to be close by with this one.
5,Did not realize there were two per box... ordered 4 and got 8.  Already have all 8 in use meaning things are a lot more convenient.  This handles enough amperage to work for many of our high current cooking devices safely OR several smaller appliances.  Very pleased with this product... does what I need without silly extras that are not needed.  Power switch can turn several things on or off at the same time.
4,The power strip is heavy duty and works fine.  I guess I should have read the write up on it more closely.  It said it had a 2 foot cord for the plug (mine was 2' shorter) because I was planning to put it on my desk and power it from the strip directly behind my desk on the floor.  Obviously 2 feet does not reach the floor from the top of my desk.
4,Overall I like this pair of AmazonBasics Surge Protector Powerstrips.  The only problem is that the power cord is too short.  I use it on my mom's Sony Trinitron TV.  It works well.  The reason why I gave it four stars and not five stars is because of the short power cord.  I would recommend these to a friend or family member.
5,I wish the length of the cord was slightly longer but for the price I can’t complain. :) Its very light great for travel use. I had no problems plugging my devices in and they worked great in a storm when we lost power. Would definitely recommend.
4,A good value but I wish I had seen the one with the one with USBs included.  I'll now order those because that is so convenient:  Cable Matters (2-Pack) 6 Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip with USB Charging Ports / 300 Joules with 8 Foot Power Cord in Black
5,They are small and compact! Perfect for travel but the cord is a little short for our taste. If you only use it for travel and not at home it would be perfect but we use it for home and travel! They arrived and in perfect condition and are of good quality. The price was also good!
5,I have two of these power strips and they have been working fine for about a year no issues to report. For one of them I am using all the outlets and it works fine powering all my devices.
5,We purchased AmazonBasics 6-Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip 2-Pack 200 Joule - Black for use at our desk and behind our entertainment center to protect our electronics and provide added electrical outlets.  The black color behind or beneath our furniture is nearly imperceptible except for the small glowing light that ensures that the unit is working.  We have had no problems plugging everything that we need into the power strips.  We are pleased with the product.
4,Knock a star for the red LED to indicate surge protection being too bright when you turn the lights off.  Other than that it's great.
5,Small only 2 ft of bulking cord to hide. My only wish is that the plug openings themselves were spaced a little further apart as I can only fit 3 items to plug in as nowadays the plugs themselves are larger than these little plug openings squished together allow for
5,AmazonBasics 6-Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip 2-Pack 200 Joule        I ordered these for my office. I ordered them not so much for the surge protection but more for the outlet space. I have not typically had issues with power surges but a little protection doesn't hurt either. If you need a lot of power surge protection you should probably go for a higher joule rating but these worked for me. They arrived on time and were a good price so I am happy with the purchase. There isn't a real pro or con for the purchase but I did feel they were a good value.
5,We are required to zip-tie a master power strip into a Christmas tree that I am doing for a festival donation. I thought we were going to be in trouble until I found these. If you were to put it behind a desk or couch there wouldn't be a problem with them being too bulky. They would pack well for laptop cases. Seem sturdy. No regrets
4,The build quity looks good. It's made from plastic. If you are going for aesthetic then try to find something else because even though this feels like good quality the plastic does not have good finish. Great value for the price hands down!
5,These surge protectors are great the design of the strip and how it is laid out is perfect for using with devices that have unorthodox plugs.  I was able to plug in multiple (all) cords of various sizes using this strip versus one that I previously had and couldn't get everything plugged in.
5,The Amazon Basics products are some of the best item I receive.I will away give them a 5 out of 5.These outlets where perfect for my for room set up I have a lot of plugs and need to charges things quite often.I also have a numerous amount of electronics running in my room.I also need to keep my device's top up such as my moto 360gaxaly S7 and my Xbox controllers.I would recommend this outlets to anybody who just don't have enough outlets in there house or apartment.They work great!I have them mounted to my walls.
5,Affordable and durable. I’ve used mine extensively without any problems.Pros- Works with no problems- very light- cord length is long enough for this item to be behind a TV for a workstation for a gaming station- doesn’t break even after dropping stepping on it or having it stored in a very tight spotCons- too big for travel but doesn’t seem to be meant for traveling
4,Very good except the cord is entirely to short should have read better but found them sturdy and easy to use
5,Package arrived on time and was easy to set up for a room to use daily routines. Especially during a pandemic when you need more outlets to use for your devices for work and school.
5,These are much higher quality products than most Low cost surge protectors. They have a nice durability and weight to them. They don’t feel like empty hollow pieces of plastic. The cord is only 1 foot long so make sure you read and realize that. The small cord is actually perfect for areas where you don’t want or need extra cord just taking up space  perfect for tight spots !
1,I ordered a two pack. It came in a damaged box with only one power strip. The one it did come with doesn’t work. Also short cord. Very fragile and clearly breaks easily so basically useless.
5,There is not much to one of these.  A line cord housing switch light and a string of outlets.  I already have a whole house surge protector on my incoming power line therefore I don't need a massive surge protector.  I received these promptly plugged them in turned the switch on and I have power to six outlets on each of them.  The outlets are snug giving a good connection to the plug leading to the load.  It has met my expectations I had wwhen I ordered them..
3,This picture shows the problem with the mount slot that many have alluded to.  The left hand image clearly shows why any screw head will be blocked from sliding firmly up into the slot.  The right hand image shows how the slot can be modified with a bit of judicious rotary tool cutting but this shouldn't be necessary with a properly designed slot.Also be sure to recognize that vertically wall mounting this strip requires that the cable comes out of the top of the strip i.e. the slot for the screw only extends toward the cable end of the strip.  It cannot be securely mounted with the cable running from the bottom of the strip.
4,So these are inexpensive reliable and sturdy. The cord is stiff and that means placing the power strip in the only way the cord will let you place it. (Is there a verb for that? I mean the cord is not flexible nor easy to place.)
4,These power strips are basic and will do the job. My only critique is that the on/off switch gets in the way of some bulkier plugs (i.e. computer/phone chargers) which ends up eliminating a potential spot.
5,I got these to affix to the legs of my shop table. They stay in place. They feel solid. All the outlets are usually full and I've had no problems with them.
4,These have been great.  The cord length is really nice and they get the job done.  As good as any surge protector I have ever purchased.  They are also nice and slim.
4,I don't really want to use an extension cord for a product like this.  Cord is way too short.
4,Does a great job on light-weight surge protector jobs.  Not a good idea if you  need sufficient joules to protect expensive electronic equipment
4,Again between this and a few other power strips i've had these feel a little bit more on the cheap side in terms of plastic but they definitely do the trick
5,They've been the answer to my needs but I don't need a really long cord for any of my locations. I got two boxes totaling 4. So far they have been reliable. I hope they last.
4,Only thing bad about this is the cord length. My outlet is a little higher than most so this just dangled and I had to tape it to the wall
3,This surge protector does exactly what it is bargained for just know that if there ever is a purge surge this surge protector can pretty much only be used once.That being said surge protectors are really the last line of defense for electronics in your home the primary defense against power surges is your breaker box. In the event the breaker box doesn't switch in time this is what this surge protector is good for and for the cheap price just replace it.There have been complaints about the red light being too bright but I've never noticed it to be too bright in the dark. If the light is facing you directly when you sleep I guess?The cord is 2 ft long so wherever your outlet is is where your power strip is going. You won't run it very far from the outlet.
4,Works fine cord length is very short so if you’re looking for lengthy power strips then i don’t suggest this one. Comes with 2 good price for what ya get i guess
5,Great little extension cord/ surge protector. I needed the extra outlets to plug in my TV and all the other electronics to go with it. It's slim and fits behind my entertainment center just fine.
5,Had to get extra surge protectors to support homeschooling. These were perfect! We are all set up! The quality is excellent. They seem pretty standard. I would purchase again if I need in the future. I think the value for the money is great.
5,You can’t price or value of these surge protectors. We’ve been having some severe storms during this pandemic and I have a lot of work gadgets here at home that needed protecting. This surge protector came a lot faster than stated on website.
3,I bought this set of 2 power strips but only needed one so I put the other in a drawer.  The first one we use has been great and is still running.  We just pulled the second out of the drawer because we finally found a use for it but it was broken.  The reset/power button just flops.  My fault for not testing it within the return period.
4,Affordable power surge protectors for a great price. It has 6 outlets so I can plug a lot of things like my TV iPhone charger & MacBook! Good purchase and for a pack of 2 very reasonable.It is your basic surge protector. The cord is a little short of you need something longer this is not the one for you. Red light indicator shows strip is on. Good buy!
3,As a power strip it is adequate but for mounted positioning this unit is useless. The screw holes on the back are poorly designed and cannot accept a screw so it cannot be mounted as almost all other power strips can be mounted. My needs require secure mounting so these are to me useless. Luckily they are also very inexpensive.
4,These two outlet strips are perfect for my living room. I needed extra plugs for some phone chargers and some plugs behind the TV. These are durable and definitely cat chewing proof! Cats have not bothered them at all. My only wish is that the cord from the plug to the device was a bit longer.
4,Length can be a little longer. Works as intended. Looks solid.
4,Came in the mail fast for the money I paid I'm happy with it
4,I think it has a nice electric switch off (of course when it is on) and be careful with your plugs.Also I did not receive all I ordered but am happy to have at least the two I paid for.
5,These are prefect. A storm came and blew the surge protector but everything on it still worked.  Definitely served its purpose. I have several of these around the house.
5,The power strip gets the job done. I would say that I prefer power cords with the plugs rotated 90 degrees so that you can fit more plugs in it. When it's vertically placed a large plug will cover the next plug which reduces your ability to use more plugs. Otherwise it's good and decently priced.
5,I like that this is a light weight jump rope and it's to adjust the length and I can take everywhere to keep on track with exercising! Love It!
5,I use these to power battery chargers for my chain saw pole saw & drill.  Once all the batteries are charged I turn the power off until I use a battery & then charge them all at once.  Works very well for me.  I am also able to turn power off to my TV  powered antenna DVD player stereo system etc. when not in use as they draw power all the time even when turned off.
4,I used this power strip to plug in everything for our cable TV. It is slim in design not bulky easy to use
3,These are very "okay". They work but feel super cheap and I wouldn't use them for more than 6 or so amps total.If you need to charge a cell phone and laptop it's a perfect choice. If you have a space heater or something else that demands more power you should look for better quality unless you have good house insurance and feel like moving.
5,I am not expecting anything spectacular other than no fires and all the plugs to work and they have done that so far. Good value for the money when I needed it fast.
5,They arrived on time where in a simple package and work as expected. The one thing that I am not totally happy with is the cable. It is super strong and does not bend very easily. This means that the quality is great and the wires are strong but it also means that it is harder to straighten and forms for my needs. I also did not expect them to be this short but it was in the description and I am not complaining about it.Recommendation: I would buy them again!
5,I thought that these power strips were causing my lamp to flicker and I was wrong. I bought a new power strip at the hardware store where I work in the lamp still flickers. I wish I could remove my negative review.
5,I needed an extra power strip but didn't have much to spend. It ended up being cheaper to buy 2 of this brand than one of another. These are worth it! The cord is a bit short for my liking but I adjusted and it's not a big deal.
4,This power strip works as it should.  Need to pay attention to the 2-foot long cord as it is a bit short if you are using this on a desk to a wall outlet.
5,These Amazon Basics items have all turned out to be great purchases for me. This was no different. I needed some surge protector/ power strips and didn't want to look through which would be the best value. So I just went with the Amazon Basics brand and I feel confident that this was the best decision. Saves me a lot of time if there is an Amazon Basics option available.
5,Can't really go wrong with a surge protector as long as they work as intended. These do the job and are worth the price. My only complaint is that the red light on the on/off switch is a bit bright which usually is a good thing but I have one in my bedroom that lights the room at night. Nothing a little masking tape couldn't fix though.
5,Good for what they're designed for.  Since the power plugs are facing serially (instead of inline facing sideways) don't expect to put many wall wart plugs into this.Has holes in the back for wall hanging so you can put nails/screws in and latch it onto them.  The cord is small enough to be non-obtrusive which is very nice for me.  I have it sitting on the back of my computer desk and the cord runs down directly to the plug.
5,It seems like I am always looking for a power strip and can never find one. Good to have a few extra around and the price in these are tough to beat. These work well and the connections are nice and tight highly recommended.
5,Works every day. Nothing bad to say about it. Giving a review on a defective product is not  classy so I usually wait to review to get my product see if it is defective and does what it needs to do. This product works like clock work.
4,Basic product for a good price.  Bought six for  for Christmas decorations.  Installed in a weatherproof box.  Are working well so far.
5,The only drawback I can point out is that the power cable is very "sturdy" and since the plug connectors are very light it's quite hard to keep the plugs standing in a position unless you "fix it" with nails or something similar
4,Slightly smaller cord length. However it is good for travelling and the quality of Amazon is excellent.
2,I bought two x 2-packs.  The first one I plugged into a wall socket blew the circuit.  As soon as I plugged it in there was a quiet pop and I saw a spark fly from need the power on button.  There was nothing plugged into the power strip.  There was nothing else plugged into that socket.  I tried the strip on other sockets and it wouldn't power on/no power on light.  The other strip in the box seems to power on ok and did not short out like the first.  The other two strips from the other box also seem to work ok.I'm kinda worried about their quality though.  I've never had this happen with any power strips before.
4,Good for the price.
4,These are ok. The plugs are not flat but they get the job done. Wish I would have selected the 3ft cord length.
4,Does the trick.
5,The 2 pack is a great value. I use them when I travel to have additional outlets. They get the job done. I would recommend this product if you’re looking for a great product and a great value.
4,I have several thousands of dollars worth of equipment plugged into these power strips with no problems at all. I have not been disappointed with any Amazon Basics products thus far.
4,A standard
5,Never have any issues with this product even when using all outlets available. Outlets are spaced out enough so bigger plugs don’t impede other outlets.
5,So far they have worked great. Have power outages at my home more often than I would like and these have protected my electronics from damage.
5,What can be said...it's a power cord/surge protector.They work great! No complaints! Basic power strip/surge protector that does the job. If your family is like ours electronics accumulate like crazy and $20-30 apiece for dozens of surge protectors adds up fast. These are great to keep handy for when you need one. Small and light will hold you till you get a more expensive one with better protection if you need for your big ticket items. It was white not orange so it blended in and did not jump out at you.
4,Bought these to protect some home electronics from power surges. The only drawback is the 2-foot power cord which limits its uses. I knew this going in and bought a couple other power strips with 5-foot cords. That being said you can't beat the price. Won't know if they really work until they experience a power surge which I hope never happens.
5,The double pack of surge protection power strips fit the bill for our needs.  When you only have 4 outlets in for 8 items well you need more outlets.  The two strips did the job at a price we all appreciate.
4,This product had the right price and is a basic surge protector.  The cord is only about 12" long.  So if your outlet is behind furniture you will have difficulty accessing the power strip.  It works fine.
4,Excellent power strip works great and it’s also a great value. I like the lighted light to let you know that the power is on. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for power strips!
4,A good product that does what it says. Worth saving a few bucks. For some reason I thought the cord was longer but that was just me not measuring out the actual length described. I wanted longer but I'm going to keep these as they do the job. Nothing against the item or the seller I just wish they had the longer version at this price!
5,I have not had a surge recently but when and if I do I have this power cord to stop it. Currently it brings power to the devices I need it to. Not much more to say about it.
5,I am happy with these surge protector extension cords.  They service the purpose well and I do not have to worry about and possible surges.  The only thing I wish I would have read better is the two foot cord.  It is a little short but is still workable.
4,Cord is a little short but that is by design. Only real gripe is that the "mounting holes" on the back were useless. I could barely fit a #4 screw head in them  because of how shallow the holes are and the slots were not deep enough for those screws to really grip. If you plan on mounting these to something you are better off with a different brand. Otherwise they work and are well made.
5,Very basic surge protectors that work fine.  As with most the cord is a bit short but you know that boy looking at the picture.  The light on the red is kind of bring in my sons room so know that going in.  I wish the light were not as bright and more dim.  If this is hidden under a bed than it may not matter.  Works as promised though.
5,It’s a surge protector. It works and things plug into it. What else is there to say. Cord could be a little longer though. If your putting it right behind a computer desk it’ll work just fine.
4,While I wanted a short (2 foot) cord for under my desk - this cord is very stiff making it's short length more difficult to deal with. Also wish I could have ordered just one and not a 2-pack but this 2-pack seemed like the best option among surge protectors on amazon that fit what I was looking for.
5,Great quality outlets. These do just as described and the material quality is a 5/5.They do have a small slot on the bottom/back if you want to anchor them to a desk or wall.The switch has a distinct click when you activate it and the light glows just bright enough so you know its on but doesn't blind or provide to much illumination if its plugged in behind a TV or computer desk.The cord is thick but still flexible to be routed or coiled up for easy storage.
5,Good product at a low cost . Works properly . No issues faced yet . The product was received in good condition and on time
4,We use these one's for my TV in the living room yet on from my workbench come in very handy
5,Can you really have too many power strips?  I needed a few extra for the entertainment center as it seems that we are always adding a Roku WiFi extender or Apple TV to the mix of stuff plugged in.  Since these are all low draw a power strip is a good solution.  These are priced right and seem to be of good quality.
3,The cord is extremely short so be careful when buying it if you want to have a longer cord. But it has a lot of outlets which is great for plugging in many things at the same time. This product is average and you get what you paid for/signed up for.
4,Pretty much the headline. If you need more outlets then look no further. Two power stips for less than the price of one.
4,Satisfied with the product.
5,These two cords were just what we needed for our home. With five people in the house with multiple devices that need charging I was getting tired of fighting with the kids after they had unplugged something of mine. There is space for everyone now. Great deal too.
4,Does the job but the cable needs to be a foot longer... doesn’t reach desk from wall socket...
4,It’s hard to get excited about something as basic as a surge outlet protector but this one does a nice job.  It has a low profile is light weight and two for ten bucks is a pretty good deal.
4,They work well and were cheap so I can't complain too much. But I will complain. Why the hell do the outlets point down? When you have a block plug it takes up 3 spaces instead of 2 when on the outside ports. So you lose only one I guess.
4,Simple and affordable power outlet strip. Go to product for my power adapter needs now.
4,sturdy power strip with light indicating its on. Wish cord was at least 6 inch longer.
4,Great quality just have to make sure you get the right cord length.
3,I hate to only give 3 stars due to user error but come on now.....it's a power strip with only two feet of cord. So that's one foot from your outlet to the floor leaving you only one more foot of cord. Unless your computer desk tv stand etc is directly on top of your wall outlet I wouldn't recommend this item unless you are ok with a big bulky surge protector showing on your floor.
4,Wish it was a little bit longer just a little! Other than that works great!
4,Does the job for a heavy gamer and music/video producer... The only thing I don't like is that it sparks when you plug something in. But other than this it's a great 2 for $9 deal.
4,Received this week. So far no complaints. Fits the description.
5,Like many of the Amazon basics line these outlets provide good value for the money. They don't seem cheap- although they don't seem particularly fancy either and they seem like they would be reasonably durable over the long haul. Perhaps there are cheaper units out there but this seems like a good trade off between quality and price.
5,For under 10 dollars to get 2 power strips is an absurd deal. I recently had an old strip go out and replaced it (with an extra spare) for cheaper than I bought my original one nearly a decade ago. Quality seems like it should last quite a while
5,Product was definitely worth the money. You get two for a really good price. The only issue would probably be the length of the cord. It would be a lot better if it was just Alitalia longer. But over all a very good product.
4,I love this just got delivered and it was great deal for the $$$$. The cord length is great and it’s good for what I want .
5,Product is great for the value it's amazon basic so it gonna meet every day need. Just don't be an idiot and over charge it and it won't blow up or catch on fire... Like all of those picture you see
4,Really good for the price have worked for all of my needs.
5,Not fancy nor too cheap works well for a splutter but not for JOULE rating.
4,I thought I read the cord was longer. Oh well. 2 circuit breakers for the price is a steal!
5,Good for what they are. Length of the cord might be a bit short however they look nice and work well.
4,Great surge protector/power strip does what it should. Sometimes it's hard to plug things in next to each other because of how everything has to face so I plug things in every other plug. But this comes in a 2 pack at a good price so I'm a big fan. It's been very helpful for the dorm room that had 4 girls and 4 outlets!
4,You pay for what you get. A pretty good product for a good price. There’s nothing fancy about the power strip it just works as you expected. A good value for your money.
4,Its little bit hard to insert the plug. Has room for improvement in socket metal alignment.
5,I was a part of the hurricane Florence and all the strips in our house where blown. We use these for everything just for that reason I would rather buy a new power strip then a new tv. I ordered these and they work great I like that the plugs go in very snug and don't come loose. I will defiantly buy them again!
4,This is a very good outlet and charges multiple things at once. My dorm only has 2 outlets and I need multiple to charge my phone speakers  fridge etc. This was a really good non expensive one. My only issue is that it unplugs very easily but that would be outlets fault.
4,I like these just wish the cord was longer
3,We purchased 4 of these outlet strips and only 3 of them work. One of them it appears the switch may have been installed wrong (pictured). It says "reset" on the switch where on the strip it says "off" and on the switch says "off" where on the strip says "on".  The light comes on but none of the plugs function. It's not worth the money to spend time returning the unusable product.
4,It's fine the cord is pretty short though.
4,Basic is just the right description.  Very basic six plug power strips with small indicator lights when they are switched on.  The two holes on the back side for mounting are goofy. Thus if you really want to mount your power strip buy a different one. I will not so these are just fine.
4,🔥
4,The surge protectors have helped me with all the plugs I needed a ground plug for in my bedroom. The only thing that is not so good for a bedroomis the bright red power light. It is very bright if your room dark-very dark.  I have had to turn them over. I would recommend them .
5,It a good and inexpensive product. The first time I ordered was a year back and they haven't given any trouble yet. So when I needed more of these I knew I could trust these.
5,They are holding up. They get a lot of stuff plugged in and out of them. Would recommend.
5,They are good and have been using them for sometime now and they serve the purpose. Would have been nice if the cords were a little longer for the same price.
5,Been using these daily for two months. No issues. Wish the cord was slightly longer for my application but so far they were worth the money. Also the red light is a bit too bright for use in the bedroom
4,The plastic quality is worse than what you can find in store at a lower price. I was honestly expecting better with it being an Amazon brand.Cord length is superb if that’s what you’re looking for.
5,They seem to be pretty decent power strips hopefully I'll never need to test their surge protection.  Cord is thick and well-insulated outlets are nice and tight has two LEDs (one to confirm protection mode the other to indicate the on/off switch is active.)They seem to be very solid in build construction and come with the standard two mounting points on the back that remain hidden when the strip is affixed in place.  A great value for the price.
5,Wasn't aware that there were wifi capabilities until i posted this review so i never used it. Great for expanding plug capacity! Seemed to protect my devices during storms but i only ever got flickers.
4,Good product.Only problem is that the cord that plugs in the wall has virtually no bendability.
4,These surge protectors feel very cheap. They were pretty much the cheapest ones on Amazon so it's expected. They work really good and are extremely light weight.  I am happy with my purchase. If you got some extra money to spend though I would probably get a nicer one.  Over all it's a good buy and does exactly what I bought it for.
5,They do exactly what they're supposed to and the cords are long enough to make a difference. Good price for two of them.
5,Second orderI have no idea where these things disappear around the house. Every time I need one we're out. It seems like I just ordered these strips and here I am again buying more. They work like a champ. Excellent value for money and next day delivery. I can't afford to start the car to go out looking for them at twice price of Amazon.
4,The product itself is great. I just didn’t pay attention to the cord length. It is really short in length.
5,Cord could be a little longer but overall it's a good product. You have the ability to turn it on and off which is very nice. The pack of 2 is nice since the cord isn't quite long enough to reach multiple spaces in the room.
4,I use this all the time and it's perfect for college dorms! Worth the price especially for two.
5,Good price for a 2pack good size compact and fits where I needed it too. I would recommend getting this and would buy this again.
4,liked the price
5,I was running out of power strips and took a risk on cheaper ones on amazon and it was worth it.Cord length isnt to long or to shortJust enough slotsAnd its cheap!Will buy again! 10/10
5,Can't go wrong with an AmazonBasics product. This does what it is supposed to and at a lower cost than its competitors.
4,Works but the red "protected" light is very misleading and annoying.  The light should be green or some other color that means "OK".  We all associated red with something 'bad' -- so Amazon using 'red' to mean 'OK' is strange.
3,I purchased eight surge protectors for my new house of this variety (AmazonBasics 6-Outlet Surge Protector Black).They seem to be perfectly fine surge protectors with plenty of outlets.  Nothing fancy but they are not cheap by any means.The one issue I do have with them is how short their plug in cord is.  My wall outlets are about a foot off the floor (it's an older home) just about two or three inches farther than the cords of these surge protectors.  So these surge protectors are dangling ever so slightly off the floor in every room of my house.  If only Amazon sold a two inch three prong extension cord...
4,They seem pretty well built . The performance is nice no problems.  The cord is very short. Other than that for the price it's a pretty sturdy piece.
5,Okay if you don't need length. If you need more more length get the 6 foot. But I had no issues with how they worked.
4,Cord is short so plan accordingly.
5,These are perfect for me to ensure my electronics are protected. Arrived super fast and don't get hot. I would recommend to any one who needs one.
4,These surge protectors work but are feel super cheap. Cheaper than those cheap ones you get from ikea. But they work...so I guess that's good. There's really not much to say about them. I wouldn't recommend them for your computer or home theater system but they're fine for the bedroom or random corner of the room.
5,Not sure who would travel with this and their is no wifi as far as I know in it but it works great for what it should be used for.
4,Great for extra plug in spots but lacks in length
4,what do you want its an extension cord works as expected
5,Good product good price. I’ve been using these for the past 2 – 3 years and they’ve worked fine no complains. I don’t have a lot of things plugged to it (like 2) but so far  so good..
4,There ok.Wish to cord was longer!
4,Came in a little later than expected.
5,Decent quality housing I like the easy to see red LED when powered.  It's quite small compared to standard power strip size which is a plus.
5,These are actually surge protected! After buying the fancy off brand versions with USB ports I learned the hard way that most of the reviews are fake and will just end up frying your electronics. Happy to report that the Amazon Basics version is a quality product!
4,The cord is a little short but works for my needs.
5,Only needed one for the time being but the 2 pack price was hard to pass up. I now have an extra surge protector if I need one. Nice quality and works great.
3,This is a perfect four plug extension seems very heavy duty but I made the mistake  of assuming it cam e with at least a six foot cord.  It DOES NOT the cord  is barely long enough so that the extension plugs rest on the floor when the unit is plugged into a low wall outlet.  The bright red "ON" light then becomes a distraction if your plug is in plain view instead of hidden behind some furniture then again if it is hidden what good is the "ON/OFF" light indicator
4,The cord is too short. I had to use an extension cord in addition to the strip.Other than that I love it.
4,I needed more outlets for my RV and these were great. The cord length was decent for what I was hoping to accomplish so I'm pretty pleased.
5,We have had these surge protectors for a couple months now and are completely satisfied. These cords are perfect for what we needed (personal use for the night stand and home office). They are discrete but able to hold the plugs we need. Great value and reliable. So far so good.
5,I HAVE THE POWER! And the strip to save my electronics from it!
5,I rated durability 5 star as I am sure it will last a long time.  I bought this to use on my kitchen counter as I needed more outlets to plug in various kitchen items.  I wanted a surge protector with a short cord and this worked perfectly.  Don't have to unplug items to plug other items in.
4,This product is definitely cheap but has worked very well for us. The cord length is short but is plenty for right underneath the outlet itself.
4,Only problem is the cords are a little short.
5,I've used the iterations of whatever "Amazon Basics" branded power strips over the years and they've always been reliable. Never detected overheating problems or experienced failures. Gets the job done at a great price. I would certainly recommend for any first timers living on their own or college boarders just to have extra outlets for the many devices that need charging or when visitors need to plug in.
5,Cord is very short and stiff to bend. Good color and does what it's supposed to do.
5,I don't buy surge protectors as often as I should. But I really like these a lot. The black color doesn't make them stick out in a room as noticably as the old white ones.
4,These days you never have enough outlets.  The only flaw with this product is the cord could be just a little bit longer.  Otherwise the pair of 6-outlet power strips is exactly what I needed.
5,Exactly what we needed and very inexpensive. Thank you. We got two for the price it was going to be at local store. They are durable and work very well.
5,I only needed one but the two-pack was less expensive so now I have a spare. I use it in my living room to plug in my charging cube land line telephone laptop and reading lamp. And when I go on vacation I can turn everything off with one switch.
4,so far so good  no any issue so far.
5,They aren't really large but still have room for alot of plug ins. They have been working fine ever since I got them and I always have 2 tabletsan oasisa firea fire 78 and 10 plugged in all the time  and no overload has happened. The strips are great and weren't expensive at all.
4,the title says it all basic. a no frills power protector that does just as it describe. The plastic could be a little more sturdy and the design could be a bit more aesthetically pleasing but it does the job as described. For the price its good deal. It would be nice if it came with USB ports to charge USB devices.
3,As many others have noted there's not much a power strip really needs to do.  I have only two requirements: (1) distribute power reliably to the 6 outlets; (2) be mountable.  For some reason the holes available to mount this are useless.  I've never had this problem with a power strip before.  I found the shallowest-depth screw head I could and it still won't fit.  Others have noted the same thing -- but wanted to add my rating so hopefully it'll either convince Amazon to improve or encourage somebody else to purchase a better model (assuming they would like to mount the power strip).
4,Very easy to use. Allows me to now have several things plugged in at once instead of just having the two outlets included in the wall. The plastic feels cheap but they seem to work well and are very inexpensive.
5,Got this to use in the kitchen with my coffee maker and other appliances. So far it has been great.
5,My WAF of some of my older white strips in my media cabinet was not exactly great.  Amazon had a lightning sales on 2 of these babies and I picked them up.  Replaced the strip and all the wiring is now invisible.Good protector for the money!
4,nice
5,Solid product. I knew the cord length was shorter when I bought it but in retrospect a longer cord would be a bit more useful.
5,The price is great so it's a no brainer. I wanted to give it 4 stars but it is my own fault that I did not realize that these cords are extremely short. They don't make it from the outlet behind my nightstand to in front of the nightstand. It is very aggravating but again my own fault - so please note that they are only 2 feet long.
4,They work okay for my needs I should have gotten something with more amperage. But that's okay I found another use for them. Because I'm a DJ and I have a lot of high-powered equipment. But  for General used in the household they're perfect
5,I bought these a long time ago and they are completely worth it. They are easy to transport and look nice not ugly. Of course they aren't in sight too much but I am glad it doesn't look like something from the 1950's. They also do not take up a lot of space.
3,The surge protector does what it was designed to do however....I had no idea they were going to be THIS SHORT! I really need to put the both of them together to get the length I need so will probably repackage and send them back. Guess I should have know due to the pricing...but I didn't (don't judge me)! Anywho the cord is about the length of one ruler and this is NOT going to work for me:-0!
4,Not very good quality for Amazon basics. The cord is really short. Outlet look is very decent. The price is alright. You get two outlets which is a good deal. 3.9 out of 5*
5,Works just fine. Haven't had them to long. Haven't had a fire or nuttin. Red light is on all the time.  update. i bought this in november ismelled somethig electric hot burning and it was where i had my phone charger plugged in to the strip.luckily i was home at the time. cant blame the strip but it didnt shut off and was hot as hell. my other strip works fine thru the other away.
5,I rebuild computer systems for the under privileged students in our area.  This was a good deal for 2 power/surge protection for the computers.  As I am financed from my own checking account I try to get the most for my money.  I believe these do a good job for a reasonable price.
3,I use these only for lamps or the occasional charger hook-up.  For a TV computer or other higher-end electronics I recommend steeping up to something else.It seems sturdy enough but I would prefer a longer cord (at least double this one).  All outlets have been tested and have worked so far.  I haven't experienced a surge hit to one of them yet and so will not comment on that.
5,I didn't have any power strips in my house so this 2 pack was perfect for me especially with the holidays coming up! Nothing too exciting- I mean it is a power strip but they are worth the money.
4,Seems to be very solid quality especially for the price. We’ve ordered several and they’ve worked well. Would definitely recommend
5,Great to have a couple of spares on hand. Power strips are one of those items I forget to buy until noticing the blinking light on my older ones. The price was right and you can't beat the convenience of having them delivered to your doorstep.
5,Works great I’ve had it for about 8 months. No fires no damage to any of my Electronics. Fills its purpose. Good for the price too!
4,Great surge protector a bit of a short cord but if you don’t need to be long it’s perfect and you get two for price of one
4,Short cord. I should've read the description better
5,I only wish this because I have so little room in my dorm and between furniture and outlets there’s no convenient spot to put them. If the cords were like three inches longer I could have them happily sitting under a raised desk though.
5,This pair of surge protectors came in handy for some holiday decorating and it never hurts to have a spare or two around the house.  They are basic black surge protectors with six outlets on the strip.  None of the outlets are spaced wide for adapters they are all for standard plugs.  You can't beat the value and I love the black color for helping the wiring disappear behind the entertainment center or computer desk.
4,It's a power strip! It works!I have no complaints for the price but I do wish the cord was longer and that the plugs were a little further apart.  But this is a failing in most all power strips. Works great at my desk
4,Works great so far.
5,I mean it works well and you can turn off the whole strip to save energy instead of unplugging each item.
5,Nice to get at good price. Should have measured. Two feet work but longer would have better my bad. So tip. Measure where you plug in to where it needs to go when selecting
4,Just a plain surge protector. Good value
5,Exactly what I wanted. I wish the power chord was a little longer but this is a great buy for the price!
5,Hey this really did what I bought it for amazing. Can't get over the power extending capabilities this thing gets away with! I turned one plug in into many and you can to!
5,Does what it's supposed to. It's a surge protector what more is there to say. 6 slots reset/on off switch. Apple chargers don't play well with others though but that's the case with any outlet. They make em too big.I did find the same thing for cheaper by GE at Target so I buy there when I need more...
5,These are fine and do their job as intended. The plug is quite bulky and I would likely order a flat plug if I were to go back. They work though.
4,Gets the job done wish the cord was a little longer
5,I don’t know why amazon has a review for wifi for this product but it does what it is indented for and for the price I cannot complain
5,Cost effective and functional. What more could you ask for? I have had no issues thus far with these power outlets. As pictured you get 2 for the price. This works just as well as any other more expensive power outlet I have purchased in the past.
5,Using it for over a year now. It works well. And I bought on a deal !!
5,Fast shipping! Brought it for my grandparents as the old ones were not working properly and messy. Helped them reconnected with the new ones from AmazonBasics and they loved it.
4,Feels a little cheap but I mean it was pretty cheap. That said it works great and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
5,I live in an older building with very little outlets and the ones I do have are in weird spots. These work perfectly for all the devices that need to be plugged in all the time. I've had them for a couple of months and haven't had any issues so far.
5,You might know some basic people but Amazon Basics are on another level. I have ordered a lot of Amazon Basics products including these surge protectors and they never disappoint!  I ordered a couple of the small and larger models of these and then placed a large bulk order for the office. Great products at great prices!  Highly recommend Amazon Basics products!
4,poor quality but still good for the price.
5,When traveling for a living you never know how well a hotel/motel is set up for all your power needs. One of these can solve all your problems. And as a surge protector it can also protect all of your equipment too.
4,Good price does what's supposed to do.
5,Simple good value looks as shown sleek modern wish the cord was a bit longer. Otherwise would repurchase.
5,As expected. I do with the cord was a bit longer but is as described!
5,Needed one with a short cord. This fits the bill. Seems durable. Can't really go wrong with a power strip can you?
5,These work great. We even went through some bad storms where we lost power for three days. They did their job.
5,Very nice basic power strip/surge protector sturdy fits snugly into wall outlet; and my lamp plug and USB charging block fit snugly into its outlets. Very good product at a good price.
5,Lightweight both came in a single sturdy small box so you could keep the extra in storage. Works like a charm like I need it to!
5,I liked the product overall.  They work great and look good too.I used them to add outlets to my living room because I have a lot of electronics to charge and also my goldfish tank setup too.  Recommended!
5,I consider basic surge protection an absolute must for anything I wish to protect. As such this entrant from the Amazon Basics Line of electronic accessories comes up aces on price/performance. They are solidly built and suitable for well protecting everything up to those items so expensive: think large OLED screens and the like. The truth is these surge protectors will do the same job about equally as well as everything up to hard core power protection gear like Panamax several order of magnitude for pricey.
4,Two for a buck more than the price of one (which itself is very inexpensive)! Four stars not five because they are a bit less hefty than "name" brands. (Some might consider this a feature not a bug.) In any event with the Amazon Basics brand I have no worries that they might fail since a return is hassle-free.
5,Pack of 2 for $10? They work perfectly what a great deal! Would buy again. Plus Amazon has good customer service if they ever stopped working.
4,I should have noticed these have a short cord.  Otherwise fully servicable.  Though some others may handle more surge power they usually are more expensive also.  I bought 4 sent 2 back.
5,Good device good priceSolid and works as design for a good price.
4,The product is really good the extension cable feels pretty small which connects to the power outlet.
4,I didn’t read the product info 🤦🏻‍♂️Cord is really short
4,I thought I got a good deal on these surge strips but now I see the price has gone down below $10. Wow! That's a good price for these strips. What I like most is the orientation of the plugs. Each strip will easily accommodate 6 AC adapters.
5,Price on these power strips were good and they work with no issues. I’ve had them for quite some time now and they’re still good as new.
5,You get what you pay for in this case Amazon has come up with a decent cost efficient product for areas that may have an annual power surge.  Would I want to use these in an area where power surges happen with any kind of frequency? No because they would get fried to quickly. In my area though they serve their purpose well and if they die to save my electronics I will happily purchase another set!
3,If you want affordable (cheap) surge protector power strips then you will get a better deal here than even going to w...mart. These work and save you cash. You can never have enough of them.
5,It has been so helpful and works great! Easy to set up and accommodating all my plug ins. The best thing is if a circuit blows I have only to flip the lighted switch on the product and everything goes back to normal.
5,Overall these are great . i feel a little bit better knowing that they have a surge protector. The cords are short about 2feet. Really good for the price
4,These are a nice basic power strip to have more plugs with.  Very helpful.
5,I have a lot of these.  Love them.  The cord is very tough cannot really be bent but the plug works perfectly!
5,They work as expected.  Not sure why I had to rate the WiFi signal for a power cord though.
5,These are basic good quality plugs and a lighted switch is a must.  I prefer the black as they are easier to blend in.
5,Great general surge protectors for general u se. Gets the job done. Not expensive either. Not sure of WiFi signal. Great job Amazon basics!!!
4,Feels flimsy but I’ve been using it for a while and no problems!
4,Remarkably like power strips. They act so much like power strips you would think that they actually were power strips. Oh wait... They are power strips. Good quality inexpensive and unbelievably convenient if you already have a Prime Membership.
5,I needed a power strip. It does the job. I now have a spare for when I need another (which will happen at some point in time)
5,They definitely act exactly as what they are designed for. Wish the cords were a smidge longer but overall I like it. It has the power on off switch enough outlets on the strip and it comes in the combo pack. Overall I really like this.
5,These are great surge protectors. I didn't want the long bulky cords that most have. It is just the right length and i can plug in all my electronics. Great buy!
5,I actually did not realize that this was a 2 pack till I received the item. Great price for 2! Great length to use for my indoor Christmas village.
4,Good for the price
4,These 6 outlet surge protectors are nothing but solid build through and through. Made with great quality materials and parts no issues at all after months of using all 6 outlets on both 24/7. Great Product! Highly Recommend!
2,The instruction manual says:"This device features an internal protection that will disconnect the surge protective component but will maintain power to the load --now unprotected/If this situation is undesirable for the application follow the manufacturer's instructions for replacing the device."I bought this device to replace my last surge protector after it got fried during a power surge.  I am glad that it was the $5 surge protector that got fried and not the three electronic devices attached to it that would have cost me $500 to replace. With this new device the outcome would have been the reverse. So yes I returned these surge protectors to Amazon. Two stars for the ability to plug in 6 devices.
5,I use this every day to light my shed and haven't had any issues.  I really just have a couple lights plugged into it and have had no issues.
5,Compact and lightweight. It doesn't take much room in a suitcase or backpack. I wouldn't use them for everyday usage at home though.
4,If you need a ling cord extension this is not for you
4,Simply put an effective power strip. Small which suited my purposes in this instance. The cord is short but again that's what I wanted. Crucially the power switch lights up when it's on. DOes what I need it to do.
5,I haven’t had any issues with these. I really like that you get two because I can always use another!
5,Would be better if the outlets were turned 90 degrees. Dont get this to plug in transformer/adapters its only good for regular cords due to the layout.
4,Short cord length but excellent price.
4,Cord too short.
5,Got these and they are very decent for their price. Full of electronics so I needed it. I would buy AmaznoBasics again! They pick out some good quality stuffs as usual.
4,These have worked very well however I was able to find these for less at a local big box home improvement store. I won't return them because they accomplish the task and having them shipped certainly saved time! The cords are long enough for my needs but I have seen others with greater distance than these so be sure to measure.
4,Seems to be just what I needed. Sturdy.
5,i only needed one of them but since a box came with 2 i got an extra for whenever
5,Length is as advertised but shortly than I imagined. Guess I should have measured before buying! Works fine.
3,These are great.  I don't use them as surge protectors since these are minimal protectors.  I use them as on/off switches for electronics that I don't want powered on all the time.  Some people do not like lighted on/off switches but I bought these mainly for the lights because I want to know if the device is on or off.Update:  The lighted switch on all of the surge protectors on all eight that I bought are either blinking or faded already.  The light on the "protected" indicator is going strong though.
5,These are great for the price. Some surge protectors can cost a bundle but these perform just as well. I bought a few of these for the house because my nephew had his xbox iPod and TV connected to one of those skinny extension cords. I knew that was a fire waiting to happen but these surge protectors are now giving me some peace of mind. Will definitely buy again.
4,It does the job
5,With exactly as advertised. I like that the power breaker is not sensitive so when moving it doesn’t flip off accidentally. Perfect. Cheap.
5,I knew it was a 2' cord because I read the info. It is exactly what the description says it is. Good quality. If I need more I'll order these because they are just fine.
4,Decent low end power strips. You cant complain much about the price for a two-pack.  Just be aware of the specs and what you should and shouldn’t connect to these rated strips.
4,too many cords needed for all the electronics we nave today. What would we do without powerb strips
5,Used one for our computer and printer and the other for our TV and componets.  Worked out perfect for my needs.
5,It’s a good price for both itemsSo far they are  excellent no complain about this product
2,It worked well… for 15 months.  Your mileage may vary.
4,I failed to realize the 2 foot length of this power strip. I bought these to extend to the outlet behind my bed to be accessible from the night stands.  Unfortunately these were too short for this purpose.  Otherwise great product.
5,Cord is a good length for items spaced about 3 feet apart. All outlets work and I’ve had no problems with either strip. I’m using the second one as a backup since I didn’t need it right away.
5,I probably should have gotten the three foot cable but these are fine. If you get the two foot cable consider mounting the unit so it doesn't slide around due to the tension from a short cable.
4,My bad I should have read description closer. These aren't very practical but they will do for now.
5,I didn't erven realize I was getting two!  I couldn't be happier!
4,They are black and have lots of holes in them.  Oh and they even power your stuff if you plug them in.Standard power strip no frills or bells and whistles but work great.  If you need to protect your stuff its is well worth the money.
2,I ordered this item because I needed a power strip for a particular location in my house and I've always been pleased with the quality and value of AmazonBasics products. When the order arrived there was a sheet of paper in the box stating that the product cannot be used within 30 feet of an electrical service panel (no explanation of why that's the case). This limitation was not mentioned on the product page on Amazon. Of course the whole reason I purchased the item is because I need to plug in several devices along a wall in my basement that happens to be the same wall where the electrical panel is. Very frustrating. The item is inexpensive enough that it's not worth the trouble to send it back so I guess I'll put it away until I need a power strip elsewhere in the house. Meanwhile I need to keep searching for a product that can actually be used in the place where I need to use it.
5,These work well was a bit disappointed in the cord length I like mine to be a bit longer.  Worth the money and do the job I purchased for.
5,Very well made power strip. Comes in handy with all of the electronic set ups we have throughout the house.
5,As with any inexpensive power strip I'm not sure I would rely on this to protect my 4k television but I always have a need for smaller power strips and at the price these are a really good deal for two.
5,Both surge protectors work perfectly.  Such a great deal.  Can't beat 2 for 1!
4,The wire is really really stiff and the back of the strip only comes with 2 thumbtack holes (that are a little too big) compared to 4 holes my old power strip has.Lightweight and does it’s job however.
4,It does what I need it to
5,Used for new medical monitors equipment for Pacemaker and remote vitals sent to VA in Temple Tx. Just right for my power needs! Great power outlets!
5,It lets you have power to your devices are on the chargers so that you can and allow you to  charge my phone and my tablet and my laptop
5,Use them on TV's and other things subject to storm surge.
5,Basic. Cheap. Perfect. I used it for my Christmas village during the holidays with no problems! It does exactly what it should without spending a fortune!
4,Excellent surge protectors. I cannot attest to the effectiveness of its surge protection but I can say on the outside they're fairly well built for the price I paid. The only wish I have for this product is that the cord was a bit longer but that's something an extension cord can solve easily.
4,good product great value for the price
2,The light on the on/off switch works but none of the outlets work.
5,I haven't had issues with many AmazonBasics products and this is no exception. Works as it should.
5,After researching slightly about power strips I discovered that a lot of cheaper ones do not actually protect what is plugged in them.  I went off of other reviewers suggestions and so far I am very happy with these.  I like the black color too.
5,I liked that it was very durable. I also liked that it came with 2 of em. The only thing i wish is that i ordered one that was a little bit more longer(the cord).
4,Quality is a bit sketchy (one arrived dead - had to request a replacement).  Cord could be longer.  Nevertheless they're decent for the price.  Great for use in a pinch.
4,These came as described however I did not realize that the short cord would bother me so much. This is a great product however. I do recommend it if you don't need an extended cord.
4,Does what it’s supposed to do.
4,Works fine. Over all just fine
5,As basic as it gets. Power cord for a good price. Nuff said.
5,So far I haven’t had any power surges so I can’t say what happens then but these are great for plugging a bunch of stuff in at the same time! The cord length was just what I needed and I purposely chose this one for the direction of the outlets. Great buy!
4,It seems that we have more and more cords for the house these days. I am using one for the multiple cords for the computer room and the other one for the gaming system for the children.The price can't be beet for the pair. They work as they should. Delivery was prompt.
5,This is a good power strip and the cord is longer than most in this price range.The housing is sturdy and feels firm when plugging and unplugging.  This does not feel like an el-cheapo power strip.
5,My old surge Power Strip didn't work anymore. These are best price out there.Work great
4,For the price paid would rate these 4.5 stars if could. Not a 5 star product but then again hard to find two surge protector strips for $10.Only wish they were a bit longer so the plugs could have more separation. Would make these strips so much more useful.
5,Hey its a power strip right? It works as designed.
5,Good value for these cant find any complaintsNorthRustic.com
2,I just got these and they work fine for basic plugging things in but if you want to mount one of these using the mount holes on the back you are going to have some problems. Internally there is a small piece of plastic that will stop the screw head from sliding into the slot (See first picture). I spent about 10 minutes trying to get these mounted before I realized this. Another ten minutes and I was able to disassemble the power strip use a utility knife and some needle nose pliers and perform some minor surgery to remove the unnecessary piece of plastic (second picture) re-assemble and now the power strip mounts just fine (Last picture). I'll still use these becasue they were cheap and now that I've fixed them I shouldn't have any more problems but it is annoying that the product design group didn't bother trying to slide any screws into the screw slots otherwise they would have realized this issue.
5,Good! Just has not been tested for a power outage yet so idk about the surge protector and how good it is. But works like any other power cord.
4,Definite quality.  HOWEVER the dang cord is so short I thought about ‘daisy-chaining’ them but instead am trying to find one with longer plug cord!
4,Inexpensive surge protectors.  Don't expect good protection but it is adequate.  They provide a better value than the cheap ones found at the Home Depot and they are black instead of beige.
4,Exactly what it is supposed to be very cheap price but the cord to connect it to the wall is just a bit short It is only like 1-2 feet long.
5,Power strips are very useful and super important for your electronics. But did you know that over time they lose their protective properties? So if you've had yours a while say 5 to 10 years it's time to get new ones and these are very nice.
5,Cord is perfect length. I’ve had problems with these causing shorts in the last but not with this one!
5,Works great. Only thing is it lights up and it's rather bright so consider that if you're going to be sleeping next to it.
5,Fitted on the wall beside the outlet behind wall mounted TV. No more hanging wires.
5,Great value. I use one in the living room and one in my bedroom. The outlets on my walls sometimes spark when I plug things in (its a really old house) Using these fixes that problem so I feel much safer plugging in my laptop and phone. Would recommend!
4,simple yet efficient outlets. I need some simple long outlets for some space heaters during winter. The surge protection was my main reason for this purchase. Holds up well and great deal for the price.
5,Obviously these don’t offer any real surge protection. Great outlet extender and very cheap!
5,You cannot beat the price for the quality.I have my gaming PC And my computerized sewing machine plugged into these.The cord length isn’t that long however.
5,For what it is it's good. I wouldn't trust Amazon products for everything but their everyday use electronics like this are reliable and affordable.
3,When trying to mount using the keyhole slots with screws they are not designed to fully slide a screw to the top of the keyhole making for a weak mount.
5,I have two computers hooked up to this surge protector and it has already done its job admirably. Had a power surge second day I ogt it from someone hitting a power pole and it saved both computers .
5,Perfect for what I needed. For the money I knew I wasn't getting top of the line. I just needed more protected outlets.
5,I was so worried when I got these because they seem so cheaply made and you hear a lot of horror storage about cheap outlets. But these do really well. I’ve been using them for a year now and haven’t had a single problem.
5,Works great! I have one in every room in my house!
5,Only complaint would be they did knock first and just left outside in the open...for these items not such a big deal but for more expensive items it would be
5,These work well for travel. For home I would like a longer cord. Not everything reaches an outlet so I really wouldlike longer cords on things.
4,I didn't think it would be this short. It's good if you need extension cord just only to maximize the number of outlets.
4,I got these  for  clock radio and lamps and various low power accessories the cords gave me a little more flexibility in placement so I did not need an extension  cord for each one.  For my purposes they work fine.
5,Only needed one but these were basically two for the price of one from other companies. Does its job and I like the black matte finish to them. I wouldn't recommend putting expensive electronics on them though
5,These surge protectors are a good buy for me. Like that they're black.
4,work great. Thank you
5,Great deal great price. No troubles with either cord they are exactly what we needed and what they are described as.
4,Good
4,The sockets are very snug so you have to push your cord in very heavily. However it keeps your cords plugged in... Short cord.Feels cheap and lightweight. But for the price definitely worth it.
5,I love Amazon Basics products I find them to be great quality for the price. These surge protectors worked out well and solved problems with limited outlets for electronics in our house. Great low cost solution and can't tell the difference between these and more expensive surge protectors I have purchased in the past.
4,The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating os because the length of the power cord is considerably short!
5,I loke the 2ft cord length works well with where I need to use it.. Also lile yhe fact of the surge protection.
5,I’ve had these for about two years now and they are still going strong.
5,Great price for what I needed. I recently moved and did not have enough outlets in my bedroom. Home Depot did not have nearly as good of deal as this so I’m havppy to have found an affordable price for what I needed.
5,I didn't realize that there were 2 in a pack so it was a good surprise for the price. I have been using them for a while now and have had no problems. They work great and were a good deal!
5,It was a good power strip for the price. Nothing exciting but works as intended! Quality Product.
5,So far we've just used one of these outlets and it's worked excellently. I needed it for my childs room to get all of the cords out of her reach. It is a little touch to put in plugs and remove but I like that it's that durable. It does it's job very nicely.
5,Luckily haven't had to test the surge protection but it's cheap and works fine as a basic power strip. Hopefully I'll never find out if the surge protection works ... or maybe it already has????
4,Does a great job I just wish the power cable was a tad bit longer as it tends to hang instead of touch the ground but its not that much of an annoyance just a personal preference. Well built and worth the price.
4,Perfect for what I needed them for. So far haven’t experienced a power surge to really test them yet but we will see
5,Delivery was not a problem.And it is working like a charm.
4,Arrived quick works great
5,GREAT price for this item! I've purchased power strips with surge protectors from other stores for $20 for one and these were $10 for two. I will probably purchase more in the future. They're very sturdy feeling and arrived packaged well. I see no difference between them and the more expensive types. They do their job and for cheap!
5,The two of these cost the same as 1 almost anywhere else.  It wasn't too expensive so I took the gamble half expecting some type of crazy inferior product.  I'm not an electrician or anything but they seem great to me.
5,These power strips are exactly what you would expect and get the job done. No complaints just a nice and well priced office accessory.
5,I got these to gather my electronics into one socket.  It works fine.  Easy to use and comes with surge protection and option to use 3-prong electronics.  I highly recommend this product.  Great job Amazon!
4,Cheap surge protectors seems to do their job at least as making more outlets. Haven't had a power surge so I can't confirm that they actually work for protection. But good for the money I am sure.
4,A little bit more space between outlets would be nice. I end up only using half of the outlets because they get partially covered.
4,Needs longer cord by 1’.
5,Well I ordered it knowing it was 2'.  So when they showed up and it was 2' and not long enough.. Ooops  my bad.Otherwise they appear to be exactly as advertised.
4,Works fine
5,I love these power strips! As someone who has a million things plugged in all the time I love that I can use these and know my systems are safe when the power flickers on and off.
5,very durable.I like that there is a light on the “on” switch to indicate that it is ready. This also makes it easy because you don’t have to unplug everything just push the switch to turn everything off.
5,These do the trick - I always buy a 2 pack we need them all the time for vacation trips - too much stuff to charge
5,Sometimes you worry when something is cheaper than the other options. I thought the quality of these were as good as any other brand I have had.
3,it doesnt lay flat on the floor the cord of 2 feet is too short.  Needs a few more inches for a standard wall outlet
5,I like these for simple little surge protectors. Been using them for like 6 months with no issues.
5,I like these outlets and will be ordering more until every device has it's own home to drink it's electrons..I love that these provides some protection for devices since the grid around here can be unstable at times.Not sure that I need an OFF-ON switch on these but it's almost free..
4,Inexpensive and both of them worked as expected. Knocked a start because the plastic feels rather cheap so I expect a bad drop or accident could crack the plastic casing rather than the plastic having some flex to it.
4,Works great smallish footprint. I wish the cord was one or two feet longer.
5,Good product except I didn’t consider the cord length when ordering for my workbench. Remember “measure twice order once”.
5,I like these and have ordered multiple sets.  The cords are a bit short for my needs but adequate.  They operate as expected and I have had no issues to speak of.
5,Useful item to protect surge on computers plug in
5,i had no problem with the 4 that i received.  they worked great for me. and i'm shore they will work great for you too. and they arrived before the date i was given. give them a try
5,I wish the cord was longer but it works and has 6 prongs so I don’t have much to complain about
4,It's a twin pack they work.
5,While the 3' length is great for some uses I find a 4 or 5 foot length ideal but six too many...
4,can not complain for the price
5,It works very good. I have one for my video game and the other for my aquarium. It works great. I highly recommend it.
5,I needed something cheap and effective to plug in my speakers PC lamp and wifi router into. This one does the job perfectly. It is cheap and effective. There are some reviews talking about how if it trips it has to be manually switched back on. At the price I bought it for I could live with that.
5,Perfecto para la casa y no tener todo conectado directamente a corrii
5,What else can I say other then it is a working 6-outlet surge protector?If my house gets struck by lightning I'll make sure to keep the community updated and check whether the surge protector worked or not.
5,For the price and what you get this is a great deal. I like that they’re black. They look good and get the job done. Will buy again (maybe with a longer chord.)
5,The length of the cord is okay enough to use with 2ft of a distance. Well made.
5,fine quality low price.  All you need unless you have some really really high-end electronics
4,Real good for basic usage but cable a bit too short
5,This is a good deal for the two power strips. Exactly as described. Works well. Good quality.
5,Good price for two. Gave one to my sister.
4,Can't go wrong with black color. But a longer cord cud help.
4,Great as most Amazon basic products are but the cord is only 2 feet long. This is something I did not notice before purchase. I can work around this problem.
5,The quality is very good the price is affordable the courier brother is even more powerful.
4,Does what it says it does. But I wish the cable was a bit longer.
5,This item Works and the only reason I’ve left this note is Amazon requires it for a review.
5,These are your basic surge protectors.  Same quality as can be had everywhere.  They were cheap and came in a two-pack.  I bought four.  What's not to like?  I have one computer at home that's super high value/priority and I have it on a more expensive system and a UPS.  For all the little desktops and things these are perfect.
5,I am very happy with the Amazon Basics 6-Outlet Surge Protectors.I just wish I had ordered them with the longer cor.I have the two foot cord and I just could have used it longer. Other than that they are fine. I had to update so this is what I ordered.
5,Not much to say about a surge protector strip.  It works well the cord is a good length and you really can't beat the price.
5,Just what I needed at a reasonable price
5,Purchased based on the fantastic reviews. Can’t beat the price. I assumed the cord was longer......it is my fault for not looking! Pay attention to cord length.Would definitely recommend!
5,These work just fine with no issues. I've had many demanding things (work lights + heat gun) plugged in and these held up just fine.
4,Great product perfect price. Have has some storms and no issues
5,These quality surge protectors have a red light “protected” button/switch and 25 inches of cord/plug length to allow access for any wall switch as well as a rear opening for wall hanging. The Amazon price for two was unbeatable.
4,It is good to have the switchbut the line is too short
3,Just a basic power strip but pay attention to the cord length. I didn't and was unhappy to realize that it's actually too short for the use I had in mind. In fact the cord is shorter than on any other surge protector/power strip that I own and too short for most purposes here. It was my mistake to not look closer at the specs but if cord length matters for whatever purpose you have in mind maybe this review will help you avoid making that same mistake.
4,Todo bien gracias
5,Works fine so far no issues although when I unboxxed it both of them had a lot of dust and debris on them like they were in a garage tho kinda was weird but I just brushed it off and they look and work fine
5,Works good. Baby protection on the 110VAC sockets. USB outlets are part of this power strip as well. The spacing of the outlets are turned to have large body power adapters facing to the side of the power strip.
5,I love this 2 pack. It has been so long since I've used surge protectors that had a power light on them these surge protectors look very good. The black color is a nice touch where I'm using them they match my decor
3,The cord is fairly short and has come unplugged one time as it's slightly loose but other than that works as described.
4,The power cord is a little bit short
5,When I care about surge protection I buy a UPS for $45 (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0030SL08A/).  Any other time I buy one of these things.  They are extremely durable.  At our office with over $100 of them we have never broken one.
5,This is a very good surge protector for two in the box the only problem with them is that the cord could be about a foot longer
5,All of my TV equipment and modem and what else is hooked into this. Works fine. I like that it is thin and easy to hide. I have not traveled with it but am sure that would work.
5,I needed these for a craft show booth and these were perfect!  Love the shorter cords on them so no extra cords to trip over.
5,Really good double set Health extension bars. Works great I've had no problem I love the on and off switch.
5,Perfect surge protector does exactly what it should do for a very reasonable price no complaints!
5,Works like any other decent power cord. No major issues cone to mind while using it and the cord itself seems pretty durable.
5,I use them all over the house and have peace of mind when I leave outta town because I know my electronics are protected in case of a lightning storm.
2,FAILED out of the blue.Picked up two of these as extras since we all run out of outlets with the number of small devices we need to keep plugged in charge up etc. One of these was merely doing minimal duty of supplying power to four wall warts for ipods and what not. Family informs me devices are dead ...  The strip has the red light on power switch on ... zero power on any of the six outlets??? Tried two multimeters power indicator and outlet tester. Switch on off. Different wall outlet in a different room. No dice. The lights on the strip are on but six outlets totally dead.Surprising failure to me that has me concerned about the other one .... as I have had a multitude of these things over the course of decades and even old ones keep on working just fine.
5,AmazonBasics strikes again! Like all of the other tech/audio/video cables that I've purchases from Amazon via their in-house store brand AmazonBasics I've been nothing but happy with the quality AND the price of their tech cords and accessories. These surge protector work great and appear to be standard quality and have worked flawlessly for me thus far.
4,Easy to use
5,Works as it should. Would buy again
5,Love it. Does what is suppose to do. Also added some command strips on the wall and it supports it. The cable is soft which is like. You can tell it is good quality!
4,Cord length is shorter than I expected.
5,Good product. Bought these twice now and am still impressed with the value
5,This package of 2 power strips are exactly what I was looking for. Cord is just long enough & work excellent!! Great value for the $ which makes me very happy 😃
5,This is a great surge protector. I'm glad there are two! Great for the price.
5,Had this 2-pack of surge protectors for a few months now and have yet to encounter any issues.At the current price-point ($11) I'd easily recommend these to anyone in need of a couple more affordable power strips.
5,What more could you want?  Except more!  Very functional.  No wonder Amazon is taking over the world.
5,This is a great item!  A fair price for 2 Surge Protector Power Strips and made well thank you!
4,One did stop working after a year or so but I’ve bought them in the past and they’ve worked just fine
5,These are the most basic surge protector 6-outlet adapters you can buy.They feature none of the expensive frills such as Ethernet/Phone surge suppression battery backup or super joule ratings but they are the exactly what you need when you just need some power and don't want to spend 30+ dollars for that very basic need.Do you need some more power outlets? excellent look no further.
5,This is an excellent purchase. I am more than happy. I am satisfied. I recommend to anyone for extra power strips.
5,These are so handy! To use behind TV's Or couches. Its always nice to have one or two on hand!
5,Works well for what I need them for. Really nice that they can turn on and off without needing to unplug
5,I don't really know how to review these things. They were well-priced and exactly what I wanted. They're solidly made power strips. I've used them for a few months now with no issues.
5,It was nice to find a reasonably priced black surge protector outlet. I have black end tables. I zip tied these to the table legs so that they are not laying on the floor collecting dust as well as making them more assesible to use.
4,The cord could be a little bit longer.
4,This works well but the cord is super short. I should have read the description better. Besides this no issues!
5,Perfect for the price. Can’t go wrong if you’re looking for well made cheaply priced and convenient outlet surge.
4,It works as it should. The switch lights up to indicate on/off. The plastic does not feel the most robust.
4,Works well
5,It's a power strip. Works well. Great price.
4,N/a
4,Alright
5,They were cheap and the only thing wrong is the cord length. They don't go very far but they have lots of plug-ins.
5,The cord is shorter than I needed but that’s my fault for not checking. The power strips however are excellent quality. I am keeping these and ordering the same ones with a 6’ cord.
5,fair price easy to use and good quality
5,We love the ease of grabbing a surge protector for travel or work. These are fantastic and handy!
5,Seems well constructed and does its job
3,It works and great you get two of them - however on one of the strips all the plugs fall out constantly.  If for any reason it gets moved or if you move something that is plugged into the strip ALL the plugs fall out without any problems.  That is very annoying especially since it is the one we use for our lamp my cell phone and a salt lamp.  The other one doesn't have that issue.  They are inexpensive and a good deal if you're using for basic items.
4,Met expectations
3,I thought 2 feet would be enough but it's not. Everything works fine but the length. It's good for certain location in the house (underneath dresser side table) but not all. I will keep these but will also order longer ones.
5,Should have bought a long time ago instead of dealing with cheap crap
5,Use these in my dorm room!
4,Durable
3,Not what I expected quality wise but 3 stars for Amazon customer service. They will do for now.
5,It was delivered quickly. Just what the doctor ordered. Thx
4,This power strip works OK.  But one of them had a failed indicator light inside the power switch after only a few days so that's slightly disappointing.
4,It’s good for extra plug ins
4,i like how these turned out. solid functional and reliable. no problem with them after a month of use.
4,Seems fine. Don't skip the part in the description that specifies the length of the cable. It's only 2 feet.
3,Product arrived promptly and in good condition.  The outlets do not accept the size for a product I have.  It is a standard alarm clock yet the outlet is not long enough to accept one of the prongs from the plug in.  Otherwise the product seems to be working well and properly.  I do wish there would have been some disclaimer about it not accepting that particular size of plug in.
4,Nothing fancy or exceptional. Just a basic strip which seems to work just fine
5,This seems very well-made and works great. Very good product ar a reasonable price.
5,Perfect for the my home office
4,Wish they were still in black but hey they do the job as needed for a good price.  Good to protect electronics with.
5,As always Amazon has done a great job with a basic product. Works perfectly! I have had this plugged in for a few months now and have had no issues with it.
5,Arrived as scheduledConvenient way to receive him essentials during COVID 19
4,I would have hoped if the cord was a couple of feet longer.  But still a good item.
4,that cord is just as short as you think it is and they show you so its only good for certain uses. otherwise its exactly what they advertise.
4,Working well
2,I bought two of these in 2016.  Two of the outlets on one of the strips do not work.  At times an unsettling electrical crackling noise sometimes emanates from this same strip.  The other outlets do work and the second strip does work.  One other thing I don't like is that they do not sit flush on the floor--the base of the strip twists with the cord causing it to be on its side or nearly upside down.  I adjust them but they find their way back to this position over time.  Not a huge deal but I do prefer not to have all the cords and plugs buried in the carpet under my TV.  Not the best product.
4,Another great product from Amazon. Shipped and delivered on time. The only issue was the mounting slots on the back could be a little deeper. Could not get them to snap on snug over the screw heads very tightly. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars
4,The cord length is small and the points seems pretty congested.
4,Works great
5,2 Protector power for $11 is a good deal. I bought it some days ago and it is serving good. It can hold up to 4 devices for plugging in. Overall a good product at an affordable price.
4,Good but quality isn't the best. Seems like it will last for a while. Just don't step on it.
5,Highly recommend all Amazon basics products.
5,We have about 15 of these around the office and they are a good value and work well.
5,Worked for my needs.  The short cord cleaned up some cord-clutter and added a bit of surge protection from where there was none before.  Feels even just a little bit better than having a power tap only.  Indicator light is a plus to show the protection is still working.
4,Works fine. Only thing is that these surge protectors feel sort of cheap and flimsy. If you're looking to protect thousands of dollars worth of electronics or equipment I wouldn't trust these. But for everyday chargers and lamps they seem to get the job done.
4,It works fine & good quality but only thing bothers me is that cord “It’s too short”
5,Does the trick. Functional and inexpensive. Well built.
5,I bought them because I needed short cords.  Be careful if you want a power strip with long cords.
4,Cord is a bit on the short side so keep that in mind for the spot that you're thinking of using this. Otherwise it works great.
5,Needed a surge protector and with this i got two for the price of one! Not very heavy so if you dont want it to move you might want to use double sided tape or mount it with screws.
4,Good heavy duty items. The cords are very stiff and could be a little longer.
5,This a good quality product for less price. Works great and the material is strong and durable for sure.
5,this is a power strip. A power strip (also known as an extension block power board power bar plug board trailing gang trailing socket trailer lead and by many other variations) is a block of electrical sockets that attaches to the end of a flexible cable (typically with a mains plug on the other end) allowing multiple electrical outlits.
5,Works great. Need to order some extra
5,good price for the 2 pack. I've only used one for my pellet stove and it's perfect.
3,We purchased this and it worked for 2 days... It was slow to turn on after plugging in and I had just thought maybe that is what it was supposed to do. Well anyway 2 days later the light on the Surge protector went very dim and now the surge protector is dead... I plugged in the other one since it was a 2 pack and it seems to work fine...
5,Good quality at a fair price. I hope the surge protection feature works well but I haven't had a chance to find out hopefully I never will! But they do give me some peace of mind!
4,Real handy to have around. Good for the price. I only wish that the plugs faced 90 degrees from where they are now. if you have multiple power supplies to plug in you could only get 2 or 3 of them on this power strip.
5,I thought I bought two but I ended up with 4. but nonetheless. I am very happy with them. I could set up my streaming set up I  one place.
5,Nicely made great value.Would definitely recommend.
4,Good enough for college dorm room. No issues at all for the few months I've been using them. Only con is that the cord is very short.
5,It serve the purpose it was. Just enough. For all the plugs I wanted to put in it.
5,I haven't had access to my car and needed some cables like these so that I could have a lamp on my desk halfway across the room. They seem to do the job!
5,Amazing for in home use plastic quality seems poor but after one year usage with 220v no issues appeared.
5,Definitely worth the cost. They don't feel as cheaply made as my bars from Wal-Mart despite costing much less. They havent shorted out despite constant use since purchase running my fish tanks.
5,simple and works good deal.
5,I am using these to organize the cords under the desk and also I use in my sewing room to use with machine and various lighting.  Received on time packaged well and as described.
5,These were very reasonably priced which is frankly why I ordered them. the cord is a little short for my liking but works for what I needed it for.
5,This power strip is excellent and coupled with its surge protection capability it is an excellent choice to use at home and in the office. I bought several and have used them at each workstation to hook up several devices.
4,Works well. Nice to have two for back up.
5,I only needed one surge protector but was pleasantly pleased when I received two of them. Now I have a spare which I will always find a use.
4,Nice adapter but I wish I realized how short 3 ft actually is as my only complaint is it’s limited reach.
5,Delivered really fast.  Ordered and received 2.  The cords are short.
5,Just what we were expecting. Fast professional shipping and packing.
5,Great value and quality.  I've only had these for a few weeks but they seem to be very sturdy and well made.  I like how the "Protected" LED indicator is separate from the power switch LED.
4,Cords are terribly short
4,Does the job wish the cords were just a tad longer and that the plugs were right angle but at this price point I can't really complain.
5,They work great and are thick and sturdy.  I like the cord length. Also the many outlets.
5,I'm no electrical expert so I am not able to measure amps or anything like that but these work well. The build quality is good I connect my laptop charger heater and phone charger all on this strip. So when they are all charged/ it's time to leave I just flick the switch and turn everything off.
5,Does what is supposed to
5,These are great! No complaints
5,These powerstrips have been great so far. My only warning is that the light on them is very bright so if you are very sensitive to light at night in your room this could be a problem for you. Even then nothing a little bit of tape can't fix !
5,I got these surge protectors to protect my television and other electronics during a power surge in a storm.  They are not  bulky and are easy to fasten in the wall and support the items I plug into them.  I wish I had gotten some that are a little longer which would have been more convenient to reach my electrical outlets.
5,They work the way that they're supposed to.
5,I needed a basic surge protector for my new computer.  These work just as well as the more expensive ones.
4,Length of the wire is short Still worth it to use at this price tag.
5,Worked perfect. We have both being used in multiply rooms and they work great.
5,Arrived fast.  Works as expected.
5,Aunque aun no lo pruebo completamente pero se ve consistente aunque el cordon de enchufe es muy corto.
5,These are a great price and work exactly as expected. I like that they're white and not ivory like most. No reason to spend more for basic household items. I do have a more expensive surge protector with a guarantee for my computer router etc though.
5,Not much to say these are standard surge strips. They work fine.
5,I know some of you had problems but I bought 2 pairs and they all are working fine.  Maybe some manufacture problem on some batches.  Luckily mine are perfect.  Best regards
4,Does the job it’s intended to do. AmazonBasics does it again. Would have liked 6” more coed BUT it’s a first world problem.
4,great
5,Before you buy make sure to measure the distance between your electronic outlet and your product. The cord may not be long enough to go around corner.
4,I liked the price but the cord was way to short. I know Amazon says the cord length and it is as advertised that is my one problem with them. Other wise a great product at a great price.
5,great price. It’s one of the amazon Choice too so it can’t go wrong!
5,Will buy again.
4,Good but cord lenth is too short
5,Since it's AmazonBasics I always stick with the same general synopsis. Amazon brand affordable works. In this case nothing has blown up so I'm good to go. Use one for home networking (routers and modems). Use one for my bedroom for my Echo Dot and charging mobile devices.Does it's job. What else do you want?
5,Seem to work fine. Low joules rating so I'm not plugging anything precious into these. Getting the higher rates surge protectors for my computer. These are great for chargers electric pencil sharpener and the modem owned by the cable company.
5,Surge protectors arrived promptly and exactly as described in product review.
4,Works well so far. Fits phone screen fairly well. Worth the price and was fairly easy to apply.
4,Holes to hang them up suck
4,The product is great and works well. However I wish they did not exaggerate the length of the cord. I did buy this thinking the cord was longer. But it's not a big deal.
4,Very basic short cabled surge protectors. If you're short on outlets these help tremendously and the two ppack is reasonably priced compared to what you'll likely pay for just one out at a brick and mortar store.
5,Perfect for where we need them and it's awesome they come in a 2 pack.
5,Nicely made good price packed well and worked easily right out of the box.  I had some problems with an old electrical outlet so it was nice to upgrade to something newer and nicer.
5,Bought these for our new house to replace some very old power strips we were using. So far we've had no issues. Affordable option and I prefer the black color
5,Amazon makes great products. Save the money and go with a Amazon branded products.
5,Cheap and does the job. I ordered this multiple times when I needed more outlets. I just wish there was more space between the outlets or that they were offset so the adapters wouldn’t take up unnecessary space.
4,Good
5,Perfect size for a bedroom
5,Great product for when you need a power strip. Got them for my classroom and work for what I needed.
3,It has two typical keyhole slots in the back for mounting.  But the slots are so shallow that no screw head known to man will fit in there.  How am I supposed to mount this?I mean sure you can never have too many power strips and it's nice that this basic two-pack is available.  But there's nothing worse than an unsecured power strip that flops over on its side when you need it or thwarts your best efforts to route power cords neatly.  Sigh.
5,These were better than I expected them to be Very good price on a quality product. I'll be buying many more of them soon because they are definitely worth it. Great value!
3,They have worked without any problems except the ones that didn't work when they arrived but amazon handled it with such ease that I didn't have to worry about a thing
5,Great product at great price just wish the cords were slightly longer... but otherwise great stuff
5,I don't understand y 1 of the ratings asked about wifi. But I like them.
4,long enough
5,Exactly what I needed came quickly and these are white not off white like some of the reviews say. Also surge protected which is a bonus!
4,The space between plug is too close from one to another. I can only use 3 of them.
4,Headline says it all.
4,Perfect size works great!
5,Upgrading from the old gray giant strips. These are much better.  My only gripe is the cords are shorter so when you plug it in it may not sit flat on the floor. But hey that's not enough to knock off a star.
5,I really needed to consolidate my many electric items. This was perfect for my breakfast nook. I will buy more for around the house.
5,These are a good buy comes in handy for traveling and even for an extra outlet without a lot of cords
5,I've bought over 6 of these power strips and they all work flawlessly.  There's absolutely nothing different about them from the competition other than the very reasonable price.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
5,Working good wanted to update some older power strips I feel them to make sure they are not getting hot my older strips were just several years old and would be warm from constant use I have the same items plugged into these and cool to the touch will  purchase more to replace other strips
5,The cord is on the short side but that's my fault for not paying attention to the specs. It does what it is intended to do and for the price I'm pretty happy.
5,Seems to be working well   Ready to order two more to make a total of six
5,Hides wellAnd if exposed it’s matches most other items in my hone
5,I bought these for travel. We pack one of these in each of our suitcases when we are traveling so we are sure we will have outlets near the bed to plug in all of our electronics.
5,Good product for the money. Something I would stock up on for home and travel.
5,Works perfectly as expected
5,Half the battle.  Thanks for all the hard work during the pandemic.
5,These work well. Just wish the cord was a little longer.
5,Good value  good price
5,Super happy - packaged well and working just fine. I needed something slim to fit next to my desk and one to fit next to my nightstand. These fit the bill perfectly and the black more or less makes them disappear. Definitely durable not flimsy or cheap feeling. Worth the $12.
4,The only issue is that the cable from the plugs to the wall is shorter than I expected. It's maybe 2 3 feet? And I bought this so I could reach a hidden plug but it's not helping.
5,I just needed the outlets but not a very long cord this is perfect.
5,Excellent quality safe construction.  Used to satisfy my never ending need for additional AC outlets in my small apartment.
5,It is convenient but I wish the cord was a little longer. Otherwise it was a good buy!
5,Had for a few months now and it works great.
4,Basic  simple and a good deal!
5,I decided to wait until I have used these for a while before I said anything about them.  They are very good.  I find that they are durable and can withstand every socket being used for a long period of time.  The price alone should make you get them.
5,It’s good for the price and has held up pretty well
5,works great for multiple hookupsI used for all my tool charging for batteries
5,When you push the button power flows through the strip. That's about all I look for in a power strip.
5,Can’t have enough light is perfect to tell if it’s on!!
5,That red light is bright
5,Great value and gets the job done. Only change I'd like to see is a flat plug head that doesn't jut out so far but that's a minor quibble. AmazonBasics continues to be a go-to brand for me. Well done.
4,Decent surge protector plastic is a little cheap feeling does the job though
5,Great quality! Replaced my old ones that I got from our local hardware store. This one’s got surge protector built in it which I had to buy a separate unit for the same function for my old ones.
5,Best deal on surge protection. Looked for a while in big box stores. This is well worth it
3,Supposed to be one day delivery but received after 3 days! Very poor service.Quality and the feel when you look or hold the surge is Cheap. Hope it works fine and amazon basics wouldn’t disappoint me !!!
5,Use as a power outlet. Works good for what I bought it for.
5,I love these they were cheap and worked well.
5,Well made and durable I have purchased 4 of these and they work great. I'vent had any issue and nothing beats the price and quality of this product.
5,Only recently have I realized that life is much easier if you have power strips at almost every outlet in your house.  For charging and using electronic devices of course but also additional lights everywhere.  I have ordered and reordered these!  They work and I do not yet have enough!
5,Perfect for everyone and everywhere.
4,Works great so far. Good price for the product. I have had no problems and it came exactly as described.
5,It's a basic surge protector & power strip.  It does exactly what it's supposed to do for a good price.
5,My son's dorm looses power quite often so having these power cords have been really helpful with protecting his electronics. Good Quality for a great price
1,2 for the price I thought was good but this is cheaply made and unsafe. I cant believe Amazon is selling this as part of Amazon basics. plugged each one in and it got super hot and started to have a burning order. I should have read more of the reviews like I usually do. This can start a fire.
5,Love the product and the price. Simply wish the cord was longer. That part sucks.
5,Used this for Wall mount TV. Instead of buying expensive in-wall power cable with 2 ports bought the one with one power input and used this as an extension. Better and cheaper way. Now I can have 4 more things behind my TV with all wires hidden behind the TV - Chromecast Roku etc
5,The smaller size power strip helps with space economy.  I can put one in my overnight bag when traveling.  I have many devices to charge and plug in.  Works fine.
5,Works well as intended for the price.
5,Inexpensive reliable surge protector. 2' cord is a problem. but sometimes you just need more outlets near the original outlet.
5,Perfect cord length to put on the floor under a wall outlet. If you need extra outlets without the length of an extension cord and you like the black color you can’t go wrong with this.
5,After almost loosing my tv I decided it was time for one of these and it works great. We had a lot of electric storms down in Florida and this thing did the job
5,These are extras in the office.. need to buy more! they disappeared.  Good value
5,AmazonBasics always has some of the greatest technology. This works well in my office and my bedroom where I may occasionally use many outlets. There are no flaws in this product. I suggest you give it a chance.
5,What can we say? Amazon Basics are quality items for a phenomenal price. This has lasted us well sturdy and the plugs are perfectly sized so that things that are plugged in aren't always coming unplugged as with some other kinds. Great unit excellent price!
5,These are great definitely would recommendUpdate I ordered these in March 2019 it’s now oct 30th 2019 and they are still going strong now I super recommend them
5,Received as advertised. Great packaging! Thanks Amazon!  You can not beat this double deal package. Especially for the price! Amazon Basic Products in my opinion are the way to go!  So before purchasing certain products on Amazon type in Amazon Basics and give them a try! You will not be sorry!
5,They work. Can't speak on the surge protection as I've not had any surges yet but dont foresee a problem. My only mistake was not getting one with a longer cable. These were a little short for my needs but that is no fault of the product.
5,I shopped around on multiple websites to find the best price on basic six outlet surge protectors. The best price I found by far was this deal on Amazon. Why pay more for the same technology with a different brand name? I have been using these for months without any incidents. They were great and the price is even better.
4,Short cord
4,Works well so far. Had for about a month and hopefully they last for a while.
5,Came just as it appeared. I liked it was in twos as I was updating the house. Was read sturdy.
5,fast delivery works well. thanks
4,Feel a little cheap. When pushing the plug in the plastic has a decent bit of give. But they seem to work fine.
3,Cord length could be longer. But for this price you can't go wrong.
4,Good product but the label on the box makes me nervous as it says it has lead in it.The cable seems kind a short but very rugged otherwise.
5,These are a great value but I wish the sockets were oriented horizontally rather than vertically. You could fit more plugs with transformers on each power strip that way.
5,power cords as described. great quality work great as well
5,Had it for 2 months never had any issues
4,Awesome
5,I thought I ordered the 6ft cord  they sent the 2 ft cord iI made it work---worked well for what I needed it for
5,These are great; it's a good deal for the two pack but the cord is a little short. I'm not too concerned because I wasn't searching for a long cord.Pros:Looks discrete in the home (which was my priority)Cons:Shorter cord than can be used for a wider range of activities.
5,It was in a multi shipment so I had to find it amongst the packages I had been receiving. When I did I plugged the strip in and it was in the off position. I thought it was broken until I checked further (my phone was charging from the strip so I'm glad I checked).
4,Ordered black.. got the white ones. Doesn't really matter still a good product but it would have been nice to get what I ordered.
5,Excatly what I needed. I'm happy with them!
4,I have three of these. One of them has the power switch lit up bright red all of the time one has the light faint and it blinks and one doesn't light up at all.
4,These were a good value. They seem well made. They feel dependable.
3,The two outlets work to power my devices and TV. The reason for the three stars is because as soon as I got them and plugged them in the surge protector light would not turn on. I don't know if it's defective or what but the light will not turn on and I only have my TV plugged in. So now I don't know if the light just doesn't work (since I just purchased them) or if my stuff is not surge protected.
5,If your not using a surge protector you really need to look up into it. No complaints it works has multiple outlets and will save your electronics include of a power surge!
1,I just received this today. I purchased it so that I could attach it to the wall at desk level so that I could plug in my computer equipment without having to crawl underneath the desk. The electrical cord is too short to reach the top of the desk which makes it unusable for the purpose I was intending it to be used for. If the holes that allows you to attach it to the wall was designed so that it could be pointing upward or downward it would be acceptable. Not only were the holes upside down but they would not accept any kind of screw only a certain type of nail that was not included. It seems that this outlet was not very well engineered. If you are going to attach this surge protector to the wall higher than the plug-in I would not recommend this for you to purchased. Amazon did not show the backside of the surge protectors. If they had shown the backside I would have recognized that they would have not worked for my intended use.
5,I ordered these power cords a month ago maybe a little more than that but I am more than happy they work great and were a great price!
5,Great value with 2 pack. Works well with electronics and for Christmas lights!
4,Great
5,Good value for a well made part.
5,Sadly we had a power surge and the 1 my pc was plugged into didn't stop it from frying my computer. The other thankfully all Xboxs n TV made it through.
5,Great product. Does what it’s suppose too.
5,It's not exactly top grade protection but it works for all those little chargers and other low amperage devices in your life.  The layout kind of sucks but you can use 1 foot extension cords to get around that.  Overall it's fairly well built given the price.
3,The patch panel looks small and beautiful and the charging is also good but a touch of the charger data cable will make the charger drop which makes me a little worried about safety
4,Works as presented
5,So far so good. I really like using power strips whenever possible. It's great to be able to turn off everything with one click. These units are well made and are giving us great service thus far.
5,Great price for a set of 2. Is my second set I bought recently. Very sturdy.
5,This is a pretty solid set of surge protectors. I appreciate the decent cord length and the indicator light.
4,Works just fine. Only complaint is the cord is short but I should have paid closer attention to that when buying.
5,DEFINITELY NEED LIKE A 10 FOOT CORD BUT THEY WORK AS INTENDED AND ARE A GOOD VALUE
5,works great!
5,Amazone Basic surge protector power strip is a reasonable value you get two power strips. The 6 outlets are nice. You are able to plug in quite a bit of stuff in 6 outlasts. There is a light for the surge protection so you can tell when it's not working properly.
5,Needed one for a work bench for a couple flexible lights chargers etc. and have an extra one for whenever I need one in another spot. Decent price and I like ones like these with the lights showing the status it's in.
5,Good price good cordsalthough no protection against low voltage micro-stops
3,I guess when I buy a strip I expect that it will provide a steady charge - this thing freaks out everything I plug into it - My phone won't even type properly when plugged in my computer behaves strangely etc. Disappointing product from Amazon.
5,Muy corta la cuerda pero buena calidad y funcionan todos los puertos de enchufe! ❤️
4,Not great but good
5,You get what you expect and it does the job you'd expect.
5,Get exactly what you order. Works great
4,good price and the extension cords are also very good but the wire just a little short.
5,They work well look nice and the price is right.  It's a basic surge protector nothing fancy here but look pretty nice in black.  I've had good luck with other AmazonBasics stuff; the quality it up there with other "name brand" items and cost is usually a bit better.
5,This item is really a bang for your buck when comparing prices to Walmart Kmart and Target this was a No brainer. i got two for the price of one who can beat that.
5,They fill my need for plugs which is perfect.
5,Good quality products and I have no complains with yet (using since last 2 months). Be careful with the length of the wire these are not meant to be used as extension cord. Consider them a good buy for TV table or any other small distance placements. You can not place them on a tall tables.
4,They work perfectly good but the cord is awfully too short. The pictures gives a false illusion they are a bit longer but they are very very short
5,Great basic surge protectors/outlet multipliers. I used one behind out TV to plug the TV satellite receiver sound bar and home theater unit into. Neatened everything up with some zipties looks and works great!
4,Its a power strip  good device especially for the money.  Cord is just a touch short  only complaint.
5,I needed surge protectors Amazon basics has been reliable for other products so I bought them. Can't complain they do what they should. The only thing I would say is that I will eventually upgrade to flat plugs but that's has nothing to do with their performance.
5,I use these to turn a single outlet into a multi-charging station.  One outlet can now charge my cell another cell a usb-c device and a non usb laptop.  They aren't spectacular very function over form but but they do the job for a nice price.
3,These are fine.  I like the black color.  However the light is annoying and not really necessary.  It would be very obvious if the "fuse" is tripped or if the device is off  because there would be no electricty coming out.
5,WiFi signal? They are great power strips but I don't know about anything WiFi related.
3,They work great obviously except the mounting holes do not function. I bought mine used so I wasn’t upset but still seems like a dumb oversight.
5,Another one of those products that you can purchase at a far higher price but never should. Amazon Basics delivered once again with an affordable alternative to the name brand if that's a thing for surge protectors!
5,Great for my dorm room! I bought this pack and it works perfectly with all my cords.
5,Great price for the product... provides power to multiple devices as intended. Havent had a power outage and dont live in a storm active area so the "surge" portion hasnt been put to the test.
5,Good cheap power splitters. Two of them even! What's not to like?I don't expect these to help with any surges really and won't be using them to power expensive equipment. I'm just using them as splitters for simple things (like lights) when I'm on the road.
5,Received my 2 Amazon Basics 6-Outlet Surge extension cords which works just fine and was able to plug in a couple of my plugs into it and came in just at the right time...Thankyou
5,Works very well
4,Basic power strip. Probably wouldn't put too much trust in the surge protection but it's an otherwise fine power strip for a good price.
3,The red light on this thing is SO bright why does it even need it?!
5,They work!  Wish cord was a little longer but that’s more of a personal preference.
4,not suppose to use if extension is over 30 ft..  Christmas lights need more
3,I can always use power strips I have a lot of things to plug in. These refuse to lie flat on the floor which annoys me.
4,Not much to say other than they do what they are supposed to do. Only issue was the mounting slots on the back are a bit tough to use as they are pretty small.
5,Excelente calidad elegante y costo
5,My curls are very difficult to tame and over the years I've tried every chemical or straightening device out there.With this once a week I just stick my fingers into the sockets and my hear is nice and straight.  Great Amazon product.
5,These work well as to be expected. No frills just exactly what I needed.
5,It's a power strip and it works.  The surge protection isn't really worth anything because the rating is so low but it's better than nothing.  They're definitely a good deal for the price.
5,Have been looking to buy an extension cord for a while for all my electronics in the apartment. This two-pack is perfect and convenient for all my phone computer smart home etc chargers.
4,These power strips work great but the mounting hoes on the back don’t work very well with screws
4,Good power strip 2-pack for a great price. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I would have preferred an option for black instead of white. Other than that does what I need it to do.
3,these surge protectors are ok in and of themselves. one problem I had was when i was installing them to my wall in my garage the holes in the back do not really allow you to hook it with a screw head made things very difficult ended up having to screw the surge protectors onto a piece of plywood then the plywood to the wall. other than that they seam to work fine.
1,I have never seen a power strip that malfunctioned. This is one. Incredible. I woke up today to see that our Google Wi-Fi is down. It went off at an overnight hour when I know for sure no one in the house is up so no one could have potentially messed with it. I located the primary access point and it was powered down. I found the power strip that it was connected to and surely it's this Amazon power strip. THE SWITCH WAS ON ALONG WITH THE SWITCH LED. So from that end it was supposed to be on but then the Google Wi-Fi unit was clearly powered down even though connected to the strip. I connected it to another outlet and surely enough it powered on. Other devices (monitors) connected to this strip are also powered down. I will buy another strip but frankly I have never imagined that it is possible for power strips to not work like this and just break one day spontaneously.
5,Around the house
3,I initially received only one working surge protector in my two pack. Amazon was very efficient in sending me a new one but I had to then send the old one back. It was not a major hassle to drop off the return at UPS however it would have been great to receive two working surge protectors when I initially bought them. Overall they do what they are supposed to do.
5,Product as advertised. I’ve had it for ~4 months and it’s working well!
5,Very good price for such nice construction power strips.  It had a light indicator and Is UL certified. It good protection for common household appliances.  For higher price electronics might consider doing more research before purchase.
5,Very pleased with product
5,2 for the price of one its simple and exactly what i needed to organize some chords
4,Great product just wish the cord was longer.
4,These work o.k.  The short cord is fine if it works for you.  I prefer the white basics with the longer cords.  That's just me.
5,muy buena calidad y funciona bastante bien durante picos de tension
5,Work great for the money not wifi use mine for computer
4,Orientation of the plug doesn't always allow some bigger power supplies without loosing an available plug or two.
4,SO FAR SO GOOD
5,Good value for the price.Not super solid feeling but more than adequate for any plug it and leave it application.Would be better with a flush plug but then would cost more.
3,These strips work well. The plugs are tight so when you plug something in it stays in there. The only draw back is the size of the mounting holes in the back. they're not big enough to fit most regular wood screws and using smaller ones doesn't hold the strip tight enough when plugging/unplugging cords frequently. No other complaints so far.
5,Basic power strip but feels an looks great.
5,These get the job done and aren't too expensive. I only needed these to expand the number of outlets from my UPS unit.
4,So far so good.... Cord a little on the short side but no issues other than that.
5,They weren't perfect Baltimore News The Price Is Awesome highly recommend
5,Here is a surge protector that performs as well or better than surge protectors costing 3 - 4 times more! The unit is well made from its 3-prong grounded plug to its 6-outlet power strip. Highly Recommended.
5,Works well.. the length is little short but I would Still recommend it..
5,Extremely stiff cords like it was an issue first installing them but just work with them and they’re awesome and easily the best value on amazon
4,ok cord should be alittle longer
5,It's a power strip. It doesn't strip. It's not powerful. But it allows you to plug things in. More than you could have before- and that is good. It's also white. It has a red light which is nice except at 2 am when it's not nice.But for the value it's a pair of power strip outlets that work.
3,The ones I received work fine. Docking the stars due to the inability to wall mount these. I did mount one after taking off the back and removing the offending plastic inside with needle nose pliers and a small sharp wood chisel bit. Too much trouble. The instructions indicate they are wall mountable. Oh well seems odd though.
4,Basic power cord extensions... it would be great to have instructions in how to mount it to the walll
5,I've been using them at home and they've been working fine with no issues. Good value/price
4,Does the job real fine comes with frustration free packaging.Beware though the cord is 2 feet so its really really really short.
5,Have worked well for over a year now. Take note of the cord length though I wish I would have gone with a longer cord for what I needed.
5,We have really loose sockets in our house but these are great because they don't fall out they seem really sturdy and they work really great. I'm definitely going to buy more of these in the future.
5,Does the job.
5,Great power strip it is well built and comparable with the big name brands at a fraction of the cost. I will slowly be replacing all of my powerstrips with more of these.
3,The cords are only 2 feet long which is pretty short. Most surge protector cords are at least 3 feet long. Overall it's perfectly functional and I like the black color but I wish the power cables were longer.
5,Works well. No problems.
5,Not a long chord but if you just need 6 extra power sockets it's good for it's price
5,This two pack has been a godsend. We needed exactly two power surges for our house. It has enough outlets for what we need. Thanks!
5,Would have liked a way longer cord.
5,As amazing as an outlet can be. Fits neatly into small spaces
5,I mean how do you mess up a power strip? The function as advertised.
5,It works as intended.  Really just a regular powerstrip at a decent price.  I wouldn't recommend it over another brand if you find a better deal.  Items like this are great if you have Prime as it can save you a trip to a store.
5,The packaging was really good so the surge protectors got me safely. The surge protectors both worked the cord of the surge protectors is actually pretty good length. I would recommend getting this surge protectors. The are sturdy and work as advertised.
5,Good especially when you compare to retail prices
3,Great power strip but the cord is a little bit too short cannot use it for what I needed it for
5,These are great to have at home.  I love these I have bought several.
5,Great quality for the price. Also the cord is a good length
5,Works really well for what I need them for.
4,The cable is actually not that long so be aware of this before you hit the button.
5,While not made out of the best plastic it gets the job done. They were much slimmer than I anticipated so that was a relief to me.
5,Well pleased. Specifically wanted a short lead cord to the outlet. Liked the white color.
5,These surge protectors are compact and pretty cool to look at. I love the black color they offer. I tried them today 3/4/2019 and they work flawlessly.
4,World good
5,I always like to  keep surge protectors around the house. always comes in handy to plug in my stuff and not worry about power surge.
4,Kinda cheap feeling and does not fit with some appliances
5,Needed temporary power strips for a short-term place I was staying at. They actually ended up working very well and I kept them with me when I moved out. They're still doing a great job and they are very good for the price!
4,Standard protectors but small and light enough that they live in my suitcase so I always have extra plugs at the ready.
5,Arrived quickly and exactly what I needed.
4,The outlet is fine it's just I didn't pay attention to the length of the wire it is really shorrrrrrttttt.
2,How hard can it be to design a decent basic power strip?  Evidently too hard for Amazon’s choice of a manufacturer.  The strip comes with slotted holes in the back to hang it on a wall(I verified before purchasing).  The problem is these slots aren’t long enough to accommodate any type of screw head.  It is such a basic oversight that makes this cheap accessory useless to me.
4,You get what you pay for. Does the job but did not come with any mounting hardware. Fine product otherwise.
4,Good surge protectors the only downside is the cord size being a little too small.
4,The cord was much shorter than I would have liked but the price was right.
4,I like these however be aware that the cords are extremely short. I did not pay attention to this prior to ordering.
4,I wish these had usb ports as well but you can't beat the price on these.
4,Good and cheap
4,As advertised. i got these with short cords to be able to reach hard to reach outlets in the kitchen and laundry rooms. Just what I wanted.
4,Satified with the product
5,gap between socket is very less
4,Did the trick
5,Appear to be well made but only time will tell about longevity.  Surge protectors can deteriorate over time depending on the number and amplitude of surges so if you are relying on that aspect take that into account with any protector.
3,Wanted something basic to plug a few kitchen appliances into. I have a 3' high cabinet I wanted to set it on and the cord wouldn't reach from the outlet to the top. Not very useful unless you're just going to set it below an existing outlet.
5,This product served my purpose to get away from a wall outlet and extra outlets. I know the cord is only 2 feet but I could use another foot length.
4,I have yet to see a better deal than this two pack 6-outlet power strip.  Most sellers only offer one for roughly the same price.  So far they work perfectly.
5,short cord but it works well
5,Does what it is supposed to do; cord could stand another 2 feet.
5,Most bang for the buck! Quality is surprisingly great.  Hope it lasts a long time.  It also has a built in surge protector which is really nice.
4,So far so good. I have been using this product without any problem. Thanks Amazon
4,It is what it is
4,Plugin cables are a bit stiff and hard to bend which can make it a bit hard to keep flat. If you don't care about that then it's 5 stars though.
5,Cable is a bit short but for it's price it does exactly what I need it to do. Not that cheap of quality nothing fancy either but perfectly functional. Amazon Basics quality Amazon Basics price.
4,The cable was shorter than expected my bad for not reading all the specs yet it feels like too short in general for proper use. Taking that aside the outlets work fine.
5,Absolutely love this Power strip!!  Has a short cord so we are not trying to fold it or hide it somewhere!!  Could not be more pleased with the convenience and quality!!
5,It's a basic surge protector does its job without issue. I've been using both to power my guitar and PC rigs for over a month now no problems at all![UPDATE] After quite some time needed more surge protectors these last two have been literally flawless ordered a couple more!
5,☺
5,Hmm what to say.. they work correctly!
4,Just what we needed. A plus would be 1-2 USB ports but for the price these are great.
5,We needed some simple powerstrips for my son's room and for charging multiple phones.  So far these have worked just fine for us.
5,They do the job
5,Great quality surge protectors allow full protection for my valuable equipment!
5,My house is a century old and installed electrical outlets were an afterthought in the 1940’s! I need these in every room! Great price! Bright LED “on” light makes it easy to locate in the dark.
5,GOOD PRODUCT
5,Reliable and exactly what u was looking for
4,Works fine
5,Awesome buy!  Great price.  Fast shipping!
5,All the outlets work great the switch makes a nice clicking sound very gratifying. I don't know if it will save my TV from a lightning strike but one can hope overall all of my electronics plug into it
5,Good product. Have purchased before.
4,Awesome just very short please read description unlike me
4,needed a short extension cord to sit beside my microwave...  works great
5,Very good price point comes with mounting holes but no hardware. Wall plug is straight  out of wall not flush fitting.
5,Not as long as I expected but do able
5,There's not much you can say about surge protectors in my opinion.  They either work or they don't.  This one works just great and fits in a tight spot.  If we ever need surge protectors again we'll probably order these.
5,I use this in my home and to take with me to do my photography to put all my lights on. Works great
5,How can you go wrong with a power strip? Honestly. Let’s see how long it lasts but so far it works great.
5,Fast shipping and exactly what I needed.
4,works good
5,Love these! They work great with alot of outlet space for multiple cords! Great value for this product! Thank you.
5,I wish the cord was longer but overall I’m happy with them
4,Works well
5,Good deal on basic power strips. I just needed a few more outlets for stuff and at this price I can't complain. Doesn't have a ton of protection but you can expect that at this price.
5,Just what I was looking for and very fast shipping.
5,The one thing I would have to add is that so far plugging anything into the holes takes some force. We will have to see if that continues or whether that was because they are brand new.
5,Its 6 plugging outlets allow all my electrical elements in one place. The cord isn’t long it works best in places that aren’t high and at level.
4,looks well made and is heaver than a lot outlets i had . is working fine
5,This power strip works very well though the value of any power strip for protecting against surges is unknown. I would definitely buy again!
4,These are really kind of cheap. I expected better quality. I was kind of disappointed when they came but they're functional.
5,I brought these plugs for my sons dorm room first year of college.
5,I have only used one power strip so far but it seems to work well. I live in a part of the country where there aren't too many thunderstorms so I hope I don't need to rely on the surge protector part of the power strip.
5,They worked and cut the circuit before a fire could happen
5,Just perfect
5,Works just fine red light can be annoying if cord is kept near bed
5,Works great. I’d like if the cord was longer but overall good
4,These offer basic 200 joules protection for your electronics. The cord is kinda short (3 feet or so ) and they are acceptable quality for the price.
4,The cord is just a bit short and clunky.
5,Very sturdy but the length of cord could be about 2 inches longer.
4,Does what it's supposed to
5,Exactly what I needed at an affordable price. I bought these to have near our night stands and so far they have held up well.
5,Great quality and good price.
5,Exactly what I needed for more plugs without the frustration of a long cord.  Great buy for a two pack and the black color almost makes them virtually invisible when placed under a desk.  Highly recommend.
5,We used these at Christmas and had not problems.  The quality seemed good and the price could not be beat.  I would buy again.
5,Like how many outlets are available
4,Good surge protector nothing special but works well.  As with most there is not enough space between outlets if the plugs are big.
5,Did the job no problems got 2 for the price I would pay for one many places would purchase again
5,Arrived on time exactly as expected. I have no issues with these. I suppose we will wait until the next lightning storm to really test them. Look good and work as advertised.
5,very good
4,Works as should
4,One of my the surge protectors seems to have a short in it (the light flickers) but since it was bogo I'm not complaining
4,good product good price. used both of them immediately and they work great
3,I purchased these surge protectors for use at work since I needed more outlets on the back of my tool box.  They work fine but they feel very cheaply made and I am not confident they will actually protect any devices from a power surge. I am not in need of anything really nice so its no big deal. However you should be aware that you get what you pay for
5,Did the job
5,These are better than the cheap "big box" value models.  The power cord could be a little longer but they work fine for our needs.
5,I received this product well packaged. The cord is just long enough for what it was needed for. I'd buy again
5,Does exactly what I need them for.  Like having extra around.
5,perfect 6 plug surge protector just what I needed !!!10/10
3,Wow what a power strip. You can plug it into ONE outlet and them plug up to SIX things into it.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5,Haven't had a problem with them. They seem to be working just fine. They were also a really good deal for two. I recommend this product.
5,I've bought these more than once I was so pleased with them the first time I ordered them. The price is right and the quality is excellent can't beat that.
5,I needed a power strip for my bedside and near my TV! This is awesome without the high price of normal brands
5,Very durable good extension outlets. The cord length is good enough better than too long.Highly recommended.
5,I like it but I'd rather I've had it in pink
5,These appear to be a great purchase indeed but only TIME will tell of course! Packaged well & super-fast delivery. Seller is highly recommended with an A+++ Thank you!!
4,they work not much else i can say :-)
5,Now I can set up my art studio!
5,It's a power strip. Either it works or it doesn't and this one works.
4,Good graduation gifts
4,Standard 6-outlet surge protecting power strip. Works great. I do wish the power cord was longer though.
5,I needed these power strips for our hydroponic tent which seems to be acquiring more electrical things than I thought possible. Working fine so far.
5,Works great and the cord length is a bonus.
5,Houses never come with enough outlets. These took care of my need of a few extra outlets. I love white and these are perfect. They work just fine. Very pleased with my purchase.
4,The cord is super super short!! And all the plugs face up and down and not sideways so I can only fit 3 big plugs in. But it works.
4,Works great and matches my entertainment center :)
2,The slot where a screw head would go is not fully cut out. See in first picture.We tried hanging the power strip sideways on the wall and this was not possible due to the design.In the second picture you can see how I remove the plastic from the inside that blocks the screw head which is how all proper hanger holes like this are made. After removing the blocking plastic the power strip hung sideways on the wall properly.If you hung the strip vertically with 'slots' upwards it will hang on the wall but not securely.
5,Bought 2 one for her desk and one for my desk in our office. No issues have had them now for a year. Mounted them under the desk tops.
5,I have a small living space that these extension cords work great for. I’m able to place them behind furniture without it being bulky.
4,Nice for the price.
5,Second time ordering these they work well ! Love that they say amazon I love to represent
5,Works as advertised. I always check the warranty fine print to see how much they cover $$ wise and if my entertainment system and consoles all would be covered in the event the surge protector failed. This was more than enough I believe is was $25k
5,Great price and great product. I buy these for my company and yes we have had power surges here in our building so far i have had no issues with any of our hardware that these were connected to.
5,Didn’t have to leave my house during flu season to get surge protectors.  That alone deserved 4 stars.  It worked so gets a 5!
5,Great product. Clean looking and works.
3,Good price point but with in a year of owning 2 units both have fried 2 power cords(1 was a laptop the other was a smart tv) I actually heard the crackling & popping come from the protector itself so I know it was the source of failure. I suppose replacing a cord rather than the device itself is a win.
3,The cords are only 2 feet long which is pretty short. Most surge protector cords are at least 3 feet long. Overall it's perfectly functional and I like the black color but I wish the power cables were longer. The red on light is also somewhat annoying and difficult to cover up with blackout stickers.
4,Not as sturdy as id like. But does the job. Good deal. Good find.
5,Good product for the price.
3,Plugs are so close together that I can’t use all of them at once. Kind of annoying. But otherwise good.
5,Pretty good deal for 2 no issues with them.
4,Product works fine.  Just make sure you understand that the cord is very short.  This is not really an "extension cord".
5,These units work perfectly. I learned a long time ago to plug everything into surge protectors for a lot of reasons. You cannot beat the price either. And they are not cheap equipment. They are sturdy.
4,Pay attention to how short the cord is - otherwise no problem
5,well bult lights on when power strip is on no guessing good outlet quality.
5,Good value Chord is short (my fault) but other than that its pretty much a good buy.
5,Worked great.  Good value for the price.
5,I was looking for a cheap replacement for my previous surge protector that started to smoke. Great price and I like that you get two of them. It does the job it's your basic surge protector. Guess I'll find out during a storm if it works.
5,They work as intended. Light duty.
5,So far so good... these were delivered quickly and the price was awesome for 2. I've been using them for a couple of days now and they work great. I will be back if anything changes.
5,Can't believe I go two of these extremely well made surge protectors for the price that others charge for one.  Works like a dream.
4,Exactly as described. I didn’t realize the cords were so short but that’s my fault.
4,They work and they are not heavy.... sorta feels cheaply made.... but I'm happy for what I got for with the price.
5,Really Good quality will buy again in the future
4,wish the cord was longer but it does the job
4,Good Surge Protectors but they are made out of cheap plastic and the cables are a little stiff. Besides that they are good Power strips/surge protectors.
3,Product arrived quickly packaged well.  But my own fault I did not read the cord length before ordering.  The cord is very short and although it was a little annoying I can still use them.  Not worth returning as I can still use them for my purposes but read the cord length people!!
5,It’s very handy and strong material but too short for 6-outlets.
5,Very useful perfect length for behind my bed
5,A great price for a two pack of surge protectors. They work exactly as you would expect a surge protector to work. I have never had a single problem with these. I have 5 devices plugged into one and the other one has 4. I would highly recommend.
5,I bought 2 of these for the protection they provide. If you have valuable electronic devices this is a must have. However they provide cheap insurance in any case. Do yourself a favor and get these for peace of mind.
5,Works great as listed no issues at all
3,I used both surge protectors. In a matter of weeks one of the protectors basically cropped out and stopped working. the other one is holding up good.
5,After spending a little time searching for surge protectors I finally found these. While I was reluctant at first because of the low price I soon changed my perspective once I received them. So far I am extremely happy with my decision and would definitely purchase them again in the future.
4,Pay attention on dimensions. Itis short.
5,Food quality
3,These work fine. Good value
4,They work as presented. They feel a little cheap but have had no problems. I would buy them with longer cords next time.
5,I am enjoying them
5,Great value and as described. Recommended
4,Pleased for the price. May fall over if heavy or large connections used
5,You can't beat the price and the quality is far better than expected. The work great!
4,they work and do what they are suppose to do !
5,Works great. Love the thin strip as it’s easy to hide behind furniture
5,These are perfectly functional power strips. Very inexpensive and arrived quickly!
4,Works
5,So cheap for 2 power strips and they work great. The cord is short but I feel like they all are.
4,Well.. i actually got the black ones even though i ordered white. Other than that they are great buy.
5,Arrived on time and it works fine
5,The two pack was less expensive than buying two separately here or locally. This is a must for anyone using a computer or other electronics.
5,Ordered to declutter the cords. Works as expected.
1,Not what you're looking for if you are needing/expecting a surge protector. It's definitely just a basic power strip. It's fine for light uses. Amazon basics does sell a few great actual surge protectors though! One with many more plugs over 4k joules and the green light or another - the 8 outlet 4500 joules to be a little more specific. If you need a basic power strip with just a few small items to be plugged in at the same time go for it but if you're looking to protect expensive electronics and equipment just spend the $19.49 or $24.99 on the much superior products they offer that actually provides superior surge protection.
4,works as expected but... the cord is REALLY short.  2 ft sounds like more until you have it in hand.  just think about your needs before grabbing this.
5,They are exactly what you think they are! They work efficiently have a little red light and are true white instead of off-white like many competitors’ versions.
4,Great quality and quick shipping.
4,i havent felt any surges of power since using these. This finally helped keep me as bruce and not the hulk.
5,Worked great for what I needed for.
4,Everyone needs surge protection.  At this price it makes it an after-thought.
5,Living in Florida where we get LOTS OF LIGHTNING these surge protectors are great products to plug things into!!
5,Great price for a surge protector I use them in a number of places throughout the house. Effective protection for minimal money.
5,I’ve had a set of these for over a year. They work perfectly. Just bought a second set because I’m moving into a new home. Love the value of these.
5,I purchased these like 6 months ago and have had no problems so I ordered two more for work.  Fast delivery too!
4,Product is as described.
5,Product was perfect for my needs and was as described
5,These are used in my classroom to provide students with a “charging bank” for their personal electronic devices. They are exactly as described and work great.
5,Nice to have color black to blend in with equipment
4,Just what I needed. I wish the cord was a little longer. And I'd prefer a 90° plug.
5,Super fast shipping!! Great product! Thank you
5,For some reason I could not get any plugs into the first outlet. Idk what that’s about. Other than that it works just fine.
5,Needed surge protectors for my video game room. Love these
5,I wish the cord was longer but for the price this can’t be beat!
4,Bought this for the dorm and it is perfect.
3,Just a basic power strip but pay attention to the cord length. I didn't and was unhappy to realize that it's actually too short for the use I had in mind.
5,A huge help in ensuring everything is charging as needed
4,Good power strips. No complaints yet
5,These are just what I was looking for. They’re made sturdy the price is better than good and the delivery of the product was quick. A+++ seller
5,The work well zero issues.  Peace of mind to have electronics protected with this product.
5,it works and works well! The cord arrived in a day. Its a great value for money!
4,I wish that the contact was flat. Other than that it's excelent
5,Two strips for cheap never had them turn off or catch fire.  Just don't overload them and you'll be fine well worth the price for most homes.
5,great value for the 2 but wish the cord was just slightly longer.
5,They don't have WiFi.
4,Does what it is supposed to do. Hopefully I will never have to find out if it will hold up to a big surge.
5,They work well I needed something so that I could feel safe using my wall plug ins cause one caught on fire and these work well
5,Works just fine ... worth the cost
5,Very practical one the quality is very good the price is right I will recommend it to my friends and try it!
5,The cord was awfully short. Doesn't reach to the wall mount screws my old (burnt up) one used.
5,All you need from a surge protector!
5,As described. Im happy.
5,good plastic quality!
5,I use these power strips and there doing a great job  Protecting my  I home  Alarm  o’clock in my TV and my fan my other stuff great power strip
5,Basic power strip does its job has survived some surges breaker flipping and outages color is subdued.  Might be nice to have longer cords but that's a small niggle.
5,They did the job nicely
5,Powers my work station. I built a PC and uses some juice and an ultra wide monitor. Everytime I turn them on they work great. They are both plugged into this power strip so the power strip works great right? right!
5,Prefect length to use for our nightstands and at my desk. Love the value of the double pack.
5,I probably shouldn't but I use these outside worrking on projects so I can keep a fan blowing and still use my corded tools. I also use them all over my workshop. Will buy again
4,Super fast shipping got it like the next day.  Described perfectly and works great
5,Great deal for two!
5,Loved these good quality great deal no problems. get them!
5,Great purchase. My home is "FULL" of electronics. Plan on ordering more.
5,Great product
5,Heart monitor needs to be free of power surges for accurate reading.  This works!
4,Good price for two. The cords could have been longer.
5,Works perfect! Use it for 5 different things.
5,Will buy again when needed
3,one of the power strip was giving me problem was not sure if it was not getting enough power since not all item I plug into powerstrip work but some things did try same plug slot and other slot to see if made a different did not
5,The cord is to short
5,Another great product from amazon basics.  Trustworthy brand I have a couple of these all work well.
4,Reset works properly after current overload
5,Need  these good  products
5,ok
5,Hate how bright the light on the switch is. I took it apart to get rid of the light. Because it lights up my room at night.
5,good quality but wire length is small. worth for money
3,To small for me... but I still would recommend to purchase it.
3,I bought 12 of these.  One partially exploded when it got plugged in the first time.  You can see the damage in the picture.  It looks like the switch tabs were not soldered at all.  They are cheap but be careful.
4,Nice. Only draw back is cord is on the short side needs to be at least 1FT longer.
3,I have used better surge protectors. My husband ordered these and they do not allow a lot of give as the cord is not long.
3,The cords didn't last long one by one the power cord socket started not to workif I knew this I would have never brought them waste of my money
5,Perfect will order more soon!
5,AmazonBasics is the best kept secret of quality.  These two surge protectors work as good as the best of other brands for half the price.  The are also sleek and simple.  Great buy.
4,Does the job and good price.
5,I was having electrical issues and had some expensive surge protectors fail yet these managed to go on just fine not sure how but im very impressed and glad my stuff was safe thanks to them.
5,Great product will purchase again
5,It does as advertised. Good quality. Have had no issues so far.
5,Good sturdy cord. Good value
5,Very good but the cord is short the predect is a very good quality
5,Bought these to update from the old ones I had.
5,Works well for the office and behind the tv
5,These work exactly as you’d expect them too.
5,Works great. Very happy. Good quality.
5,Works just fine for what I needed
4,was what i expected
5,They turn stuff on what more could a person want.
5,Excellent affordable basic protection. I wouldn't use it for a computer or something with lots of electronics like TV or stereo gear but for everything else in the house - these are GREAT.
4,It is a nice product. The wire is of high quality. I use it for my internet and smart home devices.
5,Just what I needed thank you!!
5,These are nice little power strips. They're lightweight and have a hole in the back to hang them if needed. I've been using mine for a few months now and I haven't had any problems.
5,Exactly as described.
5,Great value.
4,Does exactly what you'd expect.  Pleased with it
4,They work
2,Bought these for my dorm. One lasted a month before it randomly quit working and the other gave out just before the end of the school year.  Luckily these power strips were cheap but neither lasted a full year for me so it may be worth spending the extra few dollars for ones that work.  There's nothing more frustrating at school than not being able to plug in your lights/computer/phone/etc... because you have to replace the power strips you just got.
5,I was in search for some and I’m glad I went with these! Super nice and high quality not too short.
5,Perfect simple and sturdy basic
3,These work fine and are a great price but are almost unusable because of how short they are. It basically just adds extra outlets (which might be all you need) but they don't really give you any extra length to plug things in from farther away.
4,the length of the cord is pretty short
5,Great buy from amazon basics would buy againHighly recommend
5,Not complaints working great so far
5,It does exactly what it should I just wish the cords was a little longer
5,Work great had no problems with this item at all
4,Pretty good deal the cords are pretty short so don't expect too much room to work with if you needed to reach further than a foot and a half.
5,I'm so Very Glad I brought this.
4,The only bad thing is the cord is short.
5,Does the trick with no trips
5,It’s a good surge protector
5,Small light weight units that work as advertised. Can be mounted via key holes and are light enough to to be Velcro under a table if needed.Nothing fancy about them and nothing wrong with that. For the price these are right on point.
5,I like this product. Simple design but you can't go wrong. It works. Power washer and vacuum and blower all at same time. Also all of my electronics chargers on the one in my room.
5,Great product. Would buy again
5,Zero issues great value.
4,good price does the job..comes in a nice packaging..not much to say you know what this does..
5,Who doesn't need these? I want them in every room! They've already saved my devices from multiple power outages. Will definitely purchase more
5,A nice fit on our kitchen shelf!
4,Good price and very good quality
5,That says it all!
5,This is a great 2-pack of protectors. Perfect for college which is what I purchased them for.
5,I just needed to upgrade some of the extension cords.  Good for the price and love the black
1,Woke up this morning to the smoke alarm blaring.  The source of the fire was a Amazon Basics power strip in a spare bedroom.  Nothing was even plugged into the strip.  Fortunately we keep a fire extinguisher on every floor of the house.  Two minutes later and the whole room would have been up in flames.  In reading the other reviews here I see I am not alone in declaring the various models of Amazon Basics power strips a fire hazard and should be removed from the market.
5,These are surprisingly durable for the price. They work perfectly and I've had no problems with them so far. Getting these off Amazon will save you a trip to the store from buying an overpriced power strip.
4,Plugging in lights charger etc in bedroom
5,So cheap and they work just like you'd think! Can't go wrong. Just have wait to see how long they last. Just using these for basic applications nothing too serious. They're also quite small which can be good.
5,Great product fast shipping
4,Works well you get what you pay for.
5,On time as promised.
5,Just what I needed two quality items for the price of one. No downside :)
5,I didn't realize the plug actually rotates so it can be flat against the wall in any direction.  Love it
5,i'm not sure how you can possibly go wrong w two power strips for 10 bucks? they work. they even look nice.
5,Works great! It's a good price and works well
3,I bought these for my craft room and the cord is so short that it’s hard to have things plugged in because they all have to be stretched to reach. I will be purchasing some with a longer cord
5,Purchased for my studio the black fits with the colour scheme. Works as expected as any other power strip should.
5,Definitely a great product to connect it next to my bedside table we recommend very practical
5,For the price you not gonna really beat  these.
5,Works great for me. I have several set of these. They work just as well and the more expensive brands..
5,These do the job! And they haven’t caught on fire or anything😂👍🏼
4,The most basic surge protector you’ll ever buy. Gets the job done.
5,Easy to use you get what is advertised
3,The cord on this power strip is very short and the material the thickness of the plastic is very cheap
5,Great value and quality perfect to organize all my connections..
5,Great buy at a great price. Nothing much to say other than they do the job.
5,This is my second time purchasing this product. I love it. I use it for home and office. Very easy to use and realiable.
5,The cord isn't much long at all but is a great cheap option for desk and pc setups.
5,AmazonBasics never let me down for its good quality and durability.
5,Great value for the price! Both work extremely well and the dark  color makes them harder to see which is good if the unit is visible.
3,The power strip does what any normal power strip does. However one of the outlets has already gone out. I just got the power strip a few days ago
5,Great power strips for an amazing price! Target sells similar two packs for $18-$25 where Amazon is far cheaper for almost exactly the same product. They both work great every plug-in works just fine. Simple and just what I needed!
5,What’s to know? They’re cheapies olastic buy I’m spending low for multiple outlets instead of actual surge protection.Quite satisfied for the price
4,basic surge protectors; seem to work so far.  pretty good value. could be a bit longer cord
4,I didn't realize the power cord was so short.  Be aware!
5,Bought one for a fish tank but took advantage of the two pack. Great pricing and great product. I really love a great deal
3,It might have been great product if not for the short cord length. However  it's strong and durable. It's probably been over 10months still didn't have any problem.
4,I'm saving as a spare! GD PRODUCT!! WORKS GREAT!!htp\\..
5,Work well and a value 2 pack was great.
4,I've been looking for an outlet strip for my son's room. It was a great buy two for one. Thanks Amazon!
5,Walmart has single packs for the same price and it doesn't have Amazon logo on it. Bit it's a good product
5,This is perfect for my two power using units that need to be on all the time .  Quality to price ratio is very good
3,The 6 outlets on this strip are spaced closer together than a regular duplex wall outlet so I was only able to fit 4 plug-ins onto this 6-outlet strip simply because the outlets on this strip are too close together.  Sad.
5,Great little surge protectors for what I need them for around the house. Great deal.
5,Wonderful although I wish they sold this in a single pack. I only needed one but for the price it was more worth it to get two. Still I have been using this for months and it still works great. Happy with my purchase.
4,Cords are too short. Otherwise they get the jobs done.
4,Good price. Cord is a bit too short.
5,Very happy with my Amazon spike strips to have some extra outlets when needed and protection of curcuit breaker.
5,These are short cord but that is exactly what I needed in my situation works perfect.
5,Two for the price of one is great. Works very well and now I have an extra.
3,Affordable
3,Cord length is only 2' so I ended up having to buy another version that has a longer cord for work.  I will still keep these 2' ones because they work fine but the cord length is limiting on where you can use it.
5,Good value for money.
4,Both items were put to use right away. Now i feel secured my appliances will be protected from sudden power fluctuations.
5,Prefect for what I needed.
4,Wish had a USB outlet.
4,Functional.  I wish the cord was longer on these.
5,Usufull at my place but not long enough at work.
5,Does the job it's supposed to
5,Precisely what I was looking for.
5,Bought to plug in some gas monitors for work. I haven’t had any issues since I bought them. Cord is a little short so just be aware of that in the description.
5,Great price good power strips.
5,For a basic power strip it is surprising fantastic!  Incredible AC surge suppressor.  Totally eliminated all noise artifacts on my TV and computer screens!  Well worth the purchase.
5,Very inexpensive Great product. Came in great simple packaging that was easy to open and didn't have flashy print. Its nice to know Amazon is keeping the price low by doing so. All ports work perfectly. Both of mine are full and working great 2 months in.
5,Great I use mine a lot
5,Works as expected.
5,Grabbed some of these for guest room and office easy to setup and great price simplier than higher end brand surge protectors but these are great for around the house.
4,Nothing special.  Short cord.
5,It does what it is designed to do and at a great price very satisfied.
5,Can't say much about a sure protector but these ones are very well made.  this package comes with two protectors with a total of 12 outlets.  works perfect for my home office.
5,Does it’s job works well
5,Works great. Absolutely no complaints.
3,Does exactly what it says on the tin.One detail I wish I knew about before ordering: You can only wall-mount these with the cord facing UP. The "keyhole" slots in the back only allow for mounting in this position not with the cord facing down. Horizontal mounting should also be possible.
5,The cord is so short it has to be used with an extension cord.
3,The length is too short to use this.
5,Perfect For What I Needed Them For
5,This is a great and affordable power strip.
5,Love these so much I will be buying more.
4,Not bad. Can be difficult to plug your electronics into it's sockets.
5,Inexpensive product that does everything you'd expect.
5,Love these so much bought two more sets!  Now we don't worry about power surges during the lightning storms we have been having lately!
4,Good product and good price
5,They do their job and look just as pictured. It would be nice if the plug was flat against the wall so you could fit behind furniture but other than that they are good.
4,Works well but cord is really short.  I guess I should have read the description.
5,Works great and came wuick
5,Works as advertised doesn't get hot or present any build quality issues. Hope to see versions with a higher joule rating soon
4,good outlet but couldve used a longer chord
4,Ordered two of these; on one one of the outlets stopped working. Annoying but not a deal breaker.
4,Cost effective and quality.
5,Great price for 2. Can’t find a better deal.
4,I didn't read the description properly...I needed something with a longer cord and for big appliances. Otherwise this is a great product. Does it's job and looks good.
5,Super useful but I wish the chord was a little longer . Mine have master a while
5,So far great product.  Cord length is decent.
4,Good for Price
5,Been using these for two years for everything  in my house.
4,Came quick and was exactly what I was looking for
5,Use them all over my house. Good product.
5,Lots of outlets which is what I needed
4,Seems to work just fine no issues here with it.
5,Very good! This is my first experience with AmazonBasics and I'm very impressed! These surge protectors are every bit as good as the expensive name brand one. I will be buying AmazonBasics products in the future after having a great first time experience with this product.
4,function as you would expect.
5,Pretty basic power strips. Nothing too crazy about them. One thing I failed to read was the 2 foot cord. Not the product's fault all mine but just a heads up if you're interested in getting these. The cord is very short.
5,Very good
5,Got three orders of this for a total of six power strips. They're all going strong and well worth the purchase!
4,Good item
4,The prices are wonderful although they went on sale after I bought 8 of them.  The cord is rather short.
5,good product for the money. would recommend. amazon delivers once again. no wonder it's taking over the world.
5,Basic surge protector for everything you need!
4,Hopefully does what it’s supposed to!
5,It is in fact a power strip.
4,Nice and small but wish the cord was another 6 inches longer.
5,Great plug strip. Just keep asay from heaters. 👍
4,These are great not bulky.
5,Very good product pleased
5,It does what it says. Your typical surge protector. Nothing fancy but gets the job done.
3,The cord length is too short. Otherwise it seems fine.
5,Good deal ......shipped within days....
4,I got these for my daughter for college. So far so good. Time will tell.
5,A surge protector.  It works.  It is an amazing deal since you get 2 of them for the price you would pay for one at a store.  Strong durable plastic and a quality plug in chord.
4,They are good - sturdy well designed.
5,I bought these for my desk at home and they work well. No issues ...for the price I r we commend them.
4,Perfect for extra plugs!!!
4,It's ok
5,Good essential.  Basic and the right price.  I am ordering again to get rid of some old ones in my house.
5,I forgot i  got 2 of them for one price worth much more than they cost me. alsoVery fast shipping!
3,the cord is very short just enough to allow the outlet to reach the floor. The LED indicator is very bright. Use is ok.
5,I will definitely order more
5,Great price for two. I've had them for a few months now under my fish tanks with all of the filters and heaters plugged in and have had no problems
4,The length is pretty short.
5,These are my favorite power strips. I have been using them for about a year now and haven't had any issues.
4,A good power tap without any real hassle
5,What’s to say it works as described
5,XGets the job done
5,It does what I need it to do.  It hasn't yet started a house fire so there's that.
5,Cord is short but good price
5,Love these! The cord is a little short so it is definitely just a 6 outlet extension vs being able to be an extension cord
4,The only thing is that I wish the cord was a little longer.
4,Family loves it
4,I wish the cords were a bit longer.
5,Looks decent and does what I needed it to do. They are surge protectors and work as expected. What else is there to say?
5,Works great love it
5,Love this its a perfect fit for what I need it for
5,cleaned up all the messy cords behind my tv just what I needed
4,They work. Super cheap plastic so we will see how they hold up.
5,Bought this a while ago and I still have it today. They are just as described and work great
5,Just what I needed. Quality seems good
5,Basic but functional. I needed a basic surge protector just so I would have more outlets in a couple places around my house. These have been working fine.
5,Perfect the size they stated and all work perfectly.  For the price can't be beat.
5,Perfect for son's room! He can now plug in all of his game systems & I don't have to worry!
5,Came as advertised. Can’t beat the value
5,These were just as described great price.  As stated in other reviews they are tough to find the right screw to mount.  But not a huge deal for me.
4,The cords are a bit short but it serves the purpose
4,Electrical protection
4,Works fine Does not seem to be made out of strong material but no complaints otherwise.
5,Its really good product and you get two for a great price
5,Decent product for the price
3,I like the extension nothing major to write aboutI bought the pair but one seems to pass current even when the switch is in the off position.
5,Great for the price! Work well! Will buy again way less expensive then I have seen at any store!
5,They are great exactly what I needed.
4,Just u r every day power strip
5,Works great! Serves it’s purpose
5,Five stars because this works great for my needs I'm know there is probably better out there but I'm not a professional so for my level of play and the price this works out perfectly for me. Thank you.
5,Hard to review a power cord lol
3,One of the two power strips was defected and I spend hours trying to find the problem with all the xmas lights and the timer.  Finally I tried the second strip and it worked.  I guess one out of two is not bad but the time spent outside was frustrating. Price wise if both worked it was a good deal.
4,Ok decent quality. Not great but ok.
4,It does what it says and definitely better than competitors prices
5,They work great. I almost wish I'd bought the ones with USB outlets too.If you're on the fence about that I'd get the upgraded ones.
5,The Surge protector comes in a set and is decently priced.They are great for small jobs and task that don't need anything fancy.What you expected a long review about surge protectors? Get a life
5,Got these after lightening hit and blew out my old one. they work great so far
5,I use these to run our band equipment and they hold up and power amps and lights just fine.
5,Great product simple to use!
5,Just perfect power strips that you don't have to worry about hiding all the extra chord.
5,Two for the price of one in my opinion
3,3 star because the slotted keyholes on back were not done correctly. i had to warm a screw head hot enough (using vice grips) and then push the screw head down into the slots so that the shank of screw was located correctly in the plastic. other than that these are power strips.
4,Basic updated surgers work well.
4,They do the job at a good price. Nothing fancy just functional.
5,Just as expected and fast delivery. Simple!
5,I used this for my wife motem and TV / computer
5,It works great and durable I even used it outside during the rain for my Christmas lights and they worked great.
4,Good product
5,use them for my gaming setup they work great.
5,Price and quality are perfect! Highly recommend.
5,Works great.
3,Well they work but have a very flimsy feel. I'd be nervous about putting a lot through these. Next time I'll spend a bit more for the peace of mind.
5,Affordable quality products.  They do what's expected - split a single outlet into six outlets.  I have yet to experience a surge with these protectors but I don't doubt that they'd cover all the equipment that I've got plugged into them.
5,Useful good quality and at a good price. Recommended.These "short cord" protectors are great for eliminating messy wires that are too long for the job.
4,the cord could be a few feet longer for 5 stars
5,The cord is very short I should have paid better attention. The power strip works great
4,it's fine it serves the purpose for which is was designed.
4,The power cable is very thick and the strip is light so it doesn't stay where you want it very easily
5,Good
5,Perfect for my vanity area! Plugs work well definitely value for the $$
5,Just like your mom and your sister they both can take 6 at once
5,I was worried those were going to be cheapy surge protectors but they are nice and do what i need them to do.  Great for the price.
5,Affordable price on Amazon. However the cord is very small. I should have read with more attention. My fault. But it doesn't change the 5 stars for quality/price
5,Works just as well as name brand power cords.
5,Bought these months ago for my office and they’re great. Work very well and haven’t had any issues with them.
4,Love the double package for the great price. They seem pretty good quality too but the button is more reseeded than I care for.
5,high quality. low price
4,Just a simple multi-outlet strip for use.
5,Really great!
4,Work as expected however cables are definitely short so be aware and plan for your needs
4,Good product
5,short cable is nice
4,Good price
4,Work fine I just wish I purchased the longer cord. Nice and sturdy and I appreciate the on/off switch
5,It works perfectly.  No issues. And it’s a different color than white
2,You need an extension cord to use this power strip. It does the job...if the outlet you are using is right next to power strip and so are all the appliances or devices you want to plug into the power strip. What a ridiculously short cord. It isn’t even long enough to plug appliances in two shelves below the power strip.
5,Works perfectly
5,This was a good deal. Nothing special but it does the job.
5,I purchased 2 a few months ago and I like them so I just ordered 2 more.
5,Good basic value
4,Great power strips for a cheap price. Only drawback is there aren't any space allowances for the larger charger plugs.
3,i bought 2 1 stopped working after a while. such crap.
5,They're affordable surge protectors. Super effective in protecting surge.Ummm one complaint is the cord is super stiff and the charger is light weight... but its 2 for 10$ so 5 stars for what it is. Woot Woot Woot
4,Works great wished the wire was a little longer.
5,Great product at a great price!
1,This came with one of the plugs melted when I opened the box. Thank God I noticed it before I plugged it in! I was afraid to use the other one in the box even though it appears fine. When returning it I picked the option of replacing it but then on second thought I was worried about the product coming being unsafe based on the damaged one I received. Now I have no options or recourse to get a refund but cancelled my replacement because I don't want to deal with unsafe cords. This is for my business and I cannot take the risk. If there is a way for me to get a refund I would really love that!! This is junk and very scary! I don't even want to try one that appears to be ok now.
4,Works as a basic power strip. However the cord is very stiff and not very long so just be aware. Otherwise perfect.
3,The powerstrip itself is fine but their solution for mounting it on the wall is not sufficient. The two holes on the back are way too shallow to fit any type of screw head. I had to take it apart and drill out the back in order to fit screws and it was just a huge hassle.
4,I would give it five stars but I wish the cord was longer. But it works great and the price was really great too
4,nice product.  200 joules isn't much protection though
5,Sturdy enough.
4,Good for the price and serves as extension cord for multiple gadgets for me.
5,Cheap and works can't go wrong with AmazonBasics. The delivery was fast!
5,Good product no problems so far
5,Not much to say they function as intended great value as most Amazon Basics products are.  Well built and did it's job during an overload
3,Totally my fault for not paying attention to the cords length.  Too short to be practical for most uses.  Get ones with longer cords.
5,works well if you only need 2' of cord no issues
3,Shoddy engineering really annoys me. Really REALLY annoys me.
5,Very good product long lasting
5,Its what i needed for the space i had to use.
4,Working good.. they may provide option for closing lids for unused outlets.
5,Convenient size for use in the travel trailer.  Long enough but not so long that they get under foot in the confined space.
5,These work perfect for expanding my one outlet that I have in my bedroom. I can now have a TV and a heater in my bedroom.
5,Paid about $5 per strip for two.  Great buy.Let Amazon source these.  Same with things like rechargeable batteries.So many cheap counterfeits by the talented ..Chinese that I just let Amazon source what is good.
5,There's wifi signal? It works.
3,Acceptable for the cost. It fulfills its function. Unfortunately it has no indicator light for the on position...
5,Worked great. You always need more than 1 so 2-pack is good to have
5,Have been using these for years at my salon station as expected.
5,Perfect basic power strip does the job.
1,The wire is way too short so the outlet looks like it dangling!
5,Very sturdy
4,good
5,Decent Amazon basics surge protector. No complaints.
5,Works great. Thank you amazon.
5,length ability to travel well and value for money
5,Can plug in more now.
5,Product as expected and delivered on time.
5,Fully functioning set of surge protector extension! I’d buy them again v
4,Plug cable is very short. 2 feet may sound long but it isn't. Just be aware of that when you buy it.
4,Very good Outlet working very well
5,Wonderful product. Worked exactly how it needed to work. Very nice product for the price.
5,very good product and at a good price
5,great product and cost
4,Solid works as expected.  Not complaints.
5,Not much to say here. This is durable portable and cheap! Can't complain.
4,work like they should great outlets
4,In expensive and still work good.
5,replaced two of my older surge protector strips.  they lasted a couple of brown outs and power surges - time to ensure items plugged into the power strips are protected with the surge mov.
3,Pros:What can go wrong with electronics except not working?This one works as it's meant to -- so no complaints there.Cons:It's not well made / solid.  Feels quite a bit cheap.Finishing is not so good.
5,Great for that extra outlet
4,Works fine but the links of the cord is very short. Good price for the value though
5,Handy and sturdy
5,Using the product in my son's room for video game setup and it is still working after the first month. Fully satisfied.
5,It's a good buy!
5,They work and I like the color.
4,Just some good ol basic surge protectors at a real good price. Shipped fast and they work! awesome!
3,Price is good works perfect  however the power cord is so short it will NOT reach the floor to lay flat I have to set it up against the wall.  Disappointed.
4,They are what they are
5,Bought these twice because they are inexpensive and we always need more plugs throughout the house. I want to also incorporate them into our smart home setup.
4,It is good enough considering the price. But it indeed looks very cheap.
4,Very high quality item at a great price ... just wish the cord was a foot longer
5,These do the job that they are meant to do. They are reliable in their surge protecting/breaker capabilities. Nocomplaints
5,Great quality and good price doesn't get much better than that. Happy customer
5,These are great in my classroom
5,It's kinda hard to screw up a power strip.  So the price is what drew me to these.
4,A Good Buy.
5,Not much to review here.  Shipped within the two days.  Comes with two surge protectors and they both work well.  I would recommend this product.  Thanks.
4,Mind that the strip is quite short.
5,Came as advertised
5,1Psurge protector no wifi
5,For the price you can't hardly beat getting two of these and they work like a charm.  I mean it's a power strip so how much can you say?
4,Basic surge protector just as described.  Good price.
5,All outlets work without issues.
5,It serves its purpose. No issues or complaints. I read a review that the lights don't work (like a solid piece of plastic for the switch). That's not the case (picture attached). If it is it's probably a defective one.
4,Works very well but wish it had a longer cord.  You can't beat the quality for the price
5,Really good product for the money
4,What you would expect... its a couple power strips
5,Needed some power strips to clean up all the wiring by the living rooms. These worked great!
5,so far so good. It's only been a few days since I started using this product but it works good so far.
5,Great price for 2
5,"AmazonBasics 6-Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip 2-Pack 200 Joule" Okay this might have included "2 foot cord". It is included shortly (that's a pun) after the title. I should have noticed. Regardless they seem to work great and I am glad to have them.
5,Hidden feature: plug prongs into the socket closest to switch for unlimited power.
4,I like the item because it works as describe.
5,I bought it for my new house.  It's perfect to install simply.
5,I have four of these power strips and they all work very well. I've had very good luck with Amazon Basic stuff.
5,Jeff's power cord works really good.  Amazon products usually work really well for me. :)
3,Just what I needed. No issues yet hopefully I don't have any.Put these somewhere where noise is not a factor. Had this in the bedroom.Update:While trying to sleep I can hear a buzzing noise. Have to turn them off every night because the wife turns it back on.
5,Thank you Jeff Bezos! These are awesome. The price was great and their well made.
5,Not much can be said about surge protectors.but you get 2 for the price and thats great.
5,This is great good price
5,A must have in every household. Great product and value.
4,Too short of cord
5,They work great
5,OMG my daughter loves these!!!  The price is excellent and they work as well as any of the expensive ones we have here at home.  Couldn't have gotten a better deal on a superior product.Highly recommend.
4,Didn't quite realize how short the cord was but that's my fault. It arrived on time and works very well. Good quality.
5,The cord is a little short but the equipment works really well
5,Bars came together. They are smaller than I thought. But going to be perfect for my PC setup.
4,Great essential items for the house!
5,Used in our kitchen on black counter tops and it blends in beautifully.
4,Great price for the bundle- nice to have them in every room for convenience and accessibility
5,Amazon just keeps surprising me with the quality of their amazon basics products.  They are very good!  These surge protectors serve their purpose well and come in a two pack for not much money.
4,Works great.
5,Thank you!
5,They're power strips. You plug stuff into them you plug them into the wall and electricity flows into said stuff. Pretty simple really.
5,Looking like it’s doing his job but you never know until your power are off ......cross finger and hope he work well 😃
5,Nice & sturdy power outlet.  Wish the cord were a bit longer; but for the price the do the job very well.
5,Additional plugins for kitchen appliances
5,Cord is a little short
5,This was a very sturdy surge protector and it came quickly.
4,reasonable and workable
5,Terrific power bar.  Has red flashing light so you know it's on.  sturdy and priced affordable.  Well made.
4,Solid Workman Ike surge protector.  Great price.
5,Works as expected.The main prong is a tri prong but gets the job done for me
4,Simple and well priced. Only complaint is that the cords are a little short.
4,Great for the price. Seem to do what they'r supposed to and the packaging was great too.
5,Well made and the price was great (8.06) for (2) surge protectors.
3,Sockets are a very tight fit and indicator light is useful for replacement and device failure protections.  The cord is a bit too short for plugging in large devices like power bricks and socket mount power supplies.
5,Awesome to have around I mostly enjoy the status light to let you know when they might be good to replace!
5,These always seem to come in handy and work great. We use them for our office and garage and are a great quality.
5,they work as expected.
5,Was a great deal. Recently moved and was running out of places to install devices.
5,Bought these for my mother she only needed one but the price was so good we bought the 2 pack.  Work as intended.
5,Great buy I got the 2pck
5,These are a good value and they are exactly as described.
3,The cord is rather short. This combined with its inflexibility makes it nearly impossible to get the surge protector to sit flat on the floor. But for the cost its passable.
4,Good surge protectors but relatively basic and feel somewhat cheaply made. They seem to do their job though so no complaints for the price
5,These are great utilitarian surge protectors. Simple design. They work. What more is there to say?
5,The extension is a little short but it works fabulously with all my equipment and devices!
5,They're great especially for the price. I've had zero issues with them and I've had them one year so far
4,Cable really small. But ok for the price
5,It’s ok for the money
5,Great price do what they should. Got 6 more my office
5,Not much to say about power cables/extention cords except they work are practical and handy to have around the house for whenever you need one.
5,Great value well worth the money. Stays okay during power surges.
5,Basic extra outlets. I would not trust this for expensive electronics.
3,It was a mistake to buy this. Very poor quality.  I am very disappointed. I was expecting better than this.
5,I would buy again if needed. Great price works nicely.
5,A good deal at a reasonable price...
5,I have ordered these twice now with great success. The power cable is a little shorter then others but not too short that it causes issues.
5,Nice product. Liked it.
4,Ok for the price.
5,What is there to say about a power strip these days? These work just fine. I wish I had ordered ones with longer cords but that’s my fault.
4,Both are working
5,Good product. Works well. Good purchase!
5,These are great but I wish they were a bit longer.
5,perfect for college students - easy but only thing is I wish it was a little bit longer of a cord.
4,Feel a bit lightweight like cheap plastic but they work fine.
3,Definitely convenient though 1 crapped out after about a month but the other is still going strong so I don't regret the purchase. :) -Account holder's daughter
2,Both surge protectors didn’t last long before going bad plus in light indicator no longer works tv and radio makes buzzing noises when surge is supposed to be off. Haven’t had long and light use so no traveling with it or pulling in and out.
5,Delivers electricity and is properly grounded. Hasn't fried any of my electronics yet. That's about all I expect out of a surge protector.
1,Supposed to be a safety surge protector but i dont think it is. I looked at it today and noticed it was melted. No good. Spend the extra money and get something that isnt a fire hazard
5,These are half the price of most and do the job fine.
5,Will buy more. Chord is short but good value.
4,works great - wish the cord was longer other wise perfect
5,It's a good cord
5,Very useful and the quality is excellent. Love the light indicator.
5,Good choice in amazon basics. Got 2 of them and able to use it with no issues.
5,Love the price.  Good for a basic power strip.  Cord is flexible but short which can either be good or bad.
5,Does what an extension cord does but better because...amazon basics.
5,Perfect thank you
4,Good
4,Relatively reasonable price for convenient multi pack.
5,I have had these protectors for nearly a year now and I have experienced 0 problems. not much more to say really they do the job.
5,Works great. No problems
5,Great surge protectors for the price!  I probably wouldn't plug my $1000 TV into them but for charging your phone or plugging in a lamp these are great!
5,Excellent quality fast and well packaged shipping very satisfied and will be continuing to buy thank you so much!
5,Basic and easy to use like the indicator light showing if it is on/off. Fit well into a plug that was restricted due to the size of another cord plugged in the other socket.
5,Good deal.  Cords are a little short.  If that matters to you get some with a longer cord.
5,Love them
5,Exactly what I needed
5,Works wonderful! Didn't need to adjust the holes at all. Just plugged them in and turned them on. Highly recommend these I would happily buy them again.
4,good protector at $
5,Cool!
5,Not much I can really say about these they are cheap high quality and you obviously couldnt find a better price anywhere else. If you need two surge protectors look no further because this is all you need.
5,Works as expected
5,Thanks. Works as expected. It comes in a pack of (2)
5,Great
4,Standard surge protector. Pretty ugly but it's hidden away any way. I wish it had a flat/angled plug in to the wall.
5,Cord is extremely short but I dont need a long cord
5,Great products.  This is my 2nd purchase of the same item because I need more (there's nothing faulty about the previous ones).  Good quality.
5,Awesome product as usual very well built and does what it's supposed to do. Great quality as usual from Amazonbasics amazing price and great product. I'm very pleased with this purchase
4,Does the job but it has a very short power cord length.
4,Good for inexpensive equipment but would buy something with better Joule dissipation for expensive components.
5,Great value and safer than doubling up a socket
5,We've had these for a year and a half without a single issue.UPDATE: It's now been 2.5 years and they still work perfectly; haven't had a single issue.
5,I've never been disappointed with the AmazonBasics items I have bought.  This 2-pack of surge protectors is no different.  The quality appears to be sufficient and they do what they are advertised to do.
4,Ok for the price.
5,AmazonBasics 6-Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip 2-Pack 200 Joule - Blackgreat deal -  would get again
4,I just wish the cord was a little longer...
5,My electric equipment
4,work good the only problem with them they are not heavy duty they are very lite and if dropped would probably break
5,Works as expected
3,Good outlet. Main problem is cord was shorter than I thought it would be. Needs to be close to outlet and had to use an extension cord to make game system reach the surge outlet
5,Does the job. Good price
5,It's fine!!
5,One of them just went out after working for two years straight. It was a good value buy for me.
5,These are great basic power strip and surge protectors. I plugged them in and will never look at them again. The best part is the price you can't beat $5 for one. Amazon is my cord and wore conection
5,So far love this product! Love that it lights up to let you know its on!
4,Good product. Durable.
5,Live with them plugged in
4,Love these moved into an apartment and needed some outlets for the tv and some lighting! work great
5,As expected
5,I always like to have back up power strips. There fit the bill just fine! Plus I love the Amazon Basics brand!
5,Work like they should.
5,These surge protectors are quite a good deal.  They seem to be well made.  The cords could be a bit longer.  I would recommend this cord length for use on a counter or table.
3,the wire is pretty short and very thick and stiffthe orientation of the plus would be better 90 degrees rotated with the current layout a lot of plugs block one or two sockets next to them
5,Great quality for the price
5,Item arrived prior to expected date. It seems well made and durable. I would definitely recommend.
5,Glad to see this device offered in black to match the electronic devices used. Works we'll. No issues.
5,Great value for the $.  Does the job for the price of a pair of cheap power strips with no surge protection.
5,They serve their purpose. Cords s little stiff
5,Can't beat these for the price alone. Good all around surge protector. No bells or whistles but will get the job done for basic needs.
4,does the job...
4,Great for the price
5,For the price looks to be good quality.  Until now are working without any problem.
5,Great product. No complaints. Safe buy
5,These are easy to use and are helpful in curtailing my energy usage when the appliances to which they are attached are not in use.
4,Not too bad for the price. Functioning fine so far.
3,Short cord but functional
4,power cord is kinda short but all in all ok product
5,Used it for refrigadoor
5,Good but wish it had longer cord. Totally my fault as it does specify. Otherwise good.
4,The outlet is surprisingly compact. It works as expected however the power cords are a little short.
5,Good deal
3,Cords short  but other than that I have no complaints.
5,Great product wish the cord was longer
5,Great power strip.
5,It’s not the long but it’s good for everything
5,Exactly the size I needed and great value
3,It's OK but whats wit the short power cord? I have other power strips/surge protectors with much longer cords. I decided to keep them because I can use them in areas that are near electrical outlets. These strips are affordable and work fine for my needs
5,Good Product.  Does what it says it will.
5,Works as needed
5,It does what its supposed to do.
5,Very handy for short extensions
5,This is a very good product.
5,Great for the price!
4,cant tell if it is on or off
3,They work fine but seem a little too sensitive. Could not run my Kuerig coffee maker with 2 cell phones charging at the same time. It would trip as soon as the coffee maker started to heat up.
3,Meets basic requirements.  Nothing fancy.
5,So far so good. Used for playstations. No problems that ive experienced in past 3p days
5,Good value
5,I have these all over and the house hasn't burned down yet.
4,Cheap but will get the job done.
4,Works fine looks better! Just kidding. They look like SURGE PROTECTORS. But work fine. That much is true.
5,What can you say? It works feels well made and the price was right. Plus stuff in and its powered.
5,Word as intended do NOT plug one into the other it won’t provide enough power to your 2nd strip
5,Great to have these! They work great so far and I trust that they will hold up for quite a while based on how durable they look.
5,good product works well
4,Works fine but I received white not black
5,Item just as described. I like that there is a light that will go out when the product has served it's purpose and needs to be replaced.
5,Use these in my shop for lights and other things
5,Greate for what I needed
4,needed more as all i can say
5,No frills surge protectors. They won't win any awards for their aesthetic design or materials but they work and that's what matters.
4,Basic electrical strips for a decent price. Not the fanciest but great product for the price.
5,As described
4,just what I needed.home running out of outlets
5,Exactly as described cord length is great for smaller areas
4,Work well
5,Cheap functional power strips need to run some outlets?Want it surge protected?Don't want to spend too much money and too lazy to go to the big box store?Amazon got you fam.
5,I plug in so much stuff into these. Provides that sweet sweet electricity. No instruction necessary.
5,Still in use months later no problems.
4,They work cord is REALLY short though.
5,Good product
5,Perfect for the price and worked as advertised.
4,Good overall. The wire can be a bit longer.
5,Amazon Basics are great products. I know these are a simple item but they were priced well and the quality is good. A job well done Amazon
5,Home use
4,They appear to function as expected
5,just as described
5,Arrived on time and was exactly as described. If you’re looking for a great product and are concerned for the safety of your electronics then this is perfect!
4,A
5,Good value for the price.
4,soso
4,Great for the price
5,I bought these just to clear up all the chords and plug ins. Very nice they are slim and 6 plugs is very useful
5,Appear to be decent quality and work as they should. The cable is very short so don't think about using this as an extension lead.
4,good item
5,Very functional Surge Protector outlet
5,Use both for my TVs and gaming systems. Have had zero issues. Highly recommend.
5,Great bang for your buck. They aren't as high end as a name brand surge protector but they will do the trick. Only negative the cords are shorter than I'm used to.
5,Bought a ton of these for a large training session.  I've got no complaints.  They work really well and hold up just fine.
5,Hey it's a surge protector - It Works.  Delivery was Fast and Cheaper than a hardware store - For Sure!
4,Work as expected
5,Short cord but gets the job done!
5,The cord is a little short but other than that great quality
5,was a gift they loved it with electronic I sent
5,They work. You plug stuff in and they turn on. It's a simple concept that has been passed down from generation to generation.
5,I only needed one of these Outlet sergers but along the line we always can use a second one. Works perfect
4,No issues
5,It works perfectly! I would definitely recommend! Thank you!!
4,Prompt delivery and product exactly as advertised.
5,We're can I saying they work as advertised. Would buy again
4,Core too short but my fault I guess
5,They work really well and the price is right for the two that come in the package. Good if you have a ton of wire gadgets that need charging
3,Wish the cord was longer but works great
4,lt's good except the short strip.
4,Work as advertised. Quality product
5,Good cheap surge protectors. I've ordered 8 of them. They all work well.Just received numbers 9 & 10. You can’t go wrong with these things.
5,Great quality for the price
5,Easy to use. Bought to clear up plug behind tv and does it’s job. Nothing fancy
5,The product looks great good price and fast shipping time.
4,Does what it's supposed to do
5,Great product
5,Great product good price
5,Sturdy design. I'm sure this will last for many years.
2,They function although I'm not sure how well they actually protect devices from surges.The outlets are highly inconsistent in grip strength. I can plug in a device in one spot and it will hold as tightly as one would expect an outlet or surge protector to hold it. But the next spot will so barely hold it that the (quite light) weight of the protector is enough to completely release the plug from the socket.
5,These do what they are supposed to do. I have not had any issues with them like others reported.
4,Exactly as I had expected.
5,They REALLY WORK!! Saved me untold dollars when I got a power surge from my power company. A must have for anyone who has poor electric feeds!!
5,Successfully powered several devices exactly what a power strip is supposed to do with the added benefit of surge protection. I also like black. win.
5,Good quality. Serves its purpose.
3,Cord is pretty short
2,I know this was in the specs for the product but I assumed the cord was a reasonable length. The cord is not long enough for the surge protector to reach the ground when plugged into the wall outlet--it is so short! So we're still using it but it hangs from the outlet. I would have preferred they just sell one of these with a longer cord than package with two that just have an impractically short cord length.I didn't spend much time researching this product but wish I had now.
5,Great power strips. Have almost all plugs filled and haven't had any issues. Would buy again.
5,The price was great
5,We have a bunch of these at our house & yet always seem to run out of them. They work well!
5,if you need a basic surge protector just get this one.  it works and does the job.
5,These worked perfectly for the spaces I need them for! Great quality!
5,serves the purpose. I do not plan to plug anything expensive into these and hope surge protection protects them. good extension strip..
5,Just like every Amazon Basics brand product I've ever purchased these work great. Five stars.
4,Would like a longer cord. Otherwise a standard power strip.
5,Very easy to install and very handy.Great price.
3,They work good.  Decent price.  No issue after 8 months of usage.  The outlets sometimes are too close for bigger plugs.  If they were like 1cm further apart then that would be great.
3,The mounting holes on the back do not work they are only for show. The way the plastic is molded you cannot get a screw into it. I took them apart and filed away some plastic so I could mount them.
5,Good product well made
5,These extensions are great feel sturdy and look nice next to my furniture. Work as expected and the switch light is a nice feature so you know there is power going to it.
5,Its exaxtly what it describes. Not bad.
5,Great cord length. Most surge protectors have cords way too short.
4,Commodity product but it is an easy way to shop. The price was reasonable.
5,Good no frills  product.  Very reasonably priced.
5,Serves the purpose.
5,I didn’t realize it contained two which made the price even better. They work great and I’ve been happy with all my AmazonBasics purchases.
5,Easy and simple
5,This is the second time I've purchased these surge protectors. I know they work because the first one I had endured a power outage and thunder storm. It still works fine and all of my attached electronics still work great.
5,Works well personally wish the cable was longer but that's my bad because it clearly says the length in the description.
5,It’s a surge protector.  Yes it works. 🤷🏼‍♀️
5,Great value! Does what’s needed.
5,Works great
5,Good price for a 2 pack
3,The cord is too short and I have to buy an extension. Also the slots stay too close to each other so that only 3 to 4 of them can be used at the same time.
5,they work good. have not had a surge so don'r really know if they would trip or not.
5,No issues or concerns.  Works as hoped.
5,Satisfied with product
4,Nice basic surge protector.
3,Sturdy  good material wish longer cord length.Comparatively cheaper
5,My life has become so much easier since I realized I could order everyday household items the minute I feel the need for them instead of writing a note or trying to remember on the next shopping trip.
5,It is perfect.
5,NICE LAYOUT EASY TO HANG /HANDY OFF/ON SWITCH AND GOT AT A Bargain PRICE
4,Happy with this product
3,Works fine but if you want to mount this to a wall or under a counter try another product. The two mounting/slotted pockets on the back are poorly designed and I can't find a screw or a nail that works effectively to keep it secure.
3,I should have double-checked the length is only two feet but otherwise it works great and you do receive two!
5,Great small size power strip just size I needed.  Works well
4,Ok ty
5,Needed a new surge protector for a new portable A/C unit.  It would have been a great deal for 1 but this 2 pack made it even better.
4,Nice but just wish the cord was a bit longer is all.  But what I needed them for they work fine.
5,Like
3,Its cool. Not fancy at all and it shows.  But i didnt want to spend $20 plus $$ so im happy about that.will buy again and only ding is the switch is a littly crappy but so gets the job done
5,Great! Will order again
4,Works fine
5,Does the work for such a low price.
5,Gets the job done and provides protection through the fuse. These were so cheap I bought a few to place around the house.  They're quality too with light indicators.
5,No problems so far. You get two of them as well .
4,VERY GOOD.
5,Very happy with this purchase and works as expected with no issues.
5,You get what you see here nothing more or less!
5,Great for indoor light duty use.  good price and I LOVE Amazon Prime '1 touch ordering' and free shipping
5,I like the two extensions I have and hope they will stop any surges for My appliances I have plugged into both of them.
3,Price is nice but it works not good.
5,THESE WERE REPLACEMENTS
5,Simple straightforward protected outlet solution for more than reasonable money. Can't ask for anything better except free. :)
5,Works fine. Great value.
5,So far so good. Does what it says used as expected.
4,Power cord is rather short only about 2 feet. I like that they are black.
4,it does the job working just perfect.
5,Good power strip good price.
5,pretty sturdy.. stays put.. just big enough for my uses
5,Everything was as expected.
5,Search protectors are very well-made and I like the color black.
5,As pictured work well
4,Works as expected. Cord could be longer otherwise great!
5,Works great. Came in fast.
5,Costs less than what 1 unit would cost in the stores. Works well.
4,Basic power strips. Good quality for the price
5,They are much more expensive in stores
5,Delivered as stated in the description. Get what you pay for.
3,Doesn't really allow for extension- buy a longer cord.
5,As expected- good value.
5,Not much more to say. They haven't caught fire so that's a plus. They seems to be working properly.
5,Just like any other one
4,These work as expected so far. Can't beat the price.
5,They do what they are supposed to do. No issues and the plastic seems quality.
5,Love Amazon Basics! These surge protectors are perfect for our house and we trust that they're doing their job!
5,I bought four. They work great!
5,These are a great deal if you're looking for basic power strips. Works great and seem well made.
4,Can't complain! It's a nice price and works well .... just need the cord to be a little longer though.
5,What do you say here they work. Nothing bad to say happy I purchased.
3,I'm not satisfied with this product. I don't recommend it to any one. I hate it!
5,Easy to use. No problems
5,Just what I wanted.
4,Good but cord a little short
5,Price can't be beat for these surge protectors. I wish that I would have bought the models that have a tad bit longer cord but am still very happy with these power strips.
5,Works as intended. Plugs slide easily in and out. Thick wiring is safe though is a little less flexible than you'd see on other ones.
5,Works like they should at an excellent price. Time will tell how they hold up.
5,These are working great and I have no issues at all. I will buy more of these if I have the need.
5,Great product and protection
5,Does the job
5,I like them. They do what they are suppose to do. The chord is super thick though and hard to maneuver so you are warned.
4,ok quality
5,Works as should
5,Works as advertised
5,Good products! Use it very comfortable!and very cheap!
5,Perfect
5,Great
5,Very good product
1,Bought these. One of them has already stopped working after a few weeks with a cat fountain and a phone charger plugged into it. I don't trust the other one.
5,Works great. Perfect length
5,Love it
5,Its a low cost power strip. I purchased these to keep in my camera gear bag to plug light stands into. Not much I can say. Solid plastic construction and switch to turn power on and off.
5,A must have for those living in the area is prone to electricity spikes. A lot cheaper than those sold at retail stores.
5,Works well
4,Nice value.
5,Just what I wanted.  Great space saver. Especially if there are few outlets.
5,Great thanks
5,Good deal
5,it is fair price to invest protect any electrical device.  so far so good.
5,Does the job.  Have had for a few months and no issues!
4,Ok
5,I like the 'AmazonBasics' items. It's good to know they have their own products.
5,Not expecting a quality surge protector just needed a short cord power strip.
5,Good priced reliable product.  Would recommend to a friend
4,The cord is a bit short. Needs to be about a foot longer.
3,Really needed this for my room/ computer. Extremely helpful
1,MY laptop(mac) and iPhone started heating while I was charging them using this extension chord. I think the chord has grounding issues or something. My electronic devices behaved weirdly if plugged to this. I sensed  the touch bar on my laptop behaved very wrong (it was giving me friction or vibration kind of sense) and it took me 2 days to realize that it is coz of the charging from this chord. I recharged my laptop using the port in my house[which are grounded properly] and the issue with my laptop was gone.I would advise if you buy this then use it for lighter voltage items like I use it to connect my lamp now google home etc.
5,Excellent product!
5,Its alright
5,Whats better then one surge protector at a Great Price well that's two at a even greater price
2,Couldn't plug into one of the outlets (the metal contacts were mis-formed blocking the hole).  Overall these are really cheap power strips.  Based on how cheaply made they are I wouldn't rely on the surge protection at all.  They do make 1 outlet into 6 but the outlets are so close together that you can really only use a couple per strip.You get what you pay for and with these you don't pay much and you surely don't get much.
5,Llego rapido y buen aritculo
5,Great power strips for the money.
4,all good
5,Cheapest power strips I could find and they work great so far. The plugs don't feel loose the plastic doesn't feel cheap and the wire is nice and thick.
5,good quality
5,Got what the picture shows working great so far.
5,Good item....great value!
5,Long enough for any purpose.
5,Installed no issueswill reorder if needed..
5,Great value. I'm using one on the back of my wall hanged tv I used double sided 3m tape. Will buy again!
5,Does its job
5,Perfect for small dpaces
4,Cords could be a bit longer.
3,Not all of my cords that I would like to plug into this works. Some of them are simply too big. However they do work well with the ones that fit.
5,Not much to say. These are inexpensive power strips and they are working well for us so far--bedside lamps electric blankets and iPhone chargers. No heavy duty demands on them.
5,Item arrived as ordered and pictured... Very good quality product and safe packaging.
5,Works as expected
5,Great cheap power strips
5,Best Price and quality product from Amazon basics.
5,Works great as intended nothing to complain about here.Pros: perfect price pointCons - could have more outlets.
2,The power strip is fine. Trying to mount it was very difficult due to the way it was made. It looks like the plastic was not cut out correctly. I got the 6’ power strip it worked much better. I wish they would give you the screws needed to mount this.
4,they work
5,A good product to have.  Comparable to other surge protectors on the market
5,I was needing some surgery proctors that had shorter cords and these fit the bill.
1,I wish I had taken a picture. But apparently at some point it melted and burned at the prongs. I got lucky nothing worse happened.
4,These always come in handy in any household.
5,Love it
4,Very useful But have a very short wire.
5,Excellent price. You can't beat it. They are very modern looking. They don't have surge protection but that's ok.
5,They get the job done and at a great price. Not the most high quality but great for my application.
5,Great value. Will buy it again
5,It's funny to say but these are life changing here's why: you can turn a two slot outlet into 10. Crazy useful.
4,thanks
5,good
5,Very afforadable price and reliable quality.
5,For the price I wondered "How good can they be?".......but they are excellent quality and better than hoped for.
5,As advertised
5,Well made. I am happy with this purchase and would recommend
4,Work well. Short cords.
4,These work fine. A little shorter cable than I was expecting but still good.
4,seem to be good for the money
5,Have had for about a week now and works as advertised
5,It's super affordable and performs as expected. Liking it a lot so far. Well built.
5,AmazonBasics 6-Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip 2-Pack 200 Joule - Black works as advertised.
5,Standard surge protector. Works well. I'm using them for our nightstands to plug up all our electronics to charge at night. This was a good value for two. The cords are short though so keep that in mind.
5,What can really be said other than these are cheap and get the job done. Would buy again.
4,So far so good
5,Works as intended.
5,They work great
5,Works fine
5,Got a few OT these for the house. Working well so far
5,Great!!
5,Great deal for two surgers for the price of one! Work just fine and as they should. I use them for my Christmas lights outside on the porch.
3,Keep in mind the actual cable that connects the power strip to the wall outlet is pretty short but it is still a good product.  Honestly no different than any surge protector strip you would get from any other store.
5,they work great! no complaints :)
5,Simple and cheap like any amazon basics product lines nothing to add satisfied !
5,very nice if you dont want to use screws to mount just run to home depot and pick up some 3m double sided tape and it mounts perfectly.
1,I was using  this to run my desktop  computer  and a space heater...maybe too much. I had a phone charger plugged in to the plug above I took it out and noticed that the outlet and the plug to the power strip has burned up. It was still powered on and running  everything.  It was not hot to touch so it happened  who knows when. This looks like a serious  fire hazard.  How did it not switch off when this happened?! How was it still functioning?  This is terrifying!
5,Everything came as described and promised
5,It's good
4,Works as expected
5,Love these and they work grest
5,Great value and does the job.  No problems.  I haven't plugged anything with a high-power demand; just phone chargers lamps and a radio.
5,Perfect for the money.  I just needed them for my elderly parents to plug in everything they need in their bedroom.  These are perfect.
4,should have ordered two more
4,Works fine.
5,These surge protectors are a bargain! Would definitely purchase again.  They work great no issues.
5,Really good price for the surge protectors. I have them plugged in under my office desk and behind my entertainment center and they do the trick.
5,Perfect for home use and with surge protection makes it great product
5,I live in Texas where we have frequent thunderstorms and these are worth their weight in gold after saving our devices from power surges caused by lightening.
5,Needed this for our Christmas village and it works great. Just as described.
5,Love these surge protectors. Good quality. Great value. What you see is what you get. Can't go wrong! And you have lots of outlets for charging and powering your devices.
5,These are great power strips for the price! They don’t feel cheap at all.
5,Worked perfectly.
5,Its a basic power strip that serves its purpose. No frills at a cheap price.
5,Does exactly as it says for a lower cost than Walmart! You definitely won't find this price anywhere else.
3,I'm sure that these willwork out fine but be aware that the two foot cord is too short for a lot of applications. So really these could be 5 star surge protectors in the right environment. My bad for not realizing how short two feet is.
5,Good p/v
5,They're standard surge protectors. I like that they have a lit switch so that you can easily see when they're on/off. The cords are fairly thick so they'll likely take a decent amount of handling before they break.
3,Should be five stars if....I had only looked and seen the length of the cord. The value is not here on this one for me because the length of cord makes it not useful in normal situations.
5,These are great !! For the price definitely worth it I will be buying products from amazon again ! Btw this is a 100% legit comment no scam.
5,Great value of the price! I have them plugged at all busy spots in my house.
5,Great product just what I ordered...
5,THEY WORK FOR MY BAND'S SOUND REENFORCEMENT
5,Nice dark color for my new dark wood floors!
3,Outlets are stupidly close together and you can't plug anything large on it. The switch is weak. The slightest force on the switch could shut off the entire thing on accident
5,Great product for the price point and works very well no issues
5,Haven’t had any issues and i have been using them for 6 months
5,They are WHITE!  I wrote on them in permanent marker indicating use [ie desk bookcase etc] and room.
4,Wish cord was longer
5,Seem to be a good product
3,The cord way too short
5,Good produce. Saved my computor at power surge
5,Nice little power strips for the price point.  The AC cord is rather short so just be aware
5,Cheaper than PX in Korea serves it purpose
5,These are cheap but good quality. This is the second set I've purchased for my home equipment.
5,Fast delivery and good deal
5,Much needed especially after losing electronics from storm
5,No problems.
5,They do their job in an old house that has power surges and blown fuses all the time. Appreciate this.
5,Perfect for traveling
5,It’s a power strip with a good cord. 5/5
5,These surge protectors do their job have had no issues with them so far happy customer.
5,These are perfect just what I was looking for.
5,I have a couple reptiles at work & needed these to put multiple connections & so far no problems. No overheating or malfunctions.
5,Can't stand the sensation of terry cloth. Running six hair driers at once has decreased my air dry morning routine severely
5,Short-ish cord but great for the price!
5,Good quality. Great price. This is just what I was looking for.
5,I loved these  and you get 2!Will buy again.
5,For the price it's great!
5,yep.
5,Needed these two to power a set of electrical recliners in our living room...Love the indicator lamp.
4,Excellent it served my purpose
5,Awesome
5,Works great if you need a low joule surge protector. No complaints
5,Great. Thanks
5,These work as intended and the everyday low price is great.Cord is rather short si check which length you need
5,It works
5,Excellent buy
5,Seems like I'm always needing one of these and these work just fine.  They are a good value too.  Recommended.
5,Well satisfied with these strips.  Makes life much easier to have these in areas where we need additional outlets for all our chargers and miscellaneous lamps etc.
5,It's a surge protector plug and play. Doesn't get hot under load. However these do have a rather short cord (not worth a star but is worth mentioning).
4,Good quality for the price paid.
2,When I purchased I didn’t realize the box contained two power strips. Turned out to be a good in one way: one of them has already stopped working! Am wondering how long the second one will last. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.
5,Bought these for Guitar Pedal work they're excellent
3,I thought these were longer cords---thought they said 5 ft and they are only 3 feet.  Won't work for what i need.
5,El producto está perfecto era lo que esperaba tamaño exacto lo recomiendo 100%
5,These power strips work exactly as expected. At less than $6 each they are a great value. The cable portion of the strip is built with thick cable which is exactly what you want.
5,Use these all of the time around the house and they work great and they really do provide surge protection
5,I use one in my bedroom and living room for low amp items.
5,no real significant difference between these and the major brands beside the price tag!
5,Surge protector for tv. Haven't tested it.
5,this has a short cable but having two with the price of one is very good. it does not over heat and as soon as i see the protection light on i feel safe.
5,This was a perfect gift for my college student. Works perfectly for all his electronics
5,Good value.
5,At $12.49 a 2-pack of these is a deal. Good quality. If I had it to do over again though I might have spent more & purchased units with longer cords. I measure these at less than 2 feet!
5,Great product.
5,I have used surge protectors in the past. These are the greatest surge protectors ever!!!!!
4,So far so good.
5,It's a power strip. You get 2 of them. They're not designed to be sleek. They stick out from the wall but at this price point it is a great deal. I'd buy them again.
4,Short cord
5,Work great. A great buy and a perfect price. I almost bought one at Walmart for 6. But this is 2 for 6$. A deal.
5,Me sirve para múltiple uso de conección de mi TV y otros artefactos.
5,great power strips
3,The cord is shorter than I had hoped but it does work.
5,good power strips.  Nothing fancy just what I wanted..
2,Purchased these to replace some older power strips and tried to plug in one of the new surge protectors into the grounded outlet. For one the cord is way too short but that's beside the point. The main issue I had was with the surge protector's prongs. The prongs would not fit at all into the outlet. I don't know if this is some sort of defect or what but I initiated a return.
4,Short cord
5,Great alternative to expensive electronic store power strips. Peace of mind that they have surge protection.
4,Edit
5,Does not take up a lot of space.
5,Product works as advertised. Was pleased with it as soon as i opened ut. The quality more than exceeded my expectations especialky considering the wonderful price.
5,I would not take these traveling.
5,Fye
2,This item cannot be mounted to the wall properly. It is important to me that this item is mounted to the wall because I saw from other reviews that this item can be a fire hazard and I do not want it to burn up my carpet. I'd rather be safe than sorry.
5,Perfect. Good price. Typical surge protector. I suppose I wont know how good they are until there is a surge lol
5,This is a great deal! And the surge protectors I received are working just fine!
5,Works great
5,Good product
5,These were perfect for my daughter’s college dorm!  Would recommend and purchase again.
5,Forgot where they are but they must be ok because I do not know of a problem.
4,Very short cord. Other than that it's perfect.
5,not the best built power strip i have and it doesnt have the best surge rating but it is exactly what you would expect
3,Saved the box hope these prove to be good and don't burn out as my last ones did with hurricane Irma lost surge protector and items plugged in.
5,good so far
5,N/a
5,Good. But if the wire is longer it will be  perfect products!
5,it was ok
4,Good product haven't had any issues with them shorting out or anything and the price is hard to beat. Definitely recommend.
5,I bought multiple of these - love them!
5,They get the electrons from here to there effectively. Haven't burst into flames yet so that's a bonus.
5,I like the idea of protecting my electronic items from spikes in electricity.
5,Works well and I really like the color
5,Great quality very well priced and do the job
5,We plugged these in & they work exactly as described.  Simple product with a simple price
3,Worked well the three times I got to use it.  Make sure you clean it and wash it out before putting up. The leftover fertilizer ate up battery contacts. Just threw it in the trash.  Battery compartment not sealed off.
5,Come on
5,No issues
5,Good product.
5,Forgot to check how long the cord would be wish they were longer but that’s my mistake!
5,So works well. Cord is somewhat short but majority of them are like that.
5,So far so good
5,Good price. Wasn’t paying much attention. Thought I was only getting one. it was for two.
5,For a room that has only one outlet
5,better than making a run to the store for 1 item
5,Perfectly pleased
5,Recently bought four of these for use for battery charging and they work great! Compact and the wires feel durable. Excited for more years of use.
4,Cord is really short so make sure you take how you will use it under consideration when ordering.
5,great!
5,Does the job!
5,Love them! Now I dont have to play adult Tetris in my kitchen to pick and choose what stays plugged in or not.
5,Great value for great quality. Gotta love Amazon.
5,Great. Amazon will soon take over the world with their super cheap basic items. No complaints works as described has lasted with no issues.
5,Cord lenght is short but anyway good product
5,Good purchase for these stormy days
3,These work great. Haven’t had any issues. I just wish the cord was longer.
5,Great product
5,Works as promised
5,the surge protector for 6 outlets was exactly what i wanted. and it is safe.
4,Sturdy and reliable.
5,Works great
5,I could use another set of these. The price was good too.
4,Thanks
5,solid as expected.
4,Fine product
5,It's still working to this day. Glad I made the purchase.
5,They’re great what can I say they work  as avertised.
5,Works and can't beat the price.  I used it in the shop and it runs everything just fine.
5,Can't say if they actually protect in a surge or not. But they give me more spaces to plug stuff in.
5,Great price for performance as with all other Amazon Basic stuff I have purchased simple no frills stuff that works.
5,Yeah they do what they say they will do no more no less.
5,It works
5,works fine. was surprised at the cost of shipping though.
5,They work well and it’s a great deal
4,Super basic but works when you're in a pinch.
4,It's working! Ain't that all that counts?
5,Good deal well made
5,They worked out well.
1,Noticed a weird sound coming from it randomly brushed it off but it kept happening then a horrible smell yep it was the plastic on it melting. Extremely unsafe.
5,It works just as good as a store one with a cheaper cost
5,Surge protection is obviously minimal but for a power strip I have used a dozen of these in the past 2 years and they all work all the time.
5,right amount right price. could have been a lil longer
5,Can't go wrong great price and I like that they are 2ft long cords.
3,OK but not the best quality. Electricity sparkles appear quite oten when I plug something in. I'm not sure how safe they are.
4,Good price for basic protection.
5,Excellent thanks
5,Great product for the price. The line could be longer for better performance. Ideally add a 5V usb please.
5,Would reorder.
5,Good value working just fine.  I bought them over a year ago and no issues at all.
5,works Great.
5,It’s keeping our electronics powered so yay
5,UNBEATABLE VALUE.  CERTAINLY NOT TOP QUALITY BUT FOR THE PRICE IT FAR EXEEDS EXPECTATIONS.  WOULD BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN.
4,As advertised...
5,great all around grounded plug
5,No issues
5,You can never have too many o the outlets with surge protectors and this is a great price.
3,Cord really short but that's my fault. I should have measured it. Still useful however.
5,Item as described
4,I wish the cord were a bit longer.
5,Bought for son's dorm room at college.  Plugged it in and he immediately has all the outlets he needed for his electronics.
5,low-value power protectors with the right price
5,I believe it to be a good value
5,Works great Lights are bright. only complaint is the cable length but I also bought the 6ft cable power strip and it works just as well. these were exactly what I was looking for.
5,Great for the money. Has worked great for normal use
5,Works as it should.
5,Perfect honestly use one to charge my electronics the other for my fan.
5,Smaller Than The Power Strips I Buy Works In The Category Of Excellent❗❌📱
5,Excellent product for the price. I have paid double this before for one surge protector (back in the day :-)
5,Exactly what I needed for my living room. Good value for the price. Working flawlessly since 2 months.
5,its works there nice and definitely cheap
4,Worked well but I wish the cord was longer.
5,Works well
5,These surge protectors are super useful and extremely good quality for the price.
5,Works great no complaints
5,This is a simple power strip but it does exactly what it should!
5,Decent price for something simple like this
5,Strong material
5,Good value good product
5,Price is right and they work. Not much more you can ask for.
4,Very nice product.  Worth the money.
5,These are very basic but who needs anything fussy in a surge protector?  They do exactly what they need to do.  I will absolutely buy these for the price and quality again.
3,This isn't a product issue it's my fault because I didn't look at the length of the cord before buying it. I needed something with a longer cord so these are sitting unused for now.
5,I would purchase these again!!
4,Good
4,easy to get
4,I like it
5,Great product!
5,What can I say?  It's a pair of cheap 6-outlet surge protectors that function great.  These items perform as described and are solid pick-ups from the AmazonBasics brand.
5,Great and gas surge protector
4,These are as good as it gets for the price.
5,great price for some surge protectors. we have these around the house where we keep our laptops TVs and cell phone chargers (bedroom living room)
5,Basic power at a basic price. I would not want to plug high-end stuff into one of these "protectors" (I use Monster for that) but they are fine for USB chargers etc.
5,Gets the job done.
5,Working great
5,They are very good for organizing all the cables under my desk . I love how looks now.
5,I would give these a solid 'Meh!'...i mean they don't show a very high build quality but for 2 for 9 bucks i'm not complaining. so 5 stars.
5,As expected
5,As advertised
3,One of them started smoking and was completely dead the other one seems to be working fine
5,Exactly what I ordered and works great ..so happy to have extra outlets to
5,This surge protector is very convenient and does the job.  They were on sale 2 for 1 when I purchased them.  I would recommend it.
5,Great price for this product
5,Not much to say good solid product works as intended fast shipping got exactly what I expected. No cons.
5,Recieved these very quickly and they work great. I love the light to let me know they are on and working as they are in a dim room. Great product and works great.  I would order again
5,Does the job
5,Now I can afford to safeguard ALL my electronic gadgets.  Now there's NO EXCUSE not to be protected.
5,Works comes with 2. Are you really reading powerstrip reviews right now?
5,Items are as advertised and work perfectly.
5,Expensive
3,The outlet works great but the wire is too short to reach practically anything in my house. If the wire were two feet longer this would be a five-star product.
5,Solid surge protector use two of them with no issues solid Basics product have mice and other PC stuff in that line that works fine and the price is reasonable.
5,Great Product Great Price does everything you need them to.  100% would recommend them to a friend.
5,great
5,They...work. Like any surge protector/power strip. Haven't had a case where it'd trip though but 'til then I'd say they meet my expectations at a nice price.
5,😑😑
4,ok
4,Wish the cord was a bit longer but otherwise great.
5,Good price
5,Great surge protectors.
5,Received product it was as described
3,If you need an inexpensive power strip these are just fine. They feel cheap and the cords are very stiff. I wouldn't buy them again.
3,The cord is very short so it will essentially need to be right near the outlet it’s plugged into.
5,What can you say about power strips? They were cheap and they work. A couple months in and they still work.
5,It's a power strip. Hard to mess that up.
5,Don't hafta worry about power surges french-fryin' my lil'laptop!
5,Excellent
5,Inexpensive and product is as expected.  Should I need more of these around the house the Amazon Basics 6-outlet surge protector power strip will be my go-to.
5,I can now plug more things in than I could previously.  This is pleasing.
5,Excellent product at a great price and fast shipping!
5,Perfect surge protector for under my desk at work!
4,work as described
4,Good basic set but needs longer cord
5,Very much needed.
5,Perfect for a cheap power strip. Haven't been able to test its functionality during power-surge events but it has been solid thus far.
5,Very adequate surge protectors.  Cord is kind of short but at this price it's a no-brainer.  They work great.
5,These work pretty well for being cheap
5,Thx
5,As advertised.  Have many of these and none have quit yet.  Good value for the price.
4,works great
5,Just as described!
5,Good product well worth the money
2,Previously used.  Package was previously opened and re-taped. Both surge protectors were dusty as though they were used and repackaged.The one the I plugged up works but I don’t appreciate buying something “new” that’s clearly used.
5,Great value but wish cord was bit longer.
5,Great quality product. Came in perfect condition.
5,My cats don't swat the power button on this model.Probably not a planned feature but is the feature I need most.
5,great deal 2 for 10 is pretty hard to beat. plus they're just surge protectors. it's pretty hard to mess up basic electronics like these.
5,Work as expected. Love the light on the protector to let you know when you have power. I have plugged something into every oulet and didn't have any issues.
5,They work and they're cheap. What's not to like?
5,Good value. No problems with these at all.
5,Looks great arrived fast does job
5,These are great quality. Best price around especially for the quality.
5,Ok
5,Really convenient for small spaces. The price is great.
3,Not bad could be cheaper.
5,Just what I wanted. I was surprised that two units were included. I would have been satisfied to pay the price for one.
5,Just what I needed.
4,Works great just wish the initial cord was longer.
5,Good value for what I needed
5,No issues - whats to say?  It works the way it's supposed to.
4,Be aware very short extension cord.
4,Good quality and a good bargain.They work well I'm impressed for the price.
5,Good product works great
4,Great to have especially for holidays and to replace old ones.
4,Cord is just a little too small but good if it's not your issue...
5,Good outlet port
4,I am lucky to have both of them working. Good power handle. Wish the cable longer.
5,for greenhouse garage or shop and must to have
3,Works well enough but Amazon used inferior LED lights in the unit which causes it to flicker constantly.  Happened on 4 separate units I bought.
4,Good workmanship and solid construction.
4,They qork
5,It’s a surge protectorWhats to tell
5,Always could use more of these!!! Never had a power issue!
4,great surge protectors. very minimal protection but I was mostly looking to expand my outlets more than anything else.
3,I like it. but the price could be more lower.
5,Does what they are intended to do
5,It works great just like the ones in home depots.
4,good.
5,What can you really review about this other than it was affordable price and works just fine. Have had them for couple months through some pretty good thunderstorms. No surge issues.
5,These are a really good deal. I had some older surge protectors in my house and decided it was time to replace them.
5,My second pair. The two have worked as they should the last few months. Sleek looking and well made.
5,Nice
5,I've had these for almost 3 years and they still work perfectly.
5,Great
3,You get what you pay for
4,Purchased 25 of these for the office. Have worked well although 1 was dead on arrival.
5,Great price and I love the color so they don’t stand out under my couch.
5,Fast shipping. Product as described and the best price.  Happy with purchase.
5,Good
5,Great
5,Costo y calidad
5,Great price and I don’t see a difference in quality or effectiveness.
4,These work well for the price. These work well.
4,as expected
5,cheap and effective
5,Very affordable will again just place 2nd order  you can't go wrong ✔✔✔💯💯💯
4,The cords were very short we ended up returning these.
5,Awesome. The cord is short as is expected but it gives you so many extra outlets.
5,Very functional device at an exceptional price.  Read a public review about this product and decided to try it.  Glad I did.
5,Impossible to find locally they are perfect for dark wood floors etc. short cable doesn't need to be rolled in circles on the floor .
5,Electricity yeah
5,ew
5,Great item(s). I love how easy this order was to place and how quickly it was delivered.
5,Good stuff.
5,Good product

5,Recently found out on the news that these expire after a few years so I replaced all of mine
5,These work great and for the price are even better! I haven’t had any issues with them.
5,These work great with all my devices needed many more plug ins and these did the trick!!!!!
5,Great value
5,Absolutely no problem with these! They are such a great price and they have protected my laptop printer TV and a mist diffuser from storms! Such a great buy for a cheap price!
5,Good quality Nice Product!
3,Cords are way to short
5,Great
5,I liked this product
4,Nice - they work great.
4,Works like they should
5,Really a good outlet.
4,Nothing fancy but they work :)
3,Works well but you can see that it is not high quality. I would purchase it again but not for any of my expensive electronic equipment.
4,They work fine short cord though
3,I hook a microwave oven onto this. And it overload and jump off every time at 4th minute.
1,The cords are too shorty and strips are too short. My son told me to order these . Sorry I was just disappointment. They work fine just need longer cords
5,Great for the price!
5,They work way well and are way cheaper than others.
4,Shorter than expected but durable
5,Exactly what I thought it would be!  Happy to find this on Amazon.
5,Good product and a great price
4,They work like any other surge protector.
5,A bit plasticky but it works as expected
5,Working well so far... and I like the black ones they don't stand out as much!
5,A must
5,great price on functional power strips - what else can I say they get the job done
3,Meh
5,Hopefully this will protect my stereo from power surges !
5,Received product as described and happy with purchase.
5,I had some issues on tv equip from former plug strip so far new ones ok.
5,Cord is not long as expected
5,Work well
5,Work great! Exactly what I needed no problems.
5,Works
5,Perfect.
5,Works great. I'm not a "techy" person but I can charge or plug in 6 different cords and my phones charge and my lamps turn on... Every time.
5,Just as described and a great price for a reliable set of surge protectors.
5,Still works
5,Works great - use it in the office for all the different electronic cords
2,The slot opening on the back to hang this product don’t have the proper area to slide onto the screws which cause the to fall off. I guess if you want to use it on the floor with all the wires showing it works. But that not how many people will use it. Cheap price but you get what you pay for. Poor design....
5,Replacement policy is simple and fast plus the product itself is solid quality!
4,as advertised
5,Great quality. Great bargain. Didn't think I needed two but within days the kids needed another one. Amazon Basics have yet to let me down.
4,great value and the quality you would expect from amazon
5,Decent outlet panels. 200joul Perfect for small electric devices charging in my bedroom.
5,Shipping was so fast! I needed a second power strip and then it was just there because it came with two the first time.
5,Good basic surge protectors. I have a laptop monitor and a few other electronics hooked up to each of these and everything has been working smoothly so far.
4,It is basic but good quality
5,So far so good.  Affordable and my tv has not blown up. Also arrived promptly.
5,no problems with them amazon basics are really good quality. they don't feel cheap at all.
5,came in a package of 2--just what I needed.  Delivered promptly and not damaged.
5,You can never have enough surge protectors and at this price they are awesome!!!
5,Excellent!! I ended up buying these after regretting buying another brand that instantly broke on me ... This is a great deal and do exactly what they should. I love AmazonBasics!
5,These work way better then expected
5,A great deal 2 for 1
5,Perfect short-cord power strip.  Easily reaches from normal-height outlets to the floor.
5,Nothing to compan about here. Two surge protectors with 6 working outlets each.
4,Affordable surge protector.
5,right price  right size to take with you when you need to plug in extra electronic devices
5,Good value
5,Yup it's a surge protector and it works perfectly well. Very useful for homes with a lot of electronics.
2,These cannot be mounted to the wall reasonably. The hole for the screw to slide into is not deep enough. To be clear it is where the screw slides in not where it is initially inserted. If you are mounting on the wall go with something different.
5,They seem to do what they should. Not much more to say about it. Good price too.
4,ITS great  for my offee!
5,These surge protector power strips are very good. I use them in my office for small appliances and lamps.
5,These power strips work as expected.
5,Great price and this set  they work good and probably will be buying more soon.
5,Works just as expected and super fast shipping! I wanted a way to easily turn off electronics to minimize standby power usage and these fit the ticket.
5,Works great! Perfect for small spaces
5,I've had these for a few months now and they're fine.  It does the job at a good price.
5,The Amazon Basics 6-Outlet Surge Protector Power strip works great. I recommend the seller to everyone.
5,Works perfectly.
5,Works great for a great price!
5,As advertised and met my needs at the right price.
5,Pretty basic item that's been around for decades so pretty hard to mess this one up.
5,Obviously there isn't much I can say about these as they are only power strips with nothing special... They work so that's a plus.
3,The barcode sticker says the item is black which is what I actually ordered. But the actually box says White and so is the item that came.
5,Loved it
5,These work great. I have bought a lot of these and they do what they need to do!
5,They work well and the surge protector is a nice piece of mind
5,Works well
5,worked well
5,Good surge protectors
5,Great product works well
5,They’re very great for dorms
5,Good quality both work and arent cheap feeling

3,sleeping could have more down at this price
4,Happy with the chargers. Were delivered as promised.
5,This is a great product and very reasonably priced!
5,Overall very satisfied with the product.
2,I ended up using one between my couch and a side table which was okay but not where i intended to use it. I kept them since they weren't too expensive but there are better options out there.
2,Cord length is just too short to get anything meaningful attached to it. The item also arrived a few days late while it showed delivered on the app!
5,just as promised!
5,Great product and value.
5,Great price and they work just as expected.  I run all my electronics through these.
5,AS EXPECTED BUT PRICE WAS GREAT!
3,Length of the cord is very less. Do check it before ordering if this serves your purpose. I ended up returning this cord
5,great product
5,Exactly what we wanted!
5,they work and look nice to.
5,Good value for the money.
5,Was able to plug in two lamps when I normally only had space for one.
5,Worked
5,Excellant
5,Too short.
5,It may be impossible to have too many outlet strips for low power devices.
5,BUY IT! Worth the money for 2 power strips and the black makes it last longer (color wise). Stop reading and buy it.
5,Just what I wanted
5,Simple and functional. Great value for the price. Not much else to say about these great surge protectors.
5,You can't beat this deal!
5,Its just what I need.  I love the twin pack so I can protect all my electronics and appliances.  Very reasonable price.
5,Just what I was looking for and at a great price.
5,Great clean looking product.
5,Professional and durable
5,simple and not crazy packaging very solid product
5,Work as expected and good value
5,Works as expected without any issues. What can you really say about a power strip unless it's defective?
5,Worked out great for me.
5,It works and it's cheaper than most. I don't see a reason to knock off a point.
5,These power strips are great! I have been using them for little over a month now and I have had no issues. I definitely recommend these.
5,as advertised. construction seems pretty robust compared to cheapo ones at harbor freight or big box stores.
5,About that for my grandma
5,good
4,haven't tried them out yet but they look fine as advertised.
4,Works as advertised. Light cheap plastic
5,Good
5,College dorm must have!
3,Cord length could have been a foot longer.
5,Solid power strips.  Cord is long enough for most purposes.  Good price.
5,Haven't had any issues yet. Seem to work fine. They provide the power needed to my devices. They're not too long just fyi.
5,Great basic product. Good price for a good product
5,Been several months and they still both work. Can't beat this price. Thank you.
5,Value for money. No issues.
5,Blends in with my Black Computer and now i know its safely surge protected because of Amazons Quality Products!
5,Nice for the money
5,Don't buy a name brand. These work perfect and have held up well.
5,Needed a cheap surge protector for college. Works like a charm
5,Both of them work perfectly. In my small apartment where I need a lot of plug ins these work perfectly.
5,Nothing fancy it just does what it’s supposed to do. I have no complaints at all
2,For the price they work fine. I bought them for my classroom and they charge what I need them to charge. The issue is that they don’t turn off. The on side of the switch works. But the off side does not. So they’re constantly on.
4,They are power strips. They work.
5,Cool
5,Gets job done for decent price.
5,Thanks
5,simple way to protect my stuff
5,I have these in my room constantly on and a fire hasn't started yet soooo They're pretty good.

5,Fast delivery & it works as advertised. Nothing much else to say about it.
5,6 foot chord would be better.
5,This is a power strip. It provides power to any device I plug in to it. Not much else to say.
5,Saved my electronics from a surge and they are cheap!
5,as expected
5,As expected
5,Shipping arrived in a timely manner and product is as advertised
4,No complaints just wished the cable was a bit longer.
5,These always come in handy especially if you don't have enough outlets. Plus it's a surge protector so I feel safer about using them.
5,im happy with this purchase..
5,Works as expected. I have only had them for a few days but I will update every so often to keep others informed.
5,It's a powerstrip. Lol it isn't broken yet
5,They did the job as are described!
5,Good product as advertised. Would recommend.
5,What's there to hate?  They are cheap and works great.  Just don't use them to for your $1000000 sound system.
4,Works Well
5,It works! What more can I say other than the fact that it works with whatever electronics I've used it on.Got two because I plan to start a massive TV show.
5,Great bang for your buck
4,good
5,Just what I needed price was good for 2 as well.
5,Awesome texture

5,These work great. Very happy with them
5,Great surges. I use these to power tv and video game and they work perfectly.
4,Simple works.
5,Great deal! A must to protect your computers at home.
3,big enough for plugs but the wire is kinda too short. in general it is just okay
4,Works as they should. Good value.
1,These items were delivered on 11/9I used one of these immediately upon receiving it. It seemed to work fine.The second one I plugged in a few days later and it never worked properly. It flickered off and on and was totally unreliable.I came home a few days ago and the other surge protector was doing the same as the other. flickering and loss of power for no apparent reason.I had thrown out the boxes so the two useless and poorly manufactured surge protectors also went in the trash
5,Only thing I wish the cord was a little longer.
4,Amazon products are really good...work well
5,Make sure not to short it out with heavy appliances...
5,Standard six outlet power strip. Works fine has an orange power light. Very lightweight indoor household use only for lamps and clocks. Probably not heavy enough for shop tools.
5,I needed extra power circuits !!!!!!
4,Great product
4,Fits our needs very blends into floor better.
5,These are good quality power strips.  Work as expected.
3,Works but Power cable too short can't read from outlet to desk surface.
5,easy and ready to use
5,Simple and does the job
5,I live in the lighting capital of the U.S. surge protectors are a must for ALL electronics...THEY are great.Thank you.....
5,very good basic strips better than the local stuff that looks like they are fire hazardous. Great buy cant go wrong
5,excellent！
2,One side of the receptacle metal contacts bent inward the first time I inserted a plug (right after opening the package) making it impossible to insert a plug. I managed to bend it back but upon looking inside the rest of the outlets all of the metal contacts on that side are slightly offset toward the center meaning they all risk being bent. The other surge protector it came with does not have this issue. This suggests poor quality control on this product.
5,Love em
5,Beep beep = it is what it is.
5,No problems no sparks no electrical problems everything’s great!
5,good
4,Works as expected
4,good for price
3,Nice price for the product.
5,I thought it was going to be just one outlet but it's actually 2!
4,as expected good basic product
5,Excellent for what I needed it for
5,I have two of these and they get the job done. I just use them to charge my phone tv ps4 portable ac unit laptops etc.
4,Provides the necessary outlets.
5,Very happy!  Smooth black color and bright light.  Cannot say on the surge protection ability but it is sturdy and it is an awesome value
2,The light on this thing is extremely bright. Like much brighter than any other surge protector I’ve ever seen. You can really place this is any visible location.
5,Good enough for what I needed them for. Just to plug my cell phone in
5,very nice and I am very happy
5,Just what I needed for my room.
5,Great product for the price and fast shipping
3,Very tight fit. Plugs had to be forced to go all the way in. Concerned. Can update later if works out ok.
5,Perfect twin set!
4,I wish the cable was a bit longer.
5,Good price for 2
4,good for the job for which they were made.

5,Great value if you do not need a long cord.

3,So far so good. I needed a couple of basic surge protectors and the price made it a deal I couldn't pass up.
5,Thanks
4,Cord was too thick for convenient usage and unnecessary for the wattage rating.
5,Great product at a great price
3,Wanted more than inches for cords. Few could reach.
3,The cords are very short no light on switch to tell you it's on and upon further though- these won't be being used in my home.
5,Awesome pack for the price!
4,It is enough cheap to meet my expectation.
5,in-expensive power strip bundle. light works to let you know when the power is on or off. What more to say great buy ^_^
5,Great quality
5,Super cheap super useful.
2,When they came the cord on the end of one didn't seem to be in all the was. So i set it aside and pluged in the other. I then started to smell something burt and plastic smelling. I got online to check out what others said. And immediately filed for a return.
4,Works as advertised.
5,Works exactly how it is supposed to.
5,Nice deal. Good price. Surge protectors work as they should.
2,What you pay is what you get. This does the job but I highly recommend not using it for multiple power-using products. I use it just for charging my laptop and phone. It heats up my charges so much to the point where I'm afraid it'll cause an electrical fire. Had to buy another brand. It's okay if you are using it for lamps
5,Good for collective on off needed
5,Works exactly as intended. Provides extra outlets.
5,Works
4,they work great and the price is better than good
4,Great value buy.
4,I only give them a 4 because if they were metals they would be 5 stars
3,Just a little rough workmanship
4,GREAT PRODUCT IF YOU NEED EXTRA PLUG SPACE
5,It's a surge protector.  What else is there to say about it?  I plug stuff into it the stuff works. Ta-daa!
5,They work great and cost less than almost all of the alternatives. I'll buy again.
5,Works well can’t comment on surge protection as we have not had any power surges.
5,For the price good deal. Work fine
5,Fine for the money.
5,TWo cheap but reliable outlets. Does the job for a great price.
5,Really useful and good price if you need to have more plug ins at your room
5,Just right
5,No frills extension strip.
3,Too short cord. If you need longer cord this is not for you.
5,Bought 8 probably will buy more.
5,Works well
4,Nice. Well built and packaged excellent.
5,I like these a lot. They are sturdy and well made.
2,While functional  clearly no one ever tested the key holes on the back of the unit.  The plastic is not fully cut away  and so no pan head or machine screw can actually slide into the slot.  I was forced to use an alternative meathod to permanently attach the unit.
5,very nice
5,Great deal!! Needed these and beats many prices in stores. Thank you!!
4,Good quality decent product at reasonable price.Packing was frustration free.
5,We haven't had any power surges since I received these. But they work fine day-to-day.
5,These are nice surge sticks. Good quality...don't have to worry about my house catching fire...lol
5,Cheap as dirt good quality and connection; heavy cord.  Does not have long power cord (I wanted these shorter cords to interface with my UPS.
5,Excellent
1,I thought that we used the cord wrong. We plugged our new cord into an extension cord and it arc flashed when we pulled it out of the extension. Thankfully I wasn't burned but it was a close call. Both the cord and extension cord were melted. I just saw an article from cnn about problems with Amazon basics cords catching fire and realize this might not just be a problem with us.
4,Now everything is in order.
5,Working so far so good after the first month!
4,Look at the picture the cord is quite short. Beware
5,Does the job
5,Good product great price!
5,These work well. I've not had any issues. I'm happy with the purchase.
3,get what you pay for already broke the case trying to mount one on the wall.
1,They left out important information on the website.  In the manual that comes with them it states:"Do not install this device if there is not at least 10 meters (30) or more of wire between the electrical outlet and the electrical service panel.""The device features and internal protection that will disconnect the surge protective component but will maintain power to the load - now unprotected.  If this situation is undersirable for the application follow the manufacturer's instructions for replacing the device."THE UNIT WILL TURN OFF THE SURGE PROTECTION AND NOT TELL YOU!!!!!
5,A good value.
5,Simple and useful at great price
5,The outlet gives me more devices that i can plug in and plus with the surge protector i don't have to worry about my devices.
5,Great product for a great price.
5,Good Product
5,Have protected us against multiple surges. Work great and high durabilty
5,Perfect no issues
5,Good for price
5,These work as designed and are a very good deal.
3,Me agrado agrado pero se ve que los materiales no son de calidad
5,AROUND MY AREA STORES I WOULD PAY WHAT I PAID FOR THE SAME FOR 1 BUT HERE I GOT 2. GOOD JOB GUYS. I WILL BE BACK.
5,Exactly what in expected
5,As described.
3,The cord is pretty rigid and is bent so it won’t stretch out.
5,they worked as intended no issues
5,They work just like you'd expect no problems at all and very cheap
5,Love that this was a two pack...  Work fine and have a nice low profile...-0
5,Working great so far! Tv PlayStation c hrostmas lights all plugged in and wonderful.
5,They work great & we got them at a good price
3,It's a surge protector all right. Only problem is it only works once when needed. After that you have to throw it out. No reset button.
4,Works great
5,it's a good inexpensive power strip
5,loved the deal where I got two for almost the price of one
5,Solid
5,Short but it works
5,This are excellent and inexpensive surge protectors.
3,Cheap poorly made
5,2 power strips and they work great

5,Good product
5,good value enough outlet used for the living room mostly
5,Your basic

5,No complaint about the product works very well.
5,Works perfectly no problems no complaints and has power surge protection so u don't have to worry about damaging your devices
5,Nothing to dislike about this product.
5,It works good.
5,Another successful product ordered
4,OK. Spacing could be larger between plugs.
5,Nice surge protectors..
5,Helped to get rid of extra cords - much neater.
4,ThankYou
4,Cheap small and reliable so far.  It fits the bill.
5,Nice price for 2 surge protectors.
4,Very nice.
5,Cheap and reliable
5,Be the plug
2,The cord is not really  long enough  it does the job just really wish the cord was long enough
5,Can’t go wrong with these still working great after a year. Solid buy.
5,Great product great price.  No issues.  Use 27/4
5,It works. Didn’t even have to read the directions
5,Best price for exactly what we needed. They're small enough to hide behind furniture.
4,Good price for cheap power strips.  Good for everyday use.
5,Exactly what I needed as expect would recommend
5,Nice surge protector not super protection but just what I needed and the price was great!
4,works nicely
4,Great value
5,Bought this because it was cheap and you got 2 power strips. They work great and definitely worth the money!
5,Very happy with purchase
5,Have used the Amazon power strips frequently
5,They work.
5,Great in case of power outages. My electronics are protected! Thank you Amazon Basics!
5,It's a basic surge protector nothing fancy but nothing wrong with that - don't need Bluetooth on a surge protector. Great price reliable so far.
5,Works
2,One of the surge protectors was fine. The other one shorted out or something after about a month. The light still comes on reset it back and forth checked the outlet...definitely something happened to the power strip. Even unscrewed it to check and see if I could see what was happening but couldn't find anything. Good price but as with all things at a low price might end up with a lemon.
4,works well.
5,Price is "GREAT" ; small and works. I will order more.
5,Electricity is wonderful.  If only the economy were made of electricity instead of pies.
5,They're great good quality and arrived fast. You never know when you're going to need a power strip around.
5,Works good.
4,no surprise works good.
5,Good
5,Great price. Many Thanks to my American friends and all the workers of the Amazon.
5,They work!  I love the sleek black color.
4,Works as expected!
5,Great price. Works well. Nothing negative to say.
5,Ok
5,Surge protector strips.  Works well - fine quality.
5,What a deal
4,Great price!
5,They work well.
4,good price work well
5,Nice
5,Like
5,Just as described.
4,Cheap works as advertised.
5,It’s a plug
4,very good price & quick deliveryrecommend to buy
3,One didn't work but maybe I was unlucky because the other one works perfectly at least so far
1,To hang this on the wall- the cord must go up the wall not down (not what I expectd)  When placing the holes in back over  the screws  on the wall and adjusting it to fit there isn't enough space to tightly grasp and hang onto the screws.  I tried 2 different types of screw heads (screws are not included). Finally I had to drill the grasping part of the hole a little bigger. It's not very sturdy once you get everything plugged in.  Would never buy again to hang on wall.
3,Not bad
5,Awesome Product !
4,Watch out for the extremely short cord.
5,Perfect for my stereo system.
3,It works but there is a short in one that developed later. pretty annoying when I'm trying to charge my controllers or phones and this thing bugs out on me.
5,Multiple plug is what I needed
5,Great value. Have been using them for a couple of months and have had no problems.
1,It's a power strip it only has a couple things that it needs to do and it fails big time at one of them. The mounting screw hole are sized to accept a #6 or #8 screw but the keyhole is formed incorrectly and you can't slide it over the screw. If you don't want to mount it then great but if you do look elsewhere. I'll be returning these.
5,Great quality and price
5,As expected
5,This product works
5,Really happy with it works well
5,Happy
4,They do their job
5,These are tried and true. Saves electronics from getting fried.
5,Good product
5,great product
5,Exactly what you expect! Good quality!
5,Just as good as any other
5,can't beat the price great quality does what it is suppose to
5,I will recommend this product. Good for the price.
5,These outlets work great and are cheaper than name brand ones. Highly recommend.
5,I wish the cord was available in 3 ft. length but 2 ft. is fine.
5,another great Amazon basic product. nothing fancy but it works well.
5,Nice simple surge protector. Not the most high end but they are right for the price and work great!
5,Products are as described.  Work perfectly. No complaints. Easy to switch on & off plus great price.
5,Good value ..
5,They work.  Remember your local fire codes before chaining these things; I shared this with my brother on a separate circuit breaker.
5,Just what it says.  A basic surge protector.
3,Product works as expected but cords are extremely short
5,Ok product
5,Perfect!
5,great quality and great price!
5,Does what it's supposed to do and is reliable. Couldn't ask for much more from a surge protector.
5,Does what it's supposed to do
4,Does the lob.
5,Great surge protector for the price.
5,I only really needed one but for the price I'll take an extra. They work perfectly.
5,Works as expected and good price for pair.
5,Does the job!
5,Bought this after learning some lessons after this very active hurricane season. Arrived very quickly.
3,Honestly it works fine I just wish the cable was longer.
4,So far so good!
5,It works a sturdy
4,It's good but little bit short length.
5,Serves its purpose.  No complaints.
5,You cannot beat the price for two surge protectors. They have been working great for me.
5,Nothing much to say good quality at a great price
5,great
4,Ok
5,great buy! Very reasonably priced work well!
5,Works very good!
5,It's pretty standard works has a switch inexpensive. What more do you need?
5,Very simple device plug it in and it works.
5,Great! Thanks!
5,Good quality  multiple computers
4,great price. gets the job done.
5,Pretty straight forward no issues so far.
5,Perfect! Works great!
5,Works as a power strip. What more could you want?
5,Excellent quality surge protectors at value pricing! I have bought a number of these and haven't had any issues. Can't go wrong!
5,Love the fact that you get two of them.
5,Good
4,excellent
5,Awesome perfect and the price is great
5,affordable and they do the job.  Not much else to say about a surge protector lol
5,Works as advertised
5,These are cheap and unlike any other cheap power strip I trust it to actually be UL listed and not catch fire.
4,cord is pretty short
5,It's delivered very fast. No complaint so far.
1,the first protector i used  lasted  a week then blew the GFCI surge protector that was on that circuit. I tested the Amazon surge protector and it had a dead short in it.  It was protecting a circuit that drew between 5 and 10 amps.  My neighbor used the 2nd one to protect his laptop  computer and desk lamp (60 watts) and it tripped after 2 hours. I went to the hardware store  bought another one and  everything is fine no problems  1 month later. I believe they are junk and would not recommend them.
5,Same as title.
5,Great
5,Very good quality
5,They both work great .
1,These are terrible and not safe at all. I had one in my kid's room and it was an electrical hazard. We are lucky nothing caught on fire.I would stick with GE.
5,Like it
5,Great value!
5,This power strip works as expected.
5,Just what I needed!
5,Great buy for the price.
5,The outlets work perfectly no issues for me!
5,Serves the purpose! I like that there are 6 outlets.
5,Good product
5,It serves its purpose.  I love the light that it gives off very unique.
5,Cheap works and no issues!
5,Great power strips that work as expected. Cheap yet sturdy and solid. Good buy
5,Work great and the price was great so I purchased them a second time. I now own 4.
5,Very nice  especially for the price they are working great
5,Love Amazon Basics products - always what you need and at a great price
5,Very Good
5,Matches equipment color. Hides well.
4,Work as expected.
5,Black hides the cable better than White. Quality looks good
5,Perfect for what I needed it for.
5,Works well
5,They work just fine.
2,All of these positive reviews have to be fake. These are awful. Started acting up after only two months of use going on and off or only staying on in certain impractical positions. But you get what you pay for I guess.
5,All of it perfect
5,Worked great. No issue. May purchase 2 more.
5,Buy it now its worth it
5,What's to say?  They work great as most Amazon label products do.
5,Great
4,works for what I bought it for. Not too much money either.
5,very nice
5,It works
3,They do their job but I found another surge protector/power strip that also had 4 USB inserts.
5,Great.
5,Work nice
5,Quick delivery and the product works as described.
3,Bought two of these one works just fine other one makes the circuit breaker pop so I an unable to use it.
5,They are what you expect for the price. Not cheaply made. You're average basic surge protector
4,Good
5,Excellent protectors
5,Great product for the price!
5,Two for the price of...you get the picture. Good quality.
5,Good price
4,Worked like a charm
5,Works well
5,needed for new home/school office area - glad they were a two pack - best purchase
4,A+ thank you
4,It is worth the price.
5,I love it
5,I use one of these for my computer stuff and the other for my fish tank stuff. No problems for me.
5,Great buy. Fast shipping
5,Good price
5,Useable; stereo.
5,Good
5,They’re basic and work
3,Like
5,Sturdy easy to use.
5,Great price - works well.  Helps in electrical surges and brown outs.
2,The light weight  of this outlet  gives  the impression of be a cheap product.The old one didn't hold well the plugs but the construction  is tough
5,Good
5,right on time and does the job so far.
4,outstanding for the price.
5,Reasonable price
5,Great price for a great product!Look no further this things are awesome.
5,Super nice and cheap!
5,Good quality for the price
5,Gets the job done just be mindful the cord is short.
2,I had to take one of them apart and resolder a cold solder joint because it would not work. After that no problems...
4,as described
5,Its a power strip it either works or it doesnt. Fortunately mine works.
5,Verygoodthank amazon
5,Not much to say....they are power strips and the price was good!
4,Works well. It is what it is. A power strip.
3,The keyhole slots on the back of the strip did not fit any screw I could find.  Was difficult to securely mount.
1,These seemed very flimsy even for bargain power strips. I'm usually very satisfied with "Amazon Basics" but these were unusable immediately after plugging them in they partially lost power like there was a loose connection with the LED on the strip dimming. After a few moments of moving the strip around I discovered it was an issue related to the cord but it affected both units. I'm honestly a little afraid to even leave these plugged in or anything to them. Fortunately getting a refund was completely no hastle. I still need to go buy some replacements somewhere tho...
5,Not much to say. I bought these to replace one which was shorted out by spilled liquid. Working great after a few weeks.
5,Convenient but the line is little short
5,USED THEM AS SOON AS I GOT THEM
5,Excellent outlet
5,Not much to say about surge protectors other than it works and it isnt bulku
5,Very durable so far only had it a couple of months but holds up well
5,As advertised
5,they work nothing else to say.
5,Happy with the product.
5,Not heavy duty but they work and they deliver electricity to the jacks.
5,Haven't tested the surge protection yet but works great as a power strip.
5,Great product! Awesome for the price in the two pack. Would buy again if I needed more.
5,I am SHOCKED the quality of these outlets. (They are good)
5,Simple good price works as intended.
5,Great value
3,Not premium looking. But does the job.
5,no problemsuse for surge protecter
5,It not bad
5,Nice price works as good as any name brand. I would buy more.
5,Standard power strips - have sturdy cords and don't at all feel cheap. So far have worked great.
5,Good price. Fast Shipping.
5,Nice surge protectors. I have been using both of these with my aquariums. I highly recommend them.
4,fair product
5,Works as intended and reasonably priced.
5,Great product only wish the cords were a bit longer however these worked for what I needed.  Shipping was very fast.
5,Both worked. No surge yet so jury is out on that feature...
2,The cords are too short  to make this useful  for what I needed and I am unsure in what scenario they would really be useful because of this. I appreciated that Amazon gave me full credit without making me return them however since they were so inexpensive and the shipping would have been more than the cost.
5,No issues. Works like the more expensive ones.
4,WORKS WELL
2,Would not use with any high value applicance or device. Two pronged polarized plugs fit in only one of the outlets. I saw no obvious reason for this and chose not to disassemble to investigate. Three pronged plugs fit all outlets.  I will be returning the product.
5,I'm very happy
2,after having it a few months. the plugs are very loose and something is moving around inside of it. it works but the plug holes get loose and the cord falls out i will not be getting another one. very cheap.
4,The cords should be about a foot longer
4,seems ok haven't tried it yet.
5,Perfect for what i need
5,Great quality for the money.
5,It's a power strip.  How complicated can it be?  Nice size for my purposes.
5,Great
2,The keyholes on back for mounting allow only one position for the strip: vertical wit the switch up.  Most other power-strips have mounting keyholes that permit several orientations.  Also the orientation of the power outlets is not efficient for "wall-wart" power supplies.  A single wall-wart can use up 2-3 outlets.  If you are using for regular power cords and not mounting it it should be fine.
5,Great for the price
5,Well made and durable.
3,Power cord too short
5,bought for my son heading to college. arrived on time as described. happy buyer.
5,Perfect 2 pack great deal
5,Simple gets the job done. Early but seems durable thus far. Great price for a pair.
5,Does it's job.
5,Good
4,great product!
5,Does exactly what it’s supposed to do.
5,Work very good for my mom in puerto rico
5,title
3,Product was good however after few days switch isnt working.
3,They don't fit well into the wall. You have to bend the prongs to get a snug fit into the outlet.
4,These work pretty well so far.
3,Super basic. Nothing fancy. Does the job. Best product for the cost.
5,Nice
5,Perfect for my needs. Came as advertised. Very light.
5,Good surge protector
4,Good product just cord is short.
5,Great for the price.
5,love it
5,No issues works great. Build quality is solid. Another  great amazon basic product.
5,will get again
5,These were exactly what I hoped they'd be. They work perfectly.
5,They work as I expected. The price was awesome.
3,Cord was much shorter than I thought it would be. My fault for not reading dimensions.
5,So far so good.
5,works as expected.
5,Good value purchase they work!
5,Good product. Received on time and works great
5,These are sturdy well-made and do the job they are intended to do. That's pretty much all I ask for in a surge protector.
5,Nice size and perfect for all your needs
5,Perfect size and works great. The price was reasonable and for two of them was a great deal.
5,Shipped great great deal 2 for the price of 1 and they work perfect.
5,Excellent
5,Great
3,Did not last long before the surge protector went out.
5,I've had some problems with surges after I put these to work problem solved
5,Don't feel cheap things don't fit loose... totally recommended...
5,I mean...it's a surge protector. It works. What else do you need??
5,Should have bought longer lengths
2,Cheaply made bought the 2 pack. One is used under a desk where it is accidently touched by feet often. If the cord is touch at all it loses power and has to be readjusted. I can't tell you how much work I've lost on my computer because of this.
4,Awesome!
4,Exactly what I expected when ordering.  No complaints!
5,The cord is shorter than most but I guess that's not a big deal. Works good.
5,Very nicely built.  Good product.
5,Perfect
5,Excellent.  Did exactly what i needed.  Good price and even has a on/off switch
5,Does the job. Simple product. Works. Done. lol
5,Great price.
5,Good
5,Haven't had a problem with them. They aren't the highest build quality but nowhere near the lowest either. I would recommend them.
5,Came on time and Works PERFECTLY! THANK YOU
4,good item/
5,👍
5,i like how it has an on/off switch and it works great. no complaints.
5,Save you're electronics & replace these as they have an expiration date!
5,Works as expected
4,Does what it says.
5,Amazon basics are a good buy. I bought these to have on hand when I need them.
5,Basic affordable. Just as I have come to expect from Amazon.
4,Good product
5,These worked right out of the package perfectly and were priced right.
5,Works great.  Nothing fancy.  Does the job.  Great Price.
5,Extra electric plugs.
5,Great surge protector. Works well and is a great value
5,Don't work good as a weapon. Good priced power strips though.
5,They work
5,Its the best....  Delivery was so quick....  On recommendation  for sure
5,Great product
5,Good product nice price.
3,The cord is super shot
5,Nice for the price
5,I love this!
5,Wire connection is sturdy and thick. Hasn't given me any problems in the 2 months I have used this product.
5,works good. The cord is a bit short though
5,Great product I’ve ordered multiple of them.
5,Great
5,seem to work fine for months
1,During a storm I noticed my house (or close to it) was struck by lightning. I figured my modem & router connected to the power strip were safe as I could still see the red light. Then I noticed I had no internet. Then I noticed that both my router & modem were completely dead despite the strip appearing to be functioning just fine w/ the red light on.If I were you I would find a different power strip.
5,buy again
5,Perfect
5,NICE
5,super amazing. helped me organize my cords and prevent shortages
5,Nice product and reasonable price
5,Works good price
3,Very short and make a weird sound when you plug in certain things but it could just be my charger.  Otherwise it works as intended.
5,As described. The photos are a little different the strip is white
4,Cheap! Works!
5,Love the set of two. Works great.
5,Economical solution for my needs. They are lightweight but I just needed a secondary power switch with a few extra feet.
5,Gud
5,It is a great surge protector.
5,Exactly as described.
4,Looks cheap but works...
5,Cost effective and works well.
5,Work well with my setup!
4,Great price.  They work well.
4,They are power strips and do exactly that.
5,So many holes to put stuff in. It's electrifying!
5,Great items for the price. No issues.
5,They work like they are supposed to do.
5,Good value for the money
5,Works like a charm
5,They work well no complaints.
5,Both work great. Good buy.
5,Definitely worth it
5,Good Quality Material
2,Although the strip itself works like it should it cannot be mounted! The screw holes are fine but the grooves are too short to actually slide onto the screws enough to hold. I tried a variety of screws and nails with no luck.  Very poor design!
5,Works great for a good price!!!
1,I bought four with the intention of using them in different locations.  The first one that I put into use failed immediately.  Also although there is a slot to use to hang the surge protector on a wall it is virtually impossible to actually hang it because the hold is too shallow for any nail or hook.  I threw out the rest of them.
3,Short cord!!!
5,The extra long cord length helps with setting these onto a light stand for seed starting.
5,Good for the money
5,Reasonable price
5,Great purchase for the money. Seems feeble but if it works...
5,Good quality and color
5,They are perfect
5,Loved it. Low price. No different than products that cost 15-25 dollars.
5,Great
5,exactly what I was looking for
5,Works as expected.
5,Works perfectly and the price was right!
5,Awesome product. Great quality
5,Great value for what you get!
5,I am happy with my purchase 2 for $9.99? That's a steal! And exactly what I needed.
5,Does what it needs to! Adds extra outlets on an already overloaded circut!

1,Here is my review I gave this the one for one simple fact is the wire going to the electrical plug is very hot right now it's sitting on my TV stand or if I take it off it will dangle in midair if I had known this I would not purchase this product but for the money I guess I can Deal with it if I needed to purchase something like this again I would not purchase this product I would spend the money and to make sure the electrical stick at least reach the floor

1,The product worked well for the first 2 months but today when I plugged in my Macbook Pro Charger it blew out. Literal sparks came out of the surge protector. I'm thankful to say that it didnt damage my macbook however the charger didn't work for a few minutes. I'm upset my outlet it was plugged into doesn't work anymore moreover it could've damaged my MacBook which I spent a good amount of money on. I would not suggest buying this product.

5,Great for spaces where you have more than 2 items that require electrical plugs. Great Value!!!
5,Love them
1,My house experienced a surge in a storm from lightning and my TV connected to this device was broken. Amazon has ignored my requests on the warranty claim for protected devices for over a week. I cannot recommend that you look elsewhere more highly and could not be more disappointed in Amazon's ability to stand behind their products.
5,Does the job I bought them for. Take little space and have had no problems.
5,It's the quality you expect.  They work just fine.
5,work great really useful
5,There power strips how exciting
5,Worked

5,Very pleased item performs as expected and arrived on time.
2,As many have said in the Questions part the mold for the housing is incorrectly shaped in order to mount on a regular screwhead. Protectors like this have been being made for what 40 years? How hard is it to make that area correctly?
5,quality cord
5,Worked as intended.  Great value.
5,does the job does not hurt the wallet
5,Power strips. They make it so you can have more outlets out of one outlet.Stellar stuff here.

5,They are cheap and they work!
5,Seems good and great price.
5,these are nice looking and work great.  Have them all over.
1,Doesn't work. I thought it wasn't working because I was trying to hook up my AC unit and over power it so I gave one to my roommate since they weren't working in my room. Now I need to use one of them for my desk in the living room and I find the outlets in my wall are good I'm only hooking up computer monitors (so not too strenuous power-wise) but the problem is with the multi outlet. Terrible product I wish I could get refund at this point
5,Nicely made charging strips.
5,Thanks so much! I am so glad to have good products delivered to my door step!
5,Nice and simple. These work well and they were priced very reasonably. They arrived on time and well packaged.

5,Work fine but wish the cords were longer.
5,this product is very good!
4,good deal
5,Works great
1,I opened the box and removed this item and as soon as I plugged my laptop into one of the outlet ports a spark flew out of the end where the red "On/Off" switch is.This was a 2-pack and the other device seems to work fine but now I don't feel safe using this in my home.Shopping for something similar but made in the U.S.A.

5,Pretty good exactly what I needed.
3,Semi useful. Very short cable.
5,Great price and great quality.  I use these all around my house.
3,Cord is too short!  Very basic design hard to fit anything with a power adapter style plug.
5,Works good as surge preventer or power strip extension. Getting 2 in a box is also nice.
5,Very pleased with the quality especially for the price I believe a great deal
3,The outlets are too close together so we're only able to use 3 on each strip...

5,Good product work great
5,Great deal.  Does the same job for less
5,Works as expected.
2,The cord length is a tiny...so from the wall outlet it barely reached the floor. 😔 I had to purchase different ones because of that it's ok if you don't mind it not laying flat to the ground.
3,One of the strips is not working well but I presume it is okay for this price.

3,These surge protectors seen adequate but the cords are very short limiting their practicality.
2,One of the two worked as advertised. The other will short out any circuit it's plugged into and trip the breakers. Accidently shut down a whole conference centers electronics that way. They're cheap so I can't complain too much but would not recommend.
5,Love it
5,Great replacement
5,great products nice to see arrived in good timely manner
5,works great fits perfectly great price trusted amazon product
5,These were really nice and work well.
5,They work good
1,Ordered a two pack of the 200 Joule 6 outlet surge protector in White. Both stopped working after around 15 months. Things that were plugged in to the surge protector just stopped working one day none of the 6 outlets are active. No sign of the fuse tripping and the switch doesn't do anything.Not sure if the switch broke or became electrically disconnected due to age. Not sure I've seen any other brand fail that quickly....
3,cords are VERY short but they work fine.  and good value for the price.
5,A simple surge protector at a low price and you get two of them too.
3,the cords are pretty short.

5,Simple and does the trick.  Price is hard to beat.
1,I received two power strips on August 9th. One didn't even last a month. I had my computer plugged into it and the computer went out like an old TV set that blew a fuse.Then the light on the breaker switch started going on and off. This is the first time I had a problem with something I bought from Amazon. I don't recommend buying this product.
3,One of the outlets doesn't work cheap quality.

4,worked as expected
1,These power strips are dangerous when I plugged it into the wall with nothing plugged into it and turned it on it blew my breaker and popped. On examination whatever exploded did so with enough force to open the case and from the smoke/residue I'm lucky it didn't catch fire. I am done with Amazon Basics and you should be too.

1,I plugged in the power strip with a lamp phone charger and a printer. I only turned on the printer and immediately smelled smoke and it set off the fire alarm. I didn't even try the second strip.Amazon did refund me the cost without having to return the item so that was good customer service on their part.

5,Great price!! Fast shipping A++
1,If  I could give this a zero star I would there is only one word that describes this product  “JUNK”! Yes  you get two products but only one will plug-in to an electrical socket  after trying every electrical socket in my home the other item would not fit ONE socket in my home! Don’t be deceived by the price and the sad part it’s not worth the time nor the money to return.

5,👍🏻
1,Plugged one (from the 2 pack) in plugged some stuff into it turned it on and its happy...Plugged the next one in flipped the switch and kaboom!  Loud pop sparks and smells terrible (and obviously doesn't work).I imagine they are the lowest bidder with typical suspect QA practices... Will probably stick with the major brands from now on.

5,These are great surge protectors at a good price
5,Convenience of buying
5,Great price on a basic surge protector power bar set.
1,After reading disturbing articles reporting fire hazards from AmazonBasics electronics such as surge protectors usb cables/chargers microwaves etc... I've simply decided to get rid of this item I received a couple of weeks ago before even plugging it in once. Doesn't seem worth it.

1,As many others have already documented the so-called mounting holes on the back do not function without special screws or modification of the power strip housing. They also appear to be a fire hazard - I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. Shame on you Amazon for putting your name on these and putting your reputation at stake.
5,They work!

1,Bought two and one of them blew out my outlet. It could have caused physical harm.  Now the outlet does not work any more. It will surely cost e ore to hire an electrician to fix it. This was not only bad but also very dangerous.
2,One of the surge protectors I received has exposed wires...I'm not sure if it would be safe to use so I didn't use it. The other one works perfectly!
5,Great product! Highly recommended.
5,Great value thanks.
2,The cord is so short barely reaches the floor or the desk when plugged it I don't understand who can use this.
5,great item at a  great price
5,The power cord on these is very short.
5,Fantastic deal!
5,Very good product
5,nice useful surge protectors.
5,Nice price
5,Good deal
3,Beware. The chord length is very very very small.
5,Basic but does the function advertised
2,One of these does not work at all! Plugged it in the same place the other is in now and one work's fine the other one is junk!
5,These work great and are affordable.  Thanks Amazon!
5,It works perfectly.
5,Just what I needed

5,Good Quality and good price.
5,good purchase.
5,They work.
5,Good quality product. Totally happy with purchase.
1,working good so far.. it came really dusty though..Edit: The first one is still working good. The second one doesn't work sometimes. For example when it gets moved it'll turn off and turn back on. Its probably some wiring problems.. went from 4 stars to 2 stars.Edit: The second one is now dead. 2 stars to 1 star.
5,Worth the 9 dollars
5,AOK
5,Duh - An AmazonBasic product?  Great!!
5,Typical surge protector works just fine.
5,Great buy at this price.
5,Awesome product the Amazon basics great price point and fast shipping

5,They work as advertised.
5,Exactly what I needed for a good price.
1,The one that functions works well but when you pay for 2 and only get 1 that works it's not a great deal.  I generally buy Amazon Basics brand to avoid this kind of issue so this was super disappointing to say the least.
5,Just what I needed

5,Great product and price.
5,A+++
5,perfect
1,Item arrived in short order. Cord had splits where it connects into power strip. Wires exposed. Quality control could use a person to inspect power strips before leaving factory. Do to cost not worth returning or requesting refund/replacement. Will just wrap electrical tape around and keep exposed wires from being touched.
5,Yes. Just like it should.
5,Looks good and works well. Really good value for performance.
5,simple

5,Thanks
5,in reserve
5,Look nice and very affordable.
5,Good price and value...
1,This does not offer nearly enough protection from power surges 200 joules is pitiful for anything more than an alarm clock. Storm came through and my modem and router that was pluged into this protector both burned up. Get a higher quality surge protector for your expensive electronic devices.
5,just what we wanted
5,Work as expected and cheaper than a store
5,Good value does the job!
5,These items arrived on time and are as described.
5,Good quality and it just works.

5,excellent and for the price just what I needed!
5,work as intended
5,Works perfect. Great price!!!
2,Work very well though but the cord length is not very practical for me
2,Poor product quality.  They have to be moved around to make power connection
2,The outlets are unreliable and do not consistently power devices if moved; e.g. charging your phone may cause your computer to shutdown etc
5,works as it should
5,Works as advertised.
5,Great price for surge protectors

5,They work well and are nicely priced
2,These little power strips are not quite what I expected... half of the outlets make my laptop screen surge and I can't trust that it won't damage my electronics.
5,They work. I'm happy.
5,Thanks!
5,Another great value from Amazon Basics.

1,Recieved a power surge and everything plugged into this went dead.  Smoke was coming from this extension chord so it was fried... but I was disappointed it did not protect my other items from damamge.
5,Very good
1,The power strip worked fine for me but then about a month after I bought it CNN found that this was among dozens of Amazon Basics items flagged as "dangerous" "fire hazard" or "unsafe."
5,As good as expected
5,Just right
3,Very short cord!

5,Customer happy
1,Supposedly new. Did not come new. Was covered in scratches and scuff marks. Obviously this item will not be a center piece to any room we will be tucking it away but it is disconcerting since  I paid for a ‘new’ product.

5,Perfect works great! No problems.
5,Loving everything Amazon Basic.
5,worked
5,Great for the price!
1,I'm not impressed. I thought spending an extra couple $$ would get me a better quality blender. I could have made a smoothie faster with a sledge hammer. I want my Hamilton Beach blender back. First time using this thing since I bought it a year ago. A shame I would have requested a refund.
5,Excellent outlets
5,Super as you would expect from Amazon
5,Works good price is right
5,GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE.
5,nice!

3,Good product and cheap too. fast shipping also.
5,Perfect
5,Work just like they say.
1,You get what you pay for. We had a lightning storm last night I unplugged my TV just to be on the safe side thank God. I lost everything else my phone and cable box didn't survive. The red light is still on which is supposed to mean that everything is ok.... it's totally not ok. I should have bought a better surge protector....
5,Works great. Been using about a month.
5,Worked great.
5,They worked-no issues
2,bad quality I do not like it.
5,Work just fine. They do the job.
3,would be useful if mounting holes allowed hanging with cord below.
1,Don't plan on attaching this power strip to anything.  The sliding mounting slots on the back are defective making it impossible to attach it with any screw head.  As you can see in the pic the screw cannot slide into the narrow end of the attachment slot.
5,:)
5,Good basic powerstrips
3,ok
5,Good
5,Great item and price.
5,Looks ok. We will see
5,work fine good price.
5,Great price and product
5,Good quality from Amazon
5,VERY WELL MADE !!
5,Surge proectors arrived exactly as described
3,TOO SHORT
5,work great like the length
2,The cords on these are very short. If you need any length skip these.
5,serves purposes
5,Came quickly and works great
5,good items Thanks
5,Works perfect.  Good price
5,Works great!
3,Not bad works as expected.
5,goo deal
2,would it kill you to put an extra foot of cable on these? they are the shortest power strips i have ever seen.
1,Both strips keep tripping with single 40-watt bulbs in each  in outlets that have never had any problem supporting multiple devices. These power strips are absolutely the lowest quality such items that I've ever seen. DO NOT waste your money!!
5,They work. That's great.
5,Good Quality Great Price
5,They work.
5,Perfect source of power transfer.
5,Fast Shipping and great product.
3,cord short
2,It’s cheap
5,Power up. They work great.
5,Simple product. Works very well no issues
2,One of the power strips was malfunctioning out of the box.  (ON/OFF switch inoperable)
2,Worked fine at first but then the power output started to decrease.Now it can barely charge a tablet.The phone charges well but slower than usual.
5,Perfect
1,I'd been using this power strip since 2016 and today (May 5 2019) it failed with a bang.  The failure occurred when a short in a connected device created an overload.  The power strip should not have failed before the upstream 15A breaker tripped.
5,Yes works fine and I have no issues.
5,Great Price!! Great Product!
5,great inexpensive product
5,great product.
5,No complaint
5,good
3,the cord could be a little longer
5,Great
5,Item as described.
5,good quality at a great price
5,useful
1,Unbelievable.  There is not a screw made that will make this cord stick on the wall constantly.  Unbelievable bad engineering.  I would return it but I scratched it up so much trying to make it work and it was cheap.  Buyer beware!
5,Great product
5,Good quality. Works.
5,Quality
5,They work
5,Love it.
5,Does the job very well..
5,Arrived quickly. Work as described.
5,As expected
5,Great quality great price.
5,Good product. Great prices.
5,Came as expected
5,Great product for the price paid.
2,Uno de ellos vino defectuoso!
5,This is a great extension chord.
5,bought these for office...perfect size.
2,Surge protectors have 4 outlets but because of the orientation of the ground plug you can only use 2 of them. Somebody wasn't thinking.
5,Great value
5,Great!
5,Its work real good
5,work great!
5,So far so good.
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,Excellent
3,short cord
5,great outlets!
5,Very good thanks!
5,Works great and love the price
5,Great price!
5,Works great - Looks great
5,as described
1,Will they do a recall on these amazon basics ? I bought 4 hard to sleep at night knowing they could explode and burn. Even not plugged in. Please replace.
5,Came in handy.......
3,Average quality.  Good value.
5,work great for several months
5,Was very useful. great price. Recommend product
5,Good quality and works well.
5,Work fine.
3,These work fine cost is compatible with quality.
5,Excellent product.
5,Great item fast ship thanks!
1,This product had a bad habit of pulling out of the socket as seen in the image so much so that if somebody were to accidentally brush their fingers there they are guanrteed to get shock. I have NEVER seen a product that plugs into a socket so badly designed like this EVER.
3,Its Ok of the money
5,Awesome !
5,Works great so far
5,works like charm.
5,As expected easy packaging
2,The cord is very shot makes it difficult to manuver
3,The cords are a little too short!
2,too short
1,The cord is way too short. If I'd have known I wouldn't have bought this. Don't recommend it if you want a long cord which is usually why you would buy something like this in the first place.
5,Very nice overall
5,Economic and conveniently available through Amazon.
5,Great Product
5,Just what I needed
5,good product good timing
5,Great power strips.
3,Cord is too short
3,They seem pretty good time will tell...
5,They work. Great price.
3,Hard to hang it.
5,works great
5,Works Perfect.
5,Good value.
5,good product
5,works well.
2,one broke but one is still going strong glad its a two pack.....
5,good product
5,great product
5,Works great.
5,GOOD PRODUCT
5,Awesome
1,Garbage. Cord is super short it hangs off wall since it is not long enough.  Has bright red light that is super bright if in a room with lights off. Why does a surge protector need a light? I always cheap out to buy the $5 product will buy a more useful $20 one next time. These are going in garbage.
5,Great item for the price.
1,Not all of the plugs work two of them do not work on each surge very cheaply made product which I would not recommend.
5,Perfect!
1,One of the power strips only works if the cord is in just the right position. I would not recommend these to anyone. Great price but maybe worth paying a little more to ensure the item is going to work correctly.
5,Exactly what you'd expect.
5,GREAT
5,Excellent Product!!
5,Work Great!
5,Works well good deal
2,One had a short in the outlet and wire.
5,good
1,Although the power strip has several inlets the cord was too short maybe twelve inches.  The connection needed to be near the plug.  I expected it to be longer.  Disappointed.
3,As described
5,Thanks
5,good
5,Great
5,Awesome!
5,Great deal!
2,They serve their purpose but it's always getting twisted and it's clunky it feels really poorly made.
3,wire too small
5,goood
5,Perfect for my apple chargers!
5,Very Nice
1,If this is Amazons attempt to put their name on products then this is the first flop.  The design to hang to strip is on every strip I ever purchased and I have hung many.  The holes were not big enough to slide it on the screws.  JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK
5,great
1,This is listed as a surge protector but it’s not it’s just a power tap. I needed a surge protector to prevent a power surge and this did not work. Still tripped the breaker.
5,Great
2,Within a month four of the six outlets on one of the units quit working. All outlets on the second unit still work (so far). I suspect there's a reason these are so inexpensive.
5,Works well.
5,Good quality and price
5,Works great
1,If you want the outlet space it does a fine job. If you are thinking of buying this look for something else. I made the mistake in believing it is a surge protector and lost my 3 month Sony 65 inch TV to a surge. Live and
5,Great
2,The cord for this is much too short to be of any use.
2,BIG FAT SHORT CORD  THAT WON'T LAY FLAT. ORDER ONE WITH A LONGER CORD.
2,Cord is wayyy to short.
5,Works perfectly.
3,Shorter than expected
5,great product
2,Perhaps I didn’t read all but I was very disappointed in the length of the cord.
1,Out of two only one power strip works.Light is on but when you plug in TV or other devices nothing works.Second power strip works as advertised.Now i have to spend more $$ to buy second strip.I dont knw if i can return only one powerstrip.lets c
1,These power strips are DANGEROUS. I just tried ONE of them out... I tried or plug in an appliance. It SPARKED And I burned my hand! It could have killed me or lit my house on fire. I should sue....
5,Perfect
1,Just got these surged protectors. When I plugged then into the wall I saw sparks and heard a loud buzzing. My entire apartment electricity is now out...
5,good product good price
1,We recently had a power outage and my sons computer was fried. Ok for just plugging things in but did not protect against a power surge.
5,works as expected
1,One out of two barely worked on arrival (powder would flicker on and off if you moved it around so the cord was at just the right angle it would stay on). The other seems to be working fine so far.
5,Excellent
2,Cords are very short they barely have room to move right below the outlet.
5,Works great!
5,excellent
5,very good product
5,love it
5,Excellent.
2,Got a two pack and only one works.... I should have bought another brand. The build quality feels cheap.
2,The cord was too short
5,Great value
1,One unit seemed fine.  Other unit (brand new) the protected light blinks when shaken or tapped or plugging things in etc.  Feels / sounds as if something is loose inside.  Very disturbing.  Between this and other low-star reviews indicating Quality problems and Dangerous Situations recommend avoiding this product.  Have been happy with all other AmazonBasics products but this one disappointingly breaks the trend.
5,ok
5,works as expected
3,One worked.  One didn't.
5,PERFECT!
1,I ordered two one works one did not The one that did not work is not making contact with the plugs.  the cord is so short and the quality is not what i expected
5,nice product
5,nice
1,Sat in a cabinet untouched for over a year first time I needed it I pulled it out plugged it into the wall (with nothing plugged into the strip) and it shorted out to loud POP and bright sparks. I've never had that happen in my life until now.
1,One worked one did not.Not certain how many stars to give that?Reading other reviews I worry that the one that works is hazardous.Amazon is one of my most trusted brands. And then this product  ............
2,The cord was too short for my liking
1,Didn’t work. As soon as I turned it on and went to set things up it kept saying “plug in WAN cable” even though it was in. I tried plugging the cable into my laptop and it worked fine so the problem was 100% with this router
2,I received two white power strips instead of black as described on the website.
1,As soon as I plugged it in by it self with no any device plugged into the outlets the thin exploded with a a lot of sparks. House lost all the electricity.Dangerous. Do not buy it.
5,great!
2,Material is not quite reliable.
1,I was very disappointed to open the package to find that the power strip was connected to only a 18-24 inch cord.  I needed more than that so I need to swap power around the house and hope that I can use these almost useless devices elsewhere.
1,The "protector" trips whenever I use the vacuum or other high-draw devices. This might be ok for electronics but don't buy it to use with tools. I will be buying a replacement.
2,Its my bad not checking the details.
2,Its power chord is too short to use which is really inconvenient.
2,The length of the extender is really short..
2,I wish these were a foot longer.
1,One of them burnt and short circuited my house.  Nothing was plugged in and the inside ingited. Very scary stuff here.. I am too afraid to try the other 3 amazonbasic outlets I bought all together.  Dont want my house to burn up.
1,Surge protector had become so hot that at some point it melted and pulled apart.  Ruined a light that was plugged into it.
1,Cheaply made. I actually ended up chucking them because I don’t trust them and I’m an electrician. It’s really not worth using something you don’t trust.
1,This item should be pulled from sale immediately heard something rattling around inside before plugging it in. Was plugged to a receptacle with nothing plugged into the power strip and it exploded. Very dangerous.
2,Good
1,We used this for maybe 2 days before it stopped working and it messed up the lamp we plugged into the cord along with it. Don’t buy.
2,Just ok. One of them broke within 2 weeks of using it.
2,The on/off switch broke on one of them with maybe 10 uses..Would not buy again..
1,Brand new everything seemed ok. I bought these in May earlier this year and have used them all of three times. I wasn't jumping rope with them nor playing helicopter but they've come apart at the seams...literally.
2,During the first use one of them stopped working completely.
1,I am a big Amazon Basics fan I tend to trust them over other no name brands.  First power outage of the month and multiple media devices were blown that were plugged into it.
1,Within 2 weeks both units have gone into protected mode for no reason and they will not reset. Spend the extra money and buy another brand.
1,The cord is way too short. It didn't work well for the two places I wanted to use them. I already have one and it has a longer cord and it worked great for plugging in my computer stuff. These though aren't like that. Only buy if you want a short cord.
2,these are a bit cheaper then i expected i know amazon basic stuff is cheap but wow extremely cheaply built
1,Bad design.  Amazon should not be selling these.  Screw channels do not have cutout for head of screw.  Attaching to wall securely not possible.
2,These are cheap and don’t work that well
2,Very short cord.
1,The slots to surface-mount the strip are completely worthless. The depth behind the mounting hole/slot is so shallow that no normal screw head will  fit if you try to slide the power strip onto the screw heads to secure it to a wall!
2,Design was perfect but it did not work with my iPhone 7 Plus.
2,Not long enough. Will not buy again.
2,Don’t function well
1,Was excited to get this two pack of outlet strips. When they arrived realized that the extension cord portion of the strip was maybe two feet long. These are going back.
1,1 power cord had a short in it & kept blowing my circuit breaker - threw it out
1,Do not buy. Had over $1K devices connected to this surge protector and all devices failed after power surge. Incident happened 3 weeks after "limited warranty" expired and Amazon refuses to even partially compensate.
1,The structure of the unit is cheap. The contacts for the plug connections are essentially perforated metal strips. Don't trust it to last too long.
2,One caught fire
1,Both power strips cut on and off by themselves.  Seems to be no reason why.  One minute and on-switch lineis on but 10 minutes later it is not.
2,Just ok
1,Horrible the cord is super hard to move!!!I know it sounds weird but It is supper stiff10/10 wouldn’t buy againAlso make sure to read well cause these are extra short
1,Why are these still being sold after all the fire reviews? Malfunctioned internally and started a fire. Amazon said they would not warranty damage caused by fire. They would refund the power strip. I will post pictures if able to clearly show the fire started inside the strip.
1,Don't buy just barely use it over 3 months and it cause a black out to my house and I have to spent $160 for a electrical technician to locate the problem and fix it.
2,Too short
1,Good luck finding a screw that works in the wall mount portion.  The slot is not properly undercut.
2,Really small wire about 2 feet not practicable for a small office.
1,Literally blew up immediately when plugging it in.  Took down the entire communications closet for the store.  I seriously feel some sort of legal action or recall needs to happen.  That was scary.
1,These don't work any better than other companies. Unfortunately buying Amazon basics is just encouraging Amazon to steal other companies ideas/products and allowing them to become even more of a monopoly to kill the American dream and the American company. This will be the last Amazon basics thing I ever buy!
2,makes a buzzing sound.
2,Very short wire
1,This item is totally unsafe and should not even be for sale.
1,I received this product and the pink side of the ribbon had no ink at all.  I had to retype over each letter 10 times and it still wasn't legible. rude
1,I would not buy this product. It is defective. And could burn your house down.
2,Poorly designed.
2,I misread the advertment.. I need 6ft long not 3ft.
2,Poor quality....Not quite safe...
2,1 stopped working after a month.
1,ONE bubbled at the seam another shorted out another sparked 2 work ok but terrified of a fire
2,The cords are way too short!
2,Cord is way too short... Ridiculously short !
1,Cleaned up and took a closer look. Isn't that suppose to trigger when it gets hot? Well it never did!
2,too short
1,These are awful. They arc and blow the fuse when the power switch is flipped.  Read: FIRE HAZARD.Also potential to damage whatever you have plugged in prior to flipping the on switch. Stay away.
1,I purchased two and one melted and that is very dangerous! I wouldn't ever buy this again and I wouldn't  suggest anyone else to buy this.
1,This power strip tripped our circuit breaker (multiple times). Obviously it’s not safe!
2,CHORD IS VERY SHORT!
1,I read the reviews and they seemed good but after I ordered them I saw multiple reviews about a fire hazard.  I decided to return them but they charged me $7 to return them.
1,One didn’t even work I just barely got around to using it and it doesn’t work smh
2,ok for small plugs. you have to space big plugs
1,I had two AC adapters that burned out while plugged into this power strip.
1,I ordered these to provide safety for my Christmas lighting indoors. When I plugged them in no lights came on. So I just plugged my lighted garland into the wall using the extension c that I also purchased. I will be returning these.
1,Keeps shutting off only turns on when you move it in certain position.
1,The product did not function and caused one of my monitor to flicker on output 2 and 4 regardless of the source pushed to it.
1,After using one for a few months it broke and so I opened the second one only to find out it did not work at all
1,This thing is a piece of junk If you experience an electrical surge this junk will not protect your items trust me test it with a portable heater and you'll see
4,Like with my other Amazon Basics product purchases this has proven to be a good choice for simple power bars.While similar to many other power bar options this ends up being a better buy especially if you have a Prime membership as you get another 20% off and it gets delivered to your door. I was able to buy two quality power bars for the price of one at the local hardware stores. I would never buy a dollar store power bar they offer no protection and often they’re NOT certified for use in Canada which means that if they ever cause a fire you may have problems with your insurance claim. These bars are UL and CUL (Underwriters Laboratories of Canada) certified.Like many other power bars available today they use Varistor components to supress power surges but they do not help with any drops in voltage you'll still need a UPS (uninterruptable power supply) to keep things running when brown outs happen. In the event that power bar has had to protect your equipment from too many surges the LED will no longer come on this means its time to replace the power bar its done what it was designed for.Unlike many power bars in the same class these have a slightly longer cord 24 inches (61cm) from the end of the bar to the end of the plug. Most others that I've bought have an 18 inch cord. While not a big difference for me it often means the difference between the whole thing partially hanging off the AC outlet vs. it laying on the floor. Construction wise its very similar to the others a sort of two piece clam shell affair which is solid enough but also has a little bit of flex lengthwise which allows for being trapped or jammed between something and bending rather than breaking. Like others there are also two eye hole slots which can be used for mounting it on a wall with two pan head screws.There is one important item (for me) that I want to mention. The power switch while not completely flush its mounted low so that accidentally depressing it doesn’t happen. The switch and a red LED both light up once the device is plugged in and the switch is activated. I like this as it eliminates guess work if I plug something in and it doesn’t work I can tell that the bar is plugged in and there is power at the AC outlet.
2,One didn't work
2,Cord is too short!!!!!
2,The cord is too short
1,We had a high wind storm and I bought this to protect my iMac google wifi etc. Despite having my google wife plugged into this it shorted out and no longer works!
1,Out of four two have failed with shorts
1,The screw holes are not designed to hang holes on the back are not functionable.
1,Dont buy this crap.worked for a few weeks both power strips dont work. Withing days of each other. Both were in dif outlets.in different rooms. One almost killed my fish when it turned off my pumps. Cheap crap
1,At least one of them doesn't work - you have to jostle it around and mess with it just to get it to work. I will continue to buy AmazonBasics but this should be brought to your attention.
1,Package of two. One came broken. Spend a couple extra bucks for better made ones.
1,The cord that plugs into the wall outlet is too short.One of the two units did not work. This will be on my DO NOT BUY list.
1,Had one of mine spark and melt a little down near the on/off switch.  So glad that my wife woke up to the sparking and smelling the burning plastic.
1,Defective after a couple months.... sparks fly. Be careful....
1,The cable is so short there are similar products available in market with 6' cable at the same price or less.
2,The cord is too short.
2,Basic
1,These were terrible.  Unplugged them into different outlets a few times before I realized that these were just pieces of crap that didn’t work.
1,One works and the other doesn't. I find I am getting more of this kind of trouble lately.I really love Amazon but they must be letting quality control go by the wayside.
1,Most dangerous.The lights and computer plugged into the Surge Protector kept flickering on and off.  Seems the internal wiring is defective and shorting out.  I threw them both away for fear of fire.
1,Both of them broke after light use and have faulty connection if they are moved slightly. Would not purchase again and don't recommend.
2,Only one worked.
1,Poor quality product.  The power cord connection to the outlet strip was loose.  This caused intermittent performance and is probably also a fire hazard.
1,Cheap light plastic product/ poor workmanship. A couple of the plugs do not work. Don’t want to take the risk so I just return it.
1,Should include screws. I have more than 100 different screws including screws that fit many other surge protectors but none of the screws fit this surge protector. Pure junk!
2,weak flimsy short cord
1,One of the power strips had a short in it and tripped a fuse when I plugged it in.  I didn’t try the other.
1,One of them popped the first time I plugged it in. I didn't use it until a couple of months later  so it's too late to return it.
2,SO SO
1,You can't mount this vertical on wall the cord faces upward - plus there is no way to find a screw that will slide into slots on back plate enough said.
1,bought  2  one of them went bad in one week
1,Good product however I ordered a two pack and only received one surge protector...
1,Plugs do not fit wall outlet!
1,Don’t recommendIt’s cheap and cheap quality. One of these two stopped working next day and took my NAS with it. I don’t know how and what happened.
1,The power strip looks good but there is only one in the box. What are my options?
2,not good
1,This item was NOT in The box!
1,Loose fitting means nothing stays plugged in. Appliances unplug every time the cord is bumped.  This applies to all appliances.
1,UL Approved? Not only does the item looked used. there is also a pinched green wire hanging out the side of the case. NOT SAFE!
1,Power cord is way too short. Won't even each from top of desk to floor. Going back.
2,the cables are too short.
1,This cord is very short and almost useless
1,This worked fine at first but after less than a year while the red light still comes on showing it's drawing power nothing plugged into it will work.
1,These are the biggest waste of money. They don't stick to even the cleanest driest window. When you receive these little pieces of crap throw them in the garbage before you even try to use them.
1,The male part of the plug do now fit all the way inside the surge protector. The item works just fine.
1,they are cheap and almost caused a fire in my house.
1,Never worked so I threw them away...
2,MAIN plugin doesn't work right
1,1 of the 2 failed in less than a month
1,Power strip stop working for unknown reason and will not reset.  The red light is aluminized but strip doesn't work!
1,Bought it for my daughters computer. One of them kept shorting out. Feeling ripped off.
1,TRIED THESE IN MULTIPLE OUTLETS AND THEY GOT HOT/STUFF PLUGGED INTO THE STRIPS WENT OFF. BAD AND UNSAFE!
2,cheap plastic made in china
1,I bought this from a Woot! (Amazon sub-brand) sale order#74xxx341 and immediately upon open box I can sense I have wasted money. The construction and finish of these 2 outlets are weird it's almost if they were produced in a corrections center in 70's China; it as if those were made during that period (or made using tools from that era).Not only does the surface and the very short 14-gauge wire has a plastic finish of an abandoned tire a few years out at the sun they are also full of scratch marks as if someone is trying to carve SOS or HELP on those outlets. If I shake it the outlet rattles as if something's broken inside. If I daisy-chain the outlets I can see the plug does not sit flush when I plug one into the other. If Amazon has to depend on selling those outlets then perhaps the best days of Amazon are behind them.The quality of the 2-pack Amazon Basics outlet makes the outlets sold by Dollar Tree or Dollar General look high tech and futuristic. I should have spent $2 to buy 2 outlets at those places instead of Amazon and be able to sleep at night.
1,On top of this item showing as delivered for more than a week before it actually arrived (3+ weeks total delivery time) when the item finally arrived it didn't work probably due to being extremely cheaply made.
2,Really cheaply  made
1,I received the items and right out of the box it doesn't work. Spend a little extra money to buy some that work.
1,Doesn't stay plugged into the wall.
1,I’d been using this for a month when the power went out. It failed to protect the things I had plugged into it.
1,Product is fine but if you use this at home the red light is extremely bright.
1,One stopped working after 1 month get what you pay for and these are cheap
1,These are really low quality. the female connections are loose and work sporadically ( a fire hazard i might add)
1,Keep shorting out
1,Cord is way too short
1,Should of read the description better my fault the cord is much too short couldn't use them for what I wanted.
1,Neither of them work properly. When moved or lightly tapped the power cuts out.
1,A more affordable version is widely available.
1,cord is very short. not as long as the description.
1,they are not designed to plug into wall?????????
1,it's garbage. Don't buy.
1,PRODUCT works OK !!!  It will CREMATE in SUN.....Left in Sun in BACK of TRUCK 3 days.....MELTED into a BOOARANG or BANANA ....CAN NOT SURVIVE in SUN.....PERIOD !!!
1,Short cord.
1,Plugged only one computer into it as a test - it wrecked it.  I have no idea what to do now.
1,These are very finicky. If you slightly bump them they will turn off. Almost lost all of my data on my PS4 last night.
1,I have four of these two will not work due and the other two are very touchy.  Maybe I just got a bad lot but I am looking elsewhere.
1,To Short!
4,Power Strips are a necessity of modern life basically every television and computer in your home needs one for all the accessories you plug into them. So a two pack of power strips is definitely something worth picking even if you do not need them because you never know when you will need another (I went through a stretch where three stopped working one summer).  As you would expect with AmazonBasics these Surge Protectors have a simplistic layout with six ports.  Though they are pretty close together so if you have more than one cords with the bulky heads they will not fit very well in these.  There is one other small complaint and that the cord is extremely short two feet long.  And since about half a foot is going from the wall outlet to the floor you will have to set these power strips right next to wall outlet.  So if you want something more versatile you will want to buy something else.The power strips have a red light that lets you know that the strip is grounded it is also a bit redundant that the on switch also lights up when it is on.  Both can be a little too bright in the dark which is a bit distracting at first while watching television at night.  I have not had any problems with these strips so far but we have been in a bit of a drought since I started using them so there have been no strong storms knocking out powers. Nor have I tested it much like running the vacuum with the television and cable box on which it what killed the power strip this one was replacing.
1,Cord length. Much too short
1,Too short
1,When it moves the power goes off shutting everything plugged into it off
1,Both of these randomly stopped working after a few days use at the office.
1,This product doesn't work it sparked and the outlet sparked.  Smelt like smoke. It is a hazard I would like a refund
1,One of them broke in less than a year.  Stopped powering a socket with a worrisome fizzling sound continuing whenever something was plugged into it.
1,They came on time and everything but only one of them work which is upsetting. Wish both worked but it's fine I guess.
1,OMG that is the only comment I want to give to this cheap plastic. For your personal safety buy a 10 or 15 dollar one!
1,One of the two arrived non functional.
1,Cord is too short for many applications
1,Popped when I tried to plug one in and blew fuses. Very dissapointed.
1,Two came. One DOA.I got the money back.
1,had the power cords for about a month now and now down to one bc one just stopped working
1,Arrived broken. And the replacement was also broken.
1,Good for nothing wire is too short
1,Junk  both broke within 2 months and received a refund
1,Did not protect my electronics from thunderstorm. My Wii U modem and router were fried. Want my money back.
1,Just do not buy this junk...
1,Too short
1,Very short cord
1,Faulty/loose connection. Loses power if I move the outlet a bit.
1,Not worth the money
1,One outlet on each is closed off so you can't put anything in that slot.
4,I use a lot of these surge protectors around the house for various reasons. I have a lot of electronics that need to be plugged in as well as a lot of art and craft tools that I use often enough to leave them plugged into a power strip. These are good basic power strips for everyday use at an affordable price.They have short cords though. So if you're like me and have a craft table where you need to plug in some tools but you don't want to have to crawl under the desk each time you need to plug something in then you're going to need a longer extension cord to go with it so you can set the strip on the table where it is within easy reach.I can't say in all honesty that I would trust these particular strips to protect anything expensive like my computers but for plugging in my tools  machines and lights they are perfect.
1,Such short cables!  It restricts the usage a lot.  I had to buy some other brand!
1,Over heats
1,Does not work.
1,These is not a genuine Apple Product . Does not charge my iPad . Please be careful !
1,Very bad built quality. Didn't expect that from Amazon. Not working from 1st day
1,Very disappointed
1,Surge Protectors are too short. I need longer cords. My fault.Plan on returning 22 of  24 purchased.
1,Cord is way short. Feels cheap.
1,Useless. sockets too close together to accommodate devices with large power cords.
1,its too short  i can discern the differences between them and the outlet on the wall
1,Lousy Chinese soldering internally. Open neutrals. Should be called less than basic. Not recommended.
1,Tried to connect however I receive a message "this accessory is not supported by this iPad"
1,Horrible. Some of the outlets don't work.
1,Cords are way too short and are almost worthless
1,both only lasted 6 monthsIts better to buy a better quality surge protector
1,One of them is not working!
4,This is a nice quality surge protector with 6 outlets. Though it does not note it in the description it is UL listed. A red on light indicates the power switch is on and protecting your electronics. According to the directions if this goes out it means it protected your items and needs to be replaced. The protector can be wall mounted.It is always a good idea to protect your electronics from power surges. Power surges can potentially destroy electronics. Protectors are inexpensive and simple to use. They are worth the small investment.
4,I purchased these because I needed to upgrade the old power strips that I'd been using for my 7 aquariums. I am pleasantly surprised with these n so many levels. No frills but it's a sturdy power strip. Plugs stay in firmly with no wiggling whatsoever. Ample space between each set of holes so that you can actually use each and every one. The 2 pack makes this even more convenient. I appreciate the lighted power switch so I can see if it is on or not. Heavy duty cord and plastic body is solid. Doesn't heat up even after constant use. I will probably order a few more sets of these to have on hand.
1,One of them doesn't work
1,Only one worked out of 2
1,Over heated and melted.
1,The wire is way too short
1,Failed within one week. :(
4,Extra plugs and surge protectors. Everybody needs them and these are nearly perfect. Simple and high quality like every other AmazonBasics product I’ve purchased. If you need more plugs in your life just get these. You’ll save some time in shopping around and probably some money too.My only complaint is the stiff cable that gets plugged into the wall. It sometimes causes these to lay in weird positions that are not flat. This doesn’t affect their performance but triggers some OCD if I can see them.
1,One of them does not even work
1,Cheap and the cord is TOO SHORT!
1,This is the worst product!!!
1,good customer service bad product
1,One of the two strips did not work.
1,These are cheap qualities. And it's way too short.
1,One of the two didn't work at all.
5,The Amazon Basic products are great and this is a 2 pack. What a deal for the price! I have these kind of power strips throughout my house. I recently found a great use for them when mounting my flat screen TV. I use a single outlet power bridge to run the wires behind the wall so I have a clean wire free TV mount that is compliant. Along with the power bridge outlet I attach one of these to the wall next to the outlet by using Command Strips so it is easily removable if necessary.  I actually plug the TV into the power strip and the power strip into the power bridge outlet this way everything's protected from a surge. It works great to add additional outlets in case I need them for a media player DVD player cable box to be plugged in where the wires don't show. I have read several reviews stating that this power strip is difficult to mount using screws therefore I recommend using the Command Strips they work great and don't harm your drywall.
4,Absolutely fantastic!!!The cost for both of these surge protectors are just insanely good! I have been using these type of protectors for years  and I must say I have yet to be disappointed.I'll update as time goes by.I do hope they make the cords longer in future
4,I have a floor lamp with a switch that turns through several settings to turn on and off and I wanted to turn it on/off with just a flip of a switch so I have plugged into the AmazonBasics surge protector. It works fine.
4,6 outlet grounded surge strips in a 2 pack.  These have an on off switch that glows orange and a somewhat short lead cable.  They work perfectly and can be connected to a wall or furniture with screws. Good value for 2.
1,the wrong items
4,Works good. Wish it had ground support. While using two appliances it flipped the breakers. First time using 2 appliance worked excellent but after that hasn't supported anymore but one appliance.
4,Power strips. Don't know what else to say about them. It's not a surge protector though -- just a light-weight extension for your existing electrical setup at home.
4,Pros  1. Quality is good.  2. Switch to turn on/offCons  1. Cords  length is very  short
4,At First was thinking twice about  purchasing this power strip but after receiving it that feeling all changed in the end  Great product Priced perfectly.would recommend
1,very short
4,Works pretty well for what it is supposed to. Only drawback is that the slots are vertical which means that it takes 2 or 3 slots to plug in a wallwart.
5,They're basic. There are ones that offer better protection or more features. The cord's only 2 feet long. But they're cheap and they work well! Sometimes you don't need all the bells and whistles!Amazon suggests these for small appliances lamps and phones. There is not enough protection for your computer desk or your entertainment center. But there are many places in the house that you just need the basics!I like the protected light that lets me know that not only that the strip is providing power but that the surge protection is working. The power switch flips easily and with a satisfying snap. There's no extra room for bigger "wall warts" but that's what I expected. I would like a cord longer than 2 feet but my wife put one of them on a counter and she doesn't want extra cable there. So really get the cord length that works for where you use it!What else to say? These are perfectly good simple power strips with surge protection. We're using them and I expect we'll be using them for some time.
4,Good product works as described even arrived a day before it was supposed to. Would buy again and recommend.
4,Pretty good i havent had a black out so not 100 if they are good at power outages but they work great.
4,Just received these today for my game room definitely glad I purchased these for such a good price
4,So far everything is good although plugs are a little close so they intersept eachother
4,Good cheap outlet extenders. I don't use them as surge protectors as much as just additional outlets. The work well and are trustworthy in comparison to other inexpensive surge protectors.
