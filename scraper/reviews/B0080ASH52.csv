5,received the product in good condition...
1,this was sticky to touch
5,This is the only wireless remote we've found that will reach the distance we needed.  Great little presenter.
3,The small size with so many buttons creates problems with hitting the wrong one often for someone with large hands and knobby fingers.I may be returning it.
1,This product was a bust as soon as I received it.  The battery cover kept falling off so I had to use tape to keep it in place also the pointer did not work on an LCD screen as indicated.  I had to send back as it was below standard for the price. Not really happy at all.
4,Love my new presenters friend.  Would have been nice to have more instructions on how to set several time reminders rather than having to reset each time.
5,Very useful product. Great range for the price point works as soon as you plug it in. Great to have for presenters that forget their personal clicker.
5,Does its job really wellTimely arrivalWell done
5,Good
3,It functions well. I got it for Rs 6499 however the very next day it was available for Rs 4999.
5,The product works as described.  Sleek and convenient.  Green laser is very bright and works even on the computer screen Lcd and Plasma TVs and covers the 30 meter range. The Wifi works even on a reflected angle and maintains the range.  The Lcd panel informations are very subjective use.  Otherwise the product is excellent for its use.I wish the carrying case had an extra pouch to store spare batteries!Removing batteries is very tricky and cumbersome.  I wish they had fixed a tiny ribbon to pull out the batteries.  I fixed my own with a thin and tiny strip of ribbon or PVC to pull out the batteries easily.The product was delivered by Speed Post much ahead of the time schedule.  Thanks for the Excellent service and very prompt delivery schedule by the seller.  Thanks for Amazon for selling such valuable and useful products within such easy reach.  http://www.amazon.in/Logitech-R800-professional-presenter/dp/B0080ASH52?ie=UTF8&ref_=pdp_new_dp_review
5,I studied the available options and found this presenter to be a great choice.1. The green laser is less strenuous on the eyes especially for long presentations.2. The operations buttons are very intuitively placed and shaped which makes usage very easy.3. The LCD display is a great advantage.(a) One can set the intended presentation duration on a built in timer. The timer counts down during the presentation allowing the user to instantly glance at time remaining. Once the time set is reached the unit vibrates to let the user know the set time is up. Thereafter the counter times forward. Of course setting this feature is completely optional but very useful.(b) The display shows whether the presenter is in range of operation as well.The unit is compact and comes with a well made storage pouch.
4,The product feels good in hand. The rubberized coating gives a good grip.LCD screen is useful.There is a feature to set the timer to track total presentation time which is quite neat; if there was some way to set per slide timer then it would've been even better.It is expensive though and I would score it low on value for money.
5,Highly recommended presentation tool for the professionals. Currently there are no other similar products in the market (India and USA) that comes close to this tool in terms of features and design so there is nothing to compare it with. The green laser is bright. Ergonomics are good. One of the most useful features of this tool is the timer function. Not only do you get a visual indication of the relative amount of time left you also get a silent vibration in the device at 5 2 and 0 minute markers. However there is no back-light for the LCD display and it would have been a wonderful addition.This tool has a battery level indicator and I use Eneloop AAA 800mAh Re-chargeable batteries so I never have to worry about running out of power. Using Re-chargeable batteries saves you a lot of money in the long-term and is very good for the Environment.
4,Good quality. Up and down symbol is not etched so the print is not visible after a few days use.the battary case get loosen easly. Mudic start and stop not easy to use. Good range
5,Good any side
5,The green laser is great  the timer function keeps you on time for your presentations  and it comes with a carry-pouch.  BE CAREFUL WITH THE BLUETOOTH JACK (which connects with the computer) I feel its too loose and can come off the presenter and you might loose it.
5,Peerless in all aspects... Recommend to needy persons
4,Good product
4,Good product. The pointer is not clearly  visible on LED and similar screens.
4,Working well since last 8 months.. Got problem once when laser light stopped working but got it replaced in 1 week by logitech service center.Green laser is awesomeCons:1.very poor battery back up.. Needs Duracell  always doesn't work well with routine nippo or eveready batteries and almost never with rechargeable batteries2.price
4,It was my dream to have one for all my presentation. I used it rough and tough. I in the field of teaching enjoyed using this. Battery comes for more than 7 hr class. All parts in the product is very compact and tough hence very useful.
4,The product is good and performs well. However the battery consumption is on the higher side due to its laser power.
2,I purchased this product for 4135 in august 2016. It worked fine the design is very good and comfortable but it stopped working in august 2018. First it started consuming too much battery for a few months then the display was gone and then the laser pointer also stopped functioning. I think 2 years is a very short duration after spending so much money.My colleague has a pointer she purchased from UK and it has been working for nearly 10 years now and its battery consumption was fairly lower than mine.Am disappointed in logitech a reputed company.
4,Handy look but initially on/off sliding switch was little bit tight and tick sound comes when you press forward and reverse buttons which could be rectified by manufacturer.
5,Best product in its class. Ergonomically designed perfect size and sits well balanced in the palm. Great range - works across the large ballroom of a hotel. Only flaw is that the power button on the side gets turned on by itself in the bag and depletes battery - need to store in a plastic zip lock cover to prevent.
5,I am regularly using it for my slide shows and it is very handy. Works well. One must have additional batteries charged as the batteries drains quickly
5,Awesome presenter. Good battery life (I am using a duracell) sharp Green light laser and the best part is the timer feature. It reminds me silently (through vibration) on when I need to wind up
5,Very apt for large conference halls..have tested from a range of 120 feet..works like magic.. user friendly with amazing battery life..only draw back is pricing..
5,Straps are simply awesome.  Product delivered as expected at Right First Time and also on time ðŸ˜Š
4,I really liked this presenter. Feels really good with its ergonomic design. I liked the green laser pointer which is compatible with LCD or plasma screens. Good buy value for money!!
5,Great product. Using it since a long time and it's so easy for use even if I give to a new user. Really love the whole experience.
5,Nice ergonomically designed product...Easy to use... Battery stays for long....But very expensive in comparison to targus...The LCD display is of not much use...
5,Smooth - plug and play. Using it with Mac and it flawlessly connects and controls presentation. The ergonomics are good - it is also a joy to hold in hand. Using it with a Mac and it seamlessly connects.
2,Pointer works good. But Battery does not last for 2 presentations. Without good battery backup this product is worst.Need to recharge the batteries frequently. In between the presentation the product switches off.
4,An excellent product. If only it could have a button that could start the slide show from the current slide and in way it could work as a wireless mouse.
5,Its really a very good product easy to use in presentations and other time too.
5,I am happy with my purchase.1. Happy that it works well with laptop and apps2. Very comfortable3. Well Designed
5,Great product although a bit overpriced at Rs 4399. But it is one of few with green laser pointer and slide changer inbuilt. Fast delivery
5,Very useful and compact presenter. Works smooth. High battery consumption which is a negative for this item. have to keep a back up all the time
5,Good product. Covers a good range than the previous model R400. The laser pointer also works fine and is visible even in bright light conditions.Overall happy with the product and the service.
5,Very good product with good range and quality.
5,Great product for presentations. The Laser pointer has great range and visible in almost all the projections. The timer function is also very useful for keeping track of your presentation time.
5,Nice added timer function alert and handy design
5,Very good accessory for presentations. I am using it on my MacBook Pro running Mavericks. Had to change some settings and its fully functional with Keynote presentations. Packing was good and delivery was on time.

5,One of the best slide changes/pointer in the market. The area where Logitech can improve is battery life.
4,Committed quality & time was delivered.

5,Excellent product
5,Brilliant product works really well. The LED pointer is bright and love the green color :)
5,Great product.
2,The green laser is lovely but this model suffers from a lot of negatives. The on-off switch is very flimsy and turns on without intention. The battery consequently drains off. My own model simply blew up after the first use: the batteries drained the unit heated up and blew out.  I need to get the product replaced now! The display seems unnecessary at times but there is no option to switch it off without switching off the whole pointer.
1,The pointer can be used only for about 1.5 hours of presentation with fully charged new Duracell AAA batteries.. which is even less than 10% of their claim..... Very Bad job Logitech.. I was not expecting this from you atleast..
5,The laser beam is bright. The range is long. Very convenient. A great product
4,Good Product from Logitech

5,Fantastic and useful product
5,Excellent presenter. The green laser is way better than the usual red one.
1,Its a lovely device when it had worked but the quality is terrible. It stopped working in just three weeks. All icons are flashing. This is not covered on the product website.By the way it did work on LCD screens so it worked exactly as promised. Will update on the warranty claim in due course.
5,Good one we got it on time
5,very nice product....
1,Laser pointer started malfunctioning within the first month of use (was probably like that from the first day) - it doesn't show up at or doesn't show up brightly when pressed first. Only after half a minute or so its intensity increases (when continuously or repeatedly pressed). If it's not used again for half a minute or so the same problem. I checked with several new batteries but the same problem persists.
4,Makes you mobile while presenting
4,Very helpful product
4,good
5,It is an excellent product for presentation. Must buy!
2,I bought this since my R400's forward button stopped working. But this model R800 has a great appetite for battery. With 3 sessions of 3 hour each presentations batteries needs to be replaced ðŸ˜ž

5,Excellent device especially the green laser....
1,I highly recommend not to purchase this model
1,The pointer is not working after just a month of using the gadget. The slide changer however continues to work. How can the double the price over the Logitech R400 be justified? is there a warranty for this product?
5,Excellent product unmatched in market.
5,Simple to use easy to handle and good looking
5,Works perfect.
5,Very good
5,If you use a presenter nothing beats this one.

5,Shipped fast and brand new product in packaging! Can't fault
5,good
