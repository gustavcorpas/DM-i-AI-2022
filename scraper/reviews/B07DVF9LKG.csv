5,Short and to the point wrap up : Great little dash cam.  Not complicated at all to set up or use.  Video quality is great night or day.  Records audio and easy to mute.  Also easy to adjust the angle with a twist.  Sucktion cup as a good tight hold I will update if I ever have a problem with it but I don't feel I will.  Long cable should I want to hide it along the windshield and door floor etc to make it very "stealth". Full Review : I've been on the fence about getting a dash cam for years now. While I live in a state that does not have any crazy insurance problems or discounts for owning a dash camera I still wanted one.  You see more and more videos online about accidents or someone witness something with a dash cam and I can't help but feel if I was in a situation like that I'd like one too.  Call it peace of mind or just the fact I can say "It wasn't my fault!" and have actual proof! That for me was the biggest pro for getting a dash cam proof.  Dash cams are becoming more and more common and there are more and more on the  market every month it seems.  Eventually I decieded I should dip my toes in and finally test one out.  This device is one of those set it and forget it ones.  You set it up check the footage after a drive and don't have to fuss with it again.  I'd recommond getting day and night in there before you check the video. Now for the actual product which has been great.  It comes in a nice little box with some foam padding around the camera to ensure any shipping bumps drops and crushes don't damage the camera.  The intrustions are simple and clear and come seperate from the full manuel to help get you started faster.  I was actually surprised it came with two cables.  One for the car with the old "cigarette lighter" plug port and a shorter one for plugging the camera into a PC should you want to grab video straight from the camera itself and not have to remove the microSD.  Which for some might be very handy since microSD are TINY! As I said it had two cables where I expected only the one for the car nice.  Also surprised that the plug for the car has a little slidable piece and hides a USB port!  So if you did have something plugged in there already and it happens to be USB you can use this for a pass through.  The cable as you might expect is very long not sure I even need half of it but I'm sure someone who wants to really hide their cam has plenty of cord to work with. The camera itself looks just the part like a really mini DSLR almost.  The lens is pretty big and extends out of the camera but not so much as to make it bulky.  I appreciate the addition of the 1.5inch LCD on the back which makes getting into the settings easy.  Some cameras that I had looked at needed to set up on the PC or via phone app I don't like that.  I prefer settings to be "on device" should I need to adjust adress or otherwise need them quickly. I do recommend at least an 8GB microSD card as setting the video's to 1 minute loops has each one come in just about 110MB which is over 100 videos. However if you wanted to have a longer loop say five minutes that would be 500MB for each and will only give you about sixteen videos before it starts to loop. I would say keep it to 1 minue or three at most if you are using 8GB. Smaller cards I wouldn't go over one or even recommend to use it as you will be loppint over video quickly and if you "protect" some you might be unable to record more until you save those to another source. The video is clear and would record any accident you would have in front of your car.  This should be more then enough for any insurace claims or court case to prove your side of the story.  At night license plates are hard or impossible to read but I won't dock a star from the camera because I feel this is not important.  Given most people don't have a dash cam any kind of recorded footage is a big bonus. Finals notes : The timestamp on the bottom gives you date and time as well as your license plate # (I left that blank for this review as my videos are public) and speed if you have the GPS attachment/upgrade. (I do not at this time have that). In the video I have the settings to default 0 exposure 1080P/30 and audio off. In the picture I did not yet choose where I want to have the cam and I was moving and adjusting it for this review that is why you see the USB cord hanging down from my rear mirror. I did not do anything with it as of writing this review.
4,|—-This review is incomplete. I will come back and edit it when I get more experience from the camera—-|I purchased this for a friend because we always see something wild when we’re together. I purchased this camera for its price and many positive reviews. As always I took them with a grain of salt. I expected it to be neither excellent nor well not bad.The packaging was nice though just a tad awkward. After getting the second box opened (first was the one it shipped in) I was met by a quick start guide some kinda sweepstakes-type thing (share video get chance to win) and a full manual. I read the quick start guide but I’m more of a learn-it-by-doing-type person so I retained the absolute bare minimum I needed to know which was it needed to be charged for 2-3 hours before use. So I decided to do the next logical thing: I started using it. I’m kidding. I plugged it into a phone charger for a couple hours like it said. I hadn’t put a memory card into it yet so it didn’t record anything.The display seemed decent at the time (I left all of the protective film on everything) but after I got it set up later it actually looked pretty good. It’s also at this point that I decide to set it up. It was awkward navigating the menus. Well it was fine most of the time but the instructions didn’t exactly make it clear how to apply changes you make. Turns out it’s automatic. This confusion actually allowed me to almost exactly sync the time to what my phone said (you can modify the seconds too but I didn’t feel like it especially if I could get close).I was going to use it in my friend’s Jeep but I was too busy trying to find stuff that I forgot to insert a uSD card into the camera before leaving. Another friend tried to mount the camera anyway (I was in the back). He tried to take it back down but the suction cup resisted. He finally got it down dropping it. He handed the camera back and called it a GoPro. To be fair that’s what this camera looks like lol.Skip a couple of days and I was able to put the camera into another car. I actually remembered to insert the uSD this time. We drove for about 10 minutes and parked and waited for someone else. Once he came out it was decided to take his vehicle instead of ours so I was unable to capture any more footage. What footage I do have ins’t really enough to tell much about picture quality. We didn’t even get close enough to another vehicle for me to be able to read the plates with my own eyes.Speaking of footage the files stored on the card are in MOV format. This is a Windows file so you will need a Windows machine to watch it. I tried an Android tablet. It saw the files and even gave thumbnails but refused to play. Windows 10 played it no problem. In the camera settings I enabled GPS speed logging on the video even though I don’t have the GPS mount. I just wanted to know how it reacted and as expected it reported 000 MPH the whole time. The image seemed fairly crisp for the price. The stamps placed in the videos aren’t as up-to-par but can be overlooked. The audio wasn’t bad either.The camera mount will accept a USB mini B cable while the camera itself can take a micro B cable. It draws power from either. Included with the camera were two cables. One plugs into a standard 12 V port in a car and has a little tab that rotates open to reveal a single USB port. The other is meant for data transfer between the camera and a PC. I haven’t tried but I would imagine the data cable can also be used to supply power.I’m going to go ahead and rate this as a 7/10. As I said before I haven’t really had a good chance to test this camera yet and I will come back and edit this when I do. If you need yourself a cheap dash cam I will go ahead and recommend this. I also plan to put up a comparison video at some point comparing this camera to a whole ‘ other make and model (Viofo A119) because I can.
5,This camera is perfect for what we needed. We have a new driver and I want him to have some sort of witness if there was an accident. Our area has had soooo many hit and runs lately and I've been told that many people who don't run change their story to try to say it wasn't their fault. Although this won't catch anyone hitting him from behind it will clearly catch people cutting off weaving and running lights/stop signs.
4,Affordable quality dashcam. The videos are alright. Will record sound with the ability to disable.  Wide angle viewing.  My only wish is that it would rotate 360 degrees so I can position camera to drivers or passenger window to record law enforcement or other subjects on the sides of vehicle.
4,I love all the reviews but I think I got a lemon. I did a test drive for over an hour and only 2 files were saved. I couldn't read the files keep saying "file error". When I try to manually record the timer stays on 00.00.00 and doesn't change implying it's unable to record. I have tried multiple SD cards and formatted them both on the device and on my computer but it still doesn't work.UPDATE!!! I fix my "FILE ERROR" problem by just clicking on DEFAULT SETTINGS in the SETTINGS menu.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Bought 1 camera back in December for my car.Easy installation/setup. I wanted to wait a bit and see if the camera was going to be able to handle the Arizona desert heat and it was doing so well I decided to get a 2nd one for another vehicle.I was able to get one of the cameras working with a 128GB SandDisk microSD and the other one has a 256GB Samsung microSD. No issues so far. I used a computer to format both memories.The camera resolution is 1080p so don't expect to catch all the little details. It can be difficult to get a clear license plate while driving at freeway speeds but it's definitely better than nothing. The video quality overall is pretty good. I was a bit impressed.I was more worried about the camera handling the heat and so far we've had a few 115+F (46+C) days and it's doing just fine. Even the suction cup stayed on the windshield.Both cameras are doing great. They are as basic as can be plug and play. To get footage you'd have to take the microSD out and plug it in to a PC. I found the "G-Sensor" feature a bit annoying so I disabled it on one of them.Both cameras were installed on mid size sedans so no issues hiding the cord plenty of length.The camera records videos of 5 minutes at the time and each video is 544MB. So a 1 hour video is around 6.3GB and it's split on 12 five minutes videos. I get a lot recorded on a 256GB microSD.I would totally recommend this for the price. If you're looking for a decent quality camera without spending too much money this is the one.
4,The dashcam is pretty small so it doesn't take up much space. It's also designed very well with the power cord coming out of the suction attachment arm (makes it easy to hardwire if you'd like but also better looking in general). Only had a slight issue with the microsd card slot as the card keeps getting stuck inside. Has formatting and setup options built in that are convenient.0
5,Easy to mount and install.  Necessary with all the aggressive drivers on the road today.
3,This camera I bought back on December 7 2018 lasted about 4 months (it was for my son and he never used it so I started using it 3 or 4 months ago.I had my car in the garage this morning and went out to head to the store and the dashcam was on the dash so I picked it up to put it back up on the windshield and smoke started pouring out of it with the strong smell of burning up electronics.  Not sure what's going on but its toast.  I'm just glad it did it on the windshield and I caught it in time and not on my dash when I wasn't in the vehicle.  Other than frying itself it was a pretty good little dashcam for the price.I'll probably replace it with a different brand.  I have a Rove in my truck I've used for years and its pretty great.
4,I like the camera and the fact it's motion and vibration detected! I just wish I could turn it around to record in case I got pulled over so I could record the police officer
5,I found this dash cam to be have an incredible camera. It's good enough to see into car of someone at the intersection across from you and tell if they are on their phone or whatever. Can easily read license plates during day and night even without street lights. I have not used any other dashcams but I found the only thing about this camera that was lacking was the software and set up process. The set up tells you to wrap the power cord up and around the windshield to prevent dangling cords but came with no supplies to do this and even if it did I the cord would only be long enough if the cigarette lighter in the car (power plug in for car) was in the door. It might work in your car but not in mine. I don't really mind the dangling wires as much as how difficult it was to set up the software is not terrible but it is not good. Took me 30 minutes to set up how I wanted and I consider myself tech savvy. I would warn anyone using this for insurance or safety purposes to change the storage settings from 5 minute history to continuos. I wish it had a setting where everything time I turn on my car it makes sure that there is enough storage space for a couple hours off video and then just save everything for the next ride. But it has no such feature either you have to save everything and manually take it out and clean up the sd card every couple months or just save the last five minutes of your ride. There maybe some way to do what I want with this device but there is no button or settings that says it does this. I gave this 5 stars because of the incredible value of this dash cam I picked this up for about $75 and I'd say at that price it's well worth it . . . For me. I don't mind saving $50 for the inconveniences because I have more time then money and if that's true for you i'd recommend it.
4,I just deleted my "useless product" review because Vantrue customer service has com to my rescue. I am most grateful that this company still stands behind its product.I had become so frustrated with the suction cup mounting system that I stopped using the camera altogether. It just would not stay in place. If there was enough slack it the wire the camera would strike the dashboard when it fell.I pointed this out when I updated my review recently. Well what happened next has restored my faith in mankind:Vantrue came to my rescue. They provided to me a new alternative way of mounting the camera to the windshield.This took me quite by surprise and I am very happy for their response. They have had other experiences with the suction cup and they designed a better method of mounting the camera in place. I haven't had a chance to try it yet but from its looks I'd say it will cure the problem.KUDOS to Vantrue they really came through for me. They are just the type of company that I want to deal with and that are often hard to find.Thanks Vantrue!I bought this to record any potential mishaps believing that "other people" lie when filling out accident reports. Only once have I ever retrieved images from it. I just want it to work in an emergency thus I know little about the operations and settings.The item has one Major Flaw. The suction cup fails all the time. Sometimes it falls immediately sometimes after an hour or two. When I started leaving it down from the window it was 100% useless.I hope that this is something that I am doing wrong but after many trials(and errors) I have concluded that it is just a bad design. There is no backup method for keeping it aligned to do its job.
4,The camera is a good size and easy to hide behind the rear view mirror.  Decent images and field of view.The suction mount that came with the camera failed after a few months.  It wouldn't stay mounted at all.  However based a previous negative review the manufacturer replaced the suction mount with with an adhesive mount free of charge.  So 2 stars up to 4.
5,Easy to install. Only thing I don't like is I would get out of my car and it was up. Then I get back in my car and it has fallen.
5,Small but powerful little camera that will save you from any wrong doing highly recommend
4,Vantrue contacted me and stepped up and sent a new updated mount which has held up very well. It has not fallen at all and is dependable. Good for vantrue for standing behind their products. Thank you vantrue.This looks like a great camera and has many very good reviews. I suspect many of the reviews were written before they had it for any amount of time.That being said The first issue was with the suction cup. It does not last long attached and will drop the camera at any time. If it is while driving the camera will sway (mine was hardwired so only a few inches). Yes the window was clean. The mount is also weak. I suspect due to the nature of having to continuously lock the suction cup in place it became weak and finally snapped or cracked as shown in the above photos. Yes I ordered a new one from Amazon only being $5.99 but what really set me off is that it is GOING TO TAKE OVER A MONTH as IT SHIPS FROM CHINA!!! That's horrible. No warning when ordering. Shame on both Vantrue and Amazon.The next issue is the placement and/or the locking mechanism for the micro SD card. I ordered the  Samsung PRO Endurance 128GB Micro SDXC Card with Adapter - 100MB/s U1 (MB-MJ128GA/AM) made specifically for dash cams and video costs almost half the price of the camera and during one of the incidents where the camera dislodged from the windshield it must have hit while swinging and shot out of the spring loaded slot on the camera. I'm still looking for the chip sadly. I had to keep my eyes on the road while driving so I could not see where it went. Very disappointed with the product again. I was able to insert another SD cardbut thats besides the point. What if there was an accident and the card ejected and all my evidence was gone. All things to consider in my next dash cam purchase.Of course this will be followed by the generic statement (canned response that is seen in every other review to contact them blah blah blah. ) from VantrueA real company if they wanted to keep your business would have overnighted a new suction cup as it is propitiatory and it's difficult to operate the camera without it. I know I didn't tell them and just ordered another one @$5 with prime but I never expected it to be a month from China. SMH. Bad business. Now i'm out a camera for at least a month but I think I will end up buying something else to have it here and in use.One other negative is the G force setting. It's default is the middle of only 3 settings. With all the potholes in the road from winter most of my files were going to the protected folder because the default setting kept thinking there was an impact. I had to lower it to the lowest which made me uneasy in the event there was a minor accident it may not have locked the file. I have no way of knowing what sets off the G sensor. 3 settings for G force was not a good idea. I probably could go on but will stop here. The camera is not cheap and it's on the shelf for a month because MFR. ships from China.
5,We’ve been using the camera for about 2-3 weeks now and are quite impressed with it so far. When we googled around looking to see what reviews and ratings were posted this one popped up on our search and was well recommended and so with that and the price that we got it for we decided to take the plunge and put it to the test. There's a few cons that we found but nothing that can't be overlooked especially when comparing it to other cameras on the market!Pros:- Fairly compact- Mounts securely and is fully adjustable- With the exception of the mini sd card formatting it' pretty much plug and play deal unless you want to customize settings with exceptional- Came with quick start guide which is bonus- Minimal controls and buttons (so less confusion while on the go)- Really wide view so you can see traffic on right and left lanes at same time- Resolution is pretty good and you can clearly see license plate of the car in front of you. If 4 car lengths ahead however you can’t make out the license plate but everything else is clear- There is a button on top of the camera that's easy to reach allowing you to take a quick snapshot- Camera continues to record for period of time after the car is shut off- Has a g sensor designed to activate during collisions or events. These videos/images and can’t be recorded over after as they're saved in separate folder (apart from the regular recordings). This is good so that you can be sure that the data is safe but bad in that you have to manually delete these.- Option of having audio on and off easily- Option of pausing recording (in case you don't want something to be recorded) and this will start recording as usual again (automatically) when the car is restartedCons:- The plug that connects into camera by mount should be on right side (passenger side) and not left as we'd prefer to not run the cord on the driver's side.. .. .. but this would be a plus for non-us drivers- Cord is of generous length but for mid-size and some larger vehicles it would be a stretch to run this along perimeter and of the car and to the receptacle- Formatting card is difficult at first as you can't format the card with the camera and we learned the hard way (after taking off on a trip that we really wanted to use the camera on) that Windows 10 doesn't format the card to FAT32 either. After searching on the internet we had to download a (free) program so that the card could be properly formatted. Worked like a charm after but we were a bit annoyed at first. Additionally the quick start guide didn't mention that we couldn't format the card in the device (or at least we didn't see this in there) so we had to wait until we got back from the trip to read the bigger manual as we didn't take that with us on vacation either!Instruction booklet although comprehensive print was tiny- It would be nice if we could charge battery longer so that we can use the camera without it being plugged in- Would be nice if this had a rear view but I think that's available in a later version- The camera ball mount allows you to adjust and screw to tighten the camera but even if it's at its tightest and you push the button to take a still image but easily loosens
4,This is a good camera. The suction cup mount fell off after a while but I am working with customer service and they will fix it.
5,Got this dashcam after a recent accident so this is my first one. Super simple setup. After I put the suction mount on the top of my windshield and plugged into the cigarette lighter it powers on when I start the car and automatically begins recording. I haven't quite figured out how to do the parking monitor things where it detects motion during the night time but I will just have to go back to the manual. Really impressed with the camera quality (Day and night) audio and how simple it is to start recording and view video on my computer. Reminder this camera does NOT come with a micro-SD card. I got this one that was recommended by Amazon (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07NY23WBG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and it has worked really well.
4,The quality is really great for a camera this small and for the price! The only thing missing is that it CAN'T be linked to an app. But it's fine since the camera has a small screen so the clips can be viewed still. What amazed me more is the night vision! The suction cup eventually comes off though that's my only downside but just wipe it with alcohol pads and you're good to go! Very happy with this purchase! If only this can be linked to an app I would have given this a 5 star.
3,Had an indecent that I needed a copy for police well that file just poof was gone. Aftergoing through 128GB of 5 minute clips I found out most are dead and will not play. The appis horrible. On board battery is useless does not save date and time so you have a bunch ofvideos with the same date.  When it counts this is a dud. Sorry I bought it.
5,You can use this without it plugged in. But the battery life is about 15 minutes of use so if you want to use it then you're going to need to plug it in.
5,Despite being a very small dash camera it feels very sturdy. When I get anything new I like to figure it out before reading the instructions (just to see if I can). This was pretty simple to figure out with only a glance or two at the setup guide. I am very impressed with the quality of the video especially at night video. The snip I attached does not do it justice. The playback is great. I may buy the GPS attachment (just for fun) but it is not necessary.I live in  the desert (temps well above 100F) and the camera stays on the windshield very well. I am not sure about leaving it running because of the internal car temperature. It is rated for 158F degrees so it should be OK until it hits 110F external (which could hit the threshold of 158 within 3 hours parked). Fortunately we only have those temps a few weeks over the summer. Guess the position of the windshield sun screen may help.Overall I am very happy with the camera. I especially like the the power adapter since it has a hidden USB port to charge another device at the same time. Very smart of the engineers. Allowing the driver to easily take a picture while recording is extremely awesome. Never know when you will see something you must share with others (I took a picture of a car covered in duct tape - weird). The small footprint and extremely long cable are also a bonus. An unusual but helpful feature was the option of mass storage or powering on the device when hooked to the computer (using their USB cable as other cables do not give you the dual option). I was able to set it up inside my home (date time etc) and allow it to charge before installing it in my car.I would suggest this to anyone that wants to have that extra set of eyes in the event of an accident. If you are an Uber/Lift driver I would suggest the N2 Pro since you can view the inside and outside of the car simultaneously.Both models will be great to remove any doubt to what actually happened (inside and outside of your car). Hopefully I never need to use if for "proof" but it is great to have just in case.Great productJeff McMaster
5,Good product !
5,This thing holds up to some of the better cameras out there. I’ve had mine in the blazing sun of Florida for over a year and it has worked without fail. The quality of images is absolutely perfect and for the price it makes it a must buy. The only thing is the suction cup stopped working after about a year so you can glue it or buy a replacement for 20 bucks. Well worth buy
5,This unit provides a clear and sharp video of everything occurring in front of you from one side of the car to another side.  I had this in place and rolling when someone decided to do a delayed pull out in-front of me after being stopped and hit me.  The person disputed it was her fault but as soon as I emailed my insurance company the recording I had saved on this they immediately changed their decision in favor of me.  This is the best money you can spend to protect you from what you see while driving.  Think of it as cheap insurance of what happened that provides the proof of what you described.
3,I had very high hopes for this little camera. First I have to give Vantrue huge props for their documentation. It's written in proper English and that's the same for the user interface of the camera. Nice job. This isn't common with all the chinese cheapo products out there.My first complaint is the suction cup mount. Frankly suction cup mounts are stupid. They just don't stay. There needs to be a permanent adhesive solution. They are convenient but I'm looking for something reliable. Suction cups aren't reliable. Secondarily the length of the mount from the cup to the camera is excessive. This results in the camera being more than a couple inches away from the windshield and it results in it being more difficult to place due to the way my vehicle's rear view mirror is placed and reflections/glare from the windshield. In addition can't mount this camera on a vertical windshield like in an RV. I was hoping to buy a second for my motor home but this won't cut it.Daytime video quality is good though not as good as my Anker Roav camera I bought over 3 years ago. I can sometimes read license plates but the clarity of plate numbers isn't always clear.Night time video is sub-par particularly with the headlights on my vehicle which are LED. Can't read a single sign or license place on the road as they are completely washed out white.Unfortunately I have to send this thing back. I'm sorry Vantrue. I think this is a well-constructed product and I wish you had another camera that would solve my issues/concerns at a reasonable price but this one isn't going to work out for me.
3,I bought the Vantrue N1 Pro about two years ago. I'm on the third one.These units come with an 18-month warranty and email support has been excellent. Vantrue responds promptly and replacement parts have always been shipped quickly.The first camera came with a defective micro SD card slot. The card would not lock in place it always popped out. Vantrue sent a replacement and a prepaid return shipping label.I also purchased the GPS mount. Somewhere around the 12-month point it stopped working. Unfortunately the only way I discovered this was when I was reviewing footage on my computer and noticed the GPS info on the video was either missing or disappearing and reappearing. Vantrue sent a replacement and that one has been working fine since.At around 16 months I discovered that the clock was not maintaining time overnight when the unit was off. Again the only way I discovered this was when I was reviewing footage on my computer and the date/time were wrong. Vantrue support diagnosed this a defective battery. Apparently the lithium battery used for parking mode collision detection and so on is also used for the internal clock. The clock doesn't have a separate lithium button battery. So I made a formal warranty request and Vantrue replaced the camera again. This third unit is so far working okay.On the plus side the video and audio quality are quite good especially at this price point. And Vantrue support is excellent.Gripes:1. The internal clock accuracy is not great. Not bad but not good either. A $10 wristwatch keeps better time.2. Use a lithium button battery for the clock so it's not dependent on the main backup power source.3. Use the GPS signal to automatically set the camera time. This would eliminate #1.4. It's difficult to complain about quality at this price point (although it was quite a bit more expensive when I bought it two years ago). Still three cameras and two GPS mounts....5. It would be nice if Vantrue could incorporate some kind of warning system to tell you when the battery is bad or the GPS is malfunctioning. Maybe flash the power and recording LEDs or something.I won't buy another dashcam that doesn't set the clock with the GPS signal. For legal purposes (I haven't needed it for that yet knock on wood) if the clock isn't right then the integrity of the video can be questioned. So far as I can tell no Vantrue dashcams do this.
3,If youre looking for a super basic camera this will do. Bought for a 900 mile road trip and it worked well and we are still using it. Accessing the video is super cumbersome and a pain. But it pretty much works as advertised. Kimd of a "get what you pay for scenario"
3,I returned this item immediately after receiving it. It looks bigger on pictures. Due to it's size it was hard for me to handle it. Unfortunatel I didn't have time to test its performance.
5,I was asked to review the new Vantrue N1 Pro dash cam as an owner of the dual cam N2 Pro.  I’m not an Uber driver so capturing the goings on inside the car was more of a novelty than a necessity but I like the N2. It does its job in a discreet way and the quality of the images are excellent and the workmanship is very good.  Some complaints are the location of the buttons on the bottom of the camera Housing another issue is the price.  I paid $200 for the N2 Dual cam Pro not including a hardwire and GPS mount.Vantrue’s Latest N1 Pro is the latest and greatest from this manufacturer. If you want an almost Plug & Play dash cam that can be setup in 5 minutes or less has one of the best Sony image sensors a huge optical quality glass lens with a wide aperture to gather light in pitch black conditions and 1920 x 1080p resolution for less than $75 bucks don’t waste your time looking further for your next (or first) dash cam. In bright daytime use the images are clear with no shaking and license plates are legible even from a fair distance. Even better nighttime video and stills are so good you may have to dial down the exposure setting below factory default of 5 or you might get a bloom on street lamps and oncoming headlights like I did.  Another feature I really like is the 160 degree field of view.  Most dash cams in this price range will use plastic lenses no name image sensors and have a FOV of 120 degrees or 150 degrees at most.  The extra view can capture lane changers bikers and other blind spot infringers other cams might miss until the damage is done.The suction cup mount is solid and does it’s job well.  The daytime pic was taken with the included mount.  The nighttime pic was taken with the optional GPS mount. As you can see the exact location and speed is shown on the video in real time if you activate GPS on the setup menu. This could be either good or bad but I would rather have it than not.  The microphone is also high quality and doesn’t pick up engine or ambient road noise.  Again the audio could come back to bite you in the @ss so it’s nice to be able to turn it on or off as you wish.The cam does loop recording in 2 3 or 5 minutes snipets but with a 256GB micro SD the max card it takes you can just turn off the loop function and not worry about documenting an entire cross country road trip.
5,The camera quality is decent and overall product quality is good.The suction cup though started failing after a couple of months. I reached out to the supplier and they sent me a replacement one immediately. Great support!
5,Camera was easy to install with a generous length of cable but not so much I was left wondering what to do with too much excess. Documentation that came with the camera was clear and there were no surprises between actually using the camera and what the manual said to expect. I've only taken it for a run around the block but pleased with image quality so far. For the price point seems hard to beat!
4,I just received this dash cam and mounted it in my brand new car. I love the size very discreet in the windshield behind my rearview mirror. So far it has been working great. Only downside is no wireless connection so I have to unmount the camera and connect to my computer or take the memory card out. Unmounting the camera is easy as the power cable is connected to the mount instead of direct connected to the camera. For the price it is just a small inconvenience.
5,Great quality and features for the price.I had a VanTrue X1 that finally gave up after 5 yrs of long service. I bought the N1 Pro now based on the quality and long life of my previous one. It has gotten better. Great day picture and the night pictures/video is even better than before.Love the increased SD card capacity that it will work with.The field of view is great with hardly any distortion.Response time is quicker now too. Very easy to set up and use.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Full disclosure: I'm being reimbursed to review this model.I already have an N2 Pro dashcam so when they gave me the opportunity to review one of their other models right before Christmas I was more than happy to. I chose the N1 Pro (and added the GPS adapter) and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it.It's compact easy to use and takes pretty good video. The setup was extremely easy and I've been using it quite a bit. Unfortunately the weather has been rainy for the last several days and the rain on the windshield does affect video quality. It especially causes lense flair at night. I'm going to look through the settings to see if there's a way to adjust the picture to reduce the lense flare.Overall it's a very good dashcam for the price point but that reduced cost does mean compromises. If you're looking for a dashcam to take enough video to assess your responsibility in an accident I think this one would work for you. If you want one where you can read the license plates of those around you then you need to spend more money on it.Honestly after I use this one for a few months I might buy another for our other car so all three have some protection in case of an accident. It works much better than I expected and past experience has shown me that Vantrue's customer support is phenomenal.Edited to add: I experimented with the settings and reducing the exposure settings helped reduce/eliminate the lens flares. I can even read license plates of vehicles in front of me and the reflective road signs show up much better. The downside is that it makes everything else darker but I'm okay with the tradeoffs.
5,I was looking for a camera with a parking mode feature in response to a recent raft of thefts of catalytic converters and air bags. I ordered and compared three models: VanTrue N1 VanTrue N4 and Garmin Mini2. The N1 won out--it's the least expensive and in my overnight tests actually turned on faster than the N4 when there was visible motion such as a person or auto came into view. The N1 also has a battery though I haven't figured out how long it will work. The N4 is overkill for my purpose--I don't need cameras inside the car or looking behind--though the N4 offers a higher resolution if I was to use only the front facing camera. The Garmin detects movement in the vehicle but doesn't detect visible motion. At 1080 resolution isn't that good and I'm interested in a higher resolution camera in the future.
5,Acquired this camera to replace one I've been using for years.  After reading WireCutter's recommendation I decided to upgrade.  And I'm glad I did.  This tiny but powerful camera has a very small form factor and fits on the windshield without taking up a lot of real estate.  The power cord is plenty long enough to hide along the windshield and center console.Update (September 2022): The suction cup mounting bracket lost its ability to stick to the window (or any smooth flat surface).  I contacted their Customer Service Team.  Wow what a wonderful response.  They replaced the mounting bracket very quickly.  Indeed from my perspective their customer service is 'second to none'.  Nice to know there are companies who really support their products.  Kudos to them for sure!
5,Absolutely love this product. Frist dashcam i've bought and I wanted to go all out.it's small and powerfulVideo Quality is amazingMotion detection: haven't tried it out too much but it worked fine for my testing.Night Vision: it can see just as much if not more than human eyes  no worrying about the other lights(headlisght streetlights etc.) dimming the video on you and making the dqark unseeable.
4,I've owned this dashcam for two years now. The picture quality is really good and the camera works very well. I also use the GPS module which works well. However after two years of use part of the mounting bracket on top of the camera snapped off making the camera useless (see pic). I looked closely at the bracket and noticed the other side is also cracked. I use this camera on three different vehicles so moving it from mount to mount probably stressed the camera bracket. It was also cold when it broke. A few quirks - 1) the swivel mount doesn't tighten much so the camera is easily bumped out of position 2) the internal storage of time and other settings will go away if you don't use the camera often enough and 3) the mount will sometimes fall off of the windshield in extremely hot or extremely cold weather. (I live in Michigan.) Wrap a loop of the wire around the rear view mirror post so the camera won't fall to the floor. Set the G-force to low the default is too sensitive. Also keep in mind the HD function creates very large files a 5 minute clip consumes about 558 MB. Despite the quirks and the broken bracket I like this camera enough to buy another one.
5,I have used this dashcam for a few months and am finally writing this review after using it extensively.First of all I was impressed with the compact size of the camera. It does not take too much space on the windshield and is not a distraction at all.Second I was worried about the installation but the guidance to install the microSD card format it mount the cam and running the wire was a breeze. It took less than 10 minutes.Third I was a little worried about using the features of the camera and it seemed complicated initially. But a quick read of the manual makes it very clear. Most operations are done using the main button at the top of the cam and that is all that you will most likely use after setup.I was unfortunate about being involved in an accident where someone entered my lane unsafely and I hit the back of their car as a result. Thanks to the camera I was able to show the officer what happened who wrote up an incident report putting the blame on the other party. This helped me with my insurance claim. I never hoped to have to use the camera but when you have to it would certainly come in handy.I docked a star from the suction power as the camera fell down once when the car was parked in hot weather facing the sun. I have a feeling that the heat caused the suction to fail. But I remounted the camera and havent had a problem since.Pros:* Compact size hides nicely and does not distract* Easy to setup and install. Wire is sufficient to connect to 12V port* Night vision is good able to read license plate of car in front* Good video quality both at high speed and low light conditionCons* Suction failed once in hot weather condition* No rear view capability* Need additional attachment for GPS capability* Can't easily read license plate of car that is about 4-5 car lengths ahead
4,I have had this camera now for over 2 years. I really love it. It turns on automatically when I get in the car it has a super long cord that I can wrap around the dash and hide it. It's got easy access to the videos when I need them and I always feel really safe having it in the car. Knowing that I have proof if someone hits me is super reassuring.My only issue is the cars get hot in the summer and after 2 years my suction cup started failing. I am not sure if it's because the rubber shrunk the windshield is too hot or something else.I have contacted the manufacture and they have reassured me they would like to help which is excellent customer service in my opinion.I am very happy with this purchase.
5,I think you get your money's worth with this camera. It has a lot of features like time lapse (with 4 different speeds) parking monitor exposure control a very good mic and a very strong suction cup thanks to a lock bar you rotate for max hold. The ports and SD card holder are clean and solid and I had to check why but they give good advice to format the card every couple weeks. As the card writes over old files some data can be misplaced making the file harder to read. This is particular to the card and format not the camera. The cord is pretty long and has good solid connectors and an extra usb port so you don't lose a port by plugging it in. Nice touch. Customer service is quick and responsive. I want the rear view mirror video screen now so your mirror is the output of the rear camera (and/or front also with night vision) so no backseat headrests or anything in the way. Would highly recommend.
5,Honestly quite impressed with this little camera. When my last one started losing it's ability to retain the date and such I was looking for a replacement on the cheaper side. This little guy is half the size of my last one maybe even smaller. Recording quality is surprisingly good even at night or in the rain. It's easy to navigate and supports a 256gb card which gives me like 34+ hours of recording time. It does looping and overwrites video as most people look for and has gravity sensing for parking. It does everything I was looking for without breaking the bank and I promise you won't be disappointed.
4,I bought this on sale because I do a good amount of doordash and just don't trust the other drivers on the road. I keep it plugged in not hardwired so it never turns off. I use a simple 64gb sd card and 2 extras incase I need to save something as I'm too ad/hd to remember after each dash. Only problem so far is it'll save very random video clips to the protected folder.
5,The camera is great small and easy to use and not obstructing vision in any way. My only issue is with my suction cup mount.  I dont know if anyone else has had any issues with it but my suction cup mount fell off many times almost every day and even sometimes multiple times per day. Currently hoping to get the adhesive mount option soon and that it will be better. Still an amazing camera for a good deal.
2,I really like this dash cam in general but a few glitches make it worthless.  So far the mount has been great and never fallen off the dash.  The video quality is good for this price range and there are a decent amount of setting.  Parking mode functions well but may be triggered by any movement including trees and bushes.  This can quickly fill up your memory card and overwrite other non-protected videos just something to consider and monitor on your camera with your usage.  The size of the camera is great and I am happy with the look and feel of the build quality.  For my uses it was pretty much plug and play other than clearing out the memory card every two weeks or so.My problems with this camera have been the software glitches.  Want to turn the camera off?  Lol no.  It will turn itself back on immediately even when unplugged.  There are times when I know the parking mode will be active constantly like when I'm street parked in the middle of Philadelphia and I don't want to overwrite previous non-protected recordings or otherwise fill up the memory card.  Even when I want to bring the camera inside and review the footage it ends up recording being taken down carried inside and sitting on the counter for hours ultimately overwriting the footage that I was hoping to review.  Want to manually lock a recording?  Sure!  Except its going to get overwritten regardless.  There have been at least a dozen times where I have tried to manually lock a recording and it showed the locked icon on the screen and all looked well but when I pulled the memory card a week later none of them were there.  The recordings that lock based on the G sensors seem to be actually protected.  I have updated the software and everything and it started behaving a little differently but never improved on these issues.My newest issue and I  am not sure what is going on is that the lock icon comes up ALL THE TIME on the screen and I stop the recording and start it again so the card doesn't get filled up with useless clips that are protected but the camera will show the same shortly after.  I live in an area with many potholes and I know that many of them can activate the G sensor but this does not seem to be the case with any of these new locked videos.Is this a good budget camera?  I really want to say yes.  If you get the biggest memory card possible these overwrite issues will not be as noticeable because you will have more time to offload the recordings before they are overwritten.  Is it worth buying a cheaper camera and having to spend more on a memory card than just getting a better camera?  I don't think so.  This does what I need it to do on the day to day.  If you record something that you need to keep take the card out before it can be overwritten.  Don't trust that turning off the camera will keep your recordings from being overwritten.  My concern is that if there was ever a reason that I couldn't do this right away such as a serious accident where I am incapacitated then the footage is likely useless.
4,I had a dead battery and even replaced battery before we found out the camera was using it when let plugged in and off
5,This is the exact and perfect dash cam I was looking for. Very compact and picture quality is great. I needed help and had questions so I contacted customer service and they got back to me right away and resolved everything. Best company to deal with and quality of dash cam is outstanding. I give it an A+
3,****Had to give the cam 3 out of 5 stars due to the poor instruction manual.**** See UPDATE below. I was astounded by the beautiful day and night time picture quality. A key factor for me was the ability to clearly capture another car's license plate in the event of issue. This camera truly achieves this. I am currently using a 32 gb microSD High endurance card--so formatting is not necessary. To format 64gb to 256gb--they claim it is very easy (it is not!!!). For the price this is the best dash cam that I have ever come across. I have been researching this topic for a while and the VanTrue N1 is the best camera at this price point. The high end 4k models do not appeal to me. Perhaps if I was vlogging it would be worth the investment. Note:  I have not tested the Parking motion activated system yet. I plan on testing it this week by connecting the dash cam to a 20100  external battery pack. I figure that should be more than enough power when my car sits for 12 hours in a busy parking lot. The camera obviously does not stay on when the car is turned off due to its dependence on d/c electricity. One last pro--the camera screen goes dark after a minute or so when it is turned on. This is a really neat feature since an active screen could be potentially distracting and also for privacy and security no one that pulls next to you at a red light can tell that you are recording. Enough typing...buy the camera and enjoy.***UPDATE***I purchased a 128gb MicroSD card and to my dismay the camera would not format it to FAT32. The manual says it will. Maybe they know something I do not.  Note: Anything above 32gb will not work in this device without being formatted to FAT32. Unfortunately Windows does provide us with software that will make the conversion. After a little research I downloaded a free program called EaseUS partition Master and it was super easy. For a 128gb card the cluster size to pick is 32kb. (64gb card--16 kb cluster. 256gb card--64kb cluster). I am using an external battery pack to record when I am not in the car. It has worked flawlessly. Overall the dash cam is nice but at the same time I should not have to search the internet for a fix for their mistake.
4,Great dashcam with tons of features for the price point.  Clear wide-view video captures the view out the front windshield and pretty far to left/right.  Provides a feeling of extra security when traveling.  Don't wait until you have an accident to get one - without proof it's just your word against theirs.  One thing that I would like to see is a way to mount this camera tight up against the top of the windshield possibly by using a side mount.  With my car the painted dots behind the mirror (apparently to act as a visor) prevent the suction cup from sticking so it has to be mounted a bit lower than I'd like. Thankfully this camera is so small it doesn't block the view by much.  Love the auto save/lock feature with the press of a button or on impact.  You can even detach this camera and use it as a wide angle snapshot or video camera in a pinch with 1920 x 1080 resolution.  As can be seen in the attached image it works well even when the sun is in the image.
4,Good camera but without night vision
4,I heard rave reviews about this dash cam and since I didn't want to spend a fortune I figured I'd give it a try. Honestly I had a lot of trouble getting it to work initially because I needed to update the firmware (which didn't work for me at first). I hardwired this with the vantrue kit since I wanted footage of anything that happened while I was parked but I'm still not completely confident it works as I want it to. It seemed too easy to set off the g-sensor which would then save everything and fill the sd card but I honestly haven't checked it in a while with my computer to see how the recordings actually are. From what I was in the beginning even though I set it to record in 5 minute increments it saved really short clips onto the card. Maybe with the firmware update that also changed but I'm not sure. As far as I know the blue light is still on so the camera must be recording. Once I did find that it had turned off and I'm not sure how long it had been off for but just make sure you check that it's recording when you get in your car (mine is hidden behind the rearview mirror so I rarely remember to check). Overall it seems like the picture quality is good but I wish it worked a little better right out of the box. I just want to feel secure that my car is protected if something were to happen to it while parked.
2,I have been using this camera for a month now and I have no complaints.  the camera is quite lights picture is clean and clear.  It so happened that I took out the camera along with the suction cup from the windscreen to format the sd card and it was recommended by VANTRUE to format the sd card every 2 weeks.  After doing so I placed the suction cup back on the screen and locked it and it keeps falling off.  I am quite disappointed.
5,I'm really impressed with this camera! I read some blog reviews and heard that this one was not just the best "budget" dash cam but also best overall and decided to give it a try.It was easy to set up. It uses a micro USB to charge from the wall and to upload your files to the computer and a mini USB to plug into the car cigarette lighter port. You will need to buy an SD card as well to store the files.The camera has a very wide angle so you can easily capture your entire front dash. Not sure if it is a full 180 but it's definitely close.You'll need to buy the GPS mount separately but it's well worth it if you are to get into an accident and need to prove location. On the videos it includes a time and date stamp as well as GPS coordinates. You can turn the microphone on/off as needed and press a button to take a photo at any point during recording. It saves your photos in a separate folder so you can easily find them later. To me the best feature is that it will turn on and begin recording when you start the car and off when you turn the car off - a no brainer. It will also start recording (on battery) when it experiences a change in acceleration for example if your car is bumped it'll record for the next 20 seconds and then turn off again. If it's recording and the power is lost (like if you're in an accident) it will continue recording for a short period of time on battery.All in all I'm very excited about this product and it has given me great peace of mind during my commute!s
4,I have used this dashcam for a couple years now. My biggest problem runs into the suction cup. Anytime it is over 90 F outside the suction looses grip and it falls of my window. I have to reapply once or twice a day.  It’s more of a nuisance than anything. I wouldn’t call it a deal breaker though. I prefer wireless dash cams but for this price it’s perfectly acceptable in my opinion. The camera quality is more than adequate. In my opinion it is well worth the $70.  I do recommend this camera if you’re looking for a budget friendly dash camera.
5,This is great tiny dashboard camera with excellent customer support.  For the past 5 years I tried multiple dash cameras from different manufacturers. Most of them (cameras) died in the first 2-3 month primarily due to bad mechanical quality. One model survived for 3+ years but when I wanted to buy it again for a new car I found that the company that manufactured and sold it does not exist anymore.  I did some research and found Vantrue - a company that offers wide variety of dashboard cameras and accessories to them. I purchased two N1Pro cameras (one for the front window and one for tailgate) and have been using them for 2 weeks now. My impression so far is very good. This is what I like:  1) Mechanical quality looks good the mount feels tight;  2) There are 2 power source options available - USB or car charger (both cables are included; I use USB for the front camera and car charger for the tailgate one);  3) Video quality is very good - can read license plates of cars nearby (unless the camera points directly a the Sun)  4)  Excellent customer support. I had an issue with on of the suction mounts contacted support and they sent me a new mount.  5) There are a lot of setup options but the default configuration is very reasonable making the setup very easy.One thing that I am trying to change is the amount of files that the camera protects from automatic deletion. I suppose this happens because the default "medium" setting for the G-sensor might be too high for my conditions (car/roads/etc) so I changed it to "low" and will see how it works.  Overall I like the camera and think it is absolutely worth the money.
5,No problems and nice images. High quality feel right from the start. Does not feel cheap at all.
4,a lot of time and work to install for low quality device could be easier if i would go to electronics shop they would install this for me
5,It survived two 100+° days on my windshield so far. It must have been much hotter than that in the car. Sturdy little thing & not too obtrusive.  We like it.
4,Update: Small does not obstruct view when placed behind rear view mirror. So far the replacement camera has worked great; no issues. Gift recipient is happy with the camera. Amazon sent a replacement. Vantrue sent a windshield mount to compensate for my troubles after posting initial review. I would still recommend dealing directly with Amazon if you have a problem out of the box.Original review: So far the camera and customer support get a zero if zero stars were possible. Camera was given as a gift and SD card recommended will not click in the slot as directions state. Therefore we contacted Vantrue customer support via email (no phone support) and have had numerous emails back and forth none of which had any troubleshooting suggestions only questions about whether it clicks in if you push hard whether it click in if you push soft and on and on. Each question is a separate email that has delayed any resolution. I have asked now 4 times for replacement or refund without a confirmation of either. Finally contacted Amazon to get a replacement. So bottom line here is if you have an issue out of the box send back to Amazon immediately. Do not use Vantrue customer support as they will delay beyond your refund period. I just hope the replacement works. If not it will have been a waste of money and time but above all complete gifting fail.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I've been playing with the camera for a few days and it works perfectly. I've had no issues. The one thing I wish was different was I wish the power cable came out of the right side of the holder instead of the left but that is just my preference.Some cell phone holders I have gotten in the past have suction cups that are terrible. This one is really good. You can spin the knob to tighten the suction. It feels like it is on there very sturdy.The video quality is REALLY good. I am attaching a recording of my drive to this review. Also I am attaching a picture of the cam mounted on my window. It is a lot smaller than I expected but that is a good thing and not a bad thing.The materials the camera are made with seem high quality and not cheap like some things you get these days.The setup was very easy. You basically turn it on insert a MicroSD card format the card and you're off. NOTE: I had to contact support because I got a  card error when I first turned the device on with my card in it. All I had to do was format the card using the tool in the camera. You can either transfer the video files to your computer by taking out the card and inserting it into your computers MicroSD slot or you can just connect the camera to your computers USB port and transfer them that way. I do it this second way because it's a lot easier than getting that card out.Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I love playing with new hi-tech things.
5,It has a good picture quality with a 256 mb card the data saved can go for 3 days.
3,They advertised lots of special features that we can't seem to get the camera to do.  And they have been slow to respond to our requests for help.
4,I don't think this is something that reads license plates half as well as others say it does in my experience but they are right that the night-time performance is outstanding for its cost range. I wouldn't get this without the GPS/Speed unit otherwise you're cutting yourself off from one of the more useful parts of the camera and why you should have it in the first place. It's relatively fun to use for a dash cam but it's not a go pro. it's light and unobtrusive and you'll want a high-capacity samsung memory card recording at the highest settings. You'll get used to the fish eye effect. So far haven't had to use footage in an accident incident but under most conditions there's good clarity that if you aimed it correctly the police and insurance companies should have no problem figuring out what happened if something happens to you from the front or near-front sides of the car.
5,I had a car accident on Fathers Day. Thankfully the person behind me gave me a note with his name & number for the police to call verifying my light was green. I lucked out. I started looking for a dash cam. I found VanTrue and talked with a rep about this one. When I first opened it is seems very small. I was concerned. I have a GoPro and tried to use it for a dash cam but they are not really designed for that. Hard to find a video once it takes it in the LOOP option. And if someone decides to steal it you are out a lot of money. So what can I do?The VANTRUE N1 PRO is small but the video is clear wide and it automatically puts the videos where you can find them. Connect to your computer and WOW. And if your car is in an accident the G FORCE option will automatically LOCK the video so you can obtain it saving you possible hundreds to thousand of $$$ proving you are in the right.The camera is small enough to not draw attention to it. (Picture from front of vehicle) The cost of $79 is worth every cent. I am seriously considering getting a second one for our other vehicle. Bottom lime - minimal cost great wide video videos stored in an easy way to find them folders.The truth was when I saw the size I was concerned and considered sending it back. But I figured let's give it a good look before we jump to conclusions. Glad I did and I think you will be glad as well. I have no reservation what so ever recommending the Vantrue N1 Pro Full HD dashcam.6 Month UPDATED REVIEW: Camera after 6 months of use every time we drive is still a great buy. Works when you start the vehicle and does an awesome job on every trip. Took two trips from Kentucky to Texas - worth every dime to protect us.
4,Solid 4 star product.The bad:Instructions are minimal. No details about what the menu settings actually do. “This is a menu. Select from options A or B.” Without knowing what A or B is or does. For example the G-sensor sensitivity setttings. Low Medium High. Is high sensitivity going to trigger the camera on every little bump or does that setting mean it takes a rather large shock to trigger the camera? Nobody knows.Also the parking mode is a little wonky. Tend not to use it because of the aforementioned issue and lack of documentation as to how to properly configure the camera for my needs.The suction cup sometimes pops off the glass if the car warms up. Solution is to remove the camera and mount from the glass and stow out of sight when parked in the sun.The good:For the price point and size the camera build quality and general function as well my overall results have been positive. The picture quality is quite decent when adjusted accordingly. Night time is decent also.One thing to note is that with the wide angle lens objects will appear much smaller on video playback or screen capture than to the naked eye. Such as a low flying plane landing at an airport. Might look huge flying over your head but on video it looks tiny and far away. That was disappointing.Bottom line: Satisfied. Would buy again; Would recommend. We own two Vantrue cameras.
5,OK first the not so good: actually it's smaller than I expected. Granted it's partly my fault didn't pay enough attention to the physical dimension specs (which is BTW accurate). You can hardly see what's on the screen while driving. But why would you want to see the screen while driving? You see the same real time. Anyways apart from that because of the size buttons are small you need skinny fingers to confidently handle them.Now the good: (and much more good things about this little guy than not so good) the image quality is very good when you use 1920 res. View angle is good too. Set up is a breeze very easy fast convenient (if you read the manual; if you don't like I did first you get confused. Actually YOU get confused not the unit). User's manual is good accurate easy to read and understand.I was happy with my purchase until I found out that their Web site is not working. You can't register products can't access updates. That's an important problem these days.Amazon's shipping is the best ever. Much faster than promised. Thanks.
4,THE CAM HAS EXCELLENT VIDEO AND AUDIO RECORDING. THE ONLY THING I FOUND HARD TO DEAL WITH IS THAT THE CAM DOES NOT ROTATE 360 DEGREES AND THAT MADE IT HARD FOR ME AS I WAS GOING TO MOUNT IT ON MY REARVIEW MIRROR AIMING IT OUT THE REAR WINDOW. LACK OF THE 360 DEGREE ROTATION FRUSTRATED ME FOR SOMETIME UNTIL THE ONLY THING I COULD DO WAS TO SEPARATE THE SUCTION MOUNT TURN IT AROUND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND ATTACH IT TO THE CAM. IT WORKED. ONE MORE THING. THE CAM DOES NOT HAVE A KNOB TO ADJUST THE CAM UP OR DOWN. OTHERWISE IT IS AN ONGOING EXPERIENCE. I KNOW AN UPGRADE WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE COST. I MADE IT WORK THE OLD COUNTRY BOY STYLE. A NEW BALLGAME FOR ME FOR SURE.
4,The video quality is good and the camera functions well. For anyone having issues with the mount falling off see the attached picture. If you use a small flat head screwdriver you can remove the cap covering the mounting mechanism. When you attach it to your windshield press down on the center (red circle) to squeeze out as much air as possible. Then rotate the mechanism to lock it down.This used to fall off my windshield every day. Ever since removing the back cap (about two weeks ago) it hasn't fallen off even in 100F heat.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have recently moved to an area that is a hub for every crazy driver. A multi car accident is a typical weekday for us along our side roads. I think it mostly stems from the rapid expansion the area has seen and now because there is more people there is more traffic. More traffic mean there are more people trying to find a shortcut like running down the turning lanes for 1+ miles. This has led to a number of bad crashes.Because I know that me getting hit by some jerk is only a matter of time I thought it would be good to invest in some protection. I drive a new truck and I want to make sure that when I do get hit I can have evidence that they fault it not with me. I have been trying out a number of different dash cameras and I can honestly say that the Vantrue cameras are some of the best. I have tried more expensive options and less expensive ones but this model is my perfect camera.It has really good picture quality but is not overly large like many of the 4K camera on Amazon it doesn't have any fake chrome which is tacky in my opinion. It mounts well and then the plug is into the mount instead of the camera itself it makes for a much cleaner install. I did have to go buy a 15ft mini USB cable to hard wire the camera into my truck but that was worth the extra $5 to not have a cable hanging down.If you are in the market for a camera do yourself a favor and buy this one.
2,We bought this in 2019 but it stopped working few months after we bought it. The time stamp always revert back to Jan 1 2018 once the car turns off. Camera quality is good but if the time stamp is wrong I don’t know what good it does when showing to the authorities in case of an accident. Also after a yr the the rubber suction cup broke. I was hoping it can be replaced but no choice.
3,****Update moving from 1 start to 3. was finally able to return the unit to the company.  They shipped a new unit to me as soon as I provided the tracking number.  The new unit is work as expected we will see if it makes past the three-month mark.****After 3 months of ownership this unit is failing to accept a charge.  I have been in contact with the manufacturer for almost a week.  They keep asking me to try different things to see where the charging issue is.  All testing that I did on my own point to a bad battery.  They had me do the same test then after that response they asked for a video.  This just keeps going on day after day.  This is what I got back today "Normally the camera can stay on for 5 minutes while recording when it is new. This time will get shorter as you use the camera. So it is necessary to keep it fully charged. Yes the date will reset if the camera sits unused for some hours. This is how the camera performs as it gets used for a while. Can you connect the camera to a constant power source while not using it?"My unit has been under full power all the time unit I moved to a different vehicle for a trip that when I notice the issue.Before the above issue I was very happy with the unit and had no issues it would have been 4 stars we will see if they change that in the next few days.  Will update this review if they make me happy again.
5,Wow what an awesome Lil camera! I was a little apprehensive about buying a dash cam because it’s not something you “play” with or use daily for fun type of thing. You just put it in your car an hope you never really need it. An with buying my first new car I felt what could it hurt. The quality of this camera is way better than I expected considering the price and size. I didn’t want a bulky camera on my windshield taking up my view. This little camera fits behind my review mirror dont even notice it’s there. The HD video clarity will def have your back in an accident day or night. The audio it can pick up is excellent as well. At work I park my car in a busy parking lot. So I wanted the option of the parking mode in which this one has. With 3 options of its sensitivity. I had to turn it down because every time a train would go by it would set it off.. lol so it can definitely pick up the slightest bump of a driver not paying enough attention. It comes well packaged nice box easy to set up instructions can definitely tell they’ve put time in putting out a good product. I purchased the GPS mount for it also so I could have the speed stamp and location in car of a wreck. I’ve seen those videos of dash cam wrecks and in some cases the camera saved the driver from being at fault. An with people on their phones as much as they are these days it’s well worth the money in my opinion. Will be getting another for my wife’s car.
5,I was very skeptical when I received this dash cam since it was very compact. I was totally wrong the images are clear with FHD 1920x1080 resolution so whenever you need that extra detail to catch plates on the road. This FHD resolution is even more essential in nighttime view.What I like about this camera is that once you set it up you just leave it and forget it how easy is that?The reaction when you press the button on the camera is near instant such as image capturing video start and stop recording. There is no sluggish nor laggy feeling which is great at this price point.It also seems to have image stabilization since I capture images when the car was in motion and the image is still retained clearly.The fisheye view gives it a wider angle so you don't miss the sides and get more real estate.The suction cup/mount is really sturdy and fixed once mounted the light and compact camera help since less gravity to pull down on it. It seems to last the California heat but I will need more time to observe.I really can't find anything bad about this camera. Maybe the quick start guide could be written a little better I had to dig in the manual to find out that you must be in recording mode to capture images. The could add a little moretext on the camera itself but I can't blame them since the camera is so compact left with no room.Overall I am very happy about this purchase and the price point is very reasonable. I had the Garmin Nuvi Cam and it wasn't quite as good or compact. This is my observation for now I will update once I have more time on this camera.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             After getting my first dashcam I realized how important it is to have one.  So I was looking for an inexpensive dash camera to give to my family (mom dad and sister.)  My current dashcam in my car is a Vantrue dashcam that is the rearview mirror style so i decided to try this one out for my parents.First of all it's affordable.  My parents don't need anything fancy like the rear view mirror with touch screen and hand gestures.  So this one was a great option.  It has all the features you need.Pros:1. Small and compact.2. You can power the camera with the mount and a mini usb cable.  This is great when you want to disconnect your camera to hide it.  You just slide it out of the mount and back on.  No need to reconnect cables.3. Picture quality at night and in the day is awesome.4.  Can also be powered by the micro usb port on the camera itself.5. G-shock sensor to detect collisions.6. Parking mode will capture short clips while your car is parked.  This may be useful when capturing hit and runs or vandals.Cons:Can't really think of any.  It does what it is supposed to do and does it well.  I guess the on thing I can think of is that the videos are in .mov format which is apple proprietary format.  I mean it plays in windows just fine.  But may have been better to use a more ubiquitous format such as mp4.  But that's pretty minor.  Plus if you are a mac user then it doesn't even matter.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This dash cam is surprisingly efficient in it's video capabilities. The picture is bright and sharp and gives you a nice wide angle view. It turns on and off automatically when your vehicle turns on or off. I like the button layout on the back of the Vantrue N1 Pro dash cam because they're very easily accessed. It'll accept an SD card up to 256GB which is unheard of in the industry. The settings are easily accessed to personalize the dash cam to your liking or you can leave them on default. There;s a button on top of the dash cam that functions much like a camera in that one quick press allows for a snapshot or a long press enters the cam in parking mode. Accessories included are a car charger a USB charger cable and a suction cup for mounting to your windshield. You can power the dash cam using the USB cable and attaching it to a power bank if you so choose that method. I actually purchased this to mount in my rear windshield for just in case of a rear end collision because I already had one facing the front. Another use is something I tried just for kicks and that is I attached it to my front window in my home and recorded a few hours of foot traffic and cars going by just as a surveillance camera would do. It actually did quite well! Anyway in closing I'm very pleased with my purchase and looking forward to many years of use because the build quality is quite good.
5,So far the camera seems to be working great with no issues. My usage case scenario is less then ideal for the camera since I have subs in the back that can cause excessive vibrations. I also suspect this has destroyed my precious dashcam I will follow up if anything changes but so far so good.
5,Wonderful dash cam. I used this for a while before upgrading to a dash cam with wifi to see the videos on my phone if I want. My sister took over using this dash cam. She won't give me any clips for my YouTube channel probably because they are all her. She's a terrible driver. LOLIf you want to see this cam in action go to YouTube and search BAD DRIVERS OF DUVAL COUNTY. Go back in my videos and look for BAD DRIVERS OF PHOENIX videos. Maricopa Count #55 and below are videoed using this cam. Enjoy.
3,I used a formatted old sd card on this camera and was told "card error" issue in the Q&A part. So I spent extra $25 on a brand new card and had the same issue. Couldn't you program this camera to be "card error" then "Would you like to format this sd card?" Huge disappointment.
5,I've used this little gem for 4 weeks so far purchased after reading many on line reviews (NYT Wirecutter Forbes etc) and it is everything they say and more.I'm so impressed with this that I bought two more for our kids.
4,Overall I would say this device works well for the price.  I have two main issues.  1) How it manages time.  The device does not use the GPS for time rather the user has to manually enter the time.  This is a pain as the time does not hold very long when power is removed.  2) The internal battery after one year lasts about 2 seconds once power is removed.  Again the picture quality is really good for the price**** With the new firmware v12 the time now updates.  The internal battery still only last about 10 seconds.**** The new Firmware did not fix the time problem. Overnight the time dropped and went to 01/01/2030.
3,I’ve followed the internet to the letter on putting the suction cup on the windshield but it will not stay on at all after trying to get it to stay on asks the way the camera connects to the cup is a pain to (which I suspect is the issue). Will be looking for another suction cup. Camera is ok otherwise menu is easy to navigate and is featured enough.
4,So far it works fine. I had a deer run into me and never saw it but it was easily seen.
4,It needs to stay plugged in because the battery life is super short.
5,It’s an amazing dash-cam fairly easy to use and operate. I am satisfied and happy with the product. The suction has been great but I only put 4 stars because it did come off one day after parking car in the sun it has not happened again though in months. The Florida sun on hot days can do that to those suction cups so one time is actual really good. Hopefully it will stay out and not fail.
5,People in my town run red lights! Everyday I notice people cruising through the red lights on their phones etc and I want to be covered in an accident...I ended up choosing the Vantrue N1 Pro Mini Dash Cam because of its size. I already have a Honda Sensing in my car for accident avoidance so I needed a camera that would fit along side the builtin camera and sensors while still not blocking my view. The size of this camera was perfect. It fits nicely behind my rear view mirror without blocking any forward vision.When inserting the SD card in the camera the manual is wrong the card bottom with the gold strips should face the LCD screen. In the manual it shows the card label facing the LCD which is wrong. A few of the other functions could be better documented but it is not anything major. Simply playing with the camera will allow you to figure out the delay settings etc..Overall the camera quality is excellent. I am able to easily read licence plates and signs during playback.. Because of my camera placement I cannot easily access the snapshot button to capture pictures while I'm on the move but this because of my mounting choice.A few days after getting the camera i purchased the GPS mount. This adds just enough information like SPEED Time/Date and GPS coordinates to the video to easily capture what and where anything caught on video happened. You can see that in my screen captures. Yes I realize now I was speeding just a bit...LOLOverall.. I find the camera quality to be exactly as advertised the menu is easy to use and the size is just the perfect fit for my already crowded windshield.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I was looking for a portable dash cam for when I travel. It's easy to attach it's clear. I was looking for something that would see clear license plates.I did also opt for the optional GPS mount.Detaching from the mount was a bit tricky I had to practice that a couple of times before I could do it in the dark. However I wouldn't call that a bad thing it's definitely secure.Uploading I had an issue. Not a problem with the device but I'm adding it here in case someone else has a blond moment as I did.When I plugged it into my computer dropbox was only uploading .jpgs. After reading the manual again and checking online I even emailed Vantrue support  I decided to open the dashcam drive directly. There they all were. Easy peasy.I went in and turned off the dropbox auto upload for that drive.You may laugh now.All in all it's extremely easy to use quite compact and exactly what I was looking for. Vanture support was awesome even tho by then I had fixed my user error they were fairly quick to respond.
5,My son bought this camera for me about 2 years ago and I use it every time I drive any where. I decide to buy one for my mom after she had a close call with a reckless driver. My mom is in her late 70s and this camera is very easy for her to use. I would buy it again if needed.
3,A decent dash cam without WiFi and GPS. The night view is not good: only see the plate when the speed is under 10mph. Daylight view is sharp and in right color. Plate numbers can be see clearly in a relative speed around 40mph and upto 70mph in a good light condition. In other words once driving at 40mph it is difficult to get a good picture of plate for the car in the opposite lane. While with 1080p at 30fps this performance is fair. However taking no WiFi and GPS into consideration this dash cam doesn't stand out.
4,GoodWhen I press the save video it doesn’t save video.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is a great dashcam for the price. It came equipped with a generous length power cord into regular 12V receptacle (also acts as a blue night light for the car inside). The G-sensor is very sensitive so I recommend setting the sensitivity to low or you would be reformatting your card every week or two. It does not come with a microSD card so I would recommend getting a high endurance card to be used with the dashcam. I really like the mount as it's very simple to use and very secure. The camera size is very compact which is great! There are plenty of features like automatic event recording audio recording loop recording etc. (all can be turned off if desired).Installation is a breeze. I just had to snake the cord around the car interior and it held on without any tape. Picture quality is quite decent. You can see from other reviews of what the video is like under sunny days but camera tend to showcase how good/bad they are at dusk with little lighting. Real world footage is the best indicator of the quality and I uploaded a video of me driving at dusk with this review. Picture quality is still good around dusk time and you can still clearly see the license plate of the person in front which is a big plus.Main complaint I have is there's no way to turn off that blue light on the 12V power cord but it's not a big deal. Overall I would highly recommend this dashcam for its quality.
5,The camera's night vision is surprisingly good.  Night vision ranges from 15 to 30 ft. and more depending on lighting conditions. I haven't tried it in pitch-dark conditions. The photos you see in the ads reflect reality. Daytime videos are crisp. The device is easy to use: Plug it into a power source and it starts running. Get a 128 GB high speed card for $20+ and you can capture a 12 hour trip or so.This is an edited version of an earlier review. I had first reported a glitch with playback. The glitch occurred every 15 to 20 video files. Windows media player didn't recognize the file. I had to use another video player. It turned out the Samsung SD Card was the issue. I upgraded to a Scandisk Extreme. The higher speed card took care of it. You can probably find the equivalent Samsung card. I upgraded my rating from 4 to 5 stars.
3,This might be a decent camera but the fact you need some sort of special SD card which is marked up makes it not so good of a product. Entry point is lower when on sale but with the purchase of the SD card it brings up the overall price for a dash cam to that of other brands. Returned the product
5,The Vantrue N1Pro is a small compact camera that has a lot of features of a bigger size dash cam. First of all I like to mention that the camera size which is perfect to be placed on the top part of the windshield so people looking from the outside can hardly see it. The camera records in HD 1920x1080p/30fps so the picture and video quality output is very clear. The wide angle 160 degree lens records the entire windshield plus more while the camera is in use. In south Texas where I am from the heat in a closed vehicle during the day can reach up to the 120* Fahrenheit and that ok with this camera because it can handle the heat from -4 to 158F* With that being said every once in a while the suction cup for the camera will detach from the windshield when the moisture from the suction cup is dry.The other thing that I do appreciate from this the camera is the parking monitor mode. It does an excellent job in recording anything that moves in front of the camera ( I have mine hardwire to my vehicle ) so that the camera always has external power to operate. As far as the media for recording the events I do recommend on getting the micro SD card 256GB Class 10 U3 for the HD quality videos.So If you want to try a quality dash cam without paying to much money I recommend the Vantrue N1 Pro.
4,Surprisingly good picture quality and i like that it breaks up long trips into short video segments. My two issues; 1. the slightest movement of my vehicle and it turns on. I can't open the door to grab my wallet without the camera coming on. It's become a challenge to close the door so softly that the camera won't come on. I hate that I've made a game out of this. 2. Suction sucks and its worse in transition from cold to warm weather. I had to get on YouTube to find some solutions that work for more than a week or so. It's no fun getting off the train to find a dangling camera in my truck. I don't need passersby to know I have a camera in there.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                   Vantrue N1 Pro Full HD 1920X1080P Mini Dash Cam for Cars 1.5" LCD Dashboard Camera Car Video Recorder with Sony Sensor Night Vision Parking Mode G-Sensor & Collison Detection Support 256GB Max         so let me start off by saying this N1 pro was more then i was expecting.I decided to try the N1 Pro because in Philadelphia you can never know when you're car would be vandalize or damaged by other drivers. having had an car accident in the past with out a dash cam and the pain of dealing with insurance i decided to try this dash cam out straight out the box everything looked built well. but i was most amazed at the small size of the dash cam it haves to be the smallest one out in the market but just because it is small does not mean it bad or cheep . accessing the menu to set up the time and date was a breeze. pleaded off all the protective plastic covers stuck it to my car windshield 321 had to make adjustments  to make sure video was level the way i would like  made easy buy the 360 ball joint on the mount . i tested the video at dusk right as a thunder storm was rolling in and the video when reviewed was so clear even with all the rain wile driving you can see so much detail . over all you can not go wrong with this dash cam . if you want sum-thing discreet easy to use and high quality then you want to get this N1 Pro for sure ! (the clip i shared is right befor the rain started )
5,The quality seems good at this price point.  The battery life which holds the time and date for stamping is the question but the previous Vantrue dash cam lasted 2 years before the battery wouldn't charge and it was out of the 18 month warranty. I'll make sure to check the recording and battery memory at 15 months.
5,This is my third camera in a two years periodAll of them working so far
5,I have been using this camera for about a week now. It is a pretty good  build quality. The videos and picture quality seems to be of decent quality.  I had no problem installing it on my 08 Honda Civic. The mount has not fallen off the windshield yet. IT has a pretty good suction. It comes with a pretty long cable to I was able to route the cable in a way that it is hidden.Pros:-Tiny stays well hidden- long power cable- Has a USB charging port on the 12 V adapter as you can see it in the picture- Strong suction mountCons- No Wifi to view the videos. You have to  physically get the card or get the whole camera out. In case of an accident it would be nice to show it to the police just using wifi. But if you have an android phone you can just put it in and look at the videos- It would have been nicer if the power cable were a USB cable. The you could have connected the USB to any USB port or a separate car adapter. Current 12 V adapter is long and sticks out of the accessory port.Overall I am happy with the camera and is still worth the 5 stars.
5,For all the feature that this camera offers the price is well worth it. Though the camera is small in size it has a wide view of the road. The picture quality is very clear day and night. I also bought the gps so I can have my MPH displayed. I purchased the hardwire but then I realized I don’t need it. Those that complained of there battery dying is because they didn’t keep in mind that if you don’t run your car then you are not charging your car battery. What I do is simply plug the gps in the plug port when I drive and when I’m done driving for the day I unplug the gps and have resulted in no issues with the battery.
5,Camera can be used as security camera using the data cable to the camera and a small PowerBar. I use a 10000mha PowerBar.As for the writen mention above the camera quality is as advertised.
5,I really like this camera. My first experience with dashboard camera wasn't a good one. I remember getting a cheap one on sale an let me tell you something... I regret it since day 1. Big bad image quality the suction power.. SUCKS. Thats why I decided to look for better options and i found Vantrue Camera N1 Pro Mini and boy...I'm pleased. Small camera with big HD Image quality  up to 1080p. Sensitivity can be over the top sometimes but is easily adjusted in the settings.You can count on a superb night vision. Suction power is good i mean good. You can relax when driving knowing that your camera is not gonna fall during your road trip. You can record with or without audio I prefer the second option but thats just a personal taste.Go and get one and you'll  feel safer on the road knowing that if something happens you can count on your vantrue camera to capture it.
5,I must say that I am impressed with the Vantrue N1 Pro dash cam.  It is a feature packed budget dash cam for $80!  The compact size is very stealth compared to my Owl Dash Cam.  The unit records in 1080P 30 FPS - Sony IMX323 - awesome video quality.  I'm using a 256 GB Lexar EVO MicroSd card and it works flawlessly - very few dash cams supports 256 GB btw.  The included suction cups works great with my car.  The optional gps unit should have been included .  The built in Parking mode works really well and very useful feature when parking outside.  I think N1 Pro produces better video quality than my Owl Dash Cam (when downloading video clips though the built in wifi instead of using LTE credits [Full 1440P]) - that is saying a lot since the Owl is $350!  Overall I definitely recommend the N1 Pro from Vantrue.Plus:Very good video qualityGreat price considering the performance and features256 GB MicroSd compatibleStealth sizeCons:Should have come with built in GPSBetter night time video quality (typical weakness of a dash cam)
5,been using it for a couple weeks now. so far its great. good picture and no issues with operation. comes on when I start and shuts off when the key gos off. downloading the files are pretty easy now that I figured it out . not vantrues faultits my typical don't look at the book until ive screwed with it for a while.i like that you can turn the screen off and on and take a still when you want. now my problem . deleting files. followed the book on this one and it dosent work. follow the instructions and sometimes it work. sometimes it do. other than that good product. in my opinion a good value.one more thing. the mount is on top. I put my camera on the dash. the only way to power it with the gps mount is on the top. this mounting bracket sticks up in my vision. not so good. oh well will put up with it
5,I really do not have any dislikes except for the GPS mount should be included in the original box and not a add on accessory.  I like the picture quality and it is easy to use....you can turn the microphone off or on as preferred. I feel more comfortable driving because this takes the guess work out of who was doing what in an accident. I recommend this camera if you are on a budget due to it only looks forward and not back which you can purchase a different model for more money. Also purchase the electrical hook up cable kit so you can wire into you car or truck. That way you do not have any obstruction of the cable hanging down and you almost forget it's there.
3,If you need a simple dash cam with fair image quality for a fair price this is not a bad product. Unfortunately the sensor used in the dash camera is unable to catch necessary details such as license plate or vehicle make and model information.
4,Camera works fine. The suction would fail now and again to be expected. But after a year it kept falling no matter how well I cleaned it or the windshield. So I have the camera ziptied to the rear mirror. Make sure camera is on. Sometimes didn’t turn on. Very few times.
5,I decided to get a dash cam after a harrowing experience with a driver on the highway where he/she cut me off just before a divider that split the speed lanes in two directions then proceeded to cut across six lanes of highway in one fell swoop. Anyway I'm pleasantly surprised by how well this camera works. The packaging is really nice and the directions are clear. I bought a 128GB card for it. Once I set up the typical things in the menu system (date time sensitivity of G-force etc) I attached it to my windshield and it just works. The suction on the windshield is strong (it has a twist mechanism that makes a strong suction attachment). Whenever it detects movement it turns on (while driving and in Parking Mode). The picture is clear (I have it set to 1080) for both day and night shots. It's small so it stays out of the way. The construction looks solid. I have it plugged into my 12V internal socket. When I get some time I'm going to do the battery-direct connection.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This Dash Cam would be perfect if it wasn't constantly falling down. The video looks great. It's easy to use. But the suction doesn't last more than 5 minutes sometimes. It's pretty much guaranteed that when I walk to my car in the morning the camera is hanging by the cord. And same thing when I leave work...camera is hanging down. It's most frustrating when I'm driving and it falls down and scares the crap out of me. Then I have to try to put it back up while still paying attention to the road. The cord plugs right into the suction piece so I'm not sure what options I have to find something else that will stick better. Hopefully there is something out there that isn't duct tape.
3,It’s a nice camera I have had it for a week now and one major flaw is the cold I can have it fully charged at night but when I go out in the morning it’s dead the cold just zaps the battery but other then that it’s a nice camera
5,I love how this tiny dashcam packs a decent punch feature-wise. Any dashcam has FHD recording nowadays and most have G-Sensors loop recording etc. The thing many dashcams lack is an automatic parking mode and motion detection which this one's got (most Vantrue cams seem to have this standard set of features.It accepts cards up to 256GB which is a bonus - this means you can go days between having to worry about retrieving your footage on a computer.Heat dissipation is a major issue with such small factor so that's one thing that is hard to check during winters. This one has vents and the SD card slot is also an open-ended design which should aid in heat dissipation. The real test will be in summers but I'm hoping the product will stand true to its promise.I also like how it tells if you have been working too hard (see my screenshot about 24 hr recording). I'm not sure if it stops recording after 24 hours or just display the message but keeps recording.For the price though you can't complain much; given the fact that it's one the most feature rich cams in this size.
5,As a retired police officer I can't stress enough how important video cameras have become. This small investment could really work in your favor while driving on a daily basis! This is my second Vantrue product and I will be putting this one in my wife's car. I have driven around with it for the last few days and I have been pretty impressed with Vantrue. The foot print is small but powerful. I like the fact that the buttons are on the back of the camera instead of the top and sides. As long as you read the instruction manual figuring out the buttons shouldn't be a problem (unless you're the dude who doesn't read the instructions. LOL) The video images on this camera are very impressive...at 1920x1080P HD with a full 160 degree view!  One of the new updates I like about this one is it will hold a 256GB memory card! Some of the older cameras only did 32GB or 64GB. The one thing I wish was standard though is the GPS mount. The other part that I'm planning on buying soon is the hardwire kit so I can hide the power wire and have a cleaner install. You can't go wrong with this camera!
3,This is nearly perfect.  The mount is a bit long but the only real problem is that it doesn't reliably turn on with the car.  Often I have to notice and press the button.  And sometimes it turns itself back off a bit later.  Not great traits for an always-on device.
5,I’ve been a Vantrue dash cam user for over a year now.  My first and most recent dash cam was the X1 wide angle camera.  It had all the features I needed except the size of the camera was a hindrance.  It wasn’t in the way of my visibility but it would distract me.  Now I’ve purchased the Vantrue N1 Pro.  It’s an easy-to-use tiny dash cam with good built-in features i.e. excellent day and night captures HD video with super night vision amazing audio quality parking mode 24-hr parking monitor collision detection real battery micro USB port micro SD card slot HDMI port windshield mount and an easy to navigate 4-button panel next to the display.  I liked the fact that all I had to do was charge the camera for 2 – 3 hours and plug in to my existing windshield mount from my previous camera.  But what I loved the most was the size of the camera.  It's a tiny super dash cam that doesn’t cause any issues on my view when driving.  Thank you Vantrue!
3,Purchased in 2/20.  Manual states that files will be overwritten when disk is full.  Checked my camera today 10/21 and come to find that camera stopped recording back in 5/21.  Not sure why this is but check your disk periodically to make sure it is still recording.  Addedum: Checked my camera today. Reformatted card 10/21 today 2/11/22 I see that the card  memory is only one quarter full but stopped recording video on 1/26/22.
5,Got this for my wife SUV and Very Happy about it.Very easy to install just like another Car Cam. The only suggestion if it come with the plastic installation tool that help to hide the power cord to the edge of the car it will be perfect (because I have big fingers lol ). After tug in the cord and connect the cam on the windshield with the suction cup very nice and similar to the N2 pro.Power on and the 1.5" screen welcome you with a nice and colorful message  COOL!!This camera capture very good pictures and videos during day time.  For night time it is not as clear but still good enough and I consider GOOD for the price.Camera Button is small to me but it is a SMALL CAMERA : ) so it's still good!!Overall this is Good Price Good Value Dash car cam. Vantrue is a Reliable Brand. (I own N2 Pro for my car)  and their customer service is one of the top five I experienced.
5,After several weeks of research on dash cams I decided on the Vantrue N1 Pro. I was not disappointed. It contained all the features I was looking for; easy setup right out of the box nice picture quality in both day and night GPS  and a parking mode.I read lots of reviews and watch a few videos before I purchased this camera.  It has a built in battery which in my opinion is better then the superconductor on other cameras. The cable is long enough to go around your front windshield and around your pillars so you don't have to worry about showing ugly cables in front of your car.The GPS software is very cool.  You can see your route speed and G sensor while watching a video replay.I like this camera so much that I just bought a second one for my son's car. It is a small very unobtrusive unit that pretty much does its thing without blocking your vision  Also customer service is very good
5,I have been using the camera over two months now and give a honest view about this camera. I purchased the camera at a higher price at the end of OCT and the current price makes it an even better value.Picture quality: is great during the day and is pretty intuitive. Night quality is good but not the best. considering the price point i would say it is right on point just do not expect to see licence plate numbers.firmware: now this is the huge plus i have used other cheaper cams with a a lot of crazy issues setting up. the n1 pro is a breeze and has been stable all the time.just a couple of things to keep in mind the window mount for the camera uses a mini usb connector on the mount if you want to power it that way. the camera itself has a micro usb connector though. I would have preferred it was both micro usb or esb c would have been even better.summarizing  it is a great value and would recommend getting one if you are at the 50-60 price range
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The dashcam is mini so it doesn't distract the driver. The video and photo qualities are amazing for a compact dashcam.One thing I don't like is the user manual is not very clear it doesn't explain to you what each of the options does. The user manual give you the features and options you can choose but never explain what the features does.Also the "G-sensor" feature show different options then in the user manual. In the dashcam my options are 1-5 but in the user manual its show low medium and high. So I am confused on what to choose and what number associate with low etc...
5,Better than I expected. Super sharp high quality 1080P video. I plan to order another for the rear of my vehicle. All of the features work just as described. There is one discrepancy between the quick start manual and the full owners manual. The quick start says that the maximum SD card that can be used is 64GB but the full manual says that it is 256GB the full manual is correct with 256GB.  Also it says that a SanDisk SD card will not work but it does you just have to format it on your PC.One other note when I registered my camera a window came up that said if you clicked on it you would get a free GPS attachment for the camera. The link leads to a login to Facebook so those of us who do not want Facebook invading our privacy get nothing. I think that they should at least make the an alternate offer to non-facebookers by submitting their email address.
5,I bought this May of 2019 and until now (more than 1 year later) I am still using it. I love in Florida and almost whole year is summer it's super hot and I only park my car outside without the awning since I dont have garage. I hardwired the dashcam (you can buy their hardwire kit too through their amazon store: Vantrue) and also its better to buy their recomended sd card (samsung evo). the suction cup is strong too. Pictures and videos are clear as well as the night vision. My dash cam is still functioning well as of today and never had any issues at all.  Recomended this and will buy again.
4,It is just fine. Im excited to have it and hopefully never need it!
3,Waited a week so as to have actual results. Video is fine even at night. Main issues are with the manual. The online manual tried to correct some errors in the written provided manual but even the online manually contradicts itself (specifically but not limited to the red LED during charging). In addition the drop down menu for the G factor says choose 123 or4 yet both manuals sat low medium high or off. I still do not know which number refers to which G level. Windshield mounting and power cable run are both good.
4,Although it takes 24 hours to receive a response from this seller they will work to resolve the issue. My unit when the SD card was installed gave me an "error". Send several emails to Vantrue. All replys were confusing. Finally after the 6th email I received a phone call from Lily (California) who spent time on the phone to go through the necessary steps to resolve the "error reading card" issue. Seems that the card had to be formatted both in the unit (car) and home laptop. Lily explained that the instructions that had been sent via email reply did not apply to my situation.Unit is working fine now. Thank you Lily
5,I have been using dash cameras for a few years now and I went through several camera brands where there were problems from batteries to crashing etc.  I bought this camera based on the reviews on Amazon as well as other magazine etc. and it doe not disappoint.  I purchased the GPS unit as well.The camera is tiny...so tiny that it is next to impossible to see the screen settings without serious magnifying glasses but that's more my problem than the camera :-).  I put in a 64GB Sd card and it runs happily.  Picture quality is excellent night video is not hazy.  I put it in my truck in July and it has not fallen off yet (6 months).  I highly recommend.
5,Only one day of use so far but overall better than I expected for the price. Clear user manual quality parts and looks easy to setup and easy to get video to computer. The Quick Start Guide and User Manual are easy to follow with pictures and simple steps. Small/compact camera and mount fit perfectly on the windshield of my Acura Integra and do not block my vision at all. The only small thing I would have preferred is to have the long car charger cable end in USB and not a hard-wired lighter plug. This is because I have a lighter plug already for my phone with 2 USB ports. This is not a big deal since I ordered another cable for camera mount to USB for my lighter plug.
5,I purchased this camera to protect myself as a professional truck driver.The features are quite adequate. It has a bit of a "fish eye" type lens to get a nice wide view but not distorted. For my purposes I got a 256gb micro-sd in order to record in the highest definition - to easily read a license plate if needed - and that gives me 33 hours (about 4 work days) of recording time. It loops automatically so I don't work about running out of space. When an incident happens I take the card out and use my home desktop to upload and save the needed clip.I suggest the GPS enabled mount to add your vehicle speed to the recordings.
5,Great camera HD easy to set up and install and a good buy for the price...
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Updated: Manufacturer was awesome. Had a problem they honored the warranty and ultimately I received a replacement unit. Picture quality is still great. My recommendation still stands if not more so now. A good buy.This might not be the fanciest nor is it the cheapest; but it is an excellent middle ground between the two extremes.I wanted a dash camera that would provide excellent quality video without breaking the bank. I don't need many fancy options just enough to see what is going on out front. Acceptable night resolution great day resolution easy to setup and use easy to transfer files.I'm a stickler for quality and likewise for value; I read reviews on a few dozen dash cam systems. Here and on other sites. I settled on the Vantrue N1 based on reviews here. I have been quite pleasantly impressed and would recommend this to friends and family.
5,I’m not a person that just dives in and just buys the first one I see. I did a lot of research on this item before purchasing it by looking on U Tube and looking at reviews on the web all said it was a marvellous dash camera now that I have it I totally agree it is a marvellous product. It is very easy to set up and install the picture quality is great both during the day and especially at night a great 👍 little unit at a very reasonable price
5,May 2020 Update - The battery started die and device would lose the time resetting to 1/1/2018. Contacted VanTrue and they could not be more helpful and responsive! After evaluating a video I sent them showing the date problem they immediately offered a warranty replacement cross shipped while my unit is in transit back.5 star support from VanTrue!----My first camera but 2 days after delivery I now have 2 more on order for my other cars!Video & sound capture is very nice in .MOV format so no conversion needed to view on my computer.Couldn't be easier to use. Once the microsd card is formatted it just works without fuss. The suction cup mount is solid and well fabricated I have the camera tucked up behind the rear video mirror so it's barely visible.Mostly I have them for CYA in case of accidents but there are enough loose cannons driving on Long Island that I'll have plenty of fun posting to r/IdiotsInCars as well!
5,Highly recommend this product. It’s had very clear video and audio. It records in loop 24/7 and it has a long lasting memory before it records over the previous recordings. We live in a city where drivers don’t know how to drive and this has become very handy when we captured a hit and run. The only problem is that the screen is very small and when you try to watch a video it has to be connected or the SIM card needs to be extracted and inserted into the computer to fully see the video. Other than that great quality for the price.You also have to buy the memory card it comes separate.
3,The picture quality was pretty decent for this camera. But my biggest disappointment is there’s no WiFi or app that supports this camera which making playback a very difficult process. All the dashcam I previously purchased had apps that allow easy playback. And not able to do that with this camera is a big turn off. Imagine playing video on that tiny little screen is a hassle and adjusting the camera to the right position is also difficult without that feature. Another thing is that the mounting clip will not stay in place. Keeps on falling off after 3 days of attempts and I give up. Return this goes.
4,Great picture functionality and size. I had to dock a star for two reasons:1. The quick start guide incorrectly shows how to install the memory card. Almost snapped the card trying to get it to go in until I read the full manual and saw the correct depiction.2. This is minor but I purchased a cable that allows you to transfer images and videos from a memory card directly to my iPhone (in case I need to show an officer a larger video of an accident at the place where it happened). Unfortunately the way the camera saves the videos I am unable to transfer the videos as I was hoping to due to the file structure the camera saves the videos. Not a deal breaker just a bummer.
5,I've mulled around for which brand of camera to buy as my first one and I am not disappointed with trusting Vantrue.  The picture quality is amazing the microphone picks up sounds inside and outside well and I was able to tuck the cabling away without any issue.  The provide suction mount is terrible but I purchased the gps enabled hard mount as an upgrade.  The suction mount just cannot handle summer heat and it falls off easily.  I will say the camera has held up from falling perfectly.  I've used it for 6 months with no issues.
5,I love the feature that it deletes the old footage because that feature makes it so much more convenient for me to use. I have a 128GB Samsung Micro SD card and it works great and saves great. It also tolerates hot weather. I live in California and it can get up to about 110F inside the car but this dashcam gets hot AF but can handle it. Trust me buy this because this is worth your money. Spend more money on something and get the quality. Don't waste your money on cheap ones because they will break and not have the kind of necessary features you need.
5,This is a nifty little camera - and it is little but don't let that fool you. As with most small electronics there is a learning curve to operate the controls but this is much more intuitive and easier to program and use than other dash cams that I've tried. The picture quality is great and the "Parking" mode is a real bonus. When it detects motion outside of your windshield it turns on and takes a brief video. A nice security feature. The suction mount is very strong and it comes with a data cable so you don't have to remove the data card to transfer video to your computer. I like it a lot.
4,What I like is the 170 degree angle and the HD quality. I also like the size as it is so small.  It does have a quality feel to it which I have come to expect from Vantrue. The night vision is also pretty good. What is not easy to see (due to the very wide angle) is number plates unless stationary behind a vehicle. Oncoming vehicles and signage is difficult to read on a 24" computer monitor. The very small LCD screen is pretty much useless as it is so small unless you are a 25 year old with perfect vision. I'm not.
5,Before writing a review I wanted to wait and see if this cam could withstand the Arizona heat. As you can see from the date and temperature. 123F summer day and the dash cam is still working.Things to consider - play around with the "Parking Mode" and "G-Sensor". Those two settings will fill your memory quick with locked videos. Locked videos will not delete unless you physically delete them. Parking mode will start recording when it sense movement (All the time) and G-sensor will start recording when you open your door and shut your door.
5,Simple to use very useful easy to setup
2,Camera is pretty clear and easy to use and set up but one major issue I’m having with this camera is every time I remove the sd card to watch footage then go to put the sd card back in then I will go for a drive and the camera will record to about a min or so the camera will freeze and stop recoding and will stay doing this for a day or so I try to rest it nothing re format the card nothing it just a waitting game for it to work aging I sent it back and got another and same problem I’m having
4,Great product love it so far. The only real negative is that in the hot summer months it loses suction and hangs by it power chord. This only happens like once every couple of weeks when I get into my car and notice. But I live in texas and its often 110+ in my car when I get in.
5,I've had this for about a year. I actually got footage of someone getting hit by a car; at night in the snow. You can read the license plate of the offender.It's pretty easy to setup. It has stood up to the heat (colorado summers). My only complaint is that the suction is mediocre it fell off a few times and twisted the charging port wire. I just zip tied them together. Still for the price this thing is amazing.
2,Worked great for a few months. Fast forward a year and a few suction cup failures later and some guy rear ends me. So I go to my dash cam a few days later to pull the video and realize that this thing reset the date and has saved a sequence of videos from over a year ago and is now erasing all the most recent clips within 2 days of recording instead of the oldest clips. So my dash cam has an hour of footage from a trip I took over a year ago and then only my commute to work for the past two days conveniently missing the accident I was in. Thankfully rear end accidents are pretty cut and dry but the one time I could actually use this thing it fails me. Going to buy a different brand this week as I don’t want this to happen again.
5,This small discreet dash cam was exactly what I was looking for. It's easy to use and takes quality video like its more expensive competitors.  The optional GPS Mount is worth the extra cost and will complete the package nicely. I intend to purchase an extra car charger and windshield mount enabling me to easily switch the camera between two cars on occasion.HELPFUL TIPS1. The manual has very small print. I suggest that you go to their website at www.vantrue.net and download the User Manual.  You can also check for firmware updates.2. The camera is not recommended to be used in extreme temperatures. Living in northern Minnesota means that I will need to bring it inside at times.3. The pic of the orientation of the memory card in the Quick Start Guide is incorrect. It should look like the pic on the User Manual page 7.
5,Received very fast and packaging was so great I  this could be dropped off a building and I don't think it would be hurt. A+ Job on packaging. Directions were pretty straight forward on setup. I Charged the recommended 2 hours and installed. Assembly was very simple and the suction cup seems very strong. The Memory card is easily accessible while mounted on windshield. Unit started up when I started car and automatically started recording.  Quality of the video seems on par with 1080 which to me is more than enough for a dash cam. I will update with video clips and review of night vision after I drive in the dark. It isnt a $200-300 dashcam but for under $100 is excellent. There is not a rear facing in car cam.
4,Got this as it had a time lapse feature.  The time lapse mode prevents the regular recording.  Time lapse has three settings: 1 5 & 10. Setting 1 gives 0.5 hours per minute. Setting 5 is 2.7 hours per minute.  Setting 10 is 5.7. This is too fast for a car ok for property surveillance and such.Manuals contain errors.  For example the micro SD chip orientation is wrong in the quick start guide but Okay in the user’s manual. See imageThe power cable is a 12 V DC to 5 V DC converter. Also has a cool USB port if you rotate the cover.
5,After a lot of research I finally decided on the Vantrue N1 Pro Mini Dash Cam.  I and my three sons read lots of reviews and watched lots of videos on Youtube.  We decided on this camera because my husband drives into work in the early morning hours while it's still dark out.  The quality of the "night vision" is superior to most of those we look at including some that were twice as much money.  My husband likes it because it's a very discrete camera and it's easy to take down and put back up again. .. and he is impressed by the crispness of the picture.I can't speak for durability as he's only had it for three weeks but if it is as good as the rest we will be happy with it for a long time to come.
4,I would give 5 stars but the battery life is not great. Like any other dash cams you have to keep it plugged in to your cigarette lighter in your car or hardwire it to the battery. Let’s say the dash cam is fully charged and you the parking mode on it will probably only last for a couple hours at least. Other than that it’s a great dash cam and the manufacturer doesn’t recommend Sandisk micro SD.
4,This camera is amazing. The picture quality is fantastic. It's easy to use as well! I love having a dashcam in my car and this is almost the perfect device. I say almost because I do struggle with the suction cup. Sometimes it falls from my windshield after a couple seconds of putting it on. Sometimes it will last for months but then the suction fails and the camera falls off again. I don't know if I'm the one putting it on wrong or if it's because of the temperature change on my windshield from the weather. Anyway the camera itself is fantastic. The suction cup? Meh.
5,Just installed and took some video and pleased with what I see for daytime video. Imagine night is reliant more on the ambient light from lights or my own LED headlamps but will find out later.Install was not hard but a pain in the rear; not due to the camera or the GPS mount but due to GM. I detailed that in the wiring connector kit they sell and I purchased.Easy to pull the camera off and connect to the computer and download and even erase the videos is not needed and hopefully none will ever be needed but if so I'll have them.If things change I'll come back and repost and if needed drop the rating.
4,Does what you need it to do I wish it turned on a little faster but I understand the quality for the price overall I think everyone should have at least this in their car
5,Very good quality video and audio easy set up just don’t know what to do with the wire hanging down from the windshield
4,Received the camera quick and fast dash cam is pretty simple to set up and use. I would have rated it a 5 star rating but have problems with the suction mounting system. I was going to buy the GPS mounting system but resided not to because of the problems I've had  with the mount that came with it. As of now it has stayed put for a few days so I will see what happens.As I said I really like this dash cam. Great picture and is small and compact.
5,This dash cam is surprisingly compact. It's easy to use with only a few buttons. It comes with everything you need except a microSD card. Quality is very good you get a surprisingly wide angle with the fish eye lens. It starts and stops automatically when I turn on/off the vehicle. Installation was really simple. The suction mount feels very strong and the mount lets you tilt or swivel the camera easily while maintaining position. The cigarette lighter power adapter has a long cable so you can run it behind some panels out of the way. I would possibly like to hard wire it into my fuse box at some point to free up the cigarette lighter and give it a cleaner install.TIP: the power button also brings you to the settings menu. This felt a but unintuitive. The top button takes still photos and the OK button starts/stops video recording.
4,Set up was super easy! Menu is really funky might be due to the small screen. Hindsight i should have spent moreon one wiht more intuitive menu.  Great pciture for such a small device.  All in all a good purchase super  display when driving.
3,My camera keep resetting the date by itself.troubleshooting to bad battery.Now it keep resetting everytime I turn off my car it make it very much useless for below reasons(1) it mess up what to erase during looping recording(2) the recording time stamp is not accurate and not valid to provide anything during accident(3) it make hard to find any recording you wantThis is definitely product defect issue.Hope I can get a replacement
5,I got this unit to use at work. I drive 18 wheeler trucks locally and I am always having close encounters with distracted car drivers. They always try to blame the truck driver but no more. I will have video evidence and save my job. What I like best about the unit is how small it is and that I can just move it to my personal vehicle when I am on my way home. It has every important feature you would need for day to day use. It's very intuitive and easy to use and the video and picture quality is superb.
4,I’ve only had the dash cam for about a month now. Overall easy to set up and get going. However the manual is obviously translated from some other language and there are obvious grammatical errors. Also some of the instructions that are provided are grossly incorrect. It’s basically trial and error. The support Has been poor very delayed in the response and no phone number to call just email. For the price I’d recommend it but hopefully nothing goes wrong with it. The instrument will not delete any files I tell it to they continue to stay on the memory card and no the files are not protected!
5,Second one I have purchased for my other truck. Clarity is amazing  Hard wired is best although we took it with the rental car recently as it just use into the lighter for power . Frame by frame easy to use and setup is easy.CONS: Difficult to see as it is small to set up (although to be expected as it is a small cam with a HUGE picture that is amazing) !
4,I bought this on 27 August 2018 and used it for a while before writing this review.  I am very happy with this dash cam and use it every where I go.  The only thing  I don't like is that the internal battery will not hold a charge.  The videos are clear and easy to view.  The cam is small and doesn't interfere with my view.  I can pull the sd card and review the videos on my Chromebook.  I put in a 128 GB micro sdhc card hit format and had no problems with it whatsoever.  Would recommend this dash cam highly!
5,Amazing quality small and easy to install
5,I bought this camera for my dad as a present and he really likes it.  It's very small and almost not noticeable  when it's installed right by  the mirror.  It's hiding behind the mirror and doesn't distract you attention while you driving.  Recordings are very good and it has almost panoramic view in an HD  quality.  Pictures and recordings are very good quality in the day time and in night.  And  what is extremely important is once you install it you don't touch it  as it's turning on and off by itself when you turning on/off your car.  I think it's a great buy and my dad really likes it.  Just make sure don't forget to  buy a memory card as well.
5,This is my 3rd Vantrue  camera to go along with my cars and I couldn't be happier with this company. Their customer service is top notch and they stand by their product. I specifically like this camera because it gives you all the basic info you need at the bottom of the screen when playing back ie; date time mph latitude + longitude without buying anything extra peripheral. The bonus is that its so darn small and wont take up much real estate on the dash. Picture quality is awesome day or night. The only complaint is I wish it would've had  WiFi to make it easier to look over recorded events. But then again how many times do you do that anyway. Highly recommend if looking for something small and worthwhile.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This is my 2nd DashCam from VanTrue and as always I am impressed with the built and picture quality. Living in Arizona with high temperatures many have advised me to go for capacitor based DashCam but with my experience to my first Vantrue I decided to stick with this company as the other one has been gone through 2 summers and still going strong. With this one I also purchased the GPS mount and picture quality details and features are amazing. My only gripe is that Vantrue should consider including long USB Cable only with a detacheced charger so users can use their own car lighter chargers. This is a highly recommended camera from me now.
1,Not sure if I got a faulty one but I followed all the directions and the device keeps shutting off every time it instructs me to insert the SD card. And then it’ll say card error I’ve inserted correctly according to instructions each time I can get the thing to stay on. Not sure what else to do. Read all the instructions. Seems like it’s faulty.
2,Would not work with memory card I had so bought recommended one still no good. Returned.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The picture on this camera is incredibly clear. After installing the camera I took off on a trip out of state. I was so very glad to have this camera recording when somebody tried to run me off the road. It recorded the date and time of the event in case there was any question. The wide view was critical to seeing the full picture (no pun intended). They thought of everything by adding a USB port onto the charging adapter. This gives great piece of mind and I definitely recommend keeping it on because you never know when you might need it!
3,Really a great quality camera… if it would only stay on my windshield. It falls after a couple of hours. I’ve tried cleaning my windshield and the suction cup so many times but to no avail. It’s pretty much useless when it’s hanging mid-air while I’m driving!
4,It is very small smaller then I thought it would be but I like the fact that it’s small because if it was any bigger it could potentially be a destruction when you’re driving. I do like that it automatically Records over the oldest footage so you don’t have to replace the memory card.
1,Never could get this thing to work. I kept getting an error message on the screen then it would shut off. I read the manual. I went to the website. And I still could not get it "fixed". Tossed it and bought a different one. (No I did not contact customer support/helpdesk.)
5,I haven't had this for long but so far it's working great.  Daytime images are clear night time seem to be on par with the reviews I watched.  It sticks well to the windshield and the menu system is pretty straightforward.  Boots up fast when the car is started.  So far so good.  Glad to have the security of the cam given how some people drive.
5,The camera is very small and fits nicely behind the rear view mirror on the passenger side.  The video is wide angle providing very high quality and great coverage to both sides.  This little jewel will prove who is telling the truth if another vehicle fails to yield the right of way to you or if a reckless driver cuts right in front of you.  You would be charged with causing the rear end collision but the video will show who is really at fault.  Smile reckless drivers "you're on camera!"  I like the peace of mind it provides and I also really appreciated the quick response to my support request on Vantrue.com.  I highly recommend the Vantrue N1 Pro dash cam.
4,Does a real good job. I was impressed with both the day and night pictures which is why I bought it. Good job there. 2 complaints. I have to reset the date every other day or so (loss of battery backup?) as it goes back to 2018.01.01. Real irritating. Even hooked the camera up to a charger overnight. Also the button for taking a "picture" is also the protect video button. Really???
5,This is a great little dash cam.  After using it today I wonder why I kept looking at more expensive units.  The video is clear even in overcast conditions.  Stopping the video on the computer reveals nice detail of license plate numbers.  I did heed the manufacture's suggestion on which brand and quality for the SD card. I chose the Samsung PRO Endurance 64GB Micro SDXC Card.  Following the instructions took a little time for me to realize that hitting the power button quickly will get the camera into the settings mode.  Before use I did update the firmware.  They offer good instructions on that.  Not sure how they can sell such a good camera at such a low price.
5,Love this dash cam. Purchased 8 of them for my team of field travelers driving company vehicles. Good size great picture and solid recording features. Works very well with optional GPS-enabled mount.Also have to comment on their customer service. My particular unit started experiencing a battery issue after a while. Emailed customer support and requested a warranty exchange. True to their word they promptly replaced my unit with a new one while I sent back original. Replacement arrived in three days. Very satisfied!
5,This dash cam is an outstanding value. We have had many dash cams and none with the picture quality that this delivers especially the night vision. We have purchased four and are very glad we did. Recently we had an encounter with a rock falling off of an oncoming truck breaking our windshield and it came in handy being able to send a video to send authorities.
4,The captured videos are amazingly crystal clear. The viewing angle of the camera is very sufficient. The only thing i wish it had was bluetooth or wifi so I dont have to unmount the camera or SD card in order to see the videos on a larger screen. Other that that everything else is on par. You will not regret buying this dashcam.
5,Great product! After using it for almost 3 years in Florida sun the suction cup finally gave up. Won’t stuck to the windshield anymore i contacted customer care and they shipped me a suction cupWithout any charge even the product was out of warranty. Overall great product with excellent service.
5,Unit arrived and installed ok seemed to work as well as I understood it over time I learned what it was supposed to do and well beyond the Amazon return window I realized it wasn't working as it should. Via multiple online chat sessions we determined it was not working but within the warranty period. As soon as I shipped the defective unit back (apparently internal rechargeable battery had  failed) they cross shipped a replacement. No Fuss No muss!
4,I really liked the picture quality. But for some reason I didn't get it set to record automatically. I'm still testing it to make sure all works properly. Had to upgrade the firmware Suction cup works well but for some reason with a rental car going over bumps would knock it off the windshield. I tried moving it around on the windshield and it seemed to stick better.
5,Bought 2 of the N1 Pro dash cams after a family member recommended them. The video quality is very good and do like the wide angle lens. Was able to get 2 of these for the price of most other dash cams on the market. They do offer an extended warranty for free when you register them. The size of this camera is nice and small and hides well behind my rear-view mirror.
4,I don't understand with the great features this camera has.Why can't you turn it on and off with a switch?Or am I still missing something?
5,I’ve had their previous generation N1. Worked great for 3 years so far. Decided to give away to my girlfriend as a gift and bought myself a brand new one.What I love:- easy to use- great video quality- no gimmicky features- they seemed to have upgraded the suction cup mount!What could be improved:- not really much to be said here as I’m not a nit-picking person
5,I bought this a few months ago and it gives you a sense of control if your in an accident and show what happened. It’s easy to use no problem formatting the sad card. The suction is amazing considering the camera sits in the hot Florida sun.Got my first sorta video the other. It was of a police officer running a red light...yellow to red...illegal.
1,Every week or so we always get a card error message on the dash cam. Now it is entirely broken. I do not know why..... I paid so much for this dash cam. I'm lowkey happy that it broke because I do not want to deal with the stress of that "card error" message every week.
1,Well I purchased this for my wife and she purchased 1 for me also as a gift (really we didn't know) when we went to register you had to create an account and had to accept a newsletter or it would not proceed.  Ok so not happy but did it. Next I went to add the item for warranty. It wanted order numbers. Well it's a gift I have no order number. I asked my wife if she registered Her's apparently she backed out after encountering the same issues. If I knew it had no warranty I would never have purchased and will never purchase from this company again.  The warranty IS part of what you are buying as it represents the quality just as customer service does. A receipt and serial number is all you should need for your warranty not to be required to open an account accept unsolicited junk mail and supply some type of order number ect. Goodbye Vantrue
2,I'm worried that should I take the memory card out again I may never get it back in. For the longest time it just wouldn't catch when trying to put it in. I am also forever re-attaching it to the windshield as it loses suction after awhile.
5,I judge electronics on their simplicity and ease of use. Even though this camera has some pretty slick features like a parking mode or looping video that means you don't have to buy a huge micro SD card it manages to keep things simple and easy to use. I literally just hooked it up and then turned it on and it started recording. I used an 8 gig card and it filled up in around 9-10 hours (on highest quality settings). Another nice surprise is how small it is. Stack a couple quarters on top of each other and it's not much taller. I'm really happy with this camera.
4,I just recently realized I needed to format the memory card. Don't return your memory card.
2,The small form factor of this cam is great and does not disrupt any vision.The picture/video quality seems to be pretty decent and this will pick up any motion and record it almost right away.The night vision quality works quite well too.Now for some of the bad features that kind of makes me want to return the product:The battery life on this cam when its not constantly charging if pretty low. Because it can detect even slight movements and cause it to turn on it drains battery quite fast. I leave this in the car and if I don't drive the car during the weekend at all the battery completely drains to zero.Now that isn't so bad but what makes this really bad is that when my cam drains to zero it resets its settings for the date and time. So then I have to manually set that up all over again and that can be a pain if I have to do that every single weekend if I do not drive or at least turn on the car.
5,This little camera is perfect for any vehicle.  I found myself leaving it in the car and forgetting it was even there over time.  Thankfully i haven't had to retrieve data off it yet!  I did bring it with on a few road trips and left it in the back window to record anything random - but mostly get the scenery.  It's small enough too where i left it attached to a battery pack in my apartment when my landlord came over to inspect water damage.  You get audio with it too so it works perfectly as a small security camera.
5,Bought this dashcam a few days ago and absolutely loved it. The camera itself is a package! Feels premium and video and sound quality is great! It has some advanced features like night vision and motion sensor which I found very helpful. Very easy to install with simple instructions. The manual made it clear how to operate it great video quality the camera turns automatically when the car starts the screen is clear so I can see the number plate and people's face. These are very helpful for many situations. Highly recommended!
5,I had an exceptionally great experience with the warranty process.  After using the dashcam for nearly one year I noticed the battery was not holding a charge.Warranty contact named Echo at WXDT Richardson TX.  Echo responded quickly to all email communications (even on weekends) and walked me through a simple process.The result was me returning the original item and quickly receiving a new item.  I will not hesitate to purchase another Vantrue item.
5,This little camera takes nice clear video.  The small size does not block any view through the windshield and isn't that visible from the outside.  It stays put on the windshield.  I ordered a second one for my husband's car.
5,I bought this as a secondary front cam for my car and wanted one with a suction cup so I can use it on other vehicles (rental car/work truck/etc).  I also use it as a parking cam since I have it plugged into the 12V USB port and also use a battery pack when the car is turned off.  Daytime video is good and nighttime is about average but still decent.  The suction mount is still holding strong after about 2 months.  I've been using dashcams for about 6 years now and have gone through quite a few of them and this one so far has been working great.
5,I purchased the Vantrue N1 Pro Dash Cam based upon two major reasons:1.  I'm not a very technical person so I need access to a reliable support staff and Vantrue fit that.2. I wanted something that would work "out of the box" without a complicated set up process.  And my N1 Pro fit that very well too.Additionally I have viewed some to the captured video and they live up to my expectation.I would recommend it to my friends based upon their specific needs.
5,This is my third dash cam purchased for my company car.  It is awesome.  I definitely recommend getting the GPS base mount.  It is such an improvement over other cams that have a separate GPS unit as it all plugs in together as part of the mount.  And the suction cup mount is flawless and lets you easily move the camera should you want to.  This is a great value.  I recommend!
3,Well packaged and came with good instructions. Only thing was I've tried 2 different SD cards (newly bought) and every single time it reads "card error." According to the instructions/manual the SD card I purchased should of worked but unfortunately it did not. I'll give it a 3 star for now and will come back to deduct or add stars when I go out and buy another SD card for it. Let's hope it works.Update 4/6/2020 - Not working for me. I purchased a new SD card and this brand I bought works with it... but for some reason it will pop up "error." I'm sure something is wrong with the camera.
3,Pulling my hair out. My N2Pro died and I cant find anyone to replace battery!! I bought an N1Pro and the software has many issues. Downloaded update and still have issues.I'm about ready to find another brand. I just submitted a support email. We will see if they care. They wouldn't replace my battery on N2Pro but they offered a video to follow!! Screw that!
5,Easy to set up. The video is very clear in both night and day. My car has Lane Keep Assist (LKA)  and I installed it to close to the LKA sensors on the windshield and the camera interfered with LKA. Moving the camera about 3" from the sensor solved the problem.  I live in Arizona and my previous camera died because of heat. Heat is not an issue  with this camera. One of best thing is the Product Support with camera. I had some questions and their Product Support  responded within a day with the answers. Very happy with with camera!!
5,Been using the dash cam now for about 3 months and very happy with the ease of use and the clarity of the video day or night . When purchasing item make sure to also buy wiring that I used on all 3 of my vehicles ANTRUEVantrue N2 Pro N2 T2 N1 Pro X4 X3 Dash Cam 10ft Mini USB 12V 24V to 5V Dash Cam Hardwire Kit with Mini ACS ATO Micro2 Add a Circuit Fuse Holders Low Voltage Protection for Mini USB Dash Cams
5,I've been using the N1 Pro for about a week and have been impressed. Its small size makes it fit well on the windshield without obstructing your view. The video quality is good as you can see from the screenshot.  The only issue I could see is  the screen size but that's just due to the overall compact size. Its not a problem since anytime I'm looking a video I put the SD card in my computer anyway. I would recommend getting a GPS mount for the added speed and GPS coordinates as well. Overall I think it is a great value for the money and a good quality dash cam.
4,Bought this for my girlfriend due to her long commute to work. I'm quite impressed with the compact size of the dash cam and the minimalistic controls and buttons. The internal battery is pretty good as the camera continues to record for a period of time when the car is off. Video resolution is not 4k but it does the job and you can see the license plate of the car in front. Overall definitely worth the price!
5,Great inexpensive dash cam for starters. I use it as an insurance precaution. I live in NY and you never know what will happen. It’s very easy to use and set up. A great thing with this dash cam is the ability to use a big micro SD card. I wished there was an app so I can view my videos easier. It does the job. The dash cam is pretty small. I hardwired it to my car so it turns on/off when my car is on/off. After a few mins the screen will turn off so it won’t bother you while driving but it is still recording. Great product.
4,So far so good. I park my car in really humid weather next to the beach for work every day. In the photo attached here I park in Waikiki (overlooking Diamond Head) and once in a while the camera falls down probably because of the humidity.  The cord gets in the way but not a big deal.
5,my cable was broken after 2 years using the cam so i contacted the customer service and they helped me a lot. sent me another one for free. Would buy again anonther products !  THANK YOU !
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I trevel a lot during weekends.  having this camera in my vehicle has given me a new sense of security. installation and set up of this this dashcam was very simple this camera doesn’t come with an sd card so I have to buy a new one. the video quality of the camera is extremely good way better than expected.  this is an amazing digital camera and I highly recommended  this to anyone who do a lot of commuting or traveling.
5,I ordered the VanTrue N1 Pro for myself as an early Christmas present a few weeks ago and it's exactly what I was hoping it would be. It's quite small but the wide viewing angle covers everything I see through my Jeep's windshield. No problems at all with the suction cup so far seems very strong. I don't mind the cord hanging down from my rearview mirror...yet. Since my Jeep is only a couple years old I may get the hardwire connector setup so the wire is hidden and my 12V outlet is freed up. All in all a great value in the few weeks I've had it so far.
5,I purchased a Vantrue N2 Duo Uber in August and have nothing but great things to say about it. I decided to buy the N1 Pro for my girlfriends new Nissan Rogue. I received the unit it took me all of 5 minutes to complete the set up another 5 minutes to mount the camera and off we went. As expected the camera worked flawlessly not one glitch for the 3 hours we were running it off and on today. I am so impressed with the quality durability and operation of both cameras I will recommend Vantrue to friends and family they have a customer for life !
2,Camera itself is pretty good but the suction  cup will start to fail after 6 months and the company is unresponsive. Better to purchase another camera that can be attached using a universal mount kit or one that doesn't use a suction cup.
4,I use it in the company's vehicles it gives me an excellent record in the day and at night  I lost a bit of clarity it seems that it also records the speed but it is a function I can not activate it.
3,Having owned it for roughly two years it worked like a charm in the beginning. It still does in regards to video quality. However the first thing to go was the internal battery. It lasted about 9 months if that. Other features were nice but alas the longevity of this product's battery is questionable having sat in a car through sweltering summers and frosty winters.
5,It works! I bought one since I work for a tow company and wanted to protect myself from other drivers. Suction cup is convenient since I’m always hopping in and out different trucks picture quality is better than I expected and definitely records at night just fine. One issue I did find is the charger that It comes with crapped out on me a little after a month I ended up getting a new one at Best Buy but other than that I’m happy with my dash cam.
4,Great mini size camera! Excellent picture quality and ease of use. Had trouble with suction but customer support sent a replacement that so far is working well. I am very impressed with the care of the customer service department. They respond quickly and always try to take care of the issues with the product.
5,Bought this after my wheelwitness camera mount broke the third time I used it.  So I've paid extra attention to the mount on the Vantrue N1 and I'm impressed.  The unit is easy to operate the instructions make sense the video quality is sharp easy to read license plates etc.  I always consider the cost of a product when I rate a product and for me buying this on a lightning deal made this 5 stars.  I changed my recording file to 5 minutes each and I'm using a 32gig mini SD I had laying around and it is working great.
4,I am using it for the past 5 months...good product. If your automobile is a sedan don't buy it because it is little large and blocks view in the windshield...good for SUVs...i.e good for vehicles that has straight windshields / large windshields.Good video good storage video loop is great easy setup.Update After 3 Years:It is dead after 3 years
5,I looove the features and quality of this dash cam! I rarely write a review but this one is worth writing about and so I could let u know that you won’t be disappointed plus for the price? Cannot beat it!
5,I would like to say that this is a fantastic product. The packaging for starters is TOP Notch. The camera itself is very good quality and overall the cam is very user friendly. You simply put your memory card in and format it. Now anytime you turn on your car it does its things and records. I am very impressed with the video quality and all the features that come with it. It really is a very affordable camera with a ton of amenities. I have done a review of the camera on my Youtube Channel BLP3 Motors. I will buy Vantrue Products from now on.
5,I've had this camera for about a year now. The image quality is quite good even in low-light conditions. The interface is easy to use and set up. It has fallen off my windshield a handful of times but it's not much of a hassle to remount it. This camera really came in handy last week when some idiot crashed into me and tried to tell the cops I was at fault. As soon as everyone saw the footage from this camera he shut up real quick.
5,I tend to be skeptical about offbrand products but all my concerns were put to rest once this product arrived. First off the product arrived same day (thanks Amazon Prime) and upon opening the package everything was neatly laid out and relatively easy to install. Placed it into my car connected the power supply started the car up and boom we were secure on the road. Video quality is solid for such an affordable dashcam and there's still plenty of options I have yet to explore. Overall extremely pleased! Thanks Vantrue!
5,Summary: This is an excellent dashcam for the price. It's solidly built compact in size and has excellent video quality. Easily a "set it and forget it" product that's absolutely reliable.What I liked:- Product is small which makes it very easy to keep hidden and out of sight in your car.- GREAT video quality. Pretty much the most important feature of a device like this.- Excellent mount. Mount is solid and is where the charging cable connects.What could be improved:- Charger could be a bit smaller or at least include a second USB charging port.
5,Good camera but the date seems to keep resetting on the camera. This causes the newest footage to be written over when the camera is full. Serious flaw that could cause accident footage to be written over. It also seems to apply the "protected" label to a lot of footage that I never hit the button to apply that label. I will edit review when Vantrue contacts me for a solution.**Edit: Manufacture is sending me a new one
5,I have used many dash cams before including ones in my former career as a police officer that costs thousands of dollars. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem. It’s built with quality materials sturdy great day/night picture quality and easy to set up and use. So far I have no issues with the N1 Pro and from the time I’ve spent with it and my experience with others  I don’t foresee any issues. I would put this dashcam at the top of my list you can’t get any better especially for the price.
4,It's a small camera with good picture quality. Instructions are made clear and easy to use. The only problem is that the internal battery doesn't hold a long charge. I charged it for two hours before first use. I kept it plugged into the car lighter charger but it didn't power on while the car was on.
5,Fantastic dash cam with a solid image quality. Camera is easy to setup easy to use and offers solid features for the asking price. I highly recommend this camera especially for a first time dash cam owners. I feel like these days these things are absolutely necessary with all the dangerous texting and driving and the insurance scammers out there.ProsEasy to useEasy to setupEasy to remove plug in play to retrieve filesConsnone that I can find.
5,Easy to set up in my Ford Edge.Vacuum cup snap system holds it secure to the windshield.I have only replayed the SD card on my home PC once just to check quality.Really good.Battery in camera ran down once when motion setting was on.I have it setup where the power to cam only comes on when power is to the cigarette lighter.So if it comes on with motion detected the power comes from the camera battery only.I recommend this product to anyone that drives in high traffic areas.
2,Well this is the FOURTH dashcam I have tried and the 4th to be returned.  DOESN'T ANYBODY AT THE CAMERA PLACE KNOW WHAT A DASHCAM IS SUPPOSED TO DO?First one captured 15sec segments with 4 seconds betweenSecond one wouldn't charge off the carThird one had 1000 options NONE of which were useful for dashcam operationsTHIS one seems to work except..........it charges and connects to the computer via USB  but REQUIRES A PROPRIETARY CABLE TO CHARGE IN THE CAR --- IN THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER !!!!My cigarette lighter is in the center console 4 FEET AWAY passing FOUR USB outlets on its way making its PROPRIETARY cable 2 feet short.AND there does not seem to be ANY battery life.  It may be all capacitor which if constantly powered by the car would not be a bad thing.  (See PROPRIETARY CABLE)
5,This camera does exactly what we needed it to and more.We tested it out in the car and it works fantastic.What I really love though is how low key it is in my car. We have a ‘15 VW Golf and it sits right behind the mirror hardly noticeable from the outside and completely hidden form site on the inside. I was concerned that I’d be able to see it and that it would essentially be an “eye sore” however it’s a lot better than what I was expecting.
4,Have two n1 pro cameras running. Good small camera to have. Hard wired both . Screen is alittle small but easy to get footage to computer. Havnt have any issues in 1 year since using.
2,I purchased two of these. Both units have had battery failures. One right after the return period from Amazon ended and the other I just discovered after a long road trip with a great drive back with lost foortage due to files being repeatedly overwritten due to the battery failure causing the date and time not being correctly saved.On the first unit that failed I contacted Vantrue a number of times and was told to update the software. When that failed I contacted them again to no avail. I contacted them again to no avail.After the failure of the second unit I have given up on Vantrue.
5,I'm so pleased to have finally found a great dash cam for a good price. If what you are looking for is a great camera that has amazing video and picture quality that is TRUE full HD 1080p with phenomenal night vision for under $100 look no further. It even comes with parking mode.The mount that comes with this camera is very high quality well designed. Charges your camera through the mount as you drive.Great simple small camera with high tech  packed into it. You won't be disappointed.
5,Easy to install. The long instructions sent to you and on the web are not well-written but this camera was simple enough to install. Just stick the mount to the windshield plug in 12V power add memory card (not included) and turn on. Picture quality seems good for the price. You can see license plate numbers and street signs during daytime -- I haven't tried my camera at night yet. My wife likes having the peace of mind of a digital camera when she drives and this camera is an economical solution.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have the Vantrue N2 pro for my front dash and I bought this for the rear. The picture quality is good and it's small/compact size is great for mounting it on the rear window of the car. I park the car on the street so this helps a lot to record everything. I hard wired it to my fuse box and it works great. It also supports up to 256gb SD card which is perfect for 24/7 recording.
5,The camera is small and looks well made. It’s easy to set up and use the camera and installation was also easy. The camera has many useful features and picture quality is clear as well. Overall it is a great quality product for the price. I do not see any issue so far and hopefully it would work as intended for a long-term.
5,Perfect replacement for my other vantrue dash cameras....I'm using same suction connector from last camera even though it was repaired by me from sun and heat damage this is my third vantrue the first two cameras lasted over a year.....but yes the sun and heat can shorten the lifespan.
5,Bought one of these for both me and my wife and have them running at all times. It's very easy to setup and the picture quality is very good. The audio/video/capture settings are easy to navigate and change while it is still mounted. The support was incredibly helpful when I had questions or concerns about the product. I highly recommend it!
3,This dashcam has been in my car for only a year.  I have not used parking mode and it's always plugged in turning on only when the car is on.  Despite this the time/date keeps resetting to 1/1/2018 every day.
5,As the First.. it hard to get it work after  talk assistant about issued thing and did not work it out and i figure it out for two days and i got it work  it work great and got format it..  when u get this  slot the SD in and hold power more than 10 to 20 sec and let it go and u will see orange background screen setting  my 256gb sd have a amazing graphic video record..  i would buy second for next big one
3,Not as hassle free as I’d hoped. When I t’s hard-wired to the battery. There doesn’t seem to be a sleep/wake mode for the camera itself. Therefore you have to manually turn it on an off every time. Otherwise it keeps recording and can get a bit hot in the sun.If you have it only wired through the ignition I imagine it would be a better experience. Furthermore if this had WiFi or Bluetooth it would be a lot more convenient. I didn’t dock it a star because I was aware of its absence prior to purchase.Picture quality is good. Suction mount is secure. Added GPS attachment seems to work.
4,My first dashcam. Having a great time with it.
5,I've had two of these for a month now and they are working fine.  I am happy with the video produced.  Can't really say how it compares to others but I am happy.  I added on the GPS module which is an easy upgrade and also works perfectly.  Suction is excellent.  Neither has fallen off even once.  Love the small size too.
4,the videos in low lights show with little spots and very bright not sure if it's my settings or just the camera. I will say this daytime video and low light are not that bad. I can't complain only paid $55 when it was on sale so for the price 5 stars but lower rating because they brag a 100% perfect video.
5,I've been running this dashcam in my truck for about 4 or 5 months now. No problems. I've pulled the chip out and checked the footage a few times. No problems. This makes me feel more at ease. I may get a second one to be facing the rear.
5,This dash cam has nice picture quality and is easy to mount and use. The car charging cord is generously long. The quick start and user guides are both easy to follow and use. So far happy with this purchase!
5,This replaced one I had. And it blew it away! Great picture quality so far hasn’t fell off either. Easy operation too. Plus it’s smaller than one I had. Would buy again!
3,This is the same camera as the Cobra. It only lasted for about 8 months. Couldn't do instant recall. Not really a good camera for a semi truck that notices more bumps in the roads than cars.The reason you can't do instant recall is because it will never clear the SD card. Even when you reformat. I've brought it home cleared it on the computer and came back and it had the same images reloaded on that card so it never recorded anything new.
3,Not able to use this without it being plugged in and ugly wires hanging from the windshield. The camera shuts off after 10 minutes if it’s not plugged in. Really disappointed.
5,Some downsides I prefer an adhesive for a mount this only has the option for a suction cup mount. So if your cars windshield fritt has texture to it then it won't provide proper suction if you like to place the mount higher. Its design isn't as inconspicuous as my other dash cam (Aukey). Other than that it is Great. The setup and interface is way better than the Aukeys. There isnt a noise when the cam turns on which i appreciate. I would recommend this camera.
3,Seller should do a better job making it known that the camera comes with NO memory.  I opened the box hoping to try the product out only to read that I have to go buy a memory card.  I went back and looked and yes it is buried in the fine print but this should be in the item description.  No wonder it was inexpensive.  I can't totally bash the product it may work great but I put it back in the box and I am contemplating returning it as I feel like this was not properly described.
1,Pros:It is tiny and can be hidden well.It looks solid and the finish is nice.The video quality is very good under day light.Cons:It does not Do what it suppose to do.1. The tiny screen is very hard to see. You need a magnifying glass for that.2. The parking mode requires hard wired to the cars battery. The camera stop working after 24 hours after hard wired and the screen said it need to rest. That totally defeat the purpose of hard wiring. It is useless as a parking monitor unless you want to reset the camera every day.3. The G sensor is not working right it randomly put video files inside the lock folder even without any incident. If a real accident happened it will be difficult to look through tons of files inside the “Lock” folder to find the one you need. Even with the G sensor set at low sensitivity it still does the same thing.4. The super night vision is nothing super at all. You get dark screen even you can see very well at night. The footage it captured are mostly black in a well lit parking lot at night.The bottom line is that if you hard wired it it wont work continuously without hard wire the parking mode does not work. So the parking mode is useless.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Small form factor high heat resistant parking mode G-sensor nice night and day video picture. Supports up to 256GB SD card. I am pretty happy with this product.
5,I chose this product over the Garmin because of the price point and the warranty. Price point is a good $50 less than the Garmin 44. Warranty is 18 months instead of Garmin's 30 day warranty. I'll let you know if things change but so far so good.
4,Very easy to install.
5,It has been working very well. The only issue is that the wire cover has detached from the piece that goes into the cigarette lighter port. I didn't take off any stars for this since it might be because it's carried around in a backpack. Happy with purchase overall. I recommend.
5,I was impressed with the high quality packaging and the well-made feel of the camera. This is our first dashcam and it was easy to install and get operational.
5,Just got the N1 Pro today and set it up.  I really like the mount and the settings seem intuitive.  I like the parking feature.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet but am looking forward to seeing it in action.
4,Great little dashcam does everything you need it to do in a small size. It was very easy to setup and understand the directions. I like the discreet size being able to fit behind the rear view mirror... doesn't affect your vision. Has the option to be powered through connection to the suction cup or the camera itself.
5,I am not tech savvy at all. This camera comes with easy easy instructions on how to set up. It records well and my favorite part is that the camera comes unclipped so you can store it in your center divider and leave the stand on your window. Perfect for the price.
5,Have you ever wanted to replay something that happened while driving but weren't taking a video at the time? Well now you can. This camera has decent range and picture quality so that you can watch every mistake that other stupid drivers make.
2,I bought this back in 2019 and loved it I had no complaints. A year into owning it it didn't want to stay up I had to fight with it everyday to keep it up. Also the it won't record after being plugged in after a day you have to clear the message so it could start recording again so annoying and easy to forget. Now today I needed to get footage off of it apparently it hasn't recorded in over a YEAR even though on the unit it says it recording!! This is totally not okay and defeats the whole purpose of having it!
5,This little camera is amazing. Video quality and sound are amazing. It takes pretty good videos at night as well. It was easy to set up and easy to format the memory card. I bought a Samsung brand as recommended by the seller.Haven’t had any issues so far besides trying to figure out how to hide the power cable.
2,I tried everything to get the suction cup to work but it doesn't! I gave up and returned it.  The picture quality was good and it wasn't too difficult to figure out how to use. It’s ridiculous that I had to return it because of the suction cup but I was getting really stressed out and distracted with the camera falling down every few minutes. One time a truck pulled out in front of me and almost hit me and the camera fell at that moment! That’s when I decided to return it.
3,Picture quality isn't as clear as advertised. Nighttime glare clearly obstructs ability to see license plates
5,Not as big as I thought but still it was a great cam. Picture is clear and crisp. The motion detection works but it can get a little annoying it turning on everytime time there is the slightest movement in front of the cam. Other than that it does everything its suppose to. Lastly wish the insructions were a little more helpful or a detailed video of the how to work the features but not hard to learn.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Video quality is pretty smooth. No frame drop or anything. Covers the full front view of the drive. The parking mode is on point and it’s sensitive enough to record anything that comes in its field of view. Camera is small enough that it doesn’t block the view while driving. Overall pretty good product for a pretty good price
3,I like the quality of the camera itself and the image quality It's my second Vantrue camera and I like them but I keep having issues with it telling me I've been driving for more than 24 hours and I should have a break. I have not been It's just on all the time from being hard wired. The issue I find with that is that the camera locks up and you have to manually reboot it so that it will continue recording. I literally have to turn it off daily. Really annoying. Just remove the stupid warning about driving 24/7 and it should be perfect.
5,The little dash cam that could. Great video quality - not something immediately expected of such a small dash cam.Easy installation and setup.Definitely had my doubts initially because of but decided to give it a chance. Been using it for about a week now and have absolutely no complaints.The parking mode feature is pretty cool since it automatically turns back on after it detects a crash (when it moves).
1,My husband got the same model and his has now completely ruined two memory cards - they are now unusable. I almost was in a terrible accident and when I went to pull up the footage I discovered that mine too now has a "card error". We have even contacted the company on their website - several months ago - and they never got back to us.
5,It took two prior dashcam purchases before I was satisfied with this one.  Truly a 1080p Plus dashcam.  The easiest way to connect to the suction attachment yet.  I've not used the night vision.  I do most of my driving during day time.  I would have to recommend this dashcam to anyone asking.
2,used so cannot return but definitely not the quality they advertise.
5,This is my 2nd Vantrue dash cam and this one is just as easy to use as the first one. I needed parking monitor for all my cars and that is why I chose Vantrue their parking monitor is one of the best. Night vision is nice and clear and you can still read license plate numbers at night. User interface is simple and easy to use and setup. All in all another great dash cam.
4,Works well.  I was able to tuck the wire around the windshield but still have an issue with the wire running under the glove box. 😡
3,Battery would run out after about 30 minutes.  Video only showed in fast forward mode on computer.  Returned!!
5,I had a cord that got broke because my son kicked it and they offered to send me another one for free!!!
5,I have wanted to try a dash cam for a long time. I just did not want to pay a lot of money for it. This was recommended by a technology information source so I thought I would try it. The picture quality has been surprisingly good. I have been very happy so far and have had a lot of fun showing some of the footage to some of my friends.
3,Purchased in February and it stopped working today. I got less than 10 months out of it.Edit*Vantrue has contacted me asking me to do some testing of the camera and say if it still won’t work they will send a replacement. I have not found time to test yet but will. I am changing my review from 1 to 3 stars in the meantime.
5,This camera came very well packaged with detailed instructions and information. I also purchased the hardwire kit. The video quality is as advertised and the ability to adjust exposure is a plus. I use this in my everyday vehicle. My favourite feature is parking monitor which provides the added safety of capturing an incident even if your vehicle is off and parked. Great product for its price range.
3,first cam for car now i know that the one thing that is needed is to connect to phone by WiFi for easy use this does not have it.
4,I was initially confused which one to choose from as there are so many options out there.Here are my experiences1) Picture quality is better than what I expected during day.2) Needs improvement for night driving as its hard to see the number plate of car just infront.
5,If you want a reasonably priced dash cam that takes quality recordings day or night this is the one for you.  Small size to restrict obstruction of your windshield.  Automatically turns on and off with the operation of your vehicle.  Has extras installed on the camera that most people will want.  It's a set and forget camera that operates in the background until you need that "special  video".
4,Had a stressful time getting it all set up to use. Had to watch many how to videos.  Once set up it works as expected.
1,The picture quality and recording is decent but the battery died so it does not work when the car is turned off and all settings get reset every time the car turns off. There are videos that do not get saved. I was involved in a car accident and that video did not get saved. The video 10 mins before the accident was saved but when it came down to when I needed it did not help me out. It seems the cameras decide at random which videos to save. (I had my video save in 5 min loop)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Purchased three (3) units one for each car.Nice product. Impressive box - makes for a great gift. Small foot print. Easy to install.Works great. Just what we needed. See video with actual day and night time video. Down sampled for upload. Original video quality is great!Thanks VANTRUE
3,Well the camera is not bad but the idiotic way they set up the power cord to go through the suction cup mount is completely stupid. What happens when the cup breaks apart due to heat and cracking? Why not have the power go into the camera itself like most others. I bought a mirror mount for the camera since I did not see that it has the power like this and I cannot use  the good mount that I bought for it. STUPID Idea to do the power this way!!!
4,This dash cam has a better pic quality than the last I had. But the screen is a bit too small.
3,The picture quality is not the best. It gets poorer the faster you drive. License plates are barely readable when you're close enough to someone on the intersection waiting for green and is never readable when driving. The file size is way too large for the quality approx 500mB per 5 minutes.For this price it is decent i suppose. It will still show the general picture of the incident though.
4,Great Video Resolution Make sure your windshield is clean before using the suction mount It will fall off at the slightest bump in the road.Awesome Customer Service!
5,I had a bit of trouble getting my SD card to format but once I worked through that it was smooth sailingThis camera resides in my SLK I love to have a camera in all my cars this one works great thanks for a great camera.
4,My only complaint is that I can't easily turn it off when geoshock and motion detetection modes are on so it drains the xar or camera battery.Other wise it works great excellent clarity suction storage cord length and features.
4,I gave this to my husband and he does road work.  He found it very useful on the job.
3,Overall the camera works as advertised.  But be aware that the internal battery will only hold a charge for a period of time if left unplugged.  When the battery dies you have to plug it back in again and reset the date and time.  No mention of that in the product description.
5,It is compact on the windshield and "hides" behind the rear view mirror so it doesn't disturb my vision.  I used it on a 10000 mile 3 month RV trip to the Canadian Rockies and western US.  Worked perfectly.
1,I've had this camera in my car a couple of years just in case I was in an accident. As far as I could tell it was working nicely that is until I was involved in a hit and run on the freeway.  I thought I was protected because I had it connected. I purchased a 256GB card and cleared it all the time to keep it clear just in case something happened and I needed footage for proof.  I'm glad I had a passenger and they were able to record the vehicle license plate while they were trying to get away.  I thought it was recording because it always powers on when I turn on my car.  Upon checking the footage I noticed that it recorded when it wanted to. Random recordings here and there the last recording was of me calling the cops and going out of the freeway and before that it was me getting out of work hours before. Would not recommend this product.  I will be throwing it away because it is useless.  I thought I had purchased a reliable camera but I was wrong.
5,My first thoughts were to purchase an inexpensive device to 'test' what a dash cam might be capable of doing but not thinking the video quality would be too great.  Was I wrong...this camera has excellent quality video.  It is a very compact size and can be tucked on the far side of the rear view mirror and you won't even notice it.  Great little investment.
5,The item is smaller then it looks! Really tiny Stealth looking cam very goof quality picture I dislike that it turns on on its own when at home if laying on desk but options for sensitivity can be changed overall really nice! great price great picture awesome protection while driving and looks really good! with it being in the way Will buy a few more soon. Thanks again.
5,If you're looking for a small dash cam you don't need to think much about this is a good choice. Instructions are a little complicated but once you get everything working it's a nice little dash cam.
5,Still reviewing night vision but this is second VanTrue dash cam and the are some of the best I’ve seen. Picture quality is awesome!
5,Great
1,The camera quality was ok it was not choppy but clear. Could have been better in my opinion. The suction power did not stick on at all. The most important thing was the battery. I let it charge to full battery (forgot how long it took to fully charge) but I laughed when I took it with me from my house to the store and bank. The damn thing didn't make it back home in a time span of 30 minutes it died. I think it was less than 30 minutes too as all three locations are less than 5 minutes apart. My point is the battery sucks and I read a review saying it killed her car's battery so I did not take the risk of plugging it into my car to recharge. I took a risk on this product and paid the price. Oh well... at least I can warn other customers.
5,USPS had lost my package but Amazon quickly sent another and so far it works perfectly its very small so it hides in your dash and picture quality is true 1080p
2,Unfortunately this camera missed a opportunity to shine! My car ends up getting scratched by someone and the park mode on this camera did even record the event! So I'll end up paying for damages to get the scratches repaired and not having a clue who did it to my car. Camera was pointed towards the front of the car and the scratches happened in the front bumper so the sensors didn't pick it up.The suction on that's provided with this camera has a tendency to fall down every so often. I ended up using some adhesive to make it stay attached to the windshield.It's a so..so.. camera. Don't think i'll purchase another Vantrue camera.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 After seeing a review in PC Magazine I purchased three of these when they went on sale. Setup was fairly easy and the video is quite clear. For the price it seems like a good value. Also the company seems to have customer service as a high priority which I value.
3,A great price for a lot of features but this very small unit when adding in the gps option is anything but discrete . even with the suction cup mounted as high as possible the camera hangs below the bottom of my rear view mirror. Need a unit for my other car and this will not be it. such a small camera and a mounting bracket thats 3 inches + long? take a pass on this one.
2,The price and picture quality of this product has been adequate since the beginning but the dirty little subject that I didn't research was battery replacement.  Can't be done.  Since the beginning I have been forced to bring the camera inside to defrag the disc on my computer.  Somewhere it said to do it every couple weeks and I have done so since the beginning with a reminder on my phone's calendar.It just gets old and you cannot replace the battery or batteries.  If I had known this at the time and that the camera will only work when the car's key is on.......
4,Night vision could be a lot better.  Unit is ultra small but is ok.
2,I can’t seem to get it to work. The chip is in correctly but the camera keeps shutting off saying there’s a card error. I purchased the reader card at the same time I purchased the camera to make sure I purchased the correct one. I’m on vacation for six weeks now.  I’m just gonna have to wait till I get back to deal with it in the meantime I’m not using it because it won’t work correctly. 😢
5,can not beat it for the money my old 1 was a Unden and this is much better
5,Suction cup is not coming off!  Easy set up and to use.  Easy upload to Facebook ect.Love to use for road trips!  For the cost its fantastic.
5,I love how small and compact it is. It can easily be hidden behind your rear view mirror. Picture quality is not bad for the price point. You can easily make out the cars license plate in front of you. If your looking for a good dash cam for under 100 bucks. This has got to be one of the best ones out there.
5,I have started using my camera and I really like it. It takes great videos day and night and the parking mode feature I really like. I hope to use this for all my driving and parking. Like how easy it was to set up as well
4,I have been using this for about a month now and haven't had any functional problems.  The picture quality is very good.
5,I was looking for a dash cam with a slim profile that still takes good quality footage and this one seems to work great so far. It was easy to set up out of the box fits behind my rear view mirror without taking up much extra space and also lets you review footage on camera with the built-in LCD screen. So far so good...
5,Vantrue N1 Pro Mini 1080P Dash Cam with Sony IMX323 Sensor Full HD 1920x1080P 1.5" Car Dash Camera Video Recorder w/Super Night Vision Parking Mode G-Sensor Collision Detection. Bought the N1 Pro Dash Cam a week ago; set-up was a breeze functionality very well thought of. I'm planning to buy a second unit for my other car.Well done Vantrue team!
3,The video quality is generally good for this camera. But I think it may be a little too bright for the day time. There was one day I was driving at dusk and the video looked just like regular day time. The G-Sensor is way too sensitive. I set it at the low setting for the G-sensor already and it would still get activated every time the door is shut close.
3,Works ok not the best really considering sending it back shuts off too easy and always half to turn it on
1,I bought three.  I bought them during the winter of 2019 and 2020.  I have had nothing but trouble with them.  Customer service was sweet.  They always returned my emails though they would not give me a phone number so we could work out the problems together.  I won't elaborate on all the problems except to say that of the three cameras I was only able to get one to work.  I have spent untold hours - literally hours - on these cameras to get them to work but I was totally unsuccessful.  It starts with an instruction booklet written in transliterated Chinese and goes to small buttons that do not work as advertised.  Upgrade firmware?  Can't be done.  And on and on.Don't waste your money or your time on these devices.
4,All in all this is a great little dash cam. I wish it would turn enough on the mount to record the driveds window and that it included the GPS sensor.
4,G sensor is meh suction is not great but camera works well except for night time because the license plate cnanot be seen due to headlights.
4,Works well still new to me.
5,I got this product for my husband as his anniversary gift. He loves it. It’s very easy to use. Picture quality is very good and especially it’s very reasonable priced. Highly recommended. I’m thinking about getting one for myself too!
3,good. but i ended up returning it because i couldn’t run the thick wires in my 2014 sierra.
5,Great dash cam. I purchased two different cameras for my car this cam. this one is by far my favorite. This camera is quick to move from one car to another. And it is easy to operate and view footage. It starts to record as soon as you put it on and can record on motion.
1,Have been using it for only 5 months using the suggested SD card. Then CARD ERROR kept popping up. Tried to clear and reformat. That didn't do it. Bought a new SD card. Same thing CARD ERROR. Worthless
5,Very pleased my vantrue n1 pro mini purchase. Incredible video quality day and night perfect size that not only looks great but does not obstruct my driving view . The included suction mount is very solid and stays on just like it's supposed too.  Great value great build quality and the camera is very easy to operate  .
5,If you don't want to spend a lot and just need a simple dash cam that works well and is easy to use this one is it. It's about the size of a go pro and practically hides behind the rear view mirror. Set up is easy and it has all of the important features that the more costly ones have.
5,Wasn't expecting too much priority is that it records when you need it.  Owned for 9 months now it's still working great. Video quality is excellent. Survived the summer heat thus far. Suction cup mount is pretty good. Now that I have some confidence in this model I will get one for the wife.
5,Is ok for the price but the battery no last 10 minutes  camera must be hardwire all times.
5,I have really been wanting a dash cam ever since moving to Texas. There are some crazy drivers here. This little camera takes up very little room on my windshield due to its size but still captures all the details the larger ones do. Picture and audio quality is terrific. Very pleased with this purchase!
5,Love the quality of the video and most importantly love the ease of setup. The size of the N1 is such that it’s not impeding your view out of the windshield so your not going to miss pedestrians in crosswalks. The length of the power cord is perfect and easily ran the cord under the trim.
5,Overall great product for the price inconvenience easy to use for a novice
5,I've just upgraded from a previous model n2. So far so good. Very happy with it. Powers up with ignition on my suv. The suction cup to window seems like an improvement over my last model. I like the look of this thing as well. Reminds me of my gopro especially with That fisheye looking lense.
5,The camera is great and small enough to not be noticeable! It’s quality is great the product quality is also great! Simple and functional. Captures everything and has a wide angle view. Has many settings you can adjust and easy to connect. We bought the hardwire kit and works perfect. We love the 24/7 recording
5,Read good reviews and was sceptical but the camera seems to hold up great and works even with no power to it for long time so the battery has enough power to tiger recording for maybe an hour on/off recording. Very impressive. Tolerates extreme heat of 100F+ very well. No issues yet. Very well made.
5,Hard to beat for the money.  Not the sleekest design but great picture quality and fairly easy to use.  I found the G sensor too sensitive and ended up shutting it off.  Otherwise everything else works wonderfully.  Used it plugged in for many months but recently hardwired it with the kit.
4,Its a nice camera at a budget price
4,its tiny i have to put on reading glasses to see what's up.
1,I bought three of these camera and am very satisfied with the video quality. But one thing i hate about this camera is the camera itself keeps resetting to factory setting like date time that i have to manually readjust them every 12 weeks which is very annoying. I contacted the seller and they were nice enough to offer to replace all three but i had to pay for the shipping cost to return the camera to them and they shipped the new camera for free. And the problem still happens with the new camera. I guess because the internal battery is bad and it doesn't memorize the setting or something. I am looking for a different camera brand and throw all three cameras to the trash. Don't waste your money on this camera look for something else!
5,Great picture love that it has temperature protection cause in the hot summers the inside temperature of a car can get extremely hot and some cameras will stop working or breakdown when subjected to the heat. Decent price for a high quality camera. Was also in the top 3 of a couple review websites.
5,This is just what I was looking for compact easy to set up and good quality. I will always have a dash cam in my vehicle for my protection in court. I'm looking forward to using the N1 Pro for a long time.
5,I really like this camera because it’s easy to use and it’s what you expect Ive had it for almost a year and I recently bought 3 more for family members. I recommend it I haven’t had any problems.
5,Great little camera. Awesome picture quality and night vision. The motion detection is extremely sensitive so parking mode was recording wind leaves etc. when parked outside. I’m going to hardwire to a switched ignition source since I don’t really need parking mode. That way it’ll only record when we’re using the car!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I purchased this nice little camera due to the offered features and I was very surprised by the video quality both daytime and nighttime video.  I purchased a second N1 Pro for our motorhome because I like this unit so much.
2,Cute small camera. The suction power is terrible though. It would be a nice dash cam if it stayed to the windshield. I did follow instructions and stick for about 20 minutes.I’ve had this dashcam for almost one month and the suction cup Keeps  getting worse.  I don’t know if I have a faulty one but I should feel the need to order a different suction just because this one sucks. No pun intended.Aside from that the camera is great. I love the option of muting or unmuting.Update 07/11/19My parking mode is now not working. The sensor isn’t working as of sometime this week. I am extremely upset because it should have been recording and it wasn’t.
2,I had this dash camera installed in my truck for about eighteen months and it seemed to be working perfectly until I was in a collision in January.  The card showed everything up to the collision and everything after but the actual impact was missing.  The impact apparently caused a malfunction just when it ought to have been working.
5,Great customer service  shuts off in high heat it save electronics  small it hides behind rear view mirror
4,tried registering with Vantrue.net with no lucktried five times
5,It’s small with very good quality. Very easy to use.
5,I wanted a quality dashcam to prepare for the unexpected and this fit my needs.  Set up was a breeze and it's very small so it doesn't block vision.  I put it to use a few hours after receiving it and the video quality is great.
4,The time recorded not longer.
5,One word AMAZING! This is one of those purchased that i will never regret buying. I got this on prime day sale. Easy to install user interface friendly too! Camera angle and resolution were stellar! highly recommended product for its functionality and fair price. Couldn’t ask for more!
2,Only had it a few weeks. The set up was good and good picture quality. Suction cup stopped working. The first 2-3 times the suction power was great. Then all of a sudden the camera fell off from the windshield! I tried to place it back on the window but didn't last 5 seconds and would keep falling off. The problem with this design is that you NEED to use THAT sprcific suction cup because that's were connection is to power the camera. Left 2 starts for picture quality and features. Minus 3 stars since the product is not usable without the suction cup so it's pointless to have that dash cam.
2,The dash cam is of good quality. The camera itself is small and easy to use. The biggest problem it has is at the suction cup. After one summer the dash cam falls down every day due to a faulty suction cup. The issue with suction  cup significantly shortens this dash cam's life span. You probably can only use it for at most one year. If you do not wish to buy a new dash cam every year avoid this one.
5,Bought this for my wife’s car and it was an easy install. For the size and price of it definitely worth it. The picture quality is good. I just bought another one for my own car.
5,Good
3,Its nice and all its a dash camera its supposed to run 24/7. Moments come random during driving where the camera stops recording and makes me get it going again manual kind of pain the ass. Other than that good camera wouldn't trust it very much due to the random stop recording.
2,Was quite satisified with this dash cam which I purchased about ten months ago.  However the internal battery appears to have died so the date and time must be reset each time I use the car.  Also the "up" arrow button function is now inoperative and I can't access the settings menu to set the date/time.  I'd try going through the manufacturer but suspect the quality of this dash cam is the problem.  Will look for a more high-end dash cam.
2,I bought two of these and I have been noticing that if you set the camera on loop recording it doesn't change the date after month you would need to manually update the date after the end of each month. My camera's are hot wired and I have tried other settings but date problem is still not fixed. This is really bad what if you get in to an accident and want to show the evidence and your camera is showing wrong date & time. Therefor 2 stars. overall picture quality is good for the price you are paying. If the company contacts me to solve this issue I will change my review.
3,Camera works fine until this summer when the camera shuts down when temperature gets hot in vehical.It will turn on once it cools down.  This is annoying when I return to my car "slight window down" in the summer and the camera won't turn on right away sometimes.
5,Every function worked as stated.
5,I really liked the quality and performance of this cam. easy to use setup and view videos. Support is A+ as well.If only all companies were as good as Vantrue!
4,Only had it a couple day but it works as stated and very clear
5,Great video quality. Have used forabout a week now. Plates are hard to make out at night but very clear in daytime. Smooth video; stylish and small design. Hopefully withstands the cold temperatures okay but so far so good with the car parked in as low as 15*F
4,for the price this product is perfect
1,I couldn't find any warranty info on this It worked the one time I looked at the videos it won't keep the time and date so it was almost impossible to find a specific video.  The last time I tried it only had videos that were at least 2 weeks old.  I bought Rove R2- 4K Dash Cam  it has twice the frame rate and it lets you know when it is recording by a voice alert and is a bigger camera.  When I put this camera away to store it it was still on somehow even though it had been unplugged for a day and had no memory card in it.  Worthless.
5,Works great. Easy to install and set up!
2,I tried to use it as a dashcam. The camera has not worked with any of the micro SD cards that I have attempted to use. It refuses to accept a card of any kind. Unfortunately by the time I had tried every card I could think of I could no longer return it. I would not recommend buying this dashcam.
5,Works great!! Im really happy with the quality especially at night  after endless reviews on youtube I came to this one and knew it was the one. I especially like how clear the license plates look at night. Really great cam  would definitely recommend!
4,Like it but could be more performing for this price
5,It seems to be working perfectly nice compact dash cam I didnt realize how small it is but if it works good for me that doesnt matter
5,I'm glad to have bought this camera.  It's works great and I like how small it is.  I bought the GPS add-on which also works well and is worth having.  Hard wired it using their separate kit.  Good buy no complaints.
3,Small and useful. It would have been perfect if not for the suction cup failing. It stayed attached for a week and after that it keeps falling once every 2 days. Would love to change my rating if they cab send me a new suction cup.
1,We ordered 2 of these with the largest  supported memory card one for each of our cars.After 1 month the first camera died with "Card error". Replacing the card did NOT clear the error.Replacing the camera (with same card) fixed the problem and all was well although 1 car did not have a camera anymore. A week later the other camera failed.Both cameras failed within 2 months. I can live with 1 camera fail but both within that short amount of time .. no thanks. Not worth buying again.Buyer beware.
5,This is my 1st dash camera and in short i would buy this product again. Particularly the video quality is very good. While am very hands on with stuff this was easy to set up.
5,Does what you need a dash cam for without all the add-ons that you don't really need. Straight forward installation and set up. Good quality video both day and night. Nice size too. Good stuff. Easily worth the price.
5,PROS:1080p recordings  256GB SD card support  BEST FEATURE -parking mode  loop recording  night vision  PREMIUM build/quality  Mini sizeCON:  None so farVery pleased with this purchase
1,Was happy with all aspects of this Cam at first -- but after about 4 months the Battery would no longer hold a charge.  Cam would work ONLY if plugged into car-power; making reviewing content totally impractical.  Then at about the 6-month mark the Cam would no longer even turn on: only the blue Power LED would flash.  Using the 'Reset' button was futile -- the Cam simply failed.  It had never been dropped nor gotten wet (or any form of abuse).  I even dis-mounted the Cam when parking in the sun to avoid overheating it.  So my view of this device is that it is crappy -- and I wasted $80.  Well off to try to find another (different brand) dash-cam...
4,Happy
1,Camera will not turn on and have only had it for two months. Unable to return because return window has closed
5,Easy to setup mount and download. Great quality pictures. Good value.
5,Excellent quality picture and love the fact that it can take a 256Gb card you can record hours and hours of video. Will have to get another one for a second vehicle.
4,My 1st dash cam. Looks great and easy to use.
1,First Vantru camera was a N2 pro and the battery died after a year. That battery is hardwired in. I recently bought a Vantru N1 pro and after two weeks the camera screen turned white when turned on. No picture at all. The camera has not been dropped or mishandled in any way.
5,N1Pro is amazing camera. For this price camera gets perfect job done. It runs 1080 p. Day time is great visibility. Nigh time you you can see very well surrounding. This camera definitely gives you piece of mind for the price you can't beat.
5,Product is outstanding.  The instruction manual needs to be enlarged.  Hard to read the very small print.  Everything came well packaged and in perfect shape.  I also purchased the GPS mount.  Set-up was easy.
3,Small easy to mount. The cable is long. it's cheap.. The only issue cannot read the number plate of cars as you pass them either at day or night
2,The recording is ok but you need to have this connected to power all the time otherwise the battery will not last and the Parking Mode is totally useless and will not record if your vehicle is hit .  Having the unit plugged in all the time it gets hot and the control buttons do not work.  You have to unplug it and wait for it to cool down and plug it in again for the buttons to work.  I do not recommend this product.
1,It randomly keeps stopping and when I press the button to protect important footage it only does it sometimes. It freezes CONSTANTLY. The videos do not continue recording from where the last video stopped there's about a 5-10 second window missing (I guess because its saving the last video to the SD during that time) Which is a HUGE DEAL because in that 5-10 second gap you could have gotten in an accident which you won't have footage of. So I wouldn't recommend this dash cam. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt so I kept it hoping they would eventually work so I didn't return it before the return window ended big mistake on my part.
3,It is an average camera. I thought its resolution is better. Unfortunately sometimes I could not get the plate number clearly. It is very bad at night because it is impossible to get the car plate numbers
5,This little thing is tough and looks it too. The quality is great and I plan on buying 2 more for other cars. Everything from the manual to the unit itself is stealth and hardy.
5,Bought one for my vehicle and was so impressed I bought another for my wife. They're great and I elected for the $5 insurance in the event they act up for replacement but so far after a couple of months they're flawless.
5,It's decent for its price. There's a bit of fish eye in the recording but it works well. It's easy to set up and use. I like how small it is too.
5,Excellent camera. You would have to spend three to four times the amount to find a camera to match the quality. Video is great day or night plus wide field of view.
5,Along with the additional gps this is a great setup for the money...pics and video are great too...been using for several  months
5,I have 2... Has worked great in the crazy Arizona heat.
5,Excellent cam. Perfect size as you can tell from the pictures. The suction cup is a bit finicky but overall very happy with this product.Support from the company was great when i had any questions. Would buy from them again.
5,Clear wide pictures on 23 inch monitor need to be rather close to car ahead for license plate number clarity.
3,Now i have to spend another 15 to 20 for an sd card and it only takes samsung so your gana have to order online
5,Wonderful pictures and video
5,Small in size big in features and quality. Wish the micro usb connector could be in a different location thus making the window mount smaller.Picture quality is superb. Setup is a breeze. Will be getting one for the car.
5,Excellent quality video and small size. It gives you piece of mind having a video witness to use against bad drivers.
1,May be I received a bad unit but this is my experience. I bought this device 2 years ago.Unit showed it was recording but when I checked the video in the memory card the last video was 2 months old. Imagine If I was in an accident. The purpose of the dashcam is to record events and in my case this unit failed to do that with a misleading indicator.
4,Pleased with the product and customer service. Thank you Kelly!!
1,It changes the date every day and it’s so annoying. Idk what to do about it. What happens if I get in an accident and have proof of the situation? No one will believe me because the date is suddenly to 2018. Everything else is great except that.
5,This dash cam is small and compact. Great to hide behind your rear view mirror.  The camera quality could be a bit smoother but nothing to complain about as it will definitely  do it's job in capturing the right videos.
5,We have bought other cameras that cost more but not near as good as this one.  Awesome Camera well above expectations.
5,I really enjoy the Vantrue dashcam. It was easy to set up and use. The picture and video quality are very good. I was surprised at the clarity of the nighttime video.
3,The camera keeps resetting the date to 1/1/2018 for some reason i have tried to update the firmware but that didn't help.
5,Excellent product. Paired with a 64gb SanDisk extreme micro SD works very well for what I’m using it for. Easy download to computer for video editing. Setup menu is easy to navigate and configure the camera
5,Does what it says on the tin and seems to do it well. I am not a power user but no complaints.
5,Have had this over a year now and is still working.Update: Still working good
5,I bought an N1 for each of my cars.  With the add a circuit kit for power it took about 10 minutes to install. I would recommend this product to anyone.
4,Bummed expected nicer picture quality.
4,Great video quality.
5,Great DashCam the size is perfect. It remains hidden behind my mirror easy to preview the videos on my computer. One of the main reason why I bought this is because it’s Made in Japan.
5,Awesome camera for it's price and the features work good also. Very easy to install too.
1,Quality camera.  The suction it comes with is extremely ineffective.  After charging the camera completely I set it up in my Jeep and the next morning the suction had already given up as I found the camera hanging there in my windshield.  I've had the camera for 2 months now and I can't use it at all because the suction device is such poor quality.  If you have your own mount I would recommend this camera.  If you plan to use the suction mount that comes with the camera be prepared to be disappointed or plan on getting a supplimental mount.  Pretty much useless with the mount not working.  Great camera cheap accessories.
5,Super easy to install and to use. Picture quality is nice. Haven’t had any problems. It’s doesnt come with a memory card.
4,Works well for me
3,I didn't even get to hook it up yet. You can't use a 64gb SD card (that they recommend). Windows will not allow you to format to FAT32 with anything over 32gb.
5,The camera was easy to set up and install.  Picture quality is better than I expected and easy to load on a desktop.All in all it exceeded all expectations.
1,I've been a somewhat loyal customer for a few years. Writing after a year of use of this cam.Decent picture quality during the day but that is offset by pretty crappy night video;The battery is dead with normal use after a year... so the date is always wrong and it's neat impossible to sort out the clipsThe cam regularly falls off the windshield that is cleaned with alcohol regardless of the temperature.The g-sensor is insane saving a ton of useless videos making it almost impossible to sort out the current clips because of the bad battery and wrong dates...You are better off overall with some $30 options and even the previous versions of vanture cams.
5,Great size dash cam I like the picture quality. Setup was easy and didn’t take long at all. I made sure and downloaded a firmware update also which went off without a hitch.
2,I was disappointed in this camera but at the same time I bought it not expecting too much. The MicroSD memory card slot was defective and it wouldn't allow the card to actually fit. Therefore rendering the entire camera useless as it won't record or work without the card. The picture quality was good and the set up was easy. It seems like a great camera if it worked to its full potential. Only problem was the memory card not fitting.
5,Perfect dash cam! I bought 4dashcams including gar*** and cob*a but only this one had all features that I wanted. Operating temperature gps(optional but still cheapest!) and no overheating. Awesome dashcam!
2,Forget about reading license plates. I used a magnifying glass on a still video of a vehicle that was 10 feet away and could not read the plate number. Also the suction cup is weak. On a hot summer day the camera falls of the windshield.
5,Most definitely a great value for the price. Highly recommend this budget dash cam
5,Very Clear I mistakenly got the wrong sims card but Samsung is compatible with this cam
1,I’m extremely disappointed in this camera. It intermittently stops recording; failing to do its one job. The screen turns back on after driving for about two minutes and will continue to do so for about a week before going back to working order without me touching it at all. I have tried everything to figure out the problem and there is no indication that anything is wrong with it. I’ve reached out to the company twice because they claim to have a twelve month warranty and have received no response.
5,Bought this works great..good reviews didn't let me down..
1,I bought this dash cam to replace an older one that died and initially I was very happy with the image quality. However after about 4-5 month it seemed that the internal battery failed and it stopped maintaining settings and the date (which is odd given that it used the GPS signal to set the date). A month or so later it stopped recording reliably and each file started over with a 2018 date (this is late 2020). Then it started writing over new files and I quit using it. I would not buy another.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Finally I have found the best dash cam in a promising price without compromising the quality.Note: The video seems to be compressed while uploading to Amazon.
5,Dash cam was easy to install and has great picture and sound quality.
5,Great camera.  It does everything I need it to do while in my wife’s car (records in HD has a parking mode and records audio)
3,Directions and ease of use with the camera can be better.
5,Best purchase I've done
2,The item may have been fine but the instructions had flaw in them about the memory card.After trying to put the memory card in wrong and getting frustrated I gave up. After deciding to send it back I saw some emailed instructions telling me the correct way to do it but I was already set on sending it back.. Note to manufacture send out correct instructions right away
3,Too small no Wi-Fi still lacks picture quality but good
5,Great dash cam especially for the price. Good quality video and the perfect size. Easy to set up and use.
1,I did like that the did not have an SD card. As a result I had to find and install to complete functionality of this camera. After finding a retail seller of an SD card verifying specs with owners manual in hand and installing-“card error “ displays in cameras window! Suggestion; plug & play Vantrue simply plug & play!
1,Crap product!!  Only takes certain sized Micro SD cards the suction cup does not hold onto the windshield of my Jeep..... and now randomly shuts off and back on.  Found a firmware upgrade with no instructions on how to upload.  Their user manuals are a joke.NEVER BUYING VANTRUE AGAIN!
2,Was pleased with the video however in an all too short time it stopped recording. Would not get that brand again. Have another brand now that has been problem free much longer than this.
5,So little but pretty good quality. Don’t forget to purchase a micro SD card for it.
1,As several other reviewers have noted this unit’s battery is seriously flawed.  It simply does not hold a charge after you have used the cam for awhile.  When it worked it was very good but what good is a cam with a non-functioning battery?  Give this one a pass.
5,works great. no issues great product.
5,I set this dashcam up with the hardwire kit. So far so good. Works well for the price they sell it at.
5,Love this product.  It has great picture quality and important features.
5,Like the small size and the quality of the video. Use it all the time to capture video while driving.
5,Works perfect
2,First it loses suction after a few hours in the cold (talking only 33F here) and secondly the battery has already failed so once you unplug the power it will lose the last recording as it hard shuts down. Not really what I had in mind...
5,Great product I like that you can remove it without the remove a suction cup
5,Easy to install and operate. Good quality videos.
3,Its okay. Hardwired using recommended kit and it killed my battery.
1,Product seemed fantastic... at first. After owning and using the cam a little over a month it has stopped charging completely. Cam immediately dies once removed from a wall-outlet charger or lighter-port.UPDATE:7 Months with the camera... Changed from 2 stars to 1 star. Vantrue sent me a replacement camera after the first cam had battery issues. The replacement then had the exact same problem. It frequently corrupts the footage because it's constantly dying even while on their OEM charger. I would advise to say stay away from this camera.  Will be switching to a different cam shortly.
1,I got error messages each time I inserted the micro SD card. I tried a different card and same thing. I got frustrated and bought a different camera that worked flawlessly. I dont recommend this camera.
3,Great pictures
5,3rd dash cam for husband. Price good hope it works better than the rest.  Christmas gift works good so far.
5,Absolutely great product!! Its easy to use and install. Picture is perfect and it gives me piece of mind to have.
5,Took some getting used to but once u figure it out it’s great for the price
1,I bought this to help track driver's who seem to not notice me when pulling out/turning from a street or intersection.  I never got to install this in my vehicle.  The product is difficult to set up and would record everything with the slightest vibration on the desk.  It was difficult to stop recording to turn off and to keep tuned off.  The battery would go dead.  I would like to return it but waited too long since I was planning on installing it in a new vehicle.  Very disappointed!
1,After a promising start I keep having issues with this dashcam.- the time and date keep resetting making recording video worthless. I already set it back multiple time but nothing- some of the recordings are not actually saved. I ofter review the footage and find the recordings from the SAME DAY missing (I got a 128GB so space is not an issue)- the quality is poor. Sure it's full HD but the detail is pretty poorI will need to buy something else too bad I can't return it.
5,I was skeptical about it but the reviews were outstanding. I liked it so much I bought 3 more
1,Being connected to accessory power you wouldn’t assume the battery is very useful - until you realize that between drives the date keeps resetting and it overwrites the oldest files when it needs space: this means your newest files get overwritten quickly and older garbage remains. Of course you won’t notice till you go back to find something...
5,Excellent productWell constructed and easy to useGood Quality
5,First - the good. The video is amazing. The camera works really well. The low light video is amazing.
5,great camera the screen is small but thats great because it doesn't block any view n its easy to hide
1,Wouldn't recommend if you want something that will last battery is defective and won't hold a charge. I contacted customer support and they just offer a discount on a new one which I wouldn't buy if they aren't willing to stand behind there product. Also there suction cup is horrible walk out to it being on my dashboard every time I get in the car.
5,Takes great pictures both day and night.. small but still takes very nice pictures.would recommend to others..
1,Picture is great quality.  Angle is very good too.  However I find myself changing the timestamp on a weekly basis after 6 months of purchasing / using this.  While it's quite a trivial functionality it is very important when searching for footage.Update: Customer service is great. They were able to replace my unit after troubleshooting it.  It seems I had a bad internal battery.Update2:  Looks like the second unit battery died after a couple of months seems like this is a re-occurring theme.
1,I just got rear ended and the video is nowhere to be found. The video before and the video after are there but from the accident itself nothing. Not in "normal" and not in "events." Also it constantly comes off my windshield
5,Nice small feature size with intuitive button selectivity.  Very pleased..
5,Very easy to use and set up and the picture quality is great!
1,I have had good luck with vantrue in the past but this time was different. The camera box was already opened as the seals had been broken. I opened the box and it was obviously messed with before it got into my hands. I plugged it into the car and the screen starts to boot up but then shuts off and goes black. From there nothing happenes no matter what buttons you press. It's very disappointing to go through this experience.
5,Works great!!
5,Perfect and clear picture
5,Small and compact fits behind the rearview mirror live in Florida used it three times
5,Small well built. Does the job really well! Well worth the money.
5,Just bought camera and Micro SD card will not seat.... Please reverse from instructions....Reversed card and seats fine now..Great camera
3,No way you can read  license plate!!!
1,The camera is perfect in its small size and it worked just fine for 2 days until it gave a card error message in effect destroying my SD card which is a 32GB Class 10 or better card.  The SD card was not recoverable so I took it as maybe it was the card so I put in another 32GB card and a day later the same message.  Now both my SD cards are no longer usable.
1,I had a small fender bender and it missed it. I stopped recording seconds before the accident then started again after the fact.I then found that it misses a lot and has gapes between videos.Thanks for nothing.Junk.Update: Vantrue said if I return it and remove my bad review they will give me a refund.I refuse to take off my true review. This is the worst most unreliable camera ever.
1,I bought this in February and after this summer the battery basically can't hold a charge unassisted. This means that it will lose the date and time settings if you don't use it for a bit.While driving this doesn't affect the recording and otherwise  works perfectly fine.I'm not sure why dashcam makers even bother with Li+ batteries when they're vulnerable to heat. These things sit in the sun just while driving and cars get hot fast.
5,Good quality cam
1,It has good picture quality the problem is it only records clips of 3 to 4 seconds at a time. I bought a 256 gig sd card and according to the ad it gives you 40 hours record time well with 3 to 4 second clips at a time it’s just not worth it and now I’m stuck with an sd card I have no use for and paid 54 bucks to get it. I returned the dash cam
5,Easy to set up and use recommend to anyone needing a dash cam
5,Works well and is easy to use.
5,So far so good.
5,overall I am satisfied
5,The video quality is excellent. The price was reasonable. Support is outstanding.
5,Precio accesible a una dashcam de calidad.
1,The directions for instructions to use the video card are backwards.  After a year and numerous emails to Vantrue customer service who confirmed we have the correct video/camera cards we still cannot get these cameras to work.  No phone number to talk through issues with Vantrue and no local office in the Seattle area where we can take the camera for help in getting them set up.
5,Good camera. Records super nice and looks very sleek.
5,Very happy with this little dash cam the picture is fantastic great features!!
5,Its very good
1,POS camera. The internal battery is crap and lasts about 18 hours then camera resets itself to default settings and date goes to 2/1/2018. If you don't drive vehicle everyday to keep the tiny internal backup battery charged it's useless. Today tho it reset to default on it's on while driving and reset date and began recording over new recordings instead of going to end and looping.
5,This is a great dash cam
2,Too many cables for me screen is too small. People spend more money and buy an updated camera with bigger screen and better technology
1,works good but battery is not replaceable and only lasts 14 months they you would have to hard wire it to your car battery. . they only would give me 15 refund.
5,Great product!!
1,This camera is a dissapointment. The picture quality is horrible after many exposure adjustments. The 256 gb will only record about 20 hours at 1080p@30fps. Other cameras that i owned gave me  20 plus hours with 128 gb at 1080p@30fps. The camera kept falling off the windshield. The suction is weak. Honestly the only good thing  about the camera was the price. I paid  $55.99.
5,Like quality
5,Great cam. Haven't used for nite vision yet.
1,After 3 months of use yes with the car cable provided it caused me several times to go hunt for a jumpstart / boost as battery was almost completely dead.Not using the burglar or any fancy feature yet it kills the car battery. Im afraid will need to replace battery soon.
1,Stopped working on the first day. Camera just froze and wont respond to button controls. I really hoped th ou s camera would work. Seems like Amazon is flooded with cheap dashcam that aren't bent for serious use. I'm a contractor and am alwa it s on the road dealing with idiots who can't drive with a $#!+ I guess the search continues for a decent functional dashcam.
5,Very easy to use. Good picture quality.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Got this for Christmas and haven't used it because the suction doesn't work more than 30 seconds and it does not recognize when connected to a power source.  The window and suction we’re cleaned with alcohol first. It is completely unusable.
5,Bgy
1,Short and sweet: camera that isn’t compatible with the biggest micro-sd card maker in the world!
5,Awesome camera. Doesn't block the view in my windshield.
2,I started to install this camera in my truck. The power cord does not fit with the camera. The male plug on the power cord is too big for any of the sockets on the camera.
2,Stopped working after a couple months of use.
5,Camera does what it is designed to do.
5,Works great. Easy to install and operate
5,Very easy to use. Great picture lot of features
5,Good
5,POSSIBLY THE BEST DASH CAM YOU CAN BUY!
5,👍🏼
5,Works well and easy to set up.
5,performs as advertised
2,Only got 9 or so months out of this before battery died now doesn't work.
1,The camera worked fine did what it was supposed to do the whole 2x I used it. Took it out of the box to use it today and wire connector is broken off. Not very sturdy components I guess. Of course it's beyond the return date for Amazon. UGH!
5,Perfect.
1,plug it in and the screen shuts off in like 1/2 second.charge it and unplug it and the screen says low battery and shuts off within 10 seconds.could never get to the settings.vantrue has no ph# and does not respond to emails.
1,When I opened the box it the sd box hat a cut on top and to my surprise it came with no 128 gigabyte microSD card which was very disappointing so now in order to actually use the dash cam I need to purchase a microSD.Thanks
1,The camera itself is good easy to install. memory card formatted BUT it's video recording are useless can't open it. See above picture. If any one have solution on how to prevent these type of recordings or on how to open them let me know. I will change my rating.
1,Update: This thing annoys me to no end. I guess I never noticed it before but everytime I turn off my car the date on the dash cam keeps resetting to 1/1/2018.  I have to enter the correct date every day and it’s frustrating. I do not recommend this anymore.
5,VERY GOOD
1,This product did not work.
1,The only upside to this dash cam is that it's small & discrete. The video quality is subpar. The advertisement about "easy to read license plates" is completely false. I even used "Adobe Premiere Pro" to enhance the license plates but it's still not even close.
5,Picture clear
5,Great litty Dash cam
5,Easy setup
1,Came with cables for a different device.
5,dashcam
1,Camera is very small which is nice to not block view. Seems well made. Gave it a 1 star because micro sd card would not go in all the way. Yes I put the card in the right way. Will return and get a replacement.
1,The camera will often record the first 3 minutes of my journey and that's all.  I formatted the card per the instructions listed and it doesn't seem to make a difference.  If it doesn't record entire trips how am I supposed to rely on it?
1,After their reply they wanted me to take a picture of how the large SD card wouldn't fit in the slot.Purchased just the model SD that they said in the manual but it was tooo big.They responded three times without understanding...
5,They are great!
5,good
1,The ease of setting camera up was excellent.  I liked the rotation of picture feature so I could mount it upside down on dash.  Quality of image excellent.  8/15/2020 2nd review.  Suction cup not holding
5,Son was happy
1,I purchased two of these but they will not keep the current date and time.  Programming confusing but okay resolution.  Suction cup will not hold camera.  Look elsewhere for a dash cam.
5,Good quality camera.
2,My biggest issue is that this camera keeps turning off while I’m driving
5,Good
5,Wonderful dashcam
2,It’s not stick to the glass
1,As a cam its look like good but as electronic no it’s not worth it
1,I Tried a 64GB Samsung endurance and a 128GB Sandisk endurance and the cam would not recognize them. It did work with a standard sandisk 16GB card.
1,Would not stick to the windshield and I even purchased the upgrade clip for the windshield and it would not stay kept falling off in three different vehicles. Not good.
5,Just recently got in an accident and this camera captured every single bit of it. What I would make sure of is to clean the storage every 2 weeks if you don't have the extra disk space.
1,Not only is the sd card not included but it needs a special one that the customer needs to "format."
1,Owned and used 3 months charging/power cord now stops working after an hour or so! Keep looking there has to be better products then this.
1,Stopped working in less than a month and seller is dragging his feet to replace this device! horrible experience overall.
1,This camera is no longer works properly after about 2 months of use. It over heats and freezes.
1,The camera doesnt read any micro card says card error ive tried different cards still doesn't work
5,This camera was exactly what I was looking for. I don't have a particularly expensive car but I want to still be protected in case of a crash or help someone else who got into a crash in front of me. So I didn't want to spend $300 for one of the top rated cameras since I didn't think that I needed all of the bells and whistles that they came with I just needed something simple that got the job done.This is exactly what I got here. It was only $80 and it was great for my purposes. I thought that the quality was good and it was easy to setup. I wish it came with a plastic tool that is used to put the cable under the panels and also a few little clips to help keep the cable in place but I was able to get along without them.Overall I really like this dashcam so far!
1,no customer support what  so ever . none
1,Through it away!
1,CHINESE MADE GARBAGE STAY AWAY! NEVER WORKED.
1,Sucks
1,poor quality overall
1,Keeps falling off
4,When I received it the item was so small I figured it was junk.  But recently I tried it out and it does a good job photographing the activity in front of you while you are driving.  What kind surprised me is that it also recorded my conversation that I was having inside the car.If it is plugged in each time you start the car it starts to record.  It records a video for x amount of minutes then records another video for x amount of minutes.  Thus making it easier to find a particular spot during your drive versus having to go through one long video.The picture quality was quite good and I was pleasantly surprised.It mounted using the suction cup and never felt like it was going to come off.  Note- I did clean the inside windshield first.I have had this for awhile and I am still very pleased with it.
4,This camera does what it’s supposed to. I got it for on sale on PrimeDay. It started in our newer daily driver but I’ve moved it to our older other car and I’m currently looking for a better option for our newer car.
2,I live in a city where people drive like they got their driver's license out of a cereal box so I was pretty excited when I got this dash cam for Christmas. The camera quality is great for its small size and price. However I can't get the thing to stick to my front windshield for longer than 3 hours.  I've done everything possible to get it secure! I cleaned the window with alcohol and a lint-free cloth like the directions said. I even went out and bought double-sided Gorilla Glue tape to adhere it and it still didn't stick! Honestly  I can't even use this camera fully knowing that it'll drop to my car's floor while I'm driving. Also the battery life on this camera is very short. Without keeping it charged with the carport the camera shut off after 30 minutes of driving (I initially started with a full camera battery).
1,pictures cannot show clear plate #
5,I'm a student and I drive Uber as a part-time job so I a dashcam is a must. However I need a basic dashcam that doesn't break my little bank; and this dashcam is fantastic for anyone who only wants a simple but does the job.I was surprised by its quality given the price. The dashcam comes in well packaged and it has all the necessary accessories except a SD card (please do buy the Samsung Pro Endurance as recommended by Vantrue). I've been using the N1 Pro for three weeks now and so far it makes me feel more confident when I'm on the road.Footages are FHD quality at 30fps. License plates are visible at a relatively close distance (about two cars length) but license plate is unimportant as long as you can prove that the accident isn't your fault. There were days when the temperature was as high as 100F (even higher in my car when parked) but the dashcam was running fine. The mount is sturdy but this type of mount usually would become loose and lose its suction so I cannot comments on the mount's longevity yet. Hopefully it will last. One thing I like about this dashcam is that I can instantly review captured footage directly on the dashcam; this proves to be very convenient. Everything else is very simple just plug and play. It's one of the things that you can put it on and forget about it but this little thing can save lives. In this time and age where people are just looking for ways to make money out of others there's no reason to justify not having a dashcam.
4,I would give the product a 5 star but the first one I believe did not work correctly out of the box. It would only flash on or off when on battery. But when it failed completely after 6 months I sent an email to customer service they did a great job with replacing the old one very quickly. Received it in a few days and this one seems to work much better. I understand things fail and customer service was awesome to deal with
5,Up until now I've never felt compelled to write a review but I just had to say something about this "tiny" yet so robust little dash cam.Pros:- Video using standard settings is absolutely brilliant and clear in both daytime and nighttime.- Requires very few setting changes out of the box.- Extremely small camera easily amounts in front of rear view mirror for virtually invisible operation.- Modest amount of settings available are easy to understand- Once settings are established this is a turn on the ignition and go camera with nothing else to do.- Playback on a computer is easy and awesome to view.- Long cigarette charger cable makes it easy to mount the camera anywhere and have sufficient cord to snake the wire wherever needed.Cons:-  Dual use of both the OK and Power button makes navigation and selection in the settings menu hard to understand at first.  However over time you get used to their intended use.-  While not necessarily a con you do have to format the micro memory card once every 2 weeks to prolong its life.
4,the camera itself is great the design is smart as well having the port insert into the mount video quality is great easy to install but one thing is the mount itself loosen up in short 3 months. it is now about 6 months of using it the camera just swinging around every time I begin to break. Contacted support seems like they are willing to do something about it tho.
4,Good dash cam for the price. I researched on online reviews of many dash cam. This one seems to be a great value choice. I had it for one day now. Daytime video is in very good quality. Night video looks ok and is better than the samples of many other more expensive brands. I am considering to buy another one for my 2nd car.
4,I received this as a gift it's  a great camera good vision but the suction has  given up. It would be great to have an alternative maybe double adhesive sticker or different mount. This might be due to being in Arizona heat maybe ? but I have a different  Camara at the front. this specific one is placed in the back facing the back.
4,Ive been using this dash cam in my truck for 3 months and have only one complaint so far. The time and date stamp gets reset at times and idk what causes it. Cam have been stamping my videos at dates of last year with wrong month and day and i have to fix it after i notice untill it does it again. Good other wise
5,This little guy is amazing.  I had a Venture X1 and thought it was small but the N1 Pro makes it look like a DSLR camera.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase one of these especially for the price.I would mention that you definitely should charge the camera for 2-3 hours prior to setting it up just as the manual directs.  The camera battery needs to be charged to reliably retain settings you input.A couple of hopefully helpful tips: 1. Format the micro SD card in the camera. 2. I find it easier to just remove the camera and mount from my vehicle if I want to view recordings on my computer.  The camera fits very snugly onto the mount and it can be difficult to remove/mount it if the windshield mount is tucked up behind the rearview mirror like mine.3. I use one of those alcohol based cleaning wipes to clean both the windshield mounting area and the suction cup prior to mounting.Try one you'll like it!
5,I really like the camera and installation was pretty easy. The camera itself is quite compact and discreet and the video quality is good. Not a criticism of the camera because the manufacturer is upfront about this but as a heads up: it took a little bit to get it up and running because I used a 64GB card which required extra formatting if you have a 32 GB card it will work no problem.My biggest gripe (please see update below) with the camera was the mounting system suction cup. The camera lasted approx. 1 month on my windshield before the suction cup started to fail causing the camera to drop. After trying multiple solutions to improve the adherence of the suction cup to the glass I decided to wait until it cooled down and see if that helped. Even in cooler weather I still had issues getting it to mount so I was unable to use it.Edit 2/19: After my review I was contacted by customer service (shout out to Karen) and they offered to ship me an adhesive based mount as a replacement for the suction cup one free of charge. The install process was a breeze and so far over the last few weeks it has held up great.  Updated the rating from 3 to 5 stars at this time.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This nice for my car but it is really helpful in my RV when traveling as people pull out in front of you with 32 ft length RV plus a tow car. You just can't stop all that fast with the length and weight of everything. I usually am able to anticipate and slow down but sometimes they surprise and pull out at the last minute. Pretty unnerving and if I ever hit one the camera proof would be very helpful for the accident report. It also would help with our traffic circles for the drivers that can't stay in one lane. I added a video of someone cutting me off at a traffic circle. I'm glad I was staying back a ways or they would have cut right into my car.
4,Great camera update. I also have the old X1. This new N1 Pro is a bit smaller comes with the improved mounting (big issue on old camera).
3,Father’s Day gift
5,After a considerable amount to research the Vantrue N1 Pro stood out as being the car camera for me both on price and performance.  The camera is compact and full of useful features and records a perfectly acceptable wide screen  image. The camera arrives beautifully packed and is a quality item. I am at entry level concerning these cameras so I was a little apprehensive regarding installation  but once installed I soon had it up and running.  I must admit I found the manual that comes with the camera a little tricky to understand  but with the brilliant assistance from the online Vantrue Support Team I had no problem in quickly understanding all that the camera offers which is plenty but the most important thing this little gem of a camera offers is peace of mind.
5,I cannot believe how much more I got out of this little cam.  To put it simple terms its a durable and reliable son of a gun!  All of the features on it are very easy to use.  There is a tool where you can take pictures extremely helpful for the occasion you need it!  One thing that wasn't very clearly stated is that is has a built in battery for when you're not using it.  This means you get to use the parking mode!  The video and camera feed are amazing!  The angle is just perfect!  While I haven't had a need for the footage I know it will be reliable if I ever do need it!  If you're looking for a good dash cam this little guy is the best way to go!  If I ever have to buy another one it will be a Vantrue.
1,This dash cam is good until your internal battery dies.  It is not an easy battery replacement as you need to buy a special 3.7v battery for it.  You also need to have solder iron and skill to do it.  All of your videos will be recorded on the same date.  Not possible to find videos anymore so it becomes useless device.  I would suggest you stay away from this.
5,I haven't had this very long however I am very pleased with how it works. The picture quality is very crisp and you can see the details. Very pleased so far.
1,I purchased two of these cameras about a year ago. I recently got into an accident (we rear-ended another car). We were very disappointed to find out that even though the blue light was flashing and everything seemed fine all this time the camera did not record the event and has not been recording ANY VIDEO for months and the date/time had reset to 1/1/2016. I immediately went and checked my other dash can in our second car and the exact same thing was happening there!  Please note that we did purchase the memory card that Vantrue recommended to us (Samsung EVO 32GB).Even worse Vantrue does not respond to emails for technical support after repeated attempts to get assistance for this. Can NOT recommend this product!!
1,The wife bought this for me as she knew I was looking at cams on my account. So I gave her this one on my wish list and now I regret having done so.1. The cam will not run for more than 30 seconds and yes I have it powered on with the cord plugged into the socket. Finally had to do a reset to get it working right.2. The instruction manual is next to useless written as it is in broken English.3. The camera settings are all in Chinese when you first open up the menu and with the poorly written instruction book it is virtually impossible to go through the settings.4. Their help phone number is bogus. I received a message from a facebook posting whee I wrote them about no one answering the phone as I was told that there is a 12 hour difference. So this means that the time they have posted to make the call is when they are not available to answer. Explains why the disconnection each time I called looking for help.
5,this is my firdt dash cam so i cant really compare to others but for the price cant complaint first the quality of the material is has its weight so thats a good sign for the video i give a 4 dont expect a lastest phone camera when im driving cant really see lisence plates only when im stopped it you can clearly read them.now the picture quality its good you can see clearly i give it a 4 out 5...for the instalation it didnt came with manual but its easy to install just put it behind panels..trims etc that way you wont have cables around you and it came with a long cable thats a plus!
1,Literally just randomly stopped working… maybe the heat in the car messed it up? Either way sucks
5,I was looking for a camera with front and inside view cameras built in one body to avoid the hassle of setting up two different cameras separately. I also wanted the inside camera with infrared feature so that it is able to function during night time.After searching for a long time I found Vantrue N2 Pro which met my requirements.I have used it for about a week now with 256 GB micro SD card. I am loving the camera so far. The front  and inside video quality is great during day time and night time. The sound quality is also very good.
5,All the basic features you need and none of the complicated confusing features you don't. Great video quality. Easy set up and installation Very good value. Will order another for wife's car. Cheap insurance.
1,I was offered this product for free in exchange for a review. I let them know I only do honest reviews and they said "Sorry we only accept 5 star review". I honestly am not really interested as I have a shred of integrity. Maybe you would get 5 stars but you have to earn it!Beyond that this dashcam only does 30fps and has a clunky form factor. If you are looking at cheap cams take a look at the A119 dashcam it has a stealth form factor that looks better mounted on a dash and the picture quality is better and it does 60fps which is twice what this camera can do and it's about the same price. You may not care about frame rates that much but it makes a big difference in my opinion. So this is a hard pass.
5,Have used this brand of dash cameras before.  Very reliable IMO.  This newer model N1 is smaller and easier to setup.  Picture quality is very good with a wide angle view.
5,Great quality at a great price. It doesn’t take up the windshield. The suction cap holds well. The programming interface is easy to navigate. The camera remembers the date and time when shut off. My previous camera has trouble with remembering the date and time; I have to keep reprogramming it. I am serious considering buying a second N1 Pro for the rear view and use a splitter to connect both.
5,I just drove across the country. I loved the security of driving with the cam on the whole time. The fact that it supports 256GB of storage I have every minute of the drive recorded!
1,IDK what the point of this camera is? I understand the concept of the back-up cameras that have a camera on the rear bumper when you're reversing however IDK why anyone would want to record their own driving full time unless it's suppose to be something like having a Camera in your house but anyone stealing a car will usually wear something to cover their face then simply chuck the camera once in the car! Plus there's already OnStar LoJack ETC so unless it's just some Instagram Social media individual who posts their entire life online I think it's pointless! As far as the performance of the product I have no clue because I'd never buy one unless it was a reverse cam the simply helped you see behind while not straining your neck!
5,Good video quality very important safety tool! Highly recommended!
5,The way night vision is implemented in this camera is quite amazing.  The amount of detail the image sensor captures is quite nice even on country roads when the only light available on the road is the car's headlights.
5,This is a small powerful webcam that is very easy to set up. I did have to change my Samsung micro sd card to fat32 and it worked just fine. The manual and quick start guides were very helpful. Driving in Colorado is pretty treacherous so I feel safer having this webcam in my car and it was very reasonably priced.
5,The Dash cam is pretty good quality. Does everything i need from it. After 11 months of use it started giving me issues emailed their customer support about it and they were really helpful. Was told to reset it and try few other things as those did not work a Replacement Dash cam was send in exchange for the old one.
1,This is not entirely about the camera quality but more about the customer support from Vantrue. I have the original N1 dash camera and it's been working well but it no longer holds any battery charge which causes the date to reset every time I turn the car on. Because of this the loop recording doesn't work and the camera is effectively useless. So that's the bad aspect of the camera is that the battery is very weak. Vanture confirmed that the battery on N1Pro is the same weak one as before. Vantrue customer support does not want to help me with replacing the defective camera. Although their support was good in the past it seems like once enough time has passed after the purchase they are not going to help their past customers with defective cameras.
5,This is a very nice little camera. The first one I received had a software issue and would stop recording after about 2-3 hours of driving. They sent me a replacement and the new one works great. Picture quality is very good. The camera has a very high end feel to it. I had to turn down the g-sensor because it was protecting a lot of video's when I hit a pot hole since I have turned down the sensitivity everything is working better. Overall I would buy again.
5,Bought this directly from the seller but it's a good camera easy to set up and use and came with all the necessary cables.
5,Bought as a gift for daughter.  She is delighted with it said videos are very sharp and clear.  She loves it. This is the third dashcam i have purchased the second from Vantrue. Only a repeat buyer because X1 works so well. First one from different supplier absolutely no product support. Vantrue is great in this area also. Vantrue is great to buy from as they ship very fast have a great product and great support!
2,The video quality looks fine at first glance but you just cannot make out license plate numbers even if you get very close to the car ahead of you. That really just defeated one of main purposes of the dash cam. I will be returning this.
5,Exchanged a dashcam from a different manufacturer for the N1. Glad I did!!! Easy to use and small enough to be unobtrusive. Great picture quality!!
2,The camera/mount etc are all fine. Unfortunately the cigarette lighter plug/cable (12v plug to 10ft mini USB) failed as soon as I plugged it in (the spring/center contact fell inside the plug and shorted out the small circuit board). Thus the camera is a desktop model till I get a replacement...sigh.
1,I got into an accident. The Camara didn’t work. The memory was full of Older videos. My money was wasted for nothing.
5,Charging cable can amd should be better . And it didnt include a usb cable
5,Great gift. Good price
1,The directions are confusing and support email bounded back undeliverable.
5,Great product!  First dashcam everything I expected.  Continuous recording rollover and long duration w/sdcard.
5,Great product
1,mount designed for failure:1. will not stick to glass for more than 60 sec. not close to adequate. going out to get some glue.2. well won't mount windshield lets set on dash. good idea but it won't work. mount will not swivel 360 degrees and does not allow adequate adjustment up/down to see road. adding to poor design the mount can't be replaced as power enters thru it. poor design poor design poor design.other than that nice camera easy to set up feels like quality product. personally would not waste time on this as there are too many decent products available at similar price point.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Soo impress how so small this dash camera is yet so clear of the video was taken. I couldnt be any happy with the shots we got for this weekends get away. I have chosen a small clip to show everyone!!  Glad i made the right descision to chose this dash cam.
5,Hello Amazon Crew!  Today I must say this deal was quite nice for the price!  This deal represented a vast improvement over the Russian made device which has since been obsoleted.  Seek highr standards!  Again and again will prove it's self evident.
1,I hate to write a bad review all I can say if you dont install an extra battery in your car or hard wire the dash camera it does not going to work it last about 15 minutes and it shuts off. Battery life needs to be improved.
5,So far so good! Have been using it for three months and everything seems to be great.
5,Good Product
3,The screen is too small you can barely make it out. I have to get a MAGNIFYING CLASS. TOO SMALL...
4,Product works as advertised. Screen is a bit small to see quell from the driver’s seat of my F-150. Quality of the video stored on the microSD card is excellent.
4,Programming is very easy. System hangs easy also.
5,So far so good. Easy to set up. Super small and easy to use.
5,El producto es muy bueno la calidad es buena muy pequeño la instalación es para novatos (osea que no es difícil) la calidad de grabación  es buena el sonido es bueno...solo le falta tener una app para bajar las fotos o videos y seria perfecto...saludos a mi papá  a mi mamá y a todos los que me están leyendo. 🤪🤪🤪🤪
5,Nice small camera with a great picture!
5,I love the daytime quality. I love the nighttime video quality even more. Very satisfied with the results. I picked up the N1 pro on Black Friday and i have already recommended this brand to several friends. Buy it you wont regret It
5,Did a lot of research trying to find the best most affordable dash cam. Took me an hour or so and I finally stumbled on this one. Liked the reviews and watched a few videos people had uploaded and liked the quality so I thought I'd give it a try. You also can't beat the price! Arrived on time and was nicely packaged. Simple instructions on how to set it up. Plugged it in and charged it for two hours inside. Forgot they don't provide a microSD card so I had to go get one of those. Got myself a 128GB one. When it was charged I plugged in the microSD card. Please read the instructions regarding this as you have to "format" the dash cam if your SD card is over 8GB. Was finally able to use it today and I have to say the picture quality is beyond my expectations. At night it's not the best but also not the worst and for the price it's honestly just what I expected. Do yourself a favor and get this dash cam!PS. If you ever run into issues the instructions are beautifully done and any answer you have can be found in there.
5,This is the second one I purchased.  I travel weekly and once I leave the car rental at the airport I use it for the rental.  The video is easy to remove from the SD Card and transfer it to my laptop. It’s small and compact but has good resolution.
4,This was a gift and was appreciated and is liked.  Was a little hard to set up.
5,Nice camera what else can I say?
5,This dash cam is a great buy for the money it may not have all of the bells and whistles of the more expensive units but it does what a dash cam is supposed to do.
5,Bought this for my wife’s car. She commutes long distances to work and is constantly commenting on the crazy drivers so I bought this as a safety measure (in the event there was ever a disastrous event she would have evidence for the insurance company).
5,Recommend
5,I bought a couple other dashcams along with the N1 Pro. I returned the others after deciding that the Vantrue is the better one. I had the cable professionally installed and the camera mounts easily with a suction cup. The video resolution is excellent but I wish the single shot photos were of higher resolution. Other than that I am happy with the purchase and recommend it.
5,when put the card in my computer i could not believe how clear the picture was. buy the good one they rec.
5,Camera quality isn’t perfect but good enough to read a listens plate if need be it’s not super expensive so don’t expect super expensive quality but it gets the job done
2,The camera is the best that I have purchased (3 other models didn’t last).  The menu is easy to use and quality is superb.  The issue is with the manufacturer.  They had a promotion to register and they would send the gps tracker free.  That did NOT happen the webpage would not allow me to register or to receive my gps.  So I use it without the gps.  I would have given 5 stars if they had followed through with he offer.  Shame on empty promises.....
5,Awesome product! Awesome customer Service! Great experience! Satisfied and very happy!!!
5,I purchase this not knowing that I didn’t want to bother with cigarette lighter plug. Vantrue sells a hardwire kit that conveniently has an add on circuit for any fuse type your car has. Super easy to tuck the wires under the weather stripping and down to the kick plate where the fuses are located. If you are brave you can get a more professional install by removing a few more panels along the pillar so there is no risk of wires getting in front of the airbags. Overall good value for the price.
5,it would be better if the case is metal
5,This little camera is a wonderful starter camera for the price if the reason you are buying it for making videos.If it is just for security you need nothing more.Good value!
5,use it everyday
5,N1 Pro is a great budget dash cam. It certainly beats its competition in the $100 range. It records the license plates with good detail and colors are natural looking. Another good thing is the audio recording quality it sounds amazing.This is my first ever dash cam and I’m really happy with this purchase.
5,I got a very cheap dash cam for my daughter - all kinds of problems...need an app...only likes particular smart cards...Really a pain in the chops.  Decided to pay a bit mroe and get one with decent reviews.  The big brother of this camera has a rear camera also (for taxi drivers I guess) but I didn't need that so I saved a few bucks.  Camera works well and comes with a long cord that I was able to easily route.  Picture is super clear.
5,Good. I like it. I recommend it for the price and quality!
5,Me gusta que grava muy clarito me gusto mucho la recomiendo
5,Good product for the dollar amount. Only concern is turning it off once your done using
5,5 star vary good
5,I love my new dash cam. The picture quality is nice and the sound is very good too.
5,Executive Summary: A very good dashcam for this price point. Other than some potential annoyances with the mount once you get past that you’ll enjoy a very capable unit. I’m rating it 5 stars not because it’s a 5-star camera but because it’s a 5-star camera AT THIS PRICE. I have similarly priced units that don’t perform nearly as well and the ones I have that do cost way more.Intro: I happened to be in the market for an “inexpensive but reasonably well-featured” dashcam for my son’s new job as a long-haul trucker so timing was good. But mounting in a truck comes with certain challenges that may not apply to the average car-driver making this a pretty decent test. My own vehicle has a high-end camera that cost about 7x the price of this and in many ways this meets nearly the same standards just missing some expensive functionality.In the box: The camera the suction-based mounting bracket a USB cable a cigarette plug power cable and a small instruction manual. Note that there’s only the one mounting bracket (more on that below).Installing: So I’ve always had bad luck when it comes to suction-based mounts. Despite all the various “tricks” they never work well or for long. Inevitably I always end up using the hard mount if provided or fabricating something. Here we find the one weakness of this camera the mount. It’s a custom mount that can’t be dismantled. The suction cup is small and (pretty much as expected) didn’t work well. The other problem is that in many US states (I’m in Canada but the truck would be going south of the border often) it’s illegal to stick things to the windshield. The exact laws vary but the basic policy of many trucking companies is “nothing stuck to the windshield”. In the end I had to do some fabrication to get it mounted where we wanted it (top console hard-mounted). Luckily I have a lot of experience with this but an average person might have challenges and end up resorting to various adhesives.The camera itself slides into the mount and it’s a tight fit but easy to remove if theft is a concern.That’s the bad part (and not all that bad in the grand scheme of things). But one big plus is that the power cable is extra-long. Like way long enough to run across the top down the side and leisurely though the dash to the cigarette plug with wire to spare. It’s a standard USB on the camera end so you can use other cabling options if desired. I’ve seen many dashcams including much more expensive ones that come with a measly 3ft cable which is just dumb.Also in the box was a separate micro-USB cable to plug into the camera for file transfer and it was also very generous in length. You could plug that cable into the camera to download videos without having to remove it from the mount.Note that this comes with no microSD card so you’ll need to get one. It’s always recommended to get a good one preferably an MLC-rated card specifically for dashcam use. I used a spare MLC-rated 64Gig card for testing but the camera will take up to a 256Gig card (which is very rare in this space). Personally for day-to-day use I wouldn’t go smaller than a 128Gig and probably a Samsung Evo+ or one of the newer cards specifically for this use like the Pro Endurance line. The smaller the card the quicker it’ll fill up and start erasing old recordings. My 64Gig lasted a bit less than 24 hours of combined normal/parking (remember this was in a truck driving 10 hours a day).If you go cheap on the microSD expect to run into problems eventually (file corruption lost recordings etc.). This advice applies to all dashcams not just this one. In my experience many dashcam complaints stem from dying microSD cards.Operation: The LCD screen is pretty small. It’s really only useful for aiming and running through the menus. You don’t want to try to review videos on that. But that’s pretty typical for this type of camera and isn’t a negative. The menus are pretty straightforward and the options clear. A couple of the options are not well documented and you’ll likely play with a few settings to figure them out.If you enable the parking mode (which is a significant feature of this camera at this price point) then it uses an algorithm that I surmised was based on how much of the overall screen area was “moving” to determine whether the entire vehicle was moving (this putting it back in normal recording). Sounds complicated but for the non-nerds in the audience it just works. Seemed to record normal when moving parking when not. After the first week I turned off parking mode but left the G-sensor on to record “impact” events. In a big truck slamming the door triggered an “impact” and recorded accordingly. This was as-expected and it worked fine. You can adjust sensitivity.The manual is a bit confusing as far as “protecting” recordings or taking still pictures. It’s all based on the “mode button” on the top but the manual wording is confusing. In fact while we managed to capture a couple of still photos we’re still not entirely sure how. For protecting a video (the more common requirement) the manual says to push the button while it’s recording. That’s not entirely all of it though. If the display is off (which it normally should be) the first tap of the button restores the display but doesn’t protect the video. A second tap while the display is on protects that recording (only that one not before/after which would be my preference). A tiny icon (not really visible when you’re driving) shows the lock but I’d have preferred some sort of sound notification. You shouldn’t be looking at the camera while driving to see what it’s doing.Video quality: The camera has a good-quality 1080p sensor that records at the typical 30fps. The videos generated were of very good quality. On playback with a bit of squinting it was quite possible to make out license plate numbers of close vehicles. Especially for this price point the quality of the video produced was high and I can’t imagine anybody complaining about that.The other plus is the wide field of view (160° according to the specs). In the truck this covered well off to both sides and with the hood mirrors the videos captured overtaking vehicles on both sides.There was some reflection from the windshield mostly in the corners but only the higher-end dashcams costing hundreds more support polarizing filters so no points off for this.The “night vision” is pretty good especially at this price point. But people do need to set their expectations appropriately. These things aren’t going to “see in the dark” and there’s no IR lighting or anything (which wouldn’t work behind a windshield anyway). One downside to “night vision” is that if for example you’re behind a vehicle with brighter license plate lights it’ll wash out the plate and make it unreadable.Viewing: I usually just pop out the microSD and stick it in my PC to copy the folders. Or use the supplied USB cable to connect to a separate machine where it shows up as a standard USB drive but only USB2 so copying will be slow. The camera also has a built-in mini-HDMI port. I don’t happen to have a proper cable so I haven’t tried that out yet. But that’d be handy to plug the camera into an HDMI monitor or TV for quick viewing on the “big screen”.Epilogue: I may yet order the separate GPS unit (I’m watching for a sale). While some may complain that it sucks the GPS isn’t included the reality is if they’d done that the price would be higher causing complaints from those who don’t need the GPS. And while there’s a Viewer app that would support the GPS the Windows one seems to be broken (scripting errors from Google Maps and it doesn’t actually seem to play recordings).
5,A dash cam is needed protection these days. It is the baleful eye of truth. This one is satisfyingly tiny producing very little intrusion into the driver's field of view  — although there is some; on my car it could not be mounted high enough to be fully hidden behind the rear view mirror because the GPS mount pokes upward when it's rotated to secure the suction cup. You have to leave room for that below the windshield header so the camera ends up slightly lower than the mirror. If you're short like me you see it but only just.Yet seeing a bit of the camera is a small compromise of neatness in exchange for the security of having this thing on guard in case you ever have to prove who did what what color the light was etc. It produces amazingly clear crisp videos with a very good full-width view. The GPS mount which is just $30 extra is essential I'd say – with the GPS option video clips display the vehicle speed to help police evaluate any eye-witless accounts of whatever transpired should the need arise.Note: The supplied power cable is just 10 feet long. That's plenty if you're going to run it along the header down behind the A-pillar under the dash and then have it emerge from under there and stay in view plugged into a front-facing 12 volt socket. But I wanted the wire to just vanish completely so I kept it running out of sight past the shotgun seat and into the centre console compartment where there's another 12V socket. For that 10 feet was just exactly enough in my car. For some vehicles a pathway like that might require a longer cable so it's a good idea to measure your planned cable path before ordering one of these gizmos. Other than that no worries at all. Setup is intuitive and the documentation is pretty clear despite some odd language caused by inexpert translation from the original Chinese. I cannot speak to the device's long-term durability but it seems solid and hefty and I found no fault with it right out of the box.
5,I like everything about this dash cam. It was delivered within 2 days and I used it for the first time yesterday.Two things I need to figure out is why it plays on fast forward when I view from my laptop. I tried to view in slow mode (turtle) but it still played in fast forward. Probably just one setting away from figuring this out. Maybe it is the Transcend High Endurance 32GB Class 10 SD card I am using in it.Also maybe there is a trick to removing the camera from the mount but I couldn't after it is on. I was hoping to remove the camera easily when I parked it for a long time instead it leaves me with removing the whole mount with camera. Not a show stopper. I will contact Vantrue if I can't figure this out. They seem really receptive to assisting.Packaging is great! Manual is an easy read it stays suctioned to the windshield. I ensured to clean the windshield prior to mounting the dash cam to it.Overall excellent dash cam and though only one day using it I have no doubt it will be good to have on the dash.
5,This is my second Vantrue dash cam and once again they didn't disappoint. I have the N2 Pro (great camera) in my car and got this one for my wife's car as it was smaller and hopefully less visible to her. I haven't installed it yet in her car but tried it in mine today it was super easy to set up as I used the mount that was already in my car for the N2 Pro. *It is nice when a company uses the same equipment for newer models. Vantrue says that a 256gb sd card will work but using a 64gb is plenty of space for me. In the first road test which was over an hour the camera recorded all but 3 clips in protected mode. I have now adjusted the G Sensor sensitivity to Low and hopefully this reduces the amount of protected recordings.  Now that I have tried and liked the N1 Pro and N2 Pro I will be buying the GPS mount and hardwire kit for both. *Edit: I have changed my review to 5 stars as after adjusting the G Sensor sensitivity to Low there is next to no false protected recordings.
5,This is definitely smallest dashcam I've seen. The build quality is really nice and it has it's own propietary connector that attachs to the holder/suction cup. Extremely easy to install video quality is good and still testing it with a 32GB SDCard. I've hard wired the camera to my fuse box and it starts to rerecord automatically when the car turns on. The camera turn off automatically once the car is turned off.So far I have not experienced any issues with this camera.  It would be nice if the GPS unit was included in the package.
5,I had a few dash-cams before. Vantrue is the best so far. The delivery in Canada was fast. User manual is detailed well written and easy to follow. There is also a quick-start guide included. Vantrue website was helpful for warranty extension and for additional resources. Initial setup and installation went smooth. I like that this camera can be charged from more than one source. The price is excellent for such a good product. Dash-cams from other manufacturers in this price range do not have the GPS functions such as speed and location tracking. I am highly recommending this product.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Compact design. Easy installation. The extra cable to connect to computer is very handy.No need to remove the sd card and put it to computer.  No sound recording though!!!Night vision and day recording is satisfying. Comes with long flexible cable to install . The car in the video is Nissan Pathfinder.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 30s video = 900k words? Included a short video to show the unexpectedly good quality from such a small camera during rain and night time. License plates could be read from the video. It was easy to setup. I didn't even have to read the instruction book. 32GB memory card stores around 4 hours of looped video.
5,The set up was easy with the instructions provided. The picture is clear in the daytime have not been out at night yet so not sure how picture will be at night.
5,Just bought this dashcam and very happy with the product. Very user friendly and so easy ti use. The pictures and videos are up to my expectations. This is a very good product for such a good price. Would be a great gift to offer. Overhaul I have no problems recommending this dashcam.
5,Wide angle clear picture but still hard to see some licence plates
5,Did alot of virtual comparing of cams in this price point and this one is top of the pack. Very good product.
5,Excellent product with this price
5,Vantrue is a fantastic product line. I have this one in my rear window and the N2pro dual cam in front. They are both incredible cams that do exactly what they should. I almost never touch them but whenever I see anything on the road It gets captured without fail. I suggest also ordering the install kit so that they stay on all the time with the motion sensor active. It's an awesome piece of mind when leaving your ride in a parking lot or in public places knowing that if anyone was to ever damage your car is sure to provide valuable evidence. Also doesn't hurt to have that extra line of video monitoring parked in the driveway. I actually like to park in such a way that I capture anyone approaching on the dash cam. These days you just never know who's going to show up. I've actually seen more wildlife than anything lol. Mostly deer and raccoons.Thanks again Amazon!
4,Very good product. Because of this camera I already saved a lot of money when a guy drove back into my car while I was parked. I just checked the video an called the insurance company and because if the footage they could find the driver and he had to pay it.Worth every dólar.
1,This is definitely not a 1080p camera. I bought this to replace my old 720p camera and the picture quality on the old one was way better. You can't read license plates unless you are very close but I had no problem on my 720p cam. If they didn't overstate the claims it would be OK for the moneyPROS+ not very expensive+ easy to use menu and LCD+ wide angle captures a lotCONS- picture quality is terrible and not 1080p- parking mode doesn't work well and sensitivity settings don't help- slow response time from sellerI don't recommend this camera. There are way better units out there at this price point as the video quality on this unit just isn't where it should be.
5,I was surprised at how small the camera actually was when it came in despite being aware of the dimensions before buying but I was blown away by the quality and ease of use especially because I ended up needing it within the first week of getting it. The resolution even at night is excellent as is its ability to basically capture the full aspect of the road in front of you. Really very impressed with the performance and have had no issues whatsoever after over two months of continued usage now. Very highly recommended especially for the unbeatable price.
2,This product has excellent picture quality both daytime and nighttime. All the features are great like loop recording g sensor etcBut the worst part is its adhesive holder. The suction cup is poor and fell down a 100 times; many times during driving and at other times hurting the co passenger.If your dash cam falls down suddenly during it really jeopardizes safety.  They have to do better on the suction cup.
5,This is my first dashcam.  I read a lot of positive reviews on this unit and my expectations were met.  It looks like a well-built unit and the installation and setup went smoothly.  I decided to use the accessory power cable provided so I can't use or test the park function.  If you want that function you will need to buy a cable kit that converts the power and limits the time the cam loads and drains the battery.I tucked the cable out of sight along the headliner and door moldings.  Setup was quick and I downloaded the viewing app on my WIN 10 computer to view the videos.  I bought the Vantrue GPS mount for this unit so I can see the map and route display with the videos.  The only thing in the setup process that made me stop and think was the "frequency" setting. It is 60 Hz for North America.
4,It’s small which is great however it also makes the screen small at this size. I found it a little finicky to set up but not so bad that I wouldn’t recommend it. I bought the GPS mount so by the time you have paid for both I feel there are likely better options in that price point considering you have to purchase 2 items to get speed and GPS locations. Only got it yesterday and have used it on a trip today. I accidentally set it to time lapse however the images are put together to make a video rather than loads of pictures. It worked well. Will be testing it’s video recording tomorrow on video. Looked at the video on my laptop and I would say the video was pretty good. All in all it is just about worth the money even though it feels cheap.
1,I am disappointed not because of camera itself but the wire that came with camera  has wrong pin camera it self has mini port to connect and wire accessory they shipped is old thick pin which doesn't support the camera. What a shame !!! Such a careless mistake and customer disappointment. This is the reason I will return the camera
2,i almost got into an accident and when i got home i was looking at footage the camera never recorded it an hour drive and it only recorded 15 mins in total of it i checked previous days and it never records the full drive im not sure why but i thought that was its job also alot of 10 sec recorded videos while driving im not sure why overall quality is good but reliability not so much im very disappointed
3,If you want a camera that works good for recording night and day this is it.ConsIt stops recording when memory card full. Even tho it's to start recording over old filesYou have to push the reset button to get it restart itself and then format the card each time the card is full.The battery life is just broken. It cant even hold the current dateYou have to set the date everytime the battery dies.If you can get past these cons then the camera is for you
1,Stopped working after very little use. Absolutely do not buy this product. Unfortunately I’m unlikely to get any support because I bought it awhile ago and only somewhat recently hooked it up. It worked fine at first and just stopped working for no reason (doesn’t seem to hold power).
5,I use car shares in Vancouver BC and I wanted a dash cam for this purpose. The N1 Pro fits the bill perfectly at a great price.It comes with a suction mount - perfect for car shares - and includes a 12v plug to power the camera and the plug also has a usb port to charge my phone. Great! The mount does rattle a bit and it's recorded in the footage but it's a minor matter.The camera itself works great. Plug it in and it automatically records and there's a loop mode to overwrite old footage.The recorded footage is alright. Don't expect to catch fine details like number plates on far/fast moving cars. Exposure is generally quite good and the colours in the evening are deliciously saturated.Critiques:- The user interface of the camera is not well thought out. However a quick read of the manual sorts it out quickly! For example you press the OK button to start/stop recording not the button on the top of the camera that looks like a shutter release on a regular camera. The power button also serves dual duty - one to turn the camera on/off as well as to enter the camera's settings when not in recording mode.- Exposure Compensation is only in discrete stops. It would be nice to have EV compensation in 1/3 stops even half a stop would be great!
5,the item came a month before the date it was supposed to.it's so well packaged that you can feel the quality by the packaging and the camera fell so much better than the other cam I got before.it feel solid and well made. the button are not shaky and react well.and even tough she is tinny it doesn't feel like it will broke in your hands like all the other cheap cam I got before.the cam setting and the instruction are well made and are easy to understand the Micro-SD card fit well.and the images quality is good.. I doubt you can get a better one for the price
5,This little dashcam exceeded my expectation.  Sharp clear images in day and night and it comes with everything you need (other than the memory card) to get you going. (Vantrue please post a photo of "what's in the box" so people really know what they are getting.  My only wish list would be to have the suction cup mount and swivel have more rotation range. It would be nice to fully turn the camera and aim it wherever the action is.  Vantrue customer service is also top notch! They took care of everything and did it with a virtual smile :-). I ordered 2 more for family members.  Thanks Vantrue!
5,After my brother got into an accident that was not his fault I decided to get a dashcam and settled on this one for the price.  I don't use the motion detection since at work I face a major roadway and at home I park in a garage.  Picture quality is great at night there is some blooming from lights which was expected.  I am very happy with this dashcam.
4,Functional dashcam for the price.  The picture quality is not the absolute greatest.  You will be able to see license numbers when the car is very close to you and stationary but if moving and ~5 to 10 meters away you'd have to do some guessing. Overall I did not expect this to be an HD camera and just needed it to record events rather than read plates it fills my needs well for a good price.
5,I was looking for a dashcam and this one hits all the right boxes. Small and unintrusive great resolution good clear colour with very good contrast. Has protected mode and G sensor. Excellent FOV. Takes a micro SD up to 256gigs but have a 32 gig card which is good enough. The suction cup works fine. The small fiddly card takes a firm push to get it into the slot though not a big deal. I think this is the best bang-for-your-buck dashcam available.
5,This product is understated for its price. Night video quality is decent. It switches on with the ignition of the vehicle & due to its small footprint sits in disguise behind internal rear view mirror. Cable supplied is long enough and of good quality.There can be 2 scope of improvements; Memory card needs to be FAT32 formatted before use else camera does noy recognize the memory card and keeps giving error. Windows 10 onwards you cannot format a any storage device into FAT32 file format and this is an issue. I had to find an online software install & format the card. I hope in future upgrades camera is able to recognize newer file formats.Second issue this still has a battery inside & moreover i don't think so it can be replaced anyhow if required. So basically in extreme temperatures camera might not switch on(product mentions a safe range of negative temperature until which will function as usual). Also towards end of battery life cycle camera might stop working it could be 1 / 2 / 3 years i am not sure.
4,Over all I am pleased with the Vantrue N1 Pro Mini 1080P Dash Cam  and its advertised functions. I especially like it's tiny size.  It took a bit of experimenting to get the various settings that worked best for my satisfaction and requirements.  I would imagine that in the near future there will be a blue tooth camera that eliminates the long power cable. On some vehicles one can hide all the wires; however on my car a 2019 Hyundai Kona  I can tuck about 60% of the power cord out of site. The rest is rolled up and sits on the console.  The clarity is great with one feature that is not as advertised (below). Overall I am satisfied with the little desk cam.The cons:  There are only two items that caused me to give the camera a 4-5 was the supposed being able  to read a licence plate number.  If the my vehicle is parked and vehicle is driving by the numbers on the licence plate is blurred.  This goes for road signs when traveling more than 30 Mph/50 Kmh as well .  The camera's night vision with street lighting is far better than my past Garmin; however.  When traveling at night on a highway the camera losses my five rating.  I doubt if even a $500.00 desk cam would be able to give night vision that would be acceptable.
4,It is as advertised - the mount is sturdy the power cables are long enough to route around the edges of the windscreen (without it dangling near the center console) and the cam is small enough to not obstruct driver's view when mounted near the rearview mirror.My only gripe has been that for cars that don't have an automatic power cut from the Cigarette lighter 12v socket it would be nice to have an auto-off timeout feature should nothing happen say for about 10 minutes.
5,Have not had to look at the video quality for night time (knock on wood) but the video for daytime is good. My favorite thing about this dashcam is the size. The annoying thing about this dashcam (possibly others as I have not tested many) is the motion detection. Every time you shut the door it records / locks that clip. Although deleting the files is pretty easy.
5,I used a 16G micro SD card made in China to test and so far it has worked flawlessly.Well packed with clear instructions easy to use menu on camera. Sharp clear 1080p video.The product description says:"Please DON'T use Sandisk Card and Transend Card. We recommend to use Vanture Micro SD card." That is BS. My Sandisk micro SD card works just fine.
1,I couldn't use it because the car charger didn't work. Contacted Vantrue talked to them ones and... that was it. They did nothing so I returned it.Note: I'm not saying the dashcam is not good or the quality is not good etc.
5,I bought this dashcam a couple of days ago and got the chance to use it during night and day.It's a good dashcam in it's price point. You can read the plates number during day and also decent during night. The HDR capabilities are quite OK.Being black it's not that visible to the people being discreet.Also it's quiet and I haven't had any issues with it in terms of loosing any records. The motion sensor is very prompt and helpful
5,Amazing dashcam. Very discreet hidden right behind the rear view mirror. Video quality is truly one of the best. Easy to setup and use. Video looks vividly clear on a big screen tv. I haven’t use the motion detection yet though but everything else works great. Would definitely recommend buying this dashcam. Great item and great customer service.
5,I've been using this dash cam for over a year now. It works great. Set up was easy. After that it requires no extra attention or care unless if something goes wrong. While the suction cup is quite strong it has fallen off the windshield when there is lots of movement. When it happened a week ago then the connector came off of the charging cable. However I emailed Vantrue to let them know about the issue and they offered to send me a new cable. I'm very happy with their great service. I would definitely recommend this product and company.
5,Just got it - looks great so far.But is there a confusion in the manual - taking picture/recording event?4.5. Event recording - ... when the camera is recording press the Mode Button....4.8. Capture a picture -  When the camera is recording videos press the Mode button to take a photo in 2 million pexels.So how to take a pic and/or to lock an important footage? Should be different operations right? Described as identical.UPD: The customer service responded promptly kudos to them: yes same button makes photo and preserves the footage at once. So all is great. What I else noticed the cam too often records a footage as a event - a key icon appears and it preserves a footage. I guess indeed the G-Sensor is too sensitive. I have switched it to LOW will see how it works.
5,Exellent dash cam for the price point ( I got $20 amazon discount as well). Both day and night video 1080p quality is good. Some of the other things I like about it:-256gb card compatible-comes with suction mount (not sticky tapes)-small size-decent audio recordingSome nice to haves would be:- Android or iOS app- WiFi / hotspot for easy video downloadOverall very happy with my purchase!
5,This dashcam is unobtrusive and it keeps working just fine: turns on keeps recording turns off.  All I wanted was the basic loop recording functionality and I get everything that I needed and expected.  The video quality is very good indeed.  Great performance to price ratio.  Haven't tested the extended features since I never needed them as of yet.  Also haven't examined any nighttime recordings yet.
2,Vantrue N1 pro stopped charging and recording after car being parked outside for 1 hour.Temperature was -15.Camera is useless now.Good product until it was parked outside for 1 hour.Also hard to attach to dash mount
5,I wasn't expecting id get something this great at this price point. Is already paid for itself and the options are all there to customize it to record exactly how you want to record.Vantrue has made me a believer in dashcams with how great this unit is
4,After having used the camera for soon half a year these are my thoughts and experience.The video quality is good absolutely no complaints there. Of course because of the wide angle lens the video has fisheye distortion. The camera interface is reasonably good. The menus are easy to navigate but the function of the buttons and mostly how they are labeled is somewhat confusing - read the manual!The original camera did develop a problem of the battery not holding a charge and settings being lost. After some back-and-forth with the VanTrue technical support they shipped me a replacement camera which I appreciate.All in all a good camera which I can happily recommend assuming my issue with the original camera was a one-off.
5,This camera is still holding up awesome excellent video quality. Small from factor as to not obstruct your view while driving. Customer service is awesome! Had an issue with the mount and they corrected it right away.
5,I just received the dash cam a few days ago and was loving it. The resolution is very good and easy to setup. However the instruction booklet is a bit confusing. The SD card was shown on the booklet is upset down as the flat part suppose to face upwards and the chipped side face down but maybe it can install both ways.Another minor issue is that the charger port for the adapter is on the left side when it is locked on to the windshield. I think making the port on the right side would be easiler for the wire setup since it the wire goes throught the passenger side and down to the charger.Overall the product is easy to use with really high definition. Would definity recommand it.
5,I really enjoyed my Vantrue N2 dash cam but I needed to replace it as it was no longer working properly. I saw the N1 Pro was on sale for Cyber Monday and did not hesitate to buy! I really enjoy the Vantrue dash cams and will recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable yet packs great performance!
5,I can not believe the picture quality of this dash cam for the price.  I would highly recommend it compared to the garbage ones I’ve bought before for the fraction of the price
5,Purchased this dashcam after returning apex cam dashcam.I didnot like the video quality of apex cam so took the decision to purchase vantrue. A lot of people recommended me Ventrue so purchased one. I am very happy with the video quality of the dashcam. It comes with a very good quality mout. The camera is really small and of good quality. Anyone who is considering to guy a dashcam within 50$-100$ range should purchase this dashcam.
1,I got this for my dad for Christmas and it's garbage. It will start recording in the truck but randomly with just stop recording after a little bit. Pretty disappointed wasting my money and time trying to figure out why it was stopping.
1,As card is a 128 and the instructions say 64 fb max how do you format a 128 fb card After running this camera I'm very unimpressed it automatically goes into lock mode and today it won't stay on it keeps shutting down
5,The installation of the dashcam is quite easy the key part probably is how to hide the wire into the car.As for the footage quality I feel like is useful but not enough cause this is 1080p dashcam and the plate number only visible when the front car is in the 5m range. I attached the captured image for you guys to reference but for me a 1080p dashcam is worth for this quality.
5,The first thing I noted and liked was the small size of the camera which will not obstruct your field of vision when mounted up by the rear view mirror on the passenger side of the car.  The second thing is the easy access to the large buttons to change settings on the back of the camera.  The mount (not a GPS mount) with the camera is very adjustable to swivel the camera in the direction you want.  You can get the dash cam level easily if it is mounted slightly to one side or the other.  The 1080p recording is bright in low light conditions or the rain.  You can record in 720 resolution as well which will give you more recording time on the microSD card - don't know how much time in total as I have only recorded in 1080p.  These are my initial impressions after it's first use.
3,Battery power very questionable only 1 year in battery have problem holding charge only able to run without power for 5 mins.Suction failed during hot days every time during summer I'd have to reattach it.
4,I'm a trucker and I have it on all the time. I bought a 128GB card with it and it seems to be sufficient. The video quality is excellent as is the night video. As per the review I read which convinced me to get this... I wish the time was embedded from the GPS and not user set. (this has legal issues)..  I also wish some of the documentation was better explained.. I had to experiment with the G setting to figure out where to set it. Because of the roads I drive I seem to end up with files in the PROTECTED folder a lot and have to clear it out periodically.
5,great product for the price! Has many different features that are well explained in the manual. Wiring will be too short if your 12 volt plug-in is in your center console (it was for me anyways) but will be perfect if it's below/around your stereo.battery lasts about an hour without a power source.
4,I bought this back in June and I had no problems with it. It's small and does not obstruct my view. However after a couple of months the suction part of the camera stopped functioning properly. I went inside my car once and the camera had fallen. Of course I put it back on but noticed it happening a lot more often now the suction cup thing does not hold on anymore. Is there anyone I can contact to get another one?
5,It's my first dash cam and i don't regret it.It's really small so it's not blocking the viewThe setup is easy to doIt would be nice if you could easily add a polarize filter in front of the camera because in my car the dash is reflecting on the windshield.  I use polarize sunglasses so i don't normally see it but the camera do see it.  I did some tests with a polarize filter and it's working fine i just need to find a way to fix that filter on the camera.
5,I purchased this about 6 months ago on sale and I'm very glad I did. This is the first dash cam I've owned so I don't have anything to compare this to but I was in a minor crash recently and this captured the whole incident without a hitch. It happened during the day in good weather so it was optimal conditions for capturing video and I'm able to read the license plate of the other vehicle even though it was coming in at an angle. It's not perfectly crisp but I can clearly distinguish what the characters on the plate are which I think is as much detail as I'll ever need.
5,Very user friendly. Mounts easily behind the rear view mirror. Nice wide angle view. I like the sound recording so I can read plate numbers in case they aren't in focus.Now when you tell your friends about that ten point buck you nearly hit you can prove it. LOL
4,The quality and sharp video in day light is much appreciated But the night vision needs improvement.The license plate right in front of you is over exposed can't make out the license plate. The license plate on your left and right lane is clear and with the right exposure that you can read the license plate. But overall the street and shop is clear and you can make out what it is.Don't know if anything in the setting that I can adjust to make the license plate in front of your car in night vision more readable.
4,This camera looks great and the video quality is excellent. It has some great features and is easy to install and operate. My only real complaint is that the mount does not allow the camera to swivel 360 degrees. I was hoping it would swivel far enough to view the driver and passenger windows when needed. But unfortunately it does not swivel any further than my side view mirrors.
5,This is a little but great quality dash cam at a very affordable price.  As soon as you plug it into your cigarette lighter and start your engine it stays on automatically.  The suction cup on the holder stays securely on your windshield as well.  I tried it both in hot temperatures and rainy cooler days.  The quality of the video is excellent.  I would highly recommend this dash cam as it will provide  evidence in case of an accident.  This dash cam easily competes with the higher priced models out there.  After using one you will not want to drive without it.
4,This is a great dash cam! The image quality is really great considering the size of the camera. What I like the most is that you don't need to worry for the camera to start recording and stop recording because it is done automatically when you start the engine of the car and when you turn it off. The thing I don't like is that it makes a lot of clips because the longuest clip you can make is 5 minutes long so it works in a loop and start a new clip every time but it is really not a deal breaker.
5,I have purchased a dozen cameras and hard-wire kits for my fleet. The video quality is excellent. No issues with the mounting system as reviewed by others. Installation was easy and took about 20 minutes are less. Setup was easy as well. The only setup recommendation is the sensitivity level should be set to low. I had one truck set to high accident detection while on the highway driving it would "sense" an incident and store the video in the locked folder filling the memory card quickly.
5,My previous cam did not come close to the quality of this one. When it was time to upgrade I went on line to see reviews of the best dash cams. This cam came very highly rated. So far it has exceeded expectations. The ease of installation and operation makes it ideal and the size is very compact to say the least.
4,Just installed and reviewed the videos from this my first Dash Cam. Love the size the simplicity of the installation and good images. They will look even better now that I have removed the protective film!!  Installed on a Subaru with all kinds of tech and it does not interfere with any of it. Wonderful!
5,this camera was actually of a great quality really loved it this this time even tho i was really hesitant in buying this because the first one i bought just one week before came with defects and was really horrible but then other people were able to convince it was just a faulty one i got so i got another and this is amazing now really would recommend this now to anyone
5,C'est de loin la meilleur caméra que j'ai eu. J'ai acheté deux modèles pour mes voitures. Qualité de l'image parfaite la et s'adapte très bien a la vision nocturne.
5,I was noticing that vantrue makes a lot of dash cams so i decided to trust this company since i assumed they have experience with this product. i was right to trust them. the dash cam i got is of great build and functionallity is easy. manual is great and easy to intrepret but the use of the dash cam is pretty self explanatory. it does everything that they advertise and delivers with excellence on all features.
1,This camera works great for about half a year and then it goes wonky. Doesn’t record all trips records wrong date audio turns off and now the few times it saves a file it’s recording in fast forward.Not recommended.
5,This dash cam is quite small so it won't block your fulield of view when mounted on windshield. Recorded footage is good and I can easily read license plates of cars in front of me. Also I'm using a genuine SanDisk SD card (64GB) and I do not have any problems with it despite mentioned in their product description not to use it.Only thing I would've liked is to have charger with built in USB port on the top.
5,After I got a camera for my wife I choose this one for my truck. Easy to istall  and easy operation. Good night vision too.Love this dash camera works great.I recommend this.
1,I have a compact suv and the cable that came with the package does not reach the power socket on the car. This is at best suited for very small cars. Definitely not for small suv or trucks. Waste of money
1,Whenever the car goes over bumps the dash cam falls off. I adjust the camera a certain angle but it doesn’t stay either. The camera doesn’t record when parked.
1,Amazon recommends the 64GB card with the purchase of the dashcam. Do not purchase a 64GB card for this dashcam. You must format it to FAT 32 and therefore loose half the available space.
5,It is really good with good price. I tested some other products this one has the best quality of video and it is working under -10 degree to 70 degree temperatures. You don’t need to wait for warm up time.
5,Ez install and settings...nice sizeAwesome feature to have a separate folder location to review video clipsWould buy again!
5,I bought this product a few weeks back after reading the reviews and i dont regret it at all. I am very happy with the dashcam. The video quality is amazing almost like watching a Full HD movie. The product quality is also good and the night vision is also very sharp thanks to the Sony sensor. The product has 18 months warranty which made me feel more confident to make the purchase. I strongly recommend this product.
5,Definitely one of the cheaper priced dash cams on the market but performs excellent. Got this after my friend let me borrow his and was amazed at the quality for such an inexpensive and small dash cam! Customer service was also great friendly and fast. Also comes with warranty! Great buy.
5,Arrived just as expected. It came packaged neatly and instructions were easy to read and follow. I bought the hardware kit also to get parking mode enabled.
5,The Vantrue N1 dash cam seems to be excellent quality. It takes very clear video during the day and good quality video at night. It comes with everything you need. You can get an optional gps mount as well as a direct wiring kit. I had mine installed direct. I had a problem with the connection on the windshield mount but Vantrue were quick to ship me a new one. The service was excellent. I recommend this company.
5,Vantrue N1 dashcam is a great camera.  The day and night pictures are very clear and bright. I bought the camera because its small and fits perfectly behind the rear view mirror hidden from thieves. Took out sim card and watched the recordings  on pc. Good unit for the price.
5,The camera is compact very clear picture motion detection works good tried two other types they don’t come close to this product (N1 Pro) power cord length is good in a full size truck highly recommended
5,I bought the camera because there is a lot of accidents and insurance fraud going on in my area. The picture quality is great. It was raining cats and dogs in my neighborhood today and I still got really good quality pictures of my surroundings. A  small camera that is not obstructing my view it works well. It is also easy to operate even for a tech dummy like me.
4,Clear images and video have not tested in extreme heat though but i will comment on that later. Easy to operate and i like the small size.
3,Good camera over all however the battery lasts only one day if you lucky and the camera constantly turns on when it is extremely windy out. All this being said it’s a great cheap camera to C.Y.A. incase you get hit by someone
4,Pour l'auto. Le mécanisme pour décrocher la caméra de la ventouse est trop difficile à chaque fois il faut décoller la ventouse de la vitre et ça va un peu mal. Dans l'évaluation je ne sais pas ce que vous voulez dire par la puissance d'aspiration. À part ça c'est un excellent produit pas trop cher et efficace.Bonne journée.
5,Very user friendly. Great quality. Excellent images. Most important is that it’s backed up with an amazing customer support.I also purchased the N2 pro dual lens
4,Picture quality could be better but overall is a solid camera. Video recording is smooth enough and a good bang for your buck
5,The Vantrue N1 Pro is the perfect budget dash cam.  It's compact in size setup/install is easy has all the required features and takes good quality 1080p video.  Would recommend.
5,Excellent product so good that my dad ordered one for himself. He never thought a dash cam at this price could be so good.
4,The video quality is not bad at all but it didn't read a brand new Sandisk 64 GB micro sd card and there are better cameras for less money.
1,I've purchased many of these dash cams and unfortunately one has already stopped working in the first 2 months since getting it. Very disappointed in this product.
4,Bought the cam for my wife.Was easy to setup and works fine no complaints.Good Value for money
5,N1 Pro - What a great camera.  I recently witnessed an accident and my camera was facing the intersection.  The police were so impressed with the quality the noted the name and model.
5,I purchased this as a gift and it’s not far off the quality of my more expensive dash cam. Great value.
5,Excellent dash cam with such a clear picture! The size is perfect it causes no distractions. A great product I'd recommend it!
5,I've had this dash cam for a few weeks now and have had absolutley no problems.  Its done everything as advertised.  Years ago I used to have suction cup holders that would fall off but this one works great and the camera hasn't fallen off yet.  Enjoy I highly recommend it!
5,Very good product. Reading the license plate numbers is not easy but overall is the best cam for the price. Love it.
5,Great resolution pretty good night vision. A larger screen would be nicer. Overall a pretty decent device for the price!
4,The Vantrue N1 Pro was easy to set up the operation intuitive.Video quality is clear and bright this little dashcam does all the book says it can do.I can recommend this product.
5,good unit for the price and already paid for itself with a nasty I/me driver trying to bud into a line.
5,This is a nice little dash cam that does not get your way. It has fantastic picture quality and very sensitive to record someone banging into your vechicle.
5,This is the only decent cheap Dashcam I've come across. Ive been burned a couple times on ones that just didnt work right that this Vantrue is a blessing.
5,Perfect quality small camera very satisfiedCan see everything clearly
5,Used it for a few months now. Great product.
5,USB cable was more than long enough to wrap around side of windshield and under carpet to USB port.  Setup was quick.  Just format the SD CARD using the camera instead of your PC.
5,Been looking for a dashcam for a while and decided on this when it was recommended by some Youtubers. It has a small size and the video quality is very good for a small package.
5,This little camera packs a great bang for your buck.  I love it.  Easy to use durable and small.  Highly recommended to my friends and family
5,Very good picture quality. Satisfied with this purchase. I will be purchasing another one for second vehicle.
1,they are such a wastage of money and very poor customer service .
4,The time keeps resetting to January 01 2018. You have to manually change the date every day it’s pretty annoying.
5,Such a great dash cam for the price cant go wrong with this one. Quick replies for support too!
5,Really like this product. The price was right .Easy installation and setupTakes good video
4,Can’t complain for the price. Worked just fine.
5,Excellent camera for the money good picture quality easy to use
4,Works great. Had it operating for about 9 months in both cold and warm weather. No issues
5,Really happy with this dash cam. This is my second one (for my wife's car). Has a battery so continues to film a bit after turning off. Good quality video. For the price I don't think you can find a better one.
5,Seems like great quality. the Suction cup is a great for attaching to windscreen. Wire is plenty long to reach the power outlet.
5,Like the fact I got it promptly very exited for it can't wait to have so much fun with it. It looks amazing gorgeous.
5,Only had this for a couple of weeks but so far the video capture is good quality in both day and night.Easy to setup both the camera setting and in the car.
4,Very pleased easy-to-use great videos decent price night vision is good I just have to find out how to adjust the camera so the street lights aren't so blurry
1,It does the job but the display stopped working after 6 months.
4,This is a pretty good camera for its price. Very good picture quality. Only issue is that the suction holding the camera comes off every now & then especially in extreme temperatures!
5,Arrived same day.  N1 Pro is very small and discreet.  Excellent packaging and instructions.  Suction cup mount seems very solid.  Works very well so far.
5,Despite it's size video quality is amazing. I really enjoy having it in my car.
5,Been using this for about a year and have had no issues. Works great!
3,La carte mémoire est vendu séparément et la deuxième étape est d'en installer une avant d'installer dans le véhicule
5,It is a small easy to install and uninstall on the windshield intuitive settings and quality image. I've been using it for a few weeks now and got no problems.
5,It's a good product.
5,It records really nice videos just make sure it's actually recording. If you see the red light it probably has an issues
5,Great delivery service. Installed the camera. Easy to set up and the video clips are great. Beats the old one I had completely. Hardly noticeable on the window in the vehicle which is good and does not distract from driving. A good one!
4,It's worthy to buy. Nice little dash camera
4,The video recording quality pretty good.  The manual instructions should be reviewed as the guide line on some set up are considered misleading and confusing for a new customer.
4,Decent camera!! Work really well!
5,Did not check out night vision or motion detection yet.
5,Bien pratique.  J’aimerais avoir les instructions en français
4,So far it's working ok

5,Great product although G-sensor too sensitive for my taste
5,Excellent product. Highly recommend.
5,The product came well packaged!! It's nice and small and when mounted hardly noticeable!Works as advertised. This is my second one - for the other vehicle.
5,I’m very pleased with the product. Came in fast and as expected. The description is bang on. I didn’t rate night vision cause I have not driven at night yet.
4,The colour and the video shots was very clear. I gave it 4 stars because the dash cam was small.
5,This product shipped super fast. Set up was easy breezy. This dash cam is great and very reasonably priced. Customer service at Vantrue is excellent.
1,Never did work. Only good for holding a gate open

5,👍👍👍
5,love it!
4,Most cam aspects are great for a camera of this small size and modest price.  Great imaging and ease of camera use make this a very respectable gear.  The two observations I have concern the video format and the GPS attachment.  WRT the video format it is proprietary and therefore unviewable without use of the Vantree imaging software.  The other observation I made (which may not be a camera problem in and of itself) concerns the GPS attachment.  I purchased this ancillary attachment but have not yet been able to view any recorded video that exhibiting GPS data/info.  I am working with Vantree on the GPS display problem but am unsure that we'll be able to resolve it.  Overall though this is a very nice dashcam with a reasonable price tag.  I recommend buying the camera but not the GPS attachment pending resolution of the problem I mentioned.
4,I recently purchased the Vantrue N1 Pro dash cam. These are my first impressions. Unboxing the camera I was surprised by how small it felt but then in setting it up I noticed how easy the buttons are to operate and how simple and well designed they are. Th menu system is also simple to use and logically designed. It was easy to set up the settings and also easy to have quick access. As I mentioned these are my first impressions and I will try to update this initial review after Iv had a chance to live with and use the camera in a few ways. It looks very promising and most of the reviews I read before purchase seem to have turned out to be true.
4,See one line summary
1,While this camera has very good image quality and is nice and small do NOT assume the date is always correct. Unfortunately when I needed to retrieve important files the camera did not automatically protect the files and also the date was wrong. The loop recording should have atleast recorded the last 5 hours but because the date got reset the files were lost. Be wary of this camera and if you do own this camera check the date atleast once a week to make sure that the most recent files are properly being timestamped because if it is not the newest files will get overwritten. The camera kept deleting the most recent 8 files as the date reset to Jan 1 2018 when it should've been 2019.
1,I wanted a great dash cam to use while driving on a holiday. I did my research and thought the VANTrue N1pro was what I was looking for which I ordered from Canada Amazon along with a SanDisk 64 GB micro card. It turns out the N1 pro dash cam will not accept the micro SDcard no matter what I do. I enjoyed my holiday without the N1 pro. My attempts to contact Amazon regarding the N1 pro has been frustrating to say the least. I suggest buy that brand locally. It will be MUCH easier to return it.
1,Short and sweet.Spend more money and get something with a little better quality.1 star overall because its main purpose to record your drive is failed.MAJOR ISSUE.During normal operation the camera will stop recording and not continue for a varied amount of time but at least a minute and a half sometimes longer.I have contacted support and was told to format my SD card and update firmware but it did not resolve the issue.Objectively.Camera quality is okay at most.In good lighting conditions the license plate of the car in front of you WILL NOT be visible but the cars will not be too grainy.In dark or low light conditions the camera quality performs better than expected.Motion detection is a 5 stars.Car park mode is great. The camera will turn on and start recording within seconds.
1,Not worth it
4,The dash camera is easy to set up. But the suction cup does not hold the cup to the windshield even when lubricated. Can not use it with a faulty suction cup.
5,I considered purchasing a dash-cam after a friend who got involved in an accident used his dash-cam video to prove his innocence and got his car replaced without further investigation. I chose Vantrue N1 Pro because of the multitude of features (especially the wide angle coverage supported temperature range and support of up to 256 GB) provided at a reasonable price.I've had this camera for over a week now. It easily fits on the windshield and neatly hides behind the rear-view mirror. The videos when reviewed on my laptop are sharp and clear. The night time videos are surprisingly great. The customisation options are plus. You can control the audio camera resolution license plate display auto shutoff G-sensor sensitivity and parking mode features. The time lapse mode is a bonus if you are travelling in a scenic route. As mentioned by others I would also recommend setting the G-sensor sensitivity to low (even at medium sensitivity the dash-cam is too responsive). Make sure you turn off parking mode when you move the camera out of your car at any time else the camera would switch on for every shake and keep capturing protected videos.An in-built GPS unit would have been great (we need to purchase a separate unit in order to use the GPS feature). The charging ports provided are different - a micro USB on the camera (to charge the camera directly) but a mini USB in the holder (which connects to the car charger). Even though charging cables for both USB types are provided an uniformity would have been good. These are definitely not deal breakers though. Overall this is a great and compact dash-cam which can satisfy most of your needs.
5,This is my first Dashcam and I am very impressed. As you can see form the pictures it has a very small form factor but well built it does not feel cheap. The size is perfect as it does not obstruct your view when attached to windshield nor is it distracting. It comes with a suction cup mount with a locking system which is great and locks in tight I do not think it will fall. It also comes with a USB cable which can be used for charging and a car charger. I believe it is capable of GPS  but you need a separate mount for that. The picture looks great and is clear enough to read license plates etc when a fair distance from vehicle in front of you. Overall I would recommend this dash-cam to others.
3,Had this camera for 2 years. Worked great until the day it stopped working. I suspect it didn't enjoy sitting in the car on hot summer days. Wanted to try changing the battery but it's soldered to the board and apparently not meant to be changed. Couldn't find a matching battery online so gave up and bought a different camera.
5,I've been wanting to get a dashcam for a while. The vantrue N1 Pro mini was a great value dascam to get since it is inexpensive and has most of the features that the brand names have. The actual dashcam is tiny and easily fits behind the rear view mirror (see photo from an under angle). It came in a nice package and was very easy to set up with a cord long enough to put along the trim of the car and route so that you are able to hide the cable almost entirely. My only gripe is that it is hard to read license plates unless it's perfect conditions but this was to be expected from a camera at the budget price.Pros:-Tiny form factor is non intrusive/distracting-Price point is low-Easy to set up-Has features such as looping and a screen timeout-Power cable is longer than 99% of people will need-Mount has excellent suctionCons:-Video Clarity is not ideal but I did not deduct from the star rating given the price point of the product i.e. it was to be expected-2 different USB connectors
5,This product is fantastic such a tiny little dash camera. The quality of video is excellent crystal clear. Highly recommend! You cannot get better product for the price.
5,what an absolute piece of fine art this dash-cam is! I have been looking for a dash-cam for quite some time now and I finally found one. Very unique design it easily hides behind me car’s entertainment screen so it doesn’t distract me at all. The best feature I love about this dash-cam is the option of screen rotation so that you can mount it on the dashboard instead of windshield. This way you don’t have a wire hanging out from the top and you don’t have to take your panels off to stick the wire in. You do have to buy the adhesive disc separate though which I wish they provided with the cam I would happily pay extra for that. In nutshell this is a great buy has everything that you may want in a dash-cam.
5,I got this dash camera for my wife. I didn’t want anything too cheap and this price point seemed to fit the bill.During installation the only issue I had was getting the suction cup to stick. I think my wife’s windshield was too moist after I cleaned it there were no issues 'sucking' unto the windshield and remaining in-tact without falling off. Just remember to clean you windshield a bit prior to installing.I grabbed a few photos from it and it performed fairly well in different weather conditions. In daytime you can read majority of license plates during heavy rainfall you must be fairly close to a vehicle to see their plate and during night-time/fog you can see objects very well but won’t be able to read any plates.I’m using a 16GB Class 10 card and so far it seems to do the job as it records video without any hiccups. We are happy.
5,I was looking for something small and compact as to not be too obtrusive. this dash cam fits perfectly behind my mirror and is completely out of the way. The usb cable (very long usb cable) can also be attached to the mount rather than the camera itself which makes removing the dash cam less of a pain.The 1080 video was nice and clear and night recording was surprisingly good with easy to press big buttons.great little camera.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 One word for this cam......Amazing! Great price for this product. The features are great gives you options that other dash cams don't have. I like the fact that I am able to change the loop recording 1 3 or 5 minutes or off. I am planning to use this dash cam for recording driving videos on trips (enjoy scenic drives). Also time lapse video can set set at 15 or 10 seconds which will be useful for the longer drives. Video is clear and seamless. The other feature I like is the fact that the power cord attaches to the suction cup you can leave the power cord set up and just detach or attach the cam as needed (do not want to leave the cam in car when site seeing). Downloading to tablet or computer is easy just press OK for mass storage. The only drawback is no video options just have MOV mode but all the features out weigh this. Great warranty of 18 months and 30 day money back. I also purchased  Asurion 3 Year Auto Accessories Protection Plan for piece of mind from reading previous comments. I contacted Vantrue through FB messenger and got a prompt reply which was very helpful. Love this product and I am going to enjoy using it.
5,The video quality is really good the cam turns on automatically when the car starts and turns off when the car is turned off depending on individual setting.The customer service is good as well
1,The connector for the cable is on top of the arm... that lower the connector so low that the camera is now lower then the rearview mirror and obstruct the view.  the suction cup is not really solid.  The slightest bump on the road and everything fell off... One trip around the block and it was enough to decide to pack it back and return it.
2,look at this picture in a small well lit parking lot... no cars are moving and STILL I CANT READ THE LICENCE PLATE!DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO READ LICENCE PLATE!no mater how much i zoom or clear it up its not going to show the plates.So i just reviewed all my videos from the camera and its graney meaning it looks like 720p NOT 1080p you can clearly see the cars but fine detail like licence plates you can NOT SEE.this camera is cheap in price for someone who wants to get one for there safety but DO NOT EXPECT great quality its cheap for a reason and that's all.Also you need a gps mount to get the speed and location shown below on the pictures it is not includedim very harsh with this review because I'm a consumer like you and i don't want to waste money i hope this review helps you.
5,I was looking for a dash camera and I have to say that i'm really impressed with this camera so far. The camera works great and it is easy to use. The menus are easy to navigate and offer a lot of options. The video quality is superb.  You plug it in and it starts to record automatically. The camera comes with a 12v cable that plugs into the lighter cable and it even has a USB port on it which is pretty convenient. Overall for the price I am really satisfied.
5,This is a very good small and compact HD dash camera the small screen helps saving battery  I tested it without USB powered  it recorded for 30 minutes.one of the good option is that you can disable the microphone for your personal privacy.the small screen is also good that it does not distract you.I like the wide angle lense that captures almost what you see from your car's windshield.it records very good even at night but I could not find the night vision option.  I wished it could come with additional micro sd cart so I didn't have to spend more money for micro sd card it maybe internal memory would add value.with so many things happening on the road and neighborhood  it a good idea to have a device like this summer is on the way so it also helps capturing the beautiful views of the trips.
5,Before i purchased both the N1 and the S1 i had a DOD dashcam which worked great.  Received as a gift and it was my only dashcam.I decided to get another dashcam for my wife's car and wanted the added security of having the rear recorded as well.I purchased the S1 for my minivan and the N1 mini for my wife's vehicle and used the DOD dashcam for her rear window.The N1 is a great compact little dashcam that records clean clear quality footage and is easy to set up and use.The mount is great with a twist on / twist off suction and keeping the mount in the car and removing the dashcam from the mount is super easy and convenient.If there was a wishlist i would only ask for this to have the ability to record in 4k.  That being said the video quality at 1080p that this records at is great.
5,Picture quality pretty good for the specs. Easy to set up. Easy instructions. Nice design. Small and compact. Sd card placement easily accessible without needing to remove camera from the mount. Really no complaints!
5,I really like this dashcam!! The fact that it has parking mode is a great benefit for me and by far my favourite feature. The camera is also super easy to navigate and has straight forward settings. It comes equipped with enough accessories and especially a long enough cable to do the wiring right! I would definitely recommend this camera for anyone looking to add extra security for their car!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I decided to buy this camera after my friend got in car accident. I can honestly say the Vanture N1 pro mini dash cam is a superior product. It takes tiny space in car without distracting my driving. Installation over the front rear view mirror is simple and quick. Quality of camera is great and it gives wide-angle while it captures the other license plates. This camera provides 24h parking monitor and collison detection.All the necesary parts come in the pacakage with all wiring instructions. You can adjust the settings as per your requirments on recordings. It provides endless recording and G-sensor which can detect the collison or any happening. The best part is that it comes with optional GPS which helps in tracking the location.Vanture N1 pro mini dash cam has been excellent product so far. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for dash cam. It is the best pirchase.
5,Easy to install product and extremely easy to configure. Night vision is incredible and picture is sharp and clear. Definatly worth the price. Came with two cables length and type. The motion detection work great and sound is clear. I'll buy a second one for the truck for sure. The 256gb memory card limit instead of the usual 64/128gb is a bonus
5,Recently the dashcam of my parents car broke and Ive been searching for another one. I contemplated whether to get this one or not because it had a screen. When it arrived I was pleased. Its quite small and the screen automatically shuts off. It came with an adapter that can be connected to my computer as well. Very easy to use and set up.
4,Instructions are somewhat hard to interpret (that's why 4 stars) and I wasn't sure if I should leave the 1- 3- or 5-minute overwrite function alone. Ended up turning that off to fill the card. Now about to turn it back on to compare. What I want is for the camera to store possible problems (bumps and thumps that may be an accident) but constantly overwrite the non-important stuff so I don't have to format weekly. Controls though are very easy to use and menu very easy to navigate. Videos are nice and clear. Parking sensitivity seems to be very touchy. Will try other settings. All in all a very good dashcam for the price.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Upd:Smooth design high quality out build great picture quality (see attachment.)Cons: After 5 months some kind of glue started to appear on a screen (see attached video) warranty policy require to ship it back on your expenses which make it not reasonable.Overall: Not Recommended.
5,The Vantrue N1 Pro is very user friendly easy to setup camera is compact and for the price point you can't go wrong.Camera: Smaller than I expected compared to other dash cams on the market. For the size of the camera the quality is very good as you can see from other reviews. Also being such small camera it doesn't obstruct your view while driving it has a future where you can have the screen black so it doesn't disturb you while driving at night and it has parking mod!!For the price point is a very decent dashcam. Comparing to my last dash cam I am very happy with my purchase. I would suggest purchasing. I may buy the VANTRUE T2 for my parents vehicle.The only issue it does NOT come with a SD card.
3,This is a good value for money dashcam. Picture quality is certainly better than other cameras using the same Sony sensor. I guess it's because of the built-in processor that enhances the quality. But the picture quality falls below par when sun is falling on the front of the car and during night. Yes it's not as bad as some of the cameras out here as number plates are visible head-on during low-light but over sharpening of nighttime videos makes them grainy. The other minus point is the suction mount which certainly does work well. Mine kept falling down everyday until I used some double sided tape.That way the mount for the Chortau camera was the best. The final pic you can see the size difference between N1 and Chortau.
5,It comes two long cable and a suction holder. No memory card included. Packaging is great gives a premium feel. Picture quality is really great. It has motion sensor which work really smooth. Night vision is also another awesome feature. Overall a complete satisfactory product.
2,Pro: 1. Small size  2. Easy to install  3. Power windshield mount.Cons: 1. No phone app  2. No wifi or Bluetooth  3. Menus are confusing selection of mode is quite confusing
5,Like the quality here for the price cannot be beat. I had a Vantrue X1 before which was very good also but heavier so would constantly fall off the windshield and eventually broke because of that. This sticks well (It is very light). And I don’t put it so high on the windshield.Easier to operate than the last one however the print in the instruction book is microscopic. I could not read it even with a magnifying glass! Instructions are easily found on line.
5,I have seen many car dash camera videos on YouTube of accidents being caught on tape and decided to get one for myself after getting into a car wreck that was disputed. It’s a very important addition! No one can argue camera footage of an accident.This little device works wonders! I was extremely impressed by the Full HD 1080P providing clear image. Super easy to instal but you must note that the memory card is not included. Overall highly recommended.
5,I was looking for a dashcam that was small enough that hard to see and not get distracted by looking at it in the driver's seat. the installation of the cars was easy and fast it wasn't that hard to install it. when the package arrives there are 2 cables to use 1. a micro USB and a mini USB that is plugged into the cigarette plug the cable was long.the video quality was nice and clear configuring the settings were easy to change with easy to press big buttons.great quality product
2,Mounting clip broke in 6 month.Cannot get in touch with provider about warranty.Quality of the picture far from 4K. In the moving car licence plate not visible.
1,It has an critical issue which messes up with the date by itself. so it will delete newer files. Also it saves to smaller segments like 0:48 per video. I've updated the firmware to the latest v12 but the issues still exist.A dashcam is a critical piece of equipment to protect yourself from a fraud and false statement when there is an accident. Invest your money wisely.
5,Good quality dash cam . Awesome night vision you can see clear as day . It even works with other miscellaneous SD cards from other companies. Highly recommended if you are working with a budget .Also very compact others can't really see your dash cam if you position it the right way in your vehicle .
4,This is a nice small Dash Camera. It took 10 minutes to setup and steps are very easy. Image quality is quite good. At night also clear. I got 10$ coupon and paid $89.99 on Amazon . Screen is small but you can play recording on it. Otherway I can see recording on my pc too.Now I am looking for a second cam for other car will get dual cam model. I highly recommend this camera as it is a great value for money.
1,DO NOT BUYWhen finally trying to set things up NO USB charger although it requires you to use one no SD Card although it requires to use one. And the recommended SD almost cost the same amount like the camera itself? Seriously? I will return and you can deal with an open box. Luckily the costs for that stupid move are on your side not mine.
5,I Installed and tested it out today. Works as advertised and I had no issues setting it up and installing it in my car. The video quality looks good. I haven't tried it at night yet so I can't comment on that.I got it on a lightning deal so it was only $85. Great Dashcam for the price.
1,I was kind of skeptical at first on how a small dash cam can offer good HD quality videos but after having used the dash cam for about 1 month I find this N1 pro mini dash cam to outperform its competition. I even bought the hardwire kit because I wanted to rest assured that my car will be safe at all times. I highly recommend this dash cam because of its quality and performance both day and night.EDIT: they asked me to write a 5 star review right after receiving this product to get a free GPS mount. I’ve purchased this back in 2018 and I can tell you this was an okay camera for the first year. After 1st year the date keeps resetting to Jan. 1 2000 because the internal battery is junk and dies after expanding in the summer heat. Also the parking mode with this camera starting acting up and would stay on for longer periods of time even when there’s no motion. I had to turn that mode off a while back to save my cars battery. Now it’s completely dead and doesn’t even turn on. Will not be buying vantrue again. Bought a new dashcam with capacitors so this doesn’t happen again. If u want a camera that will last for 1 year and have to replace it after this is the one lol. Vantrue is garbage
4,Good product picture quality is great. HD is more than adequate for anything related to an insurance claim.Limited storage capability means clearing the card every couple of days.
5,Surprised to find how small this dash cam but with good quality.  Easy hook up and connected in seconds. Picture quality is excellent. Being is so small it hardly takes up any space to block your focus. Tried for a couple of days and have worked really well.  Good product worked as described.
5,Very professionally packaged product. I had to buy a Samsung sd card as my old one did not work. Hence it's an additional expense on top of this dashcam. As for the dashcam it's VERY VERY small as compared to other cameras. So was not sure how the quality wud be. Having used it I am impressed with the video quality and would recommend it at this $90 price
4,Camera corrupted micro SD following issues with battery failure camera loops restarts under power which may have contributed to micro SD failure.
4,I am happy with the product and features are great. I found the Vantrue official site offers a better price for the same product. The price difference is  $20.00. Is there any possibilities that I could get a refund for the difference? I want to keep it instead of returning the product.
5,I've only been using this for one day so far... but I'm already loving it. Great picture quality even in low light. Decent sound capture. The mount seems strong. Very happy with my purchase.
3,The product is good. Suction power is not bad but when its too hot or too cold sometimes it fells.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Conducteur de poids lourds très satisfais de sont achat l image est excellente même de nuit la lumière est très bien gérer de jour comme de nuit ont voie mieux dans la cam que irl sous leblouissement du soleill et des lumiere de voiture ! Merci VANTRUE !
5,The night vision is good for the suction you have to stick it really well overall everything is fine for me.
1,Tried three memory card even the Samsung brand they’re recommending but in vain!Disappointing!
5,It is very clear especially at night time.
5,Got this for my boyfriend and he really likes it! Works well.
4,the 24hrs parking mode doesnt work at all. I perfer the size of the lens a littlel smaller or leans towards the left so i can put my dashcam on the right side on the windwhield. otherwise things are good. quality is good.
4,Use it for two weeks picture quality acceptable in this price range. The suction is not stick on windows well easy to off compare to other brands.
1,Not good.. really. can't see the plate number. It is the serious problem. Someone told me racial slur and the middle finger today. why can't i see the plate number?
5,I've purchased this dash cam yesterday and quickly mounted it onto my windshield to test it out. Although the evening to follow was quite foggy and rainy the dash cam was still as clear as day I was able to clearly make out plate numbers and the makes of vehicles. I was initially debating between a few dash cams but I am glad I chose this one
5,The item was delivered on time thanks to Amazon Prime 😊. This dashcam was pretty small yet it possess the qualities that you will be looking for in a dashcam. The daytime capture in FHD looks very sharp and clear. But you will appreciate it more when night time comes. The details on the road can be seen perfectly. It certainly do what it promises on paper. This is the best budget friendly dashcam that I have ever tried in my whole driving career (no joke). So if you are looking for a high quality dashcam without 'breaking the bank' this one is for you.
5,Best budget dash cam you can get from Amazon vdo and the pic quality is amazing what you pay for  really happy with the product so far will update  again after using it for six months
4,Quality meets expectation though area covered is tad small
1,Unable to operate this camera. No instructions were provided.
3,The microphone doesn't work very well. I don't need it though. I bought it for the 256gb MicroSD capability.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Je la recommande fortement !
5,This is my third camera. The other two I refund it after 2 days. It was bad. But this for the price  is really good. I like it so far.
5,High quality camera lots of options to choose from easy to setup and install
5,I like "time lapse" feature. Use 256Gb samsung micro ssd memory and setup for surveillance.Recording and saving 1 frame/Sec videos for almost 40 days. AWESOME!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I like the compact size of the dashcam. Video quality is very good.
5,Compact camera great image/video quality highly recommend.
2,I was excited when I received the product. Good video quality day/night for 1080p. After less than a month of using. It stops recording after 1min and 42 seconds. I've tried factory reset and format SD card and still nothing. After it stops recording it auto shuts off after the set interval. Will be doing a return.

5,Best value for the money. Gives me a peace of mind on a road and parking lots: skateboarders bicyclists and other alternative transportation users. Just because they are not behind the wheel doesn't make them a victims by default. Also fender benders and any other situations involving my vehicle.  Easy to report accident accurately even when witnesses are not available. I am a practical user and my rates based on my needs.

1,I needed to see video of guy walking by my car with my bike that he stole.  However it is blank!  The video works when it wants.  90% of my clips were not recorded.  Just black little squares.  Empty.  Very disappointed.I will not buy this junk again.
2,Video at night is bad you can't read the number plates. Even the speed limit sign is grainy.
4,This dash cam is value for money product. Does it job well. In hot days the suction comes off and starts hanging on wire😂. Wide view is not good.
5,Good Value Product.
4,Good built quality easy to use very tiny footprint.Cant comment on image/video quality just yet.one downside is the DC connector bit skinny and long.
1,Impossible to program.
4,This is a great dash cam for my first one. It was simple to install. The night vision and video quality is great considering the affordable price range.Unfortunately the cam stopped working suddenly and I had to email the Vantrue Customer Service Team. They answered promptly and did all the necessary steps to ensure I got my replacement dash cam as soon as possible. The new dash cam has been working great.
5,This is my first dashcam. The mount is a little larger than expected but likely smaller than most. I’m impressed with ease of use hardware quality & picture quality. My car’s power source doesn’t turn off when the car is off so I waste a lot of memory when I forget to turn the dashcam off.
5,Superb picture quality and easy to operate !Would love for the kit to included a mount kit utilising double tape.
4,Camera works fine and customer support rectified an issue I had concerning the mount.
1,Im not too technically inclined but you'd think when you purchase a product all that would be left to do is read the manual and assemble but no......you still have to purchase SD cards and be very careful...you must buy specific cards like most customers my age feel comfortable with that. If it's SO important....include itv and charge more....cut out the deception!So I paid my neighbours  son to buy what was needed install it.I hate deception.
4,This is  a great product and very easy to use. The quality of the camera and picture/video quality is excellent but however the suction cup is useless. The suction cup does not stick on to the windshield for longer than 5 hrs and after that it will lose it suction and the camera will fall off the windshield. I have applied Commands 3M wall strip sticker to stick this thing on the glass! So far so good.
1,Battery went bad after a few months
5,I really impressed with the package of product which prove it a great dash cam. I have install the dash cam on my car within less than 5 mins. The quality of the saved video is amazing especially in the night time in comparison with my previuos one. The finish of the cam is very good.
5,Value for money
2,I wanted a good and affordable dash cam with zero additional hassle. The first mishap that I didn't realize was that my footage was not being recorded due to internal settings that I had to change myself later. Something to do with formatting the SD card. The camera would say memory full when I knew it wasn't. That wasn't helpful when I ended up in a ditch and footage of that wasn't recorded so buyer be aware. Secondly the internal battery died meaning that half the features this camera boasts about are literally useless. The suction cup sometimes came off. The status of the camera right now is it stopped recording for an unknown reason. I wish I read a review like this so that I could rethink my choice. My brother has V2 version of this dash cam and he has the same battery issue.
2,Camera is decent but suction cup "sucks" - it doesn't hold. Beware of suction cup dash cams!
5,have used for a week or so and it works great. takes a nice clear video. very easy to install and is so small i don't notice it on my windshield. would gladly buy again.
1,I like the camera except it cant import photo and video to my computer it said empty every time i tried to import but you can play it on the cam can you give me ideas or instruction about my issues i tried on manual it wont works
5,One for us one for our son. None of us are disppointed.
5,For the money not bad at all. Occasionally the recording quality is horrible but a quick format of the card fixes it. Falls off the windshield about once a month but super easy to reattach.
5,Been over a year since i got this and it is still doing well.No issues so far..the formatting of the SD card was frustrating issue but once it was done it has been a breeze to use since then.Great value for money for sure !
4,For $100 or less I’d say this is a good dash cam if you need something cheaper to get the job done. Don’t expect any top of the line features. Just a good basic dash cam. Saw others complain that the suction cup mount is not strong enough. I’ve had no issues in 4 months. Just make sure your windshield is clean and free of any oils. I liked that you could additionally buy a hardwiring kit for this dash cam. However reviews tell me there is no voltage cut off when using the hardwire. Meaning it will run until your battery is dead. That was annoying to find out after the fact. You get what you pay for. Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap/affordable dash cam.
5,The Vantrue dash cam I installed today is their “Ondash N1 PRO”. It fits nicely next to my sun visor so it’s unobtrusive. The setup was straightforward and there are lots of options to suit one’s needs.I ran the 3 metre power cable around the car’s upholstery around the windscreen to the cigarette lighter.I like that the camera switches off n and starts recording as you start the car.I did a few laps around the block to set the right position of the camera using the suction cap.The resulting short video loaded into my PC and looks pretty good showing a wide (160) degrees.So…I’m quite happy with my new dash cam.
1,File error really? New SD card that I inserted and formatted and I can’t even get the files.  :(
4,Got this for my brother's car as a Christmas present very useful.
5,Using it since 2 yrs and working great. Good quality videos and pretty great for a budget dashcam.
5,This is such a great dash camera.  The picture quality is amazing and it works well.  The suction cup has been flawless and the size of the camera itself is perfect.  It takes little visual space away making it safe to install in appropriate areas on the windshield.
5,Night vision is great. Even with the small screen I could see clearly. You could hardly see anything on my old dashcam.
5,Good quality for day and night time
3,The issues:- complained about High Endurance Sandisk card- the assembly was back to front from the boxwith camera facing the driver not the road when installed on windshield glassyou need considerable dexterity and wrist strength to fix this not the task for everyone- the camera is small however with the holder it extends down a fair bitCannot comment on the rest of the features and the picture quality yet
2,The picture quality is okay in the daytime but you can see from the attached photo that license plates directly in front of my car aren't visible at night. Even after adjusting some of the settings it didn't fix the issue. The company's claims that you can see plates at night are just utter fiction. I'd rather spend a bit more on a better camera this is just disappointing.
3,product produces fabulous video.  however it does not run continuously and as such missed taping the accident when I was hit by another vehicle.  I would not recommend the unit
1,So we purchased 3 of these a couple years ago. Only 1 still functions as it should. The other 2 may or may not turn on when you start up the car. Very inconsistent.... which is the last thing I want from a dashcam. With those numbers I can't recommend Vantrue - or at least I can't recommend the N1.
1,After purchasing the dashcam I used it once but after it turned back on it displays a card error on the main menu. I went ahead and got a new SD card but discovers the same problem. Disappointing quality.
5,I really like this cam as it is unobstructively small and operates flawlessly. I find the menu easy to navigate and understand. It is definitely newbie friendly. The recordings are great quality and the detail is nice and sharp. I also found it easy to install in the car and the length of the cable for the cigarette lighter is nice and long. For the price this small cam is great value and would be my first choice if I was going to buy one again. As a side note I would recommend to get the Vantrue  micro SD for peace of mind due to unfortunate recording issues with other cards. But having said that I have had no problems with Sandisks for my other Vantrue but why risk it?
3,Bought this in 2020 and still I'm not entirely confident in its performance. Previously I had a Vicovation Opia2 dashcam prior to this Vantru one and it was reliable with great pic night quality. Had faith in it but can't be same for the vantrrue
5,Amazing day time and night time video quality where when stationary or in near field can read number plates clearly. nothing to complain. Well done Vanture Team. Hats off for the great product at this price range
2,Purchased this for my new car but it will not format the disk I purchased for it
4,I compared the Vantrue N1Pro to the Apeman Dual Cam in a side by side test and the Vantrue won for a number of reasons. The Vantrue is more solid and better made. The control buttons are larger clearly marked and on the back of the camera making them easier to access when the cam is mounted. (The Apeman has the buttons on the far side where you can't see them. They all feel the same too.)The Vantrue has a ball mount which makes aiming the cam easier than the Apeman.The images on the Vantru are better overall especially the lowlight and night videos.CON: The power plugs into the suction mount and both the mount and the camera have exposed contacts which must mesh for the camera to work. Hopefully this won't be an issue but it seems like an unnecessary feature. It would reduce costs and improve reliability if future models just plugged directly into the camera you know... like every other dash cam does.
5,I have bought a few dash cams before but this one beats them all.
4,The camera takes excellent pictures and I really like the 245gb capability. The only drawback and it's a minor one I'd like a little more flexibility in the mount. I had trouble getting the camera to point straight as it tends to point downwards taking some of the distance away in the picture but as I said no big deal. It's still a great unit for the price.
5,This is a great value for money camera.  I got it up and running and all settings set to my preference  within about 10 minutes (very easy to setup). The image quality during the day is fantastic. Far superior to my older camera. At night it is also fairly good considering I only paid $89 on Amazon for it. Note screen is small but still usable to play back directly on it. Alternatively just plug the card into your pc. This camera suits my needs for the second car and does everything stated as per the description on Amazon. If your looking for a good camera at a budget price I would highly recommend this camera.
1,no mater what disk installed never worked
4,Easy to set good quality.  There are better cameras out there but this didn’t break the bank.Bought one for each vehicle we own. Might provide some evidence in terms of a traffic light or an accident.On hot days parked in sun the suction mount releases. I’ve come to accept this outcome.
5,I like this product. It functions well and got great camera quality. So far so good.
5,Best one I have had good quality
5,This dash cam is very easy to use. Just put memory card and plug in. Smallest dash cam I've seen.  I love the size not in the way of driving. The quality of video is very good. Definitely recommend. The kids enjoy watching the screen as i drive.
5,This dash cam ticks all of the boxes for me. I wanted something that was reliable and took good quality clear videos in cash there was ever a situation where I needed to use the videos as proof for something.Thankfully this camera does just that it has an excellent 160 degree viewing angle and is able to record in 1080P combined with a 30 FPS recording speed the result is a crystal clear video that is easy to watch on the largest of screen.The camera also has loop recording collision detection and if you ever wanted to do a cool time lapse video of a scenic drive well that option is there too.Overall a great camera that is well put together and well worth the price.
