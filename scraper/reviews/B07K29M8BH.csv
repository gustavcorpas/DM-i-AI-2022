5,I have had this headset for quite a few months now. The ear buds easily slide in and out and I never have a problem with them not sticking in my ears. When jogging there can be some pull on the earpieces because the cords attaching the ear pieces to the unit are not quite long enough when the unit bounces on the collerbone. My easy solution - put a rubber band on the part that rests on the back of the neck to make a small bulge. This shortens up the unit so the earbuds don't get pulled out of the ear and it doesn't bounce on my collarbone. When I do that I love this unit both when I am on the phone or driving or when I am jogging.
5,I bought these to replace Bose Soundsport earphones which quit on me after about 1 1/2 yrs.  I WISH I’D BOUGHT THESE BACK THEN!  These are SO much better!  At first I wasn’t sure about them because I couldn’t get the plugs to stay in my ears.  Then I changed them to the small plugs and they now fit almost perfectly and rarely do I have to adjust them.  The sound is awesome.  With my old Bose Soundsport I would have the volume up all the way and it was barely loud and my iPhone was always warning me that the volume was too high.  With these they sound great at only 60% of the volume and NO volume warnings from Apple!These are easy to control.  The buttons work easily (once again the Bose worked hard).  The retractable cords are so small that with my long hair they’re almost un-noticable.I wear these to the gym and they’re going non-stop for 3-4 hours and that only uses 10-20% of the battery!  Awesome!I don’t use these to talk on the phone so I can’t review that feature.I recommend these!!UPDATE:  Disappointingly these began to malfunction after only having them for a few weeks.  While using them they began to activate Siri and then would dial random telephone numbers repeatedly!  I’m talking 30-40 times!  If I turned off cellular service (and Siri) it didn’t help.  How does a phone dial out (and connect) when there’s no cell service??!  When it would dial out it would indicate that the action was being taken by thr “LG” headset so I know it was the headset causing the problem.  I am exchanging them and hoping for better results with the new ones.
4,This was my 2nd pair and just like last time the sound randomly went completely out on one side. I didn't keep using this pair after it happened but with my original pair the sound volume eventually started fading out as well. Neither pair lasted a whole year. You can get a lesser known name brand with the same sound quality and retractable buds for less money and they last longer.
5,I loved my first set so after years of wear and tear they broke. This new set is fine except the original had an additional speaker that didn’t need the headphones to be heard. I really miss that feature and wish I could have found that set.
4,I have purchased these and other Bluetooth around the neck earbuds. These are good but I purchased a cheap pair for temporary use and they sounded better than the LG's. With regards to everything else they get 5 stars.
5,These headphones definitely are my favorite comfortable and retractable. They last me the whole day which is my main reason for the purchase as my workplace i listen to music the whole 8-12 hr shifts. These replaced the older version and the only reason i had to replace those was because i snagged them on a cage so one side quit working my own fault lg are my favorite affordable headphones
4,nice..works great.. shipped on time
5,Have as a well received gift
5,It has an amazing sound!
4,Works as expected
5,One of the best quality Bluetooth Ear-buds on the market
5,Awesome Headphones
4,I used to have the 810 and still have an old 730 (the best audio quality unbeaten since it was made) which I just keep as a backup.  Call audio quality on the 830 is good but Bluetooth connectivity is very temperamental -- having the phone (Samsung Galaxy S20 which is no slouch) in my pants pocket already causes some connectivity disruption.  There is a difference in these newer models with more controls and information through a phone app but putting all the button controls on the left side of the neckband is a money-saver for the manufacturer and a disadvantage for us.  I like a button to have one function only not two where you have to remember to press-and-hold instead of just press etc.  Luckily I don't use the audio functions much so I don't use the fast-forward/reverse but I've read from other users that it's a nuisance.  I much preferred the button layout on the 810 where call controls and volume were on the left side playback controls on the right.  Also there are just too many beep-boops when you hang up a phone call -- (1) If you hang up from your phone screen you get three descending tones plus a final beep.  (2) If you hang up by pressing the headset call button you get three descending tones two more tones (which I guess lets you know you pressed the button) plus a final beep -- just the first set of descending tones would suffice.  In summary:  good but not great.
5,Great headphones
4,My old HBS-760 headset died after many years of good use while running. Decided to buy the 830 and wasnt dissapointed. Great sound and also cool stuff like the LG Tone and Talk app to configure the headset and it can vibrate and make sounds to nofify me of incoming calls or texts while im running and listening to music. Saw a lot of people complain about the poor\low sound quality from the microphone when talking on calls but everybody i talk to tells me i sound crystal clear (using with a Samsung Galaxy S8 phone).  Other people complained about the missing button that was on the 820 for jogging to previous or next song but the volume button on the 830 does almost the exact same thing except you cant go back to the previous song only rewind the currently playing song. Someone complained about it not working well in MS Teams meetings but i havent had a change to test that yet.  Overall a definite upgrade for me and the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was due to the really lame user guide that came with the phone. Even the user guide that is available via the Tone and Talk app is poor and there is no download for a digital version of the 830 owners manual from the LG website. That needs to be fixed. Write a user guide that clearly explains what you can or cant do with your headset. Really surprising to see how vicious some people can be in thier reviews....over small things like a button being removed from the previous version. People say things like "what were you thinking and I will never buy LG again".....think these people have some anger issues man.
4,These are overall good. I mainly bought them because they’re Bluetooth compatible while I jog and read it has a flexible neck band. I like that you can pull the headphone and it pops back in on its own. The battery life is good I like that I don’t have to charge often. I’ve had these for at least a month or so and only charged them twice. (I exercise 3-5 times a week). I’ve had similar ones by the same company before and while I can’t remember the specific model… loved them and just wish it had a flexible band on the neck. The base was great and they lasted a while until I put them on the bathroom floor next to my tub after an exhausting workout. Needless to say they got wet and buzzed until death. So never do that if you buy these. For these I appreciate the flexibility of the neck band. I was looking for something I didn’t have to be too cautious about and wouldn’t hurt my neck if I were to lay in bed with them on. That said I will name some things that I don’t like; the earbuds don’t stay in if you get really sweaty like I do. I also can’t figure out how to skip a song with them or answer a call… so I use my Apple Watch. There are minor inconveniences like that I don’t appreciate when I jog. Sound quality is pretty average in my opinion. Overall I wouldn’t say there’s anything that special about it. It does what I need: play music via Bluetooth strong battery life and I’m confident that they’ll last a long time.
3,My old headset another LG was dying and I thought I'd try to upgrade it. This was a disappointment in so many ways. The buttons were small and harder to use. The light that showed it was on was nearly impossible to see. The headset seemed to turn itself on and off without my input. People found me difficult to hear and I couldn't hear much of anything. This headset seemed to have about half the volume of the other one. And the earbuds were too large I could barely get them in my ears. These may be protective features for people who still have their hearing but I don't have my hearing and  need all the volume of the previous set. I'd say that adults are largely aware enough not to blast sound needlessly. Anyway these did't work and went back.
5,These are great for work I leave them on all day and instead of having to pull my phone out I can just click a button and answer phone calls. Very convenient. The first pair I got the right one stopped working after about 2 weeks. But I gave them another try and this pair has been great.
3,If you’re hard on the retractable part the inner mechanism can break. Had it for a little less than two months and one side stopped staying out when I pulled out the earbud. Sound and calling is amazing sound wise but not worth the amount I spent
3,This headset is great. I really like it ergonomically wise and the sound quality. I was sceptical to buy these due to the bad reviews. And it was hard to believe that the newer model is worse since I've used hbs 750 and 800 for years. But then I saw almost copy pasted bad reviews on other models that I used and liked so I had no doubts getting this one.Ergonomically these are very comfortable and clean design with retractible wires no hanging wires when not it use just lightly pull it down and it's back in place.Sound quality is great for the money and it's on the same level as previous models. Has good low end as well.Call quality is clean. People say they can hear me clearly.My only real complaint is a range it's noticeably shorter I would say 1/3 times shorter then hbs-800. For me it's good enough I could freely walk arout the house on one floor.Not a complaint but the wires seem to be fragile because they are thin so i pull them carefully. If they ever brake I will update the review.Overall I like these a lot and preffer them over previous models.update 4/2/2022The earbuds did not last. One of them simply stopped working unfortunately. Otherwise the headphones are very nice. They most likely won't last you a few years like older models did.
3,So I really LOVED these but after a little over a year I am not getting any sound out of the right ear bud. That's really disappointing because I would've purchased something cheaper if they weren't going to last. I thought if I invested a little more up front I'd get a little more bang for my buck but unfortunately that has not been the case. Outside of that they charge quickly and hold a charge pretty well.
5,Husband loves them  :)
5,I saw a Blueshirt in Best Buy wearing a hot pink pair back in 2015 when I bought my first Samsung Galaxy Phone. The color got my attention. I bought the last pair. I have small ears and most earplugs hurt but these are great. Lightweight and easy to use. Sound quality is great. I got a black pair when the pink ones were getting worn but I still use them at home.  My new puppy chewed my black pair so this is a replacement. I'll make sure I keep this pair away from the puppy! The pink pair is still working after over 7 years so you can't beat the value!
3,One speaker stopped work quickly
3,Overall I have enjoyed these headphones and am surprised they have held up to my physical line of work. All the buttons work and feel well they hold a charge for a long time the retractable earbuds are still working. I assume that they will break at some point though. Audio is decent enough for me. I am not an audiophile by any means.My only issue which is kind of a big one with headphones is mostly everyone I try to talk to through them has trouble hearing me or say I'm cutting out and I end up switching to my phone. So they are strictly used for music and audiobooks.
3,bad clarity
5,My fiance loves this headset. He has tried several different ones and he likes these the best! He is a mechanic and when he is laid over in a car he doesn't have to worry if they fall out of his ear they are secure around his neck.
5,I lost my first one (pretty sure a hippie in Palm Springs stole it LOL) and had to get another. The music quality is good. Im no audiophile so it works fine for me. I generally listen to audiobooks and its perfect for that. music is fine on it also not sure why every bashes this thing.
5,The microphone went out after 2 months of use
5,The quality is worth the price.
5,These replaced a set I have owned for years...sound is great and the retractable earbuds are a bonus ( just be easy on them)
5,This is a great blue tooth headset I have used these kind for years and this is a little different than the older ones but seams to be really great so far.One thing that I have noticed for years with this headset is that I can make sales really good because when you have good communication where you can hear them good and they can hear you good then I can get them to buy my services.I have been using it for u tube videos and the sound quality is great alsoThe loop It's great because it dosen't get lost and with hands free calling I can be on the phone talking to people while looking up stuff instantly on the net in my phone.I have used this blue tooth LG LOOP for years and the 800 models are better than the bigger models and with the retractable ears buds are best in this modle.LG WARRANTIES this product for like a year and that's great but if you buy the extended warranty with it you might get to use the product for like 10 dollars for the cost of the extra warranty because after they go bad in a year plus the warranty company will just send you back a check for the money you paid because they don't want to keep warranting it for 2 more years if you don't mind dealing with warranty paperwork.THIS IS A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT SO FAR
4,These pretty much have fallen in line with every other style of LG tone I've had up to date. They all sound good but need to be louder. I have had 4 different sets up to date and you can't go wrong with these. Better than Dre beats imo. Good mics. Only gripe is that I wish they were just a bit louder.
4,I like the ease of these
4,I have had several of these now and this one is great. The only dislikes I have is the range and the slide switch to turn up and down the volume or to change the songs your listening to is on the inside and not good if you want to go forward or back a couple. Over all a good product.
5,No cancela el sonido externo muy bien. Eso es un punto negativo. Si vas A enviar notas de voz tienes que pegarte el micrófono a a la boca y no funciona muy bien como manos libres
4,This is my 2nd pair i ran over the last pair with my truck after about a year of daily use. They are not truck proof However they are high quality. I spend 4-6 hours a day on phone calls while my hands are busy with tools so hands free is a must. these have great sound quality and great mic pickup. They read off my caller ID too so i can answer or diamiss calls without looking at my phone. I will buy again***Update! 2022 now and I've bought another pair and now those have died. Apparently the mic on these is good for about a year. The ear buds sound quality is still fine however on calls my voice doesn't transmit clearly anymore. Same happened on this pair the next pair (June 2021) and now my current pair (April 2022). Idk if it's the mic orother electrical components.
5,I am disappointed that they don't drop in volume when I am listening at night. And I am concerned that the cord that attaches to the ear piece may become loosened by movement wearing them laying down or getting caught in my hair. But sound quality when the volume is normal or high is great. I can mow my lawn and Still hear audio books clearly.
5,I love them. I’ve had 3 over the years and if I needed a new pair today I would buy LG . Not good for talking on the phone but for listening to books are music you can’t go wrong. Reason not really good for talking on the phone is the mic is to far away from your mouth.  Phone Might work out better in a quiet environment.
4,Lg makes the best headphones but they do not last too long. Between my husband and I we buy a new pair about once a yearThey do not work with Siri as they once did and that is very disappointing so I we are still searching for a good replacement for these.These are sleek and lightweight and you hardly even know you have them around your neck and in your ears.
4,I've had these for a couple months now and with moderately use they are at 10% battery remaining by evening.. my other Lg's i had for several years and never once did i run the battery out in 1 day!
2,The sound quality was great!! Very flimsy!One side stop working in less than a year. I purchased the additional warranty. When I tried to use the warranty I was told that they only cover package & delivery damage! Be careful how you word how they damage occurs!! I was told that I caused the damage and they don't cover if the user was being careless!! TOTAL SCAM!!I'm was very careful with my around the neck headset because I used them for my job. I'm usually on the phone approximately 10 hours a day and the wireless earbuds was too painful!!!I threw away money on this WORTHLESS WARRANTY !! DO NOT BUY EITHER ITEMS-HEADSET AND WARRANTY!!
4,Amazon delivery speed was super quick.Headphone is of superb quality.However wire is very very thin and I feel it ahould be handled with care especially while pulling from magnet jack.I hope this headphone lasts long. I am skeptical due to wire.
5,Well since I accidentally left a previous version of this headset in a decorative box I had and sent it to the thrift store I HAD to buy the newest version LG SB830.It has great sound quality and rockin' base for those of you who like bump in your music - I listen almost exclusively to R&B and Rap... perfect!The headset is very lightweight - I forget it's dangling around my neck I LOVE the retractable earbuds and because they are attached I won't lose them: BONUS!FYI there's a downloadable app for the headset but it doesn't really have squat except for an equalizer (if that isn't enough you can use the sound settings on your phone for more sound tweaks).It was super-simple to pair with my phone: as long as you have the headset turned on a pop-up should show immediately on your phone so you can connect. There's also a user's manual so can you see visually how the buttons work (in case they're not intuitive to you).I'm biased..I LOVE this headset! It also rated higher than other LG Bluetooth headsets..for good reason! Also Amazon had the best price: I paid $65-ish. At Best buy they were on sale for $76. Happy camper here!!!
5,I bought these for my husband about 5 years ago from T-mobile and the old ones are STILL working despite our evil cat eating one of the wires 3 years ago. We’ve gone through multiple other pairs that could never survive him(he’s a trade worker and extremely forgetful with his own property so the others always got broke somehow) and we’d always go back to this pair we had on the back burner. Sound quality is still great in the remaining earbud! We’ll be keeping the old pair /just in case/ but we thought a new pair would be a nice use for tax money. Absolutely worth the price they’ll last you for sure!
5,Ive had loads of different headsets. I work in the weather outside freezing temps rain hot weather sweat. Never had any issues. The ear buds get ripped out of my ear by curtain strips after 3 yrs of 5day work weeks getting used all night daily i get about 2-2.5yr life span from these and i put them under extreme conditions at McLane Foodservice. Getting soaked in water or sweat no issues same with the tiny cord breaking no issues and they get pulled on hard when getting caught on stuff. Battery life is typically 12-14hrs for mine. Im on my 3rd one now after 6yrs of using these headsets. Me and my wife bought 2 pairs of samsung ear bud pros and they lasted 4months before her speaker quit and one of my mics died and put ear piercing sounds into who ever i was talking to. Had a sony pair around the neck and it died at work after 2 months. These are superior!
3,I bought LG headphones before and this one is not a good item.
2,The earbud retraction lock mechanism has failed after 10 months of use. The right earbud immediately retracts when pulled out. Further the small sticker on the device that has the serial number came off within a few months of "normal wear". The sticker usually always comes off on my headsets after a year or so due to body oils but this seemed particularly fast on this model.The lack of a serial number makes it risky to try to warranty the device. The language when filling out the warranty form states that they "may" refuse warranty if serial is missing and then it states that devices deemed to not be under warranty will be charged a repair fee of $40+ and they will charge shipping too... but you don't get to find out their decision until after you ship them the device... So I didn't bother. At this point I would rather try a different brand.I was able to get 2-3 years of use out of their older models like the HBS-750 without the retractable earbuds and much heavier and sweaty use....  It's almost as if they knew the spring mechanism on the 830 would be a weak link and put weaker glue on the label to save money on warranties...
2,I’ve had this item before. I bought another one because the original broke after a few years. This set is NOT as good as the original. They put the mic opening too close to where it rests against your neck. If you hold your head the wrong way it covers the mic and the person you are talking to you immediately starts complaining the sound is all muffled. It’s a big pain. I would have returned them but I waited too long (2 months) and Amazon won’t take them back. I’m disappointed. Now I’m stuck with them and I’ll have to buy something else that works better
5,This is a replacement for a similar model which I used for 8 or 9 years until I lost some pieces and the retracting mechanism didn't work. That one was good this one is even better. It seems to charge faster.I prefer it to traditional ear buds since if you need to take them out when you walk into a store or something they retract into the neckband so you don't have to find a place for them. Also great value for the money.If there is noise cancellation it isn't claimed on the package. That's okay for me I walk in a quiet neighborhood.
1,I have owned 3 LG Tone headsets over the past 10+ years. I like the design because it allows me to remove the earbud and not lose it - and I can wear one or both ears. They had last a long time even with the seemingly lightweight wires that connected the earbud to the neck collar. That said my last one broke - likely because I fell asleep with it on too many times. This new one didn’t have a very good quality microphone for calls but I really use the headset for listening while moving around and not so much for phone calls so that wasn’t a deal breaker. However - there is something fundamentally WRONG with the Bluetooth connectivity that appeared after I couldn’t return it (of course). The headset would randomly disconnect from my phone or PC. Then it wouldn’t reconnect. I would have to power it off to reconnect and sometimes I’d have to delete and re-pair it. And sometimes that still didn’t work. I’d power off the phone and the headset delete and re-pair a couple times and maybe it would connect… and maybe not. I have never had any Bluetooth product act like this so I know it’s not my phone which is a relatively new iPhone 13 Pro Max. I’m disappointed because I really liked the retractable earbud design but I can’t deal with something that only works when it wants to. LG what’s happened here?
4,Great device for the price - multi function - very good sound. No complaints
3,I rarely write a review. This works perfect as advertised. However my major complaint is the on/off switch is on the inside of neck band and if it is against the skin it is uncomfortable and irritating. But some sandpaper and time will smooth it out so you can’t feel it rubbing the neck.  Aside from that it works fine.
5,Works great could be a bit cheaper
5,good quality product
3,The headphones out of the box were fantastic. Sound great work great and the battery life is fantastic. However over time they became Skippy sometimes the audio would cut out but the video/song/movie would continue playing and the audio would cone back WAY out of sync. It's been getting worse and happening more often lately. Honestly they're on a fast track to the trash can.They haven't been abused or misused but they've just declined in quality very quickly.I personally wouldn't reccomend these headphones because I spent less on a couple other pairs and they work just fine(I bought different pairs to make sure it wasn't the Bluetooth on my phone but being an s21 ultra I found it hard to believe it would be the phone.)
2,I ordered these because my last pair of LG headset fell into another dimension. I had purchased the more expensive ones for my husband for his birthday last November and he loved them. I never had an issue with my headset previously.Despite previous feedback about sound quality I ordered them. *sigh* I should have listened. People on the other end have a horrible time hearing or understanding me regardless of where my phone is in relation to me. I know it's the headset because if I switch over to speaker (despise) or use the phone up to my face (also despise) they can hear / understand me fine. I really regret not spending the extra money to get the ones I bought my husband.That said they are great for listening to music in my left ear as i work customer service with my call center headset on my right ear.Unless that's what you plan on buying these for however I strongly discourage you wasting your hard earned money on these.
4,👍👍👏👏👏
2,The sound is decent enough if you don't need any bass. But expect 1 side to go mute after about a year. It happens EVERY time.  In fact I have saved these headphones over the years so I can cut the good speaker off of a broken pair to try and solder on to another broken pair. In fact there's a youtube video showing you how to do this with LG headphones because of this issue with them.Over the years I have purchased a total of 6-7 LG HBS headphones. The main reason is that they're one of the few that have the aptx codec which was needed for watching TV without delay. Not anymore with bluetooth 5.0! EVERY SINGLE pair of LG HBS headphones I'm purchased lost sound on one side in about a year's time. But now that you don't need aptx like you did in the past I am moving on from these.LG knows they have a design issue with ALL of their HBS headphones yet they don't fix it driving people to keep purchasing them. Take this info for what you will I'm just putting it out there as a LONG time LG HBS purchaser.
5,The right ear had no sound.  Cannot get company to replace
4,These are my second pair after my first pair stopped working on one side after 6 years
3,I would give this a 5 star but I haven't had this very long and the right ear bud is already going out
4,Bought these just to have music will riding my motorcycle. Not real impressed with the low end bass quality. But they are pretty clear sounding. Even music with heavy bass seems barely acceptable. But.. their not that expensive. I couldn't justify the price of the top tier model so these will just have to do.They paired right up with my galaxy phone no hassle.Update: I replace the bud tips with ones I found on amazon and has improved the bass response also clocking the earbuds helped conform the bud tips to my ear canal better.the bud tips I replaced the stock ones with are ALXCD Ear Tips Compatible with LG HBS Earphone
3,Sounds really great easy to use main downside is callers can’t hear you well when you speak to them on a phone call.
3,I get frustrated with LG.  I had one of these headsets before and it finally wore out and it worked great.  This one was ok and then I discovered that my neck would cover the tiny microphone hole and no one could hear me.  Because I have back pain I tend to slouch a bit when sitting.  This issue with the microphone hole is irritating.  If I am walking or straight up it seems ok.  It does seem like a bad place to put the microphone hole though.  Other than that it seems to work ok.
2,I take very good care of my products and I’m the only one who uses them. This headset did not last 3 months before they started acting up. Sound cuts out will not connect or looses connection.I did not trust the pull to retract feature for the ear buds and I think that is the root of the problem. If they had the older version of this headset I’d buy it again but I will not and fo not recommend these.My search for a replacement begins.
5,LG makes some great bluetooth headphones. This is the second pair of these that I've bought. I got the upgraded version of the previous pair that I have and they are great! This pair has great audio for calls and for video and music. The main reason I got these is that they have a long battery life almost 12 hours of battery life on full charge. Great range. Great feel. Can't go wrong with these.
4,not as many controls as I would like but they have held up for  1 yr so I will buy another pair whrn they go out
3,Overall the headset works well. Paired nicely connects flawlessly.Excellent receive sound. I love the retractable ear buds. My previous LG headset has magnets to store ear buds. This left a huge wire loop that I was always afraid would get snagged and tear off the buds.The only problem is the placement of the microphone. On my old LD headset the mic was on the end of the left bud arm. This allowed unobstructed voice to the mic. On this one they moved the mic to the inner top side of the left arm. If I turn my head to the left it blocks the mic. I have to wear the headset left arm outside of my collar to ensure I don't inadvertently bock the mic. Who's brilliant idea was it to screw up a good design?
4,Nice quality. Good price
3,Where I work something interferes with the Bluetooth connection. Periodically disconnects. (out of range trying to connect). Didn’t have an issue with my previous LG Bluetooth (model unkown) headset.
5,Sounds great and comfortable to wear and it lasts all day long on a single charge
5,Love these earbuds and the design. I use these to garden and cut the grass. Sound quality is great. It has the best Bluetooth connectivity out of many others I’ve tried. Sound doesn’t cut out when something loud or hard hits next to you like some others I’ve experienced don’t know what’s up with that. Would definitely buy again.
2,I have had 4 LG bluetooth headsets similar to this over the past 6 years.  Although without their quirks this one is inferior to those.  Deviating from most of the current reviews I primarily use my headset for podcasts not phone calls: this is geared toward that use.Pros:  it works most of the timeCons:Battery Life:  This headset has a much shorter battery life than all of my previous LG BT headsets.  To save money they redesigned to put all of the electronics in one side of the headset (vs. both sides in the older models) I believe this compromised battery life.FF/RR functions:  I need to RR often as I miss something in the podcast (interrupted distracted etc.) and FF through commercials.  Due to this redesign of putting all electronics in one side they combined the Vol & FF/RR functions into one slider on the only side that now has the electronics:  intead of R side slide being up and down volume and L side being FF/RR L side slide holds everything.  For Vol you push slide for a short time RR is a long "hold" slide.  This increases time to FF/RR and it results in many times you try to FF/RR but you just turn Vol up and down.FF/RR Backward:  the controls are backward to the previous models and counter intuitive to usage:  to FF you slide back to RR you slide forward.  All other models were the opposite (and intuitive).  Why the change?Re-Pairing:  I have rarely needed to repair my older models this one seems to need re-pairing with existing devices often.Really enjoy the freedom of the LG BT headsets but this redesign is absolutely off and I hope it won't be standard.
3,I love the way these sound. They are comfortable have great battery life I love music when I'm working out. But anyone who talks to me while I use them complains.... especially if I turn my head to the left. Seems like my head blocks the mic? It's strange since I have a normal size neck? :(
5,Great price and fast shipping.
4,They advertise over 11 hours. Have to charge it everyday. Sucks
5,My bf had bought a pair of these somewhere which he had for about 2 years and then gave them to me which I had for about 3 more years before one of the ears started to go. So I'm so happy I was able to find the exact same pair on Amazon.☺I love these so much they are amazing the charge lasts for days and the sound is great.
4,Good quality. They will last at least a year or so.
5,My favorite Bluetooth headphones! This is my second pair as my first needed to be replaced. After time they do wear with the cord retracting so much. My first ones lasted me almost three years! I’ve tried the ear bud ones in the past and they are annoying to find where to put them while your not using them. If u need to take these headphones out of your ear they just retract and sit on our neck. Easy to turn off/on and pair. I can also pair these to my Apple Watch for music. Not ideal for cardio/CrossFit because they do bounce around so that is a downside but I just put one side thru my sports bra strap and it stays in place.
5,Be AWARE 🛑I Buy a a Bluetooth for this seller and came defects ( people can’t hear your futon a call I ask for a replacement for another one with the similar problem by the end I Just quick and trash it.
3,I like these for sound and comfort. I use these because my right hand is impaired and I cannot answer the phone quickly enough if I have to pull airbuds out of my pocket. But people often compain that I sound garbled and I have to hold the left side up to my mouth....kind of defeats the hands free aspect of the device.
3,They turn on but don’t always connect.  Sometimes when answering I have to connect them via the phone.  They didn’t start this immediately so I don’t return them.  I will if I can
2,Still waiting on a refund for the headphones. Not noise cancelling mic issues.
1,I dunno if I'm cursed or something but I've gone through dozens of bluetooth devices over the last 10+ years and literally none of them ever work right. Headsets earbuds game controllers Fitbits audio receivers for my car etc. This headset is no exception.I have a wired headset that I've been using for work calls voice chat on Discord and online doctor's appointments. Except it's kinda uncomfortable after a long while and the cord catches on frigging everything. So I figured "It's been years since I last bought any kind of bluetooth headset surely they've improved the tech by now to actually be reliable." Oh what a misguided deluded fool I was.This thing has trouble pairing with my desktop my laptop and my Surface. Any device really. Trying to switch between devices is a nightmare. I have to unpair then sometimes repair it back on the original device just to unpair it again so the headset actually detects it. I have to keep resetting it to get it into pairing mode. Once I'm actually paired it sometimes shows up as multiple devices for...reasons (headphones and a headset). Finally it doesn't matter what app I'm using (MS Teams Discord Chrome etc.) the audio and/or microphone will just randomly cut out for no reason after anywhere from 15 seconds to 10 minutes after I start using it. It still shows up in my device lists and Windows says audio is being played over the device but I get dead silence from the earbuds not even a low hiss of static. And sometimes even if the earbuds are still working I'll be talking only to suddenly be met with a barrage of "Your mic cut out" comments. But usually both stop working at the same time.TL;DR - This thing is a piece of junk and I freaking hate bluetooth technology.
3,Just not good quality
2,This is my third LG bluetooth headset and by far the worst.  The sound quality through the ear phones is decent but if you're looking to use these for calls best to move on. I've been using it for the last week on work and personal calls and on every single call the person on the other end tells me that my voice is muffled.  I have to sit perfectly straight and still - cannot move my head or neck or the I can't be heard.  On one particular call I held the headset off my body and the audio was fine.  The mic is on the bottom of the headset which means it rests against your shirt/skin and the sound is muffled.  Who thought THAT was a good idea??  These are going back - if I can't find a better design by LG I'll switch brands.
5,My husband loves wearing his when he is cutting the grass or kayaking. Works great and he’s very hard on everything.
2,Sound and noise cancellation  was good but it broke after a few uses one side will no longer retract.
2,I needed to replace my 910’s but could not find any for sale online. Weird.Anywho these are not as sturdy as the 910s. The sound not as good but not horrible.When the female voice comes on when you first turn on the power you can barely hear it. Could be a lot louder.Also on iPhone 11 pro max the fwd and rwd does not work.The wires around the neck are incredibly thin and kinda cheap feeling.However I work in a somewhat loud enviroment and I can hear my music just fine and that’s what I bought em for.Over all…for the price you really can’t go wrong.I have not answered phone calls with these so I don’t know how they are for that.UPDATE: put this now as 2 stars because it won’t let me answer the phone.So pretty much its just headphones
1,Mediocre quality lasted about 10 months before first one earbud died followed closely by the second one.NP... still in warranty right? LG is good stuff and this is probably an anomaly and they'll send another set right? No.Called and spoke with LG Customer Service and they want me to return these but not until they email me their special label but that requires me to log in and fill out a lengthy form. Okay.  Hung up filled out their paperwork waited...no label came. Called back am told that takes 24 to 48 hours to receive..wait FOUR days with my defunct headphones sitting packed for shipping on my counter.  No label.Today I call back and after AN HOUR on the phone with LG 35+ minutes of which I'm asking to speak to a supervisor they tell me....wait for it....My headphones are "currently being worked on by an LG technician".  ...mind you they're still on my counter haven't even been shipped!So even if the LG CSA wasn't lying about them working on my headphones the facts remain that not one but both earpieces failed within the year and LG's return policy is cumbersome and pretty much impossible.Save your money. They don't last and they "service" their customers much the same way that a bull "services" a cow.
5,This is the 4th neckband earbuds that I have purchased in about 8 years. This set works great. Easy to pair to phone and adjust volume on earbuds. Listen to audiobooks often with these earbuds and very happy with the quality of sound. Highly recommend this product.
5,I really like this headset. I got it because my boyfriend has the same one and told me it was great. Very lightweight. My favorite part is that the  ear buds retract when you don't need them. My previous headset was similar but the cords and ear buds kept getting  tangled in my long hair. I haven't had that problem with this product. I do wish the cord was a slight bit longer but it's pretty good. The sound quality is good and I haven't had anyone complain about hearing me. Easy to use as well. Overall it's a great product and I would recommend it.
5,I use my headset everyday at my job and I don’t need to charge my headset lasts well over 8 hrs
4,Not exactly what I expected as I had a previous model that was a bit better but this one is ok for the price point. I don’t like that it gives this awful feedback between song (a crazy loud static movie sometimes that hurts my ears!). But it’s pretty similar to a previous product I had purchased. I am still on the hunt for the exact product I had before because it was better IMO but this is working fine for now!
2,I purchased these bluetooth headphones to replace the older version  which LG no longer makes.At first all was well but about 4-5 months ago I noticed the battery life beginning to tapper off after about 6 hours. No idea why though.The claim that 15 hours of play time is possible is laughable; they won't last more than 6-7 at best (and that time tends to vary by about an hour depending on use).Additionally I frequently find that when I make or receive phone calls the other person cannot hear me at all.Durability seems good as I use them everyday and I work in the construction trades but I need my tools to work and these stopped working less than a year after I bought them.I would advise against purchasing these headphones if you plan to use them during a normal workday or wear them all day -they simply won't make it and if you have to make (or take) phone calls you may or may not be heard by the other party.LG has seriously dropped the ball when it comes to quality and producing high-end bluetooth headsets.For me moving forward I will be looking elsewhere.
5,Great quality sound portability and battery duration
4,I prefer the LG products. This will be my 8th set of bluetooth headphones.
5,Replacement pair. Great product
3,This product works well on my end but in the short time I've owned it I've received numerous complaints from the people I've talked on the phone with while using this headset that it's too quiet on their end. I'm not a quiet talker and I've never received this type of feedback while using other headsets. I'll be returning this one and searching for another that's hopefully louder.
5,Muy bueno
2,Well leaking oily substance partial refund or replace. No one ever got back to or send me a replacement
4,these headphones are almost perfect. If I had to find any fault in them i would say the more expensive ones have a slightly further range.
4,I’ve had several pairs of LG headsets like these - they’re great and sweat proof but physically wimpy.  Seems line the neckband always breaks and this thin style is especially delicate.  If you’re careful with them they do last a long time.  Overall great- battery life rocks- will get you through a 5-6 hour flight no problemo!
3,These are light weight and comfortable but what I didn’t like about them is you can barely hear the person when speaking to them and they complain that I sound very far . So not so satisfied on the sound .
5,Very good product for the price. The earbuds fit into your ears and do not fall out. I like that the earbuds are attached to the cable. The earbuds that do not have a cable easily fall out of your ears and it's hard to find them on the floor just like a contact lens. This is one of the few products that has the earbuds connected to a cable which makes it very easy to retrieve if they fall out of your ears. Not only that but the Fidelity on these are very good
2,I ordered these for my wife -- and she doesn't like them. It has been barely a month since she's had them and she says that the sound goes in and out and takes time to connect to her iPhone. She previously owned the HBS-820S and says that those were better than the HBS-830 model. Will return these for a refund and try another brand or try to find a pair of HBS-820S. Very disappointing.
5,I used to have the HBS-750 and that is my all-time favorite but they've discontinued it. So I went to the HBS-780 and I bought 3 of them. Well in less than a year the ear bud went out in 1 ear of each one. I really didn't want to spend this much money on a headset but I did. IM SO GLAD I DID!! THE BATTERY LIFE ON THIS HEADSET IS ALMOST DOUBLE THAT OF THE PREVIOUS ONE!! I love it!! I also like that this one has retractable buds so when I need to quickly remove it out of my ear they're not just hanging there. I might buy another one of these now for backup.
2,I am an Audible addict I listen to books most of the day.  I purchased these because of good reviews.  They worked well for about 6 weeks then the battery started to fail.  I charged them overnight and was to get 8 plus hrs of use but after about 30-45 mins was told battery low and needed to be charged.  I used different cables and different usb charge boxes without success.  I called LG and they said I could mail it back for repair and they gave me a link to do so.  I went to amazon to print out the order form and was pleased to see I was able to return it which I have--THANK YOU AMAZON. The sound for Audible was good and I answered calls without a problem if the battery had not failed would have kept them.
4,Nice head set bought for my daughter who has some disabilities and a lot of wireless buds and headphones don’t work for her. She loves these. I am just not sure yet of durability of earbud wires where you have to give them a little tug to get them to retract. We’ll see.
2,They work great with my phones and iPad just with my laptop they just stop working and I have to disconnect and reconnect.
3,Not a fan of this retractable style.  They tend to not last as long
4,the quality is good and sound is good battery life is good. My new one has began lose its ability to be used as a phone. I keep having problems on the receiver's ability to understand me for prolonged reception.
2,Have 2 sets of these. These have one button and up and down where my other set had 2. Always cut out while i mow lawn. Love the design hate that they cut out constantly
1,I am usually a big fan of LG but this product is as a poor example of their usualExcellence. It never has worked well for phone calls can’t hear people and use this for work so that’s not good and can’t use it forMusic incase someone calls it’s brutal. Have had just a month and it’s terrible. I don’t know if I just got a lemon but of course when finally fed up with quality of product I’m just a few days over the return window too. If it’s not working properly when you get it don’t hang on return asap.
5,Great sounds ok price lightweight you can even sleep with them.
4,I'm really happy with this neckband headset. The only issue I have with it is that when it is connected to 2 devices simultaneously the sound quality goes down for my phone only. Otherwise this is the solution I was looking for.
4,Great sound and excellent battery life 👍
4,This is not the original product I remember.  However it does work well.My only complaint is that the earbuds don't retract easily and will get stuck while winding in.
5,I have an earlier version to the Tone Control headphones which I use when working outdoors. I bought another pair for indoor use. My only concern is with the cables going to the earbuds. They are smaller wires and they are on a reel. The reel prevents to wire from getting caught on something. I hope they hold up as good as to older bigger wire. Time will tell. I will update this review when I've had more time with the new headphones.
3,Pro:- The sound is great- Overall battery life seem good- The retracting mechanisms seem solid @ 2 weeks (only time will tell)Cons:- Microphone has a hard time picking up my voice.- Cannot listen while charging- The combo volume/track-advance slider button is finicky. Having to hold the slider to advance or return to a previous track does not work for all apps specifically Audible.  Other headphones will advance or rewind 30 secs in Audible but these do not.
3,There is no noise cancellation which make it useless most of the time.
4,NA
2,The person you are talking to cannot hear you. You have to keep repeating yourself. You cannot hear them. Cost too much for the quality. I have only used this brand for years. They last 2-3 years. this sounds like a 19.99 headset.
5,I go this for my brother. he is happy with headphones. We had a previous version of the headphones and they are just nice.
2,I'm a long time LG Tone fangirl...or was. This is probably my 7th set and the second purchase of this particular model. I'm a heavy user clocking probably around 5 hours of use per day. Every set seems to be lower and lower quality. This set was the final straw. I bought these about two weeks ago and the bluetooth will no longer connect. The sound quality is obviously lower than the previous set (same model). The past two sets I had to replace less than a year apart. I've never had that issue in the past. I'm going to give Bose a shot. It's hard to find good sound quality in buds. It was cool while it lasted. ✌
2,I only bought these LG headphones because it was a newer version of the headsets i've had in the past. This is my favorite form. As someone phone uses these headphones for podcasts and phone calls the controls are the worst! only having 3 buttons to do everything is a bad idea. God forbid you have to fast forward or reverse. you have to hold the switch one way or the other and it takes to long and sometimes doesnt work. The wires also seems flimsy and i dont imagine that they will hold up to daily use. Also i need to frequently take my earbuds out to interact with people and i miss the old LG way of just clipping on. This pull to retract is annoying. i'll probably return them this week and try to buy an older version.
4,When you talk in the phone micro people were complaining about not being able to hear you sounded like you were in a tin can
5,Great product but ofcourse if you're talking dont put your face so close to speaker
5,This was by far better quality than previous generations of the  same product. Previous product would break and I would lose sound in one of The ears. Now with this retractable cord for each ear there is less likelihood that the mechanism will break.  The sound quality is great. And can get quite loud if you really want to not hear what is going on around you. I give this the full rating of 5 stars
5,I've had these in the past with the older model. I like this model because it has the soft flexible around the neck piece. The quality is great the battery life is very good and it usually takes about 3 years to get a failure on the earpiece with the dozens of times a day I extract and retract these. This is my 3rd set. I do like that I can pair these to my work laptop work phone my other phones and other devices and I can have two devices connected simultaneously!
5,I put these things through hell at work and they are killing it. I constantly have to take my ear piece in and out at times. They have been surprisingly durable. Very happy 😃
5,Perfect will see how it holds up. Clear soundeasy setupvery nice.
3,Headset will sometimes decrease in audio sounds for the caller to be heard without it being muffled
1,I have had nothing but issues since I purchased these headphones. I had in the past a pair of LG headphones that I owned for about five years. My second pair I had for three years. And to be honest with you they still work now. I am having to use those in place of these new ones that I recently purchased. There are always issues with the earphones connecting to the Bluetooth of my Apple iPhone. Very often the buttons do not work properly. The use of the air phones were difficult to learn. I still actually have not learned everything about their phones. Why did not they just use the same buttons from their previous LG headphones. I have had these now since January. And because they are over the 30 day return with Amazon I am unable to return them. These headphones are not worth the price that you pay. I will admit that they were on the cheaper side of the LG products that you can purchase. But I have purchased other non-namebrand ear phones and have gotten better quality. Don’t Waste your time.
5,I have purchased and tried many different headsets. These are by far the best. Superior sound and noise reduction on phone calls.
5,Other posters have complained that the headphone set does not have as many buttons as previous models. I have long been a believer in keeping things as simple as possible. I like fewer buttons; things are easier to operate.  The sound quality is excellent and the headphones lightweight.  I wear these when cutting my grass on my tractor and they block most of the engine sound. No distortion in the sound from the engine either - I had another set that the engine caused static when running.  These are nice folks!
4,Love the retractable cord. Has good sound quality. Sometimes the person I’m talking to can’t hear me well. Says it’s muffled.
3,I do like the long battery life.I wish I came with a type C plug
5,Easy set up & clear sound.
5,I really like this headset. The sound is great the buds are retractable.  The only thing I don't like is I feel like the battery life is to short.  I wear these everyday and feel like I should get more than a day or so out of them before I have to charge them again.  This however would not stop me from purchasing them again.  Well worth the money.
4,love the quality sound. My  issue is that it doesn't seem to have noise canceling for the mic.  No one can hear me unless I yell loudly. I've had 4 in the last year.....the right ear bud has quit working in every set.  The last set ordered for my wife worked for 2 weeks before the right ear bud quit.
5,I have always had these and when i finally broke my last pair i was dumb enough to buy 2 other cheaper headsets. Both were crap. So i learned the hardway and stepped up and bought my LG's again. They dont call me Billy Two Times for nothing lol !!  Unfortunately it seems like i have to do too many things twice. Like headphones.
5,This LG product performs as expected and that's why I keep buying LG!!The design is perfect and it sits on my neck without any bother - lightweight too.Sound quality is excellent.Buttons are placed in convenient locations.Call quality is good (not excellent) because callers tell me it's muffled or garbled sometimes but mostly good.The one key feature it doesn't have (and past headsets have had it) is the button to fast forward/rewind an audio file.  I really miss that.
3,A fairly basic Bluetooth. NOT the greatest battery life. Sound quality is okay. Nothing outstanding nothing to write home about. No need to stop the press.
3,I like previous model better.  It lasted over 5 years.  This model fights with my Samsung smart TV.  Doesn't aways pair.  Sound is ok.  I do not like thinner bud cords.  They seem fragile they get tangled and catch on everything.  It does have better range.
1,You get what you pay for. The quality is poor. I just opened it and have used for work for a week and get really bad feedback on the sound quality. Sounds like you're in a tunnel. Not good for phone calls OK for listening to music/shows.
5,I have had LG Bluetooth headphones for many years for cycling. They tend to last about 2 years. I sweat a lot on my 2x weekly 4 hour ride workouts and get caught in the rain often. I tried these at 1/2 the price I usually spend and they are no different in sound or quality. I hope they last the 2 years. I'm sure they will.
2,They do not stay connected to husbands iphone
1,I have had the LG HBS-810 for 5 years thought it was time to upgrade so I bought the 830. Unfortunately one of my primary uses is for video calls for my work and for that it simply doesn't work. I can only get the headset speakers to work if I choose the laptop's microphone (rather than the headset's microphone) which kind of defeats the whole purpose.  I did an online chat with LG support and they said they do not test this headset with WIndows PC applications like Google Meet or Microsoft Teams so there may be an incompatibility issue. I pointed out that the 810 works fine but got no response. Basically they just threw up their hands and said not our problem. It's sad because the audio quality is excellent and the form factor of around the neck with the retractable earphones is very convenient for me. BTW I previously bought the HBS 835 and had the same issue and returned it. I tried this one thinking maybe the problem was unique to the 835 but apparently not.
3,First I have no issue with the seller. They sold me this headset expecting it to be satisfactory and I believe it is the technology that is the issue. I have been waiting on LG to move to Bluetooth 5.0. This is one of their first with it. I have had at least six prior LG versions with great success and love. Most have preformed better than expected. This one does not. The range is horrible.  My callers complaint is that many of my calls are staticy. My word. For me I expected some increase in range but these are half of that. I used to be able to go with my S8 Note across the room to my office without dropping out. The office is nearly line of sight from the kitchen counter my phone is on. Same issue setting the phone on the counter in my shop and working with the headset. Clicking popping and dropouts have become normal. I will keep it but note it does not met prior versions. using BT4.?.
5,Been using this product for years please don’t discontinue it reliable durable would highly recommend
5,Does what it’s supposed to! Works great! I love them. I work with water so I have to replace them every few months but would rather use these and replace every 6 months or so rather than any other brand I really enjoy the LGs
1,One of the primary reasons that I purchase Bluetooth headphones is for hands free talking. Every time I receive a phone call and answer using these LG tone headphones people say I sound like I'm underwater. I've had headphones that cost half as much that lasted almost 2 years and was always clearly heard. If you are going to use your headphones to talk to people  then I would definitely stay away from these they are terrible.
2,I'm dropping the rating after owning it a couple of months. It is much less functional than the 820 I owned before. Combining all the functions into one button leaves me without the option to access Google assistant. It is also very difficult to rewind when listening to a book. You have to long long press just right.Overall a great headset. I like the size and the fact that I can just leave it underneath my collar and available to use any time. It vibrates when my phone rings and it is easy to grab the earpiece and extend it and place it in my ear.The function buttons have all been moved to the left side of the headset. This is a big step down in functionality. Instead of separate volume and forward/back controls these are combined. It is easy to mess up. Also there is now no button to access google/siri. I used to just push the left button and then speak my command. Now I have to verbally summon google which is not as convenient.
5,I previously owned LG earbuds that eventually became non-compatible with my newer phone. i ordered an off-brand and the sound quality was nowhere near the quality. After a few months I decided to bite the bullet and purchase these. Sound quality is excellent and people no longer complain they cant hear me on the phone.
4,Thanks
5,The first set lasted for quite a few years and my husband liked how lightweight it was and how thin the “ collar” was around his neck ….so when the first set finally gave out …went online and found this “ updated “ replacement! Husband is a happy camper!😬
2,I purchased these headphones because I love the style and comfort and in that regard they do not disappoint.  However the Bluetooth range is so short that it disconnects if I just go into the next room and then take forever to reconnect.  It unpairs itself frequently.  The sound quality is poor.  When I make phone calls the receiver often has difficulty hearing me.
5,Had them for a year now still working like new
3,While the sound quality is excellent the retractable nature of the ear buds seems like a bad design. I have to many retractable items that get stuck and stop being able to retract.  Additionally the wire that connects the ear bud to the main portion of the product is very thin and seems like it could break.
5,I like that I can push a button to go back 10 seconds quite a plus if you are listening to audiobooks
5,Very nice quality
3,They are ok.. I can hear people well and they can hear me.. as long as I don’t have a neck gator on and as long as I don’t turn to the left side.. no kidding.. weirdest thing ever. I think I’ll save up and spend the money on beats again... I’ll still use these but the quality is not the best.. will work  but I’m on the phone all day every day and need great quality
5,Todo me agrado
5,I tried a couple other handsfree necklace devices and they both lasted 3 months before they broke.I will stay with LG.
4,Only dislike is not able to fast forward a song.
5,Solid headset. Good sound. The controls aren't as intuitive as the HBS520 but they aren't too hard to figure out. The battery life is good for day to day listening and it charges pretty fast. I can go from 0 battery to fully charged in about 1.5 hours.
5,Added use for my cell phone.
4,Works well good sound quality
4,Easy to use very light weight almost forget I am wearing it.
2,Anyone I talk to say it sounds muffled and like I'm really far away and it was new . Not happy with it.
2,Callers could not hear me sound was muffled. Battery is really short-lived.I would not buy again.
3,When I talk on the phone using the headphones which unfortunately is why I wanted these people can't understand me. Apparently its very muffled. This is the first lg headphones I've had a problem with talking on the phone with.
4,Volume very low and when taking phone calls has very low volume where they can't hear u
2,Pay too much and only had it over a month and now the sound is choppy
4,Bought as a gift for someone who used the previous model. They seem very satisfied. Price was great and two day shipping even better.
5,Good bang for the buck. I can even fall asleep with this unit in my ears.  It holds a pretty good charge.
5,Good
5,Bought to replace an older model that broke after 3 years of heavy daily use. Hope this one is just as tough! Brand has been reliable so far. Sound quality is crisp and loud with both music and calls.
5,Work I Drive a Truck
3,I expected speakers not ear buds
2,Very good sounds and noise cancellation. It’s horrible for phone calls. The other party has a very hard time hearing me
3,Thought these were like my other LG headset and it wasn't it missing the buttons on the right side.  When you pushed the talk button it doesn't start Google assistant.  Can fast forward or change songs because those buttons are missing.  The retractable buds are cool but I wonder how long they will work.  They work for what I need them too but wish they had all the options my other ones did.  The price is high for this dumb downed headset.
5,Slightly different controls compared to my old set so a mild learning curve.  Well built. Not sure what ‘moisture wicking’ has to do with anything but the review guide said to mention it. And no. It does not wick moisture. 🥸
5,Perfect
5,I got this head set worked great for music. But muffeld when on phone. No one could understand me. I have LG headset in the past worked great. They sent a replacement and it's great. I love it. Would definitely buy again.
1,Now have 2 of this item both were garbage. Ordered the 1st one worked great for about 3 weeks then it became so garbled that no one could understand me returned & got a replacement exact same thing except this time only lasted 2 weeks!!! Returned!! Seller being very slow to refund me my money
5,I work in an industrial facility with lots of loud machines running 24/7. When I turn my LG Tone headset on i can hear it over everything. Great sound long lasting battery makes it through my whole shift. Very satisfied customer.
5,Easy to use but headphones didnt last not even 6 months
3,I have had 2 older versions of this headset which were much better and more reliable. This one intermittently fails to allow others to hear me speak. I can hear them just fine but when I want to speak I have to turn the headset off and back on which sometimes helps. Lately I have had to turn it off and pick up the phone to speak in a zoom meeting. Perhaps the microphone is faulty.
4,This item is broken I paid for 3 years of warranty I’m trying to get a replacement
3,Many people tell me they can't hear me it sounds muffled.  One moment I sound clear min later other person asking me to repeat myself.  On my end can hear without issues.  Fits perfect and easy access to the buttons.
2,This was not a great investment.  I spent a little more on LG because the products I purchased from them previously were great. Gone are those days. Every time I'm on a call the listener keeps asking why I sound so muffled.  I am constantly adjusting the position of the earpiece so I can be heard better.  It would have made more sense to spend a lot less on another device.  At least I would not be surprised at getting less.
3,Purchased this product for wife as a birthday gift. Quality of sound - GreatQuality of Battery  - GreatConnection capabilities  - GreatOnly down fall with this model is making calls is the worst. Haven't had the best experience talking during a phone call. Would love to know if anyone else has had this problem with this model HBS-830. #Amazon #LG would love you're feedback.
3,The retractable ear piece is not as good quality as the headset from 2015/16? I love my LG's but I had to replace mine. Got this and the right ear piece acts like it dont want to retract and sometimes doesn't all the way.
1,This is the second pair that this has happened to on me. Less that 6 months old and the manufacturer will not warranty it. Pulled out the ear piece and the side just broke. Will not be buying another LG headset.
5,They work grate I use them all the time have a good battery life.
5,lot of people dont like them but i have been using LG Bluetooth for years. i still love them.
3,Works with my phone but i can not get it to link with my laptop.
3,Good but they don’t block sound
2,Muffled and distant - the HBS810 had 100x better sound clear
2,The way it cuts in and out
3,People can't here me very well
4,Voice activation never worked and seller won't stand behind it. They are making me go through LG which means I have to send it in to get repaired. Not happy and would not recommend this seller to anyone!
2,I’ve used LG Bluetooth headsets for almost a decade now. Bought this one from my wife and unfortunately the microphone is not clear. When speaking to her on the phone it is very muffled and sound quality is poor.
5,Love me some LG this is my second pair and I’m very satisfied…
2,I wanted to like these headphones.  I had used and enjoyed the previous model (HBS820) for three years.  The HBS830 is just poor quality plain and simple.  I don't ask a lot of headphones primarily just work phone calls (I travel).  Occasionally a podcast or music.  Even for these functions the sound quality was very average.  I decided to just live with it.  Unfortunately about 90 days after I purchased the item the right side speaker stopped working.  I had to move on.  I would not recommend this model.
5,Sound is very good. Able to hear clearly and the voice portion is clear as well. Reasonable price as well.
5,Used to have one of these couldn't find any at the store so we bought some here for all of our employees.  I love them easy to use and great quality
5,I trust this brand. Was a birthday gift. They are very pleased!!!
5,Best hands-free speaker easy to use love it!!
5,me gusta y lo volveria a comprar
5,These earbuds are really good quality and the retractable ear pieces are still retracting after almost daily use for a few months. Battery life is good as well I usually only charge about once a week.
1,The cost of the headphones are expensive and should work properly however they do not. Cord gets tangled up and doesn’t go back into headset. Slides around all over your neck. Cheap made product.
5,I’m satisfactory whi t this aitem
5,These are by far my favorite! I now own two sets. The battery life and ease of use for this brand are two of my most haves in Bluetooth headphones!
1,I purchased this to replace a model 820 I had used for 3-4  years with no trouble until recently.  They worked wonderfully.  So when they had a problem I thought I would get newer technology.  BIg mistake.  The 830 drops connection frequently - even during calls. It's sound is inferior to the 820. It pairs with my iphone poorly and drops the connection way too often - the old model never did that!I waited too long to send it back or it would be a goner.
5,My husband is an excavator and loves these!!
2,I want to return this item.  It has been frustrating because my clients can not hear me well and I can't hear them.  Looking for something more reliable.
3,The sound quality is great  the range is about 13-14 feet. It's easy to sync into your device.  Lightweight.  Recommendation if you like LG products.
4,I purchase these for my father a few times a year from either Amazon or another vendor.  He loves them!  The sound quality is great but they seem to have durability issues.
4,Battery life is much better than others I've used. Sound and ear fit are good. I use the device to listen to music or podcasts while working driving exercising and reading.
4,ConvenienceAnd good when answering phone calls.
3,Husband did not like it it did not answer when he put it in his ear
5,I like the long lasting battery life of the Bluetooth. There has been times I forgot to charge them and I am still able to use them with no issues. I got tired of loosing the individual Bluetooth.
3,Didnt like anything about these.  My hair kept getting caught in them the earbuds dont seal into your ears and doesnt have separate volume /ff rw buttons.  Big disappointment.
4,Good product overall
5,Extremely comfortable around the neck. Easy to use. Don't fall out of your ears. Can wear 1 headphone so you can hear what's going on around you. I use them to go hiking walking my dogs and driving in my car.
4,sounds good & lite weight
1,For $100 the battery life is bad and always disconnects from phone
3,Sometimes you can’t hear clearly what the other person saying
1,I have been a long time user of LG Bluetooth headset since the beginning. It’s has been a staple to my life. I loved having it accessible but not having something in my ear at all times. This one has been a major disappointment. Of course right after the return period I have been having issues with connectivity to my iPhone and can’t go out of 1foot range of the phone. I get complaints that people hear my background more than me and that I keep “ breaking up”. Instead if being able to return it because I’m ( days out of the return window I’m stuck with the option of getting a replacement. I’m not interested. LG used to be the best you could get when it came to these types of Bluetooth headsets. They have really deteriorated in quality. I may have purchased one from the dollar store for what usage I got from this. Don’t waste your money on this at all!!! DO NOT BUY!!!
4,n/a
5,Had before really liked them but lost the old pair. Good fit when wearing with my helmet riding the motorcycle.
5,Got these for my dad that's not 100% tech savvy and he enjoys using them! They disconnected 1 time when he first used them but haven't done it ever again and it's been over 2 weeks
1,I like the fit of these but they disconnect often and I get a lot of complaints from people that my audio quality is horrible when I'm on the phone.  I'm ditching them and trying something else.
5,I am happy with this product snd I have used them all people I speak to hear me clearly snd I can hear fine..
5,Love. It.  I will buy. Buy again
1,First pair I owned worked great for about a year until wires started coming loose in retractable earbud. So I bought this 2nd pair worked good for about 2 weeks now won't turn on...have to click on and off for a dozen or so times in hopes of it turning on.  Definite wiring issues with these earbuds
2,My LG HBS-820s' battery finally failed after years of wonderful performance.  So I found what I thought was the next generation of the product line. Turns out this one is full on missing several buttons that really reduces is usability and convivence.  Buttons missing relate to the back and forward media controls as well as a button to initiate a digital assistant (aka Siri or Google Assistant)It does have volume and play/pause controls not sure why they took the other ones out.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Good Brand terrible reception. LG products are usually great so I looked forward to these headphones. But now I can’t even walk between two rooms and not carry my phone with me. If I set my phone in the bedroom and I walk into the living room I lose reception. Am I supposed to carry my phone with me everywhere? I’ve never had headphones that wouldn’t let me walk around a small apartment before. Something is either wrong with this pair or they are poorly manufactured. I expect more from LG. One thing more:The controls are on the LEFT side. Great if you’re left-handed but inconvenient if you are right handed. Either that or they plan for you to wear them upside down (With logo & writing etc. up & curved wrong)
2,They fit well around the neck comfy and easy to use. Biggest downfall you can hear everything going on in the background around the person talking the person using the headset. You can hear just fine when someone is talking to you through the earpiece.Would not recommend these for the price.
5,Battery life is only good for a little more than nine hours. Sound quality is top notch.
5,I wear a headset all day everyday because of my job I have to have both hands free. These headsets are great. The price is right too!
2,Like others I too have had older version of this same product. When I am talking my customers frequently complain that my voice is muffled and sometimes not heard at all. In addition the earbuds are on a very thin retractable wire... when I say very thin I am not kidding. My impression of this is it won't tolerate too many extractions and retractions before breaking the wire. The older version of these did not have retractable wires the wires were in fact heavier and never had a single complain regarding hearing me. So I am going to put these aside and buy something better.
4,I had the HBS 810 much better!!!
5,I've been buying these since they were new. They hold up for around a year for me with heavy daily use. Highly recommend.
4,Wish it could connect to 2 devices simultaneously but still good.
3,I usually have no problems with my LG headsets but this one has given me fits. When talking on the phone other people have problems hearing me out understanding what I am saying. When I switch to a corded headset they hear me fine. Very frustrating.
3,Lasts a couple days worth of workouts. I’ve had cheaper LGs that have had better phone call receipt. Don’t care for the one button volume and song change button!
5,Convenient and easy to use.  Sound is good
2,😒 They work for maybe a month great. Then hard to hear anyone. Have to yell. The other person keeps saying what did you. What do you say. So not happy 😕
4,Can't change channels
2,I was disappointed to learn the USB charging port was still a micro USB. Nearly every device has moved on to the USB C standard.
5,Overall was very please it's a huge upgrade from my previous one and does supremely good.
2,This is a complete trash product. I rely heavily upon being hands-free to talk with my customers and coworkers. This product fails in every area. People tell me that it sounds like I'm in a wind tunnel I went underwater my voice went digitized or all communication has stopped altogether. I hope I can return this headset and get a refund because it's a glorified paperweight and I had to buy another headset
3,Don’t waste your money. The sound is muffled the other party can’t hear you and the battery life is short. I should have read the reviews before I purchased it
1,I bought these a few weeks ago and just started using them. Everyone says it sounds like I have my hand over the microphone. I work with my hands so its vital that I have a headset that allows for hands free operation. You can't use these to make a call unless you phone is in your hand. The older version would allow you to press the answer button and say who you wanted to call this model doesn't. The sound thru the earpiece is good. I would not recommend this product.
5,It was a gift to my friend! I'd give it five stars but I can't attest to anything more than I do not see her without it. Her other one broke she always has it on!
3,Cheap average bluetooth LG device nothing like the high end but it will get the job done.
5,I think LG did good on these. The battery life is superb along with quality sound. Worth every penny.
2,I really wanted these to work easily for work Zoom calls. I like the neckband style a lot. However unlike another pair of Bluetooth headphones I have these have such a hard time connecting via Bluetooth. It’s so frustrating to not have the headphones synch quickly (or at all) between platforms (Zoom Teams Jabber etc). I spent a lot on these and can’t return them now. I don’t recommend these.
5,Wonderful sound. Easy to pair with laptop and tablet.
5,I like that it's a great product the sound quality is great and it's easy to keep up with.
5,My daughter bought this for meand I love it.  Had a different one but this one is really good
5,Bought this for my boyfriend who drives a semi over the road.  He loves it.  Says it so comfortable not to have wires or a headband on.
5,Great product and light enough that I've caught myself wandering the house looking for it only to realize it was around my neck already.
1,Phone calls books on phone calls other person can't hear for the nose in the background
3,Terrible audio/mic quality. Seemed to get worse over the course of the month since I bought it. No one can hear me. Too later to return now.Sound is fine but too expensive to only be a listening device.
5,Good product
5,This is my second pair. I use one for t.v. and one for iPhone.
5,Very easy to setup and use
3,I love listening to music with these but on a phone call people complain they can't hear me or I'm very faint.
5,New and improved ! .... Forget head candy ....
1,No one can hear me and I just bought these.+
5,Are use this product to go to the gym when I work out and to use it when I want to listen to good music.🙂
5,Love these! They last my full 10 hour work day while streaming from Spotify!
3,Good product clear audio light weight easy in us👍
5,Like
1,I dislike the noise that the listener receives from and standstill conversation in a quiet surrounding.
5,It has a good sound to them great for talking on the phone or watching a movie
5,Great for hands free talking.  Great volume on both receiving & giving end
5,You can't go wrong with LG very nice quality blue tooth headset for the price I highly recommend.
3,No solio muy bueno la bateria no  muy buena y poca reseccion
5,Work well and is easy to control volume start/stop functions. Comfortable to wear while working in the shop.
3,No button for command such as connecting to Siri or placing calls to contacts as previous models.
1,I like the retractable eat bud feature but the wow were so skinny I measured them they're 0.025" thick; I felt like I was going to rip them apart. The thin wires are hard to gab once the earbuds are in. I ended up wearing these riding my motorcycle to work and they flew off I got two days of use and I wasn't really impressed.The wires could be significantly thicker app reliance is a bit of a pain the charging port is micro USB instead of USB C like most others the max volume wasn't impressive they're much bulkier than other brands that have longer battery usage. Overall I'm not impressed I'd return it if it wasn't currently sitting shattered on the side of the highway somewhere.
1,end user doesn't get clear voice.
4,These do a nice job!
5,Excelente
5,This is terrible. DO NOT BUY.  BIG waste of money.  People I call say Muffled terribly.
5,I really like the item although I've had to return them due to left ear piece volume quits
2,They sound great the battery lasts all day. The only problem.................sometimes people can’t hear me over the phone. This is the second pair and I should’ve returned them but I’m kind of bad at returns.  I’m not sure if it’s the microphone or the noise canceling technology but although I can hear fine my folks on the other end of the phone can’t hear me. 2nd pair.........same issue 😞
2,The item is obviously used and was dirty in the ripped box. I was under the impression I was purchasing a new product.  The listing did not indicate it was used. I am so grossed out it is so dirty I'm not sure I even want to use them. Question this seller.
2,Sound quality: Noise in background. Hard to hear other party on telephone.
3,When using on runs I constantly get a slight pause almost regularly every minute.
5,These are great for getting things done and chatting away.......background nose can be loud for those on the other end. But work great.
5,The product is a masterpiece even though l usually have a bit of a sound /reconnecting issue at times
3,Not very clear like my previous model
5,good sound and no more lost wireless ear buds.
3,Disappointed that there are fewer features than the last one I had.
5,Love this for Zoom calls and music. Fits comfortably and easy to use.
5,Good sound qualityworks well with my phonesyncs quickly and easily. It has good battery lifeand tveyearbuds retractunlike my earlier version.
3,Most people have a hard time hearing me.  They tell me I fade and am muffled.  As soo as I take the blue tooth off they can hear me great
1,After I had it enough time for the return period to expire the right side broke. Useless.
3,This is cheaply made for the price not like my 1st one quality is not what I expected eould not buy another one.
5,Like the dual microphone. Those who wear hearing aids don't need to put the earphones in the ear but can hear clearly thru the 2nd mic.
5,Easy to use. Sound quality is great.
3,The previous model was much better better phone reception and bluetooth reception too.
5,Long battery life lightweight and sound is great.
1,I had the LG Premium Bluetooth Stereo Headset back in the Day and jumped on the pricing for the "Used" one only to find it does not include Earbud replacement.  Did I missed this in the description if not thenthe description should denote "additional earbuds not included.....I would not have purchased if this was known would have purchased new one instead......
5,Great value I bought one used and one brand new. They both work out just fine. No complaints from myself or my brother that I gave the used one to.
1,No one can hear me on the other end  while trying to carry on a conversation.  They say it sounds very distant or I sound like I'm under water. I've tried on numerous occasions to use this to talk on which was the purpose of this device. It is useless for that purpose. I can however use it to listen to music. So for this reason I have rarely used it. For the price of this device I expected more.
2,Used them every day. That is until they broke which was literally two whole months after buying them. What a joke
5,Love the fact that no one is saying can't hear you or what did you say!
2,To talk on the phone
3,I’ve only had these for 3 months and the right ear has gone out!! Who do I contact?
5,This is my second set I received a pair as a gift many years ago and when they quit I was lost without them!
5,Sound quality
1,I have had these for 3 months.  The microphone is terrible Everyone tells me my voice comes in and out. The Bluetooth radio is also terrible it has virtually no range.  The volume is fine the sound quality is decent but if I can't walk 5 feet away from my phone and there are virtually unusable on phone calls there are drastically better options..  This probably my 5th or 6th Bluetooth headset over the years and this definitely the worst one....I do like retractable ear buds .. But that's doesn't make up for the rest
5,Great product
5,Good product for the money
4,Headset
5,Lg is a good sounding wireless headset nice and easy to use.
5,so far so good.... all the way around
5,Good build way better then Mpow
1,Only had these for a few month before they broke. The sound quality is awful for music and calls. Not noise canceling. Cool design with having retractable cords but the wires are too thin. Would not recommend.
2,I thought these would replace my LG Tone headset which I loved until it broke after many years and some abuse.  The sound quality was great but I couldn't keep a continuous blue tooth connection so I had to return them.  I could have called samsung customer service but didn't want to hassle with it.  My old headset just worked flawlessly so I was sad.
1,Microphone functioned poorly to the point of the unit being useless. People would tell me they could not hear me and I sounded "muffled" even if I held the microphone closer to my mouth but who wants to do that for every call?
1,I got these as a replacement for my old tones.  The same button controls the volume and the track skip button (and guess what volume UP SKIPS TO THE NEXT TRACK.)I'm so disappointed.  They could have kept the old design and made so much more money.  These feel cheap and light.  The plastic slides around on my neck too when I take the headphone out.Now I need to find a new set of headphones and I'm totally distraught.  The old Tones were my go-to for over 5 years now.  I guess this is good-bye LG old friend.  Just know it's not me.  It's you.
1,Garbage didn’t last 90 days.  I have had at least 4 of this brand and they held up for a year or better. I won’t be buying another one from lg.
5,Work great
5,Excelente
1,Omg.... stop... DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEYS!!!!I got mine today I changed it up and the sound is bad!!!If I fart? They can hear it ( haha) said it cuts back ground noises  that's a lie people in my back set was talking ... the person I was talking to could hear them better then they could hear me  sorry LG but this bluetooth is trash!!! I'm returning it asap!!!I need a Bluetooth that cuts noise 😫I need a Bluetooth I can hear the other person...If I could give a -10 I would
2,I bought these June of 2020. I use them here and tgere not a lot. Went to recharge them last week and they will not accept a charde or even work while plugged in. Decent product terrible length of service.
3,This product has a funny noise and an echo that is really poor quality in its connection. Gonna have to return
2,Good enough.Occasionally not heard by those of whom I’m on the phone. “Too quiet” says the other line.Update:I have shelved these permanently and resolved to them being a true waste of money. I’m pretty sure it’s because I bought them from Amazon Warehouse deals instead of new ones and they weren’t sent back to LG to get checked out.I bet a new pair would work great but these suck.
5,Good quality and sound.
1,I haven't had the earbuds 2 months and already there is a problem with the people that I am talking to say that I am cutting in and out the product should last longer than 2 months  especially for the price.Also when I am on the phone the volume goes from being able to hear clearly to a whisper and I haven't touched anything the button for listening to music on my buds doesn't work. I have to control my music on my phone  so disappointed they were a gift from my son. Not happy at all.
5,Phone
5,Todo bien el sonido y la bateria perfecto
1,Exactly that…extremely poor audio. I used to own another LG neckband earplugs (I forget the model) but the audio quality was great. This thing I just purchased is a major disappointment
1,LG used to make good products.  Their Bluetooth headsets are AWFUL.  They cut in and out when right next to the phone people I’m talking to tell me the sound quality is horrible.Keep browsing.
5,Just what it said
5,Long lasting battery
5,I really like them I can hear clearly didn't think they were that big but its ok..
1,So bad it does not work with Google voice nice headset besides that.
1,the head set had pore sound
1,This was the second pair of these Bluetooth headsets  we have ordered in less than 3 weeks. The left earbud stopped working after less than a weeks use in both pair. Now we are not able to return again.
5,Good sound battery life is good great product
5,Excellent product!! Very pleased!
5,Fantastic sound  13-14 hour battery very comfortable and sleek
5,Love them
5,Excellent sound quality recommended.
5,Nice product would buy again
1,This is rediculous I paid about $63 to get a bluetooth that can't make phone calls I mean if you press the call bottom you can ianswer a call or you press to finish the call or if you keep it pressed it will only calls the last phone call you made. As a matter of fact on the phone instructions I was looking for a way to  make a call and it doesn't have it so it definitely can't make a voice call. Blogna for that amount of money? I am returning it immediately. Don't buy it! Not worth the money!
5,good
1,While the sound quality is superb when listening it's useless for hands free calling. No one can hear what I'm saying and when they do its muffled. Also they seem to disconnect randomly. I purchased these as a second pair being I broke my older pair and never had any issues with them. This replacement was a mistake.
5,The sound quality is great. They look good nice. I'm happy with them.
5,Worth the price! I have tried other brands no comparison
5,Works grear
5,Good product! Holds up very well in dust and sweat.
1,I bought 3 pairs of these headphones last spring. All 3 of them are now garbage. All 3 the microphone and earpiece have gone out of them and I haven't even had them a year.
1,This headset does not work with iphone.  You can not make a call from this device.  Called LG and they said you have to use your phone to make calls.  What's the use to have a hands free device and still have to get your phone out find the number and dial it not to handsfree to me.  I returned the first one with problems with volume.  Now I have the second one that is useless!!!
1,About every 3rd song change on Spotify on my laptop has a screeching sound that I feel like blows my ears out. This is the 3rd or so different set of LG over shoulder headphones I've had over the years. This is BY FAR the worst set I've ever had.I will be returning these. This is terrible and painful. It's too bad too. Because they feel well constructed as compared to many flemsy ones I've bought from other companies.
5,Sounds great
1,I want to love these BUT wearing them on my dog walk they pause over and over. Or they say “your headset is connected”. They do it so often on my walk I did not even know what song was playing. My phone was with me so I don’t know why it kept loading the Bluetooth connection.Would not buy again.
5,Excelente
2,That’s the last time I purchase an electronic on Amazon. 60 days after delivery and the right earbud quit working. Less than a month past the return policy of course. For the first 59 days I was tickled with my purchase but on day 60 I now have to spend the money to replace it. What a waste of money!!!
1,I used to own a set of Tone Ultras but upgraded over the years as head sets die with daily use for work. These sound flat for music and just ok for calls but microphone randomly cuts out. At times people can hear you fine and the next time you answer a call the other end hears garbled mess. Anker $40 headset works and feels way better.
3,Worked great while it lasted 14 months.
5,Good deal for the money!
1,the earbud were broken into piecess in 2-3 weeks
2,These are the worse ear budds that I have bought from LG over the YEARS I wish that I didn't purchase these !
2,I had a previous pair of this head set and they worked for 2 1/2 years.. I got these and I have already had issues. The right ear piece sounds muffled. Then yesterday the head set wouldnt turn on after charging it. It finally turned back on today. Just wanted to let someone know. I do love these head phones when they work properly.Jennifer*404-944-7306
1,I love the LG headphones - the previous version lasted 4 years - however this model HBS830 -2 months for the right ear bud and 10 months for the left. the right ear not working was ok because I usually wear one at work anyways...  the microphone still works though so the headphones aren't dead - just no sound. Expected a longer life...
1,This is my fifth lg headset. After 5 years of using the old LG JBL headset it finally broke apart. This does not have the Google assistant built in but I still manage to use it in other ways. I will have to return this headset... quite disappointed 😞
3,I've had Lg Headsets like this one before. My old one was alot better . This one seems to be more flimsy don't retract as well either...
5,I use it for work and I love it.
1,Difficult calling out hands free
5,My first pair lasted years. I mostly use for my phone and listening to audio books.
5,Sounds great. Battery lasts almost 2 days. Great product. Would buy again.
5,Very good
1,I’m not sure what’s going on with LG but their new Bluetooth headsets are not nearly as good of quality as the older ones. This is the second pair of purchased this year. I returned the last pair because it would disconnect from my phone all of the time and my new set does the same. Sometimes my phone will ring the headset will ring and vibrate but no matter how many times I push the answer button it won’t answer it beeps when I push the button but doesn’t answer.
2,it happens that they sputter during a conversation very often they do not connect to the phone the first time
2,Very disappointing. I have always loved the ultra plus and the active plus. However they are very hard to find as such no other products have external speakers and connect to two or more devices. Without those features the declining quality of lg bluetooth devices are no longer worth the price for me.
1,They where a bit more that I had wanted to spend but have had LG in the past and loved them. These headphones I can hear conversations music and streaming shows. The problem is whomever I am talking to can NOT understand/hear me well enough to understand me. I would have returned them but the opportunity to return was only a 30 day at the time.
2,Great sounding. Not a good mic. Hard to understand on the other end.
1,This is the second pair they just quit working after a month. Light use
1,If I could give no stars I would I bought these for my mom and they always make her sound muffled and can't hear her half the time
1,Talking on the phone and multiple people can really hear me.
1,The microphone was useless about 75% of the time. If the general area near the microphone touched my neck it refused to pick up anything but rustling and white noise. Sometimes it would happen totally unprovoked. This headset performs like a cheap drug store equivalent. This is a bitter disappointment from a company that can and has done better.If you need a working microphone avoid this product. The quality of the headphones themselves was passable for the price but the cables are razor thin and will likely break early.
1,The headphones are very inferior cheap and do not work well with my iPhone. Sometimes I have to turn the headphones on and off 5-7 times until my iPhone reads the Bluetooth. I’ve had this brand in the past but bought through Verizon never thru Amazon. I’ve had to get Amazon involved so I could send the Bluetooth back to the company to be fixed. Volume was broke. These are cheap don’t connect with anything correctly and a complete waist of money. Sound quality and sheerness bad. It’s a cheap product
5,Works really well
2,I only buy LG headphones and have never had a problem but these are terrible. They won’t start connected and sometimes just go off.
1,I have loved all of these bluetooth products and how easy they are to use; however no one can understand me on this one even when it has been fully charged.  They say that the sound keeps breaking up so I will have to return it. I was so disappointed!  My old one that is probably 6 years old has much better sound quality.
5,it's a LG product  they're pretty good
2,Battery life is decent sounds cuts in and out while listening to music or talking to people. Definitely not as good as the 820. Disappointed in LG on this one.
1,Wouldn’t stay connected and people couldn’t hear me when used for phone calls
5,Works wonderfully.
1,I had to give 1 star because it would never hold a charge and would not last long. Finally had to send it off to LG and they reported that the battery was bad. They replaced it but didnt have this one instock so was sent another style . Those work just fine.
1,Headset sound will not stay on.  Installed correctly but would play one "test" audio cycle then quit.  Would require shutting bluetooth off and on again for it to play audio test again.  I wanted to like these but would not work..new out of the box but some additional labeling on box seems to suggest these were after market or refurbished.
1,Would not purchase again that's for sure a waste of $60 I had to pay for them They are not the best at all they always disconnect from my phone all the time in the middle of phone calls music quality is not great at all either
1,This headset is a dumb down version of the HBS-820 which in my opinion is a much better headset. These lasted 2 months before people started saying they couldn't hear me well during phone conversations and just my luck that it's out of the return window. Good luck trying to get a warranty exchange with LG I've been trying for 2 weeks with no luck. I highly advise against buying these.
1,This thing is garbage!  Right out of the box people say they cannot understand what I am saying on the phone.  I was never able to use it because of this problem.  If it isn't too late I will return it.
5,Works as advertised.
5,Came on time and was in great condition.
1,Less than a month and the ear buds are cutting out
2,This model (HBS-830) lacks the skip controls that other models have. While that one flaw does not make them useless it is a major flaw and in my opinion a complete deal-breaker.
1,Do not buy these headphones. I wish I had looked at the reviews before I bought them. The connection is slow and the quality is bad. The final straw is when the neckband snapped from opening it to put it around my neck. LG wanted to charge me to repair it. There are better brands out there.
1,Audio cuts in and out with the slightest movements.  It's either defective or a poor design.  Amazon won't replace so I'm stuck with a useless paperweight.
1,Second pair of HBS-830 where the right earbud stops working in less than a year.  LG support won't answer the phone and the website sends you around in circles.  Love the headset but can't go on buying them since they simply don't last and LG support is very difficult to non-existant.Sorry but I can't recommend these headsets
1,You would think that LG would make better quality headsets that last longer but alas this is not so.Not only are they not getting batter but they’re making them worseWhat’s my proof? They don’t even cover their headsets for more than a year and if it breaks the warranty isn’t renewed as it should be.
1,I had to send it back - I could not get it to pair with my phone
2,I can hear just fine but no one can understand me when I talk.
1,Within a couple of months the left earpiece stopped working. Contact customer service and was informed that I needed to ship it in for repair. Not convenient and was unable to ship and wait several weeks for a repair.
2,It does not have the option to speak and call.
2,I have to hold mic in front of mouth or muffled to people I’m talking to
1,No se que sucedió con LG  que ni se escucha bien este accesorio en llamadas telefónicas . Solo funciona con música . Se escuchan más mal que unos baratos de la tienda de dólar . Que vergüenza .
1,Not high quality for the price. We bought 2 thinking we’d like them & now we can’t return:-(
1,Everyone is telling me they can't understand or hear me on the phone. I have owned many like these. Never had this problem. And they seemed used by the appearance. Can't find the option to return them. $75 down the drain!
5,Love the lg line of headsets.
1,This is the first LG bluetooth headset that I've purchased and it's not what I expected. I can hear the caller fine on my end but they say I sound like I'm under water and it's every call I get. Very disappointed that this predict didn't work out for me.
2,Sound is not great doesn’t connect to the phone consistently - not worth it
2,I normally like LG earpiece. However the mic sounds muted to the person on the other end. Sounds like I’m in a tunnel.
1,I love my other bluetooth LG headset that is of similar design but this one was terrible. The wires felt like they'd snap if pulled on at all. Also it would not work with MS Teams which is primarily what I needed it for. I did some forum searches and apparently this is a known thing for this model. Wish I had seen that sooner.
1,Worked great for a week. Now nobody can hear me. They all say the same thing. "Sounds like I'm really far away and muffled." If you only want it more music and never make calls it would be great. Otherwise they're a waste of money.
1,I previously owned another LG Tone and had it for 3 years with great success.  However this product does not work near as good as my older set.  People are constantly telling me I have a strong echo or they just cannot hear me very well.  I would not recommend this LG Tone.
2,If playing music and the phone rings or the call is over the music has to be turned back on at the phone. Headphones suck compared to older versions
5,works good
1,This is my 1st review after being with Amazon for years.  I brought this one after my 760 broke. I wanted to save a few bucks and I paid for it.  Everyone said my voice was muffled.  I brought the headphones at 68.00 and they refunded 28.00. I paid a 40.00 restocking fee.  I should have paid the extra 38.00 for the 760. You live and learn. Hopefully this will help someone else avoid the same mistake.
1,So my husband got this headset - he has always been a fan of the LG neckband bluetooth headsets.  No wonder it was only $60...At less than 4 months he started having it making a repeated loud clicking through the buds.  He has to end his call turn them off wait turn them back on again then re-call whomever he was speaking to.  We definitely do NOT recommend this model!!!  The HBS-910 model is THE BEST out there....too bad LG discontinued it.
5,bien
2,Sound quality is poor.
1,Unlike the earlier model (LG HBS730) and which I've owned for 8 years this "ultra" model has poor voice quality (muffled mask-like) and  substandard audio listening quality (fuzzy limited). In addition it has poorer range when separated from the phone/source.  I've done the A-B comparison. Sorry but the LG "value engineering" job has made this product uncompetitive - I'm looking elsewhere for a replacement to the fantastic HBS730. I'll be returning after one week.
1,Can’t hear this thing at max volume. Disconnects from phone often. I had the older version and loved it. But it was unavailable anymore. I don’t recommend the LG tone extra
1,About 4 weeks after purchase it stopped taking a charge. I've tried to charge it with different chargers without success..save your money and go buy another p.o.s that may last 5 weeks instead!
1,spent a lot of money on these and they aren't worth a penny. People can't hear you and complain all the time. The older models were great which you can't get anymore.
1,This was good for the first month. Now less than two months with this headset and the mic quality has severely degraded. People cant hear me clearly i have to continually repeat myself on calls.
1,Purchased the product 4/27/21 as a present for Mother's Day.  When listening to music is drops or cuts out at random...sitting still or moving.  I would like to know how to get an exchange or refund.
1,I had to buy my dad a new set becuase these broke really  quickly bought them in June and broke in August don't bother wasting your time buying these headphones not worth it
1,I'm not a fan of this Bluetooth the wires are super super thin. talking to people on the phone everyone said it was hard to hear me I sounded muffled you walk away from the phone and it breaks up I'm talking like 5 feet awayDecided I want to return it and they charge a restocking fee so you won't get your full amount back whether you decide you don't like it or if it's defective. I won't order from this company again
1,Why would you buy a headset in a state with handsfree that you can't use to make a call !!!
1,I had a similar pair of lg neckband a couple years ago and loved them until some a$$ stole them from my car.  These are terrible in sound compared not only to the old ones but some cheapie wireless ear buds
1,Description said "Used like new.  Packaging may be damaged".  This set of headphones looks like it had been used for a year.  There were scratches on it and you couldn't even read the writing on the label.  Sound at different levels in each ear.I've had about 4 LG Tone's and i love them.  But this unit obviously lived in an abusive household.
1,Don’t waste your money! Broke within 6 months of use and LG won’t stand behind it. Cost me $15 to mail $20 to assess and if I wanted it repaired $89- that’s more than it costs!!!
5,Listen to music while I work.
1,The microphone doesn't work. Everyone says my voice is muffled and they can't understand anything I say unless I hold it right up to my mouth. Makes the unit useless not hands free.
2,I purchased it because the ad said it was adouble mic so I thought my clients could hear me better.. was not the case.
1,This is my second pair...thought the quality would be the same as the first.  People tell me the sound comes in garbled and tell me the sound is not clear.  Requesting a refund.  The only reason why i had to buy a new pair is  because i got the previous pair wet.  Disappointed in the quality.
1,The phone sound quality is poor and people can’t hear you clearly. It takes several attempts to connect on Bluetooth and loses connection. Clearly not the replacement quality of the LG we had before.
2,Couldn't get through 5 phone calls at work.  Everyone hadtrouble understanding me.
1,I've owned LG headsets for the past 8 years and by far this one is the worst one I've ever owned. Everyone says they can not hear me I've tried on 2 different phones the same thing. I even sent a pair back and purchased a new one still everyone is saying I sound muffled. Now I'm out shipping restocking fees time and energy. Very disappointed in LG.
4,I’ve ordered 2-3 of these now over the years. I love this product but use it every day to take calls or listen to podcasts while I work with my hands. After about a year they start to lose sound quality volume and the ability to hear clearly. I can’t hold the phone for long periods of time due to biceps tendinitis so having something like this is super helpful but wish they lasted longer.
2,No
1,Apparently these are just thrown together with no quality in mind. This was my 2nd pair and there won't be a 3rd.
1,The complaints that people can’t hear you and you sound like static are real.  I thought the first one I bought was bad so I sent it back and got another since my old HBS-810 had been great - and it had the same exact problem.I highly recommend you look at another product instead.
1,It calls people randomly while you are using it and disconnects often. Does not connect the Bluetooth most of the time. Piece of F garbage
1,It came dirty out of the box. My purchase included a new earpiece not a refurbished earpiece. I am not pleased.
1,Work meeting and conversation
1,Sound quality was good for the first month of owning then these got bad now nobody can hear me and I’m stuck with Bluetooth headphones that don’t work halve the time don’t recommend to buy
1,When I used the Bluetooth  no one could hear me they said it sounded like I was trying to talk to them from underwater
1,Callers complained they couldn't hear me clearly
1,Lasted 3 months  quit working.  LG sent me a replacement and 7 months later they have quit working.
1,I think I may have received the same item that keeps being sent back by others that say that one side has no sound...smh
1,This is the the forth one my wife and i bought they have good sound for the money only problem after 6-8 months the thin ear bud becomes disconnected same problem on all 4.
1,I’m very disappointed in this product. It has a very short range of connectivity with my phone. It will drop my connection if I leave it on the table and go into the next room.  I would not recommend this product at all.
2,One of the ear buds has static the entire time the headphones are on. No good
1,Also if it's a bad Bluetooth for whatever the seller only returns part of ur money.  At least Walmart returns all of it.
1,I dislike the product bc it was missing a lot of features from my previous LG Tone.... it did not have the outer speaker feature/ JBL... for the price i paid i sent the merchandise back.
1,Its a waste of money when a $30 dollar set has better sound quality and connection than something that costs close to $70
1,Bought in December 2020 come March 2021 it stopped charging and is now completely dead. It won't charge when I plug it in.  Don't waste your money.
2,stopped working properly
1,Can not be heard by callers they were always asking me to repeat myself. These were returned.
2,Sound quality is poor
1,The earphones worked a little over 30 days before the right side went out. I tried contacting the seller and gave them over the 48 hour period to contact me but they never did so I had to contact Amazon for a refund.
1,People say they can't hear me and I have had this headset for less than a year and the wires have come apart from the earbuds it's not worth the money.
1,the chord was tied in a knot and the battery won’t hold a charge
1,Very disappointed ... I bought them in August and one side of the headphones ahave already gone bad .. I would want it replaced ... yet again
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 this product is second hand.  It is peeled and scraped that lack of seriousness and waste of time
1,At just six months old the wires are trying to escape! Sound goes in and out.
1,Static sound goes in and out sounds muffled on the other end of a call
1,Just outside the return window it wouldn't stop vibrating when plugged in now it won't charge at all. Junk sound quality too.
5,Pleasantly surprised
1,Yo tuve hacen 5 años y muy bueno  pero este no salió bueno
5,I always buy mines from Best Buy with the 2 year protection plan. I went from these to the next ones that came out to the platinum. After the platinum I came back to these. What I've learned the hard way is I don't care what anyone else says nor what the advertisement says mics are not waterproof! I've gone through 4 sets of LG Tone with retractable buds and my mic seems to mess up when they get wet. I'm heard BUT it seems like I'm far away or in a tunnel. The HBS830 are the best for me over all of LG Tones retractable buds including the platinum. The platinum breaks on the neck and. The HBS 830 is more flexible. The sound is great! Can't hear any noise when you have them in your ear. The battery life lasts a long time. I use mine for work where we have power drills running all day. I'll still have battery life even after 8 to 10 hours of straight play time listening to music and talking on the phone while working.Great set! Best i ever had. Just don't get the mic wet.
1,Left side stopped working a week after I purchased
1,Doesn’t work with Siri and others can’t hear you very well
1,Great product for everything except the charging port. The charging got very loose after only a few charges and will not charge at all.
1,The sound quality is not good people can't hear you well and you can't hear them well either
3,I've purchased 2 of these units within 1 year and they've both failed on the right side ear bud. I love this Bluetooth but they keep failing on me.
1,It has been less than three months and this one and I might add the second one to replace the defective one.  Doesn't work. What now.  Can I send this one back
1,Returned item delivered not what is shown in picture very disappointed
1,Bad quality issues with microphone and 100% of the times issues with the other party to listed
1,They stopped working in les than a week I’m wondering is this is original I had to return it and buy one in a local store
1,Don’t buy!!! It works up until it’s no longer returnable Then it starts going doesn’t hold a charge
1,Does not hold a charge n look t very loud
1,Poor sound quality. Buffeting and drop calls 📞
1,No puedo ser escuchado con claridad por labor persona en línea el equipo descarga la batería demasiado rápido y se mantiene vibrando constantemente.
1,Extremely uncomfortable and my grandson cannot wear them.
5,Ok
1,very disappointed  just hangs up on calls randomlyand left earbud went out and havent even had them for a month just sent them back for a refund
1,Didn’t like because of item wasn’t working properly
1,Can't walk far away from phone without losing sound.
1,I can’t hear anythingI’m waiting for someone to call me they never call
1,The sound quality SUCKS. Sounds like someone has there hand over there mouth. Volume sucks. Save your money buy something different
1,everyone says they can not hear my voice on these they pick up so much background noise
1,People can’t hear you when your talking
1,I could not be heard through the microphone at all.
1,I can hear music phone calls great; however the person on the other end of my phone call consistantly says the quality is terrible.
1,Clumsy and not worth buying
1,My bluethooth keeps disconnecting from my phone for the money I paid it shouldn't keep doing that not happy at all
1,Sound quality is very poor.
1,It's not what is advertised I received a rebranded hbs 835
1,Only one side wired and now the entire headset has quit working.
1,headset mic muffled when you move your head.
1,Worked four about a month until it just stopped. Not a good headset.
1,When I used this Bluetooth everyone stated I had a "muffled or echoed" sound. Kept hearing "what did you say".
1,I am really unsatisfied with this headset you can't hear and the person you talking to can't  hear
1,Sound quality is decent.
1,Not as good as old one
1,Piece a crap 💩
1,These worked for 2 days and quit. Not happy at all. Charged them all day and still didn’t work.
1,I guess during a call my end sounds muffled
1,They cut out absolutely all the time background noise is horrible on the other line
1,Never buy Bluetooth from Amazon I buy July and know stop working.
1,Terrible quality!
1,Sent back! People were constantly complaining I sounded muffled couldn't hear me or gargly.
1,People tell me I'm muffled and they can't understand me.
1,Sound issues
1,Would not pair to my Vehicle.
1,Terrible quality!!! I sounded like I was in a tunnel on every call
1,I have been getting a lot of complaints that the person I am talking to can’t hear me and it’s static
1,People dont stop complaining that they cant hear me. I cant use it anymore. Bad news! Stay away from this product
1,No longer working within a month of delivery.
1,Wouldn’t connect
1,Seems like talking under the water
1,Mal estado🤦‍♂️
1,The headphones are ok except… if you use them every day they are useless because they break one way or an other!The first pair stopped working on one earphone after about 4-5 month.LG warranty department said I used to much force so no replacement or repairs under warranty.Second pair broke right where the thin neck part goes in to the thicker front part with the controls and retractable earphones. LG warranty department said… yes right! I used to much force!Then I bought an other LG model headphone set because I liked the retractable part. Well they worked about 3-4 month. They split apart in the back neck area and one of the ear plugs did not play any sound anymore.I bought a different LG model which stop working after about 2-3 month one of the ear plugs stop playing sound. At that point LG was dead to me I thought that a big company like LG would learn from their mistakes but sadly that couldn’t be farther from the truth. They made “improvements” don’t get me wrong but it made the disaster even worse.I have now a different brand that costs a 1/3 from LG and they work already for more then 8 month with no problem!Don’t buy LG headphones they are a nightmare not when you get them but 2-6 months down the road!
3,Cheap Quailty
1,Suddenly quit pairing with iPhone and the purple light will not turn off. Nothing helps ANC button off hold ANC and slide on-off button to on. Recharged. Nothing. This stupid thing is only a couple of months old. Piece of garbage.
1,Received it as a gift and not very happy - low sound quality bluetooth connection drops every now and then. Stay away from these earbuds!
4,I brought these headphones because I got the new OnePlus 7t cell phone and it doesn't have a headphone jack so I got these headphones an overall I give it a three and a half Stars it doesn't really council out as much noise as I would like like my box fan in my room I can still hear that I can still hear my own voice. I ended up just getting an adapter for my phone and using my over-the-ear studio headphones to give me that full Dolby surround sound quality these headphones will not give you that. So now I just use them at work and that's cool and when I'm out like at the gym or something like that they're perfect for that. But not if you want that true fullness that I get from these $20 headphones that are not wireless. So for that reason I give it 3.5 🌟
2,A. The fitting around your neck is going to be excessively loose unless you have the thickest neck ever.B. The earbuds slip out of your ears so easily it's not even funny. Even holding still they fall out. I feel like I need to get some glue to hold them in place. I have narrow ear canals too but even my ears can't hold them in.C. The wires to the earbuds seem way thin for their importance especially since you need to actively pull on them just to access the ear buds. I feel like they will quickly tear apart probably within a month.D. The controls are a bit too confusing. The power is a little slider which I actually like along with the placement on the inside of the neck. But the sound buttons and main buttons are separate and too spaced. Not too much a fan of those in placement and design.E. Sound quality is about the same as the Skullcandy earbuds I am used to. Nothing exceptional but not terrible.
1,The package was on point. However when I began to inspect the headset I noticed the words and numbers on the bottom of it had been worn off. This caused me to do further inspection and I had then noticed earwax down inside the rubber on the end of the speaker’s.  I replaced the rubbers with new ones from a previous purchase (from a different seller) and I tried the headset out. I then became aware that the speaker sound quality was absolutely horrible. I also didn’t receive the car charger wall block  and extra rubber ear thingys.  I recommend buying something new and from a different seller. Mkk Group is the seller I purchased from.
2,After my last regatta my Samsung decided to jump overboard. SO I had to get a new phone and this time I got an iPhone. Lo and behold! It has NO PLACE to plug in headphones! So I bought this LG Tone HBS-830 Bluetooth headset from Verizon so I can continue to do Zoom calls with my phone. The salesperson assured me it had a built-in mic. And it does. It's just that NO ONE CAN HEAR ME with it. Also the sound quality is like listening through a tin-can compared to my ancient plug-in style "Sony Discman MDR-A10" headphones. If it weren't for the $50 restocking fee I'd return them and get something else. One thing I do like: the retractable buds - it is a nice feature. But I saw somewhere else that eventually the retractability wears out - probably the spring inside.
1,I purchased these stopped working after six months.  Amazon directed me to the manufacturer for replacement as Amazon does not honor the warranty. The manufacturer could not be reached. I learned to only buy from Amazon suppliers. Otherwise the warranty may not be valid.
1,Hello amazon representative I bought an lg brand bleutooth ear plug and this device does not work well since I bought whoever is on the other line does not listen to me and when he hears the vaz this picota or half would like to return or my money back please Thank you very much in advance!
1,POS. Won't last 6 months. Been through 3 of these - loved them while they worked but they just don't last.
5,works well
5,It's been a month since I've owned these headphones and the only thing that I really don't care for is that the Mic faces outwards instead of inwards. These are a great pair of headphones and have not shown any sign of quitting on me and I am very hard and heavy with my elctronics.Overall; Great pair of headphones for the price. I've read some reviews about some of the headphones now being new and while the package appeared to be opened prior to my purchase I cannot say that these were or were not new. But these are still a great set of headphones.
1,Sound quality isn't that good
5,I use them all the time - for a work education and leisure. The signal is strong even on the long distance. I like the comfortable shape and the fact they are very light. Would definitely buy this product for my parents.
5,The only thing I don't like about these headphones is the volume/fast forward button. They are the same little switch you have to just flick it for the volume but press and hold to skip it's quite annoying but these are still super duper nice
3,Picks up all noise in background. Owned a similar headset I thought it would perform the same. Not a good buy.
5,I really like this set.  I can keep around my neck so they don’t get lost! When you need them there right theregood sound easy to install on my phone
1,Work is what I tried to use them for
1,Wire from wrap around neck part to each earbud is SUPER thin and wouldn’t auto pull back in. The wire quality was so poor in our opinion that we immediately returned them.
5,Headphones are on the pricey side but they have excellent sound quality and good battery life. I’ve used the LG 780 headphones which don’t have the retractable earbuds and these are far more convenient.
2,I had an LG before and loved it. This one the sound goes in and out and sounds muffled. I do not recommend
5,I am glad to be back with an LG wireless headphones.  My last one stopped working and the one before that one fell apart.  For a while I was using wired earplugs.  Believe me these are WAYYYY better.  I am glad to be back to wireless.
5,These sound great are easy to use good value for money. Just wish the battery life was better but overall happy with purchase.
5,Los recomiendo
5,Muy facil de utilizar
5,I don't think you can ever go wrong with an LG... lol
5,Great sound great battery life. Functional easy to use.
1,Needed it for business VoIP phone calls and it will only go half a day
5,As presented in description looks new works great
5,Perfect
5,Product does what it says it can do.
5,Good headphones. Very good stability when around my neck.
5,sometimes on a call itll sound far away but other than that i love it
5,Good quality
5,Good service. They are easy to use.
1,Would not a charge for more than 1 hour.
5,Excellent
5,Good for the money
4,These do not function like by older LQ 830.
5,Good Headphones
5,Good Headphones
5,Great buy and comfort. I dislike the static.
1,Sold item didn't like them at all
1,None of them worked all of them had issues with voice clarity as in no one could understand me. My cheap backup works fine with same phone. These used to be quality
5,Great product and price
5,I love these headphones! I bought my first pair 6 years ago. Only reason I had to buy another was because I accidentally had a mishap with my cat chewing on the headphone wire. These are best headphones I’ve ever had because they are super convenient have amazing found quality never have to worry about losing a headphone like airpods and can easily connect by flipping the switch on the headphones rather than pairing them directly each time like airpods. I highly recommend to anyone who works out or is super forgetful like myself since they are always around your neck so you don’t have to worry about leaving one headphone somewhere and needing to buy a brand new pair!! They are not headphones to buy if you are looking for complete noise cancellation but they get the job done well enough to not hear things when trying to listen to music. This product lasts a long time and the charge last a long time!!
5,Love the LG tone
5,It's work very good
5,Love these headphones easy to use durable and long battery life! Highly recommended!
5,And the size and shape of the product makes them uniquely suited for my application I only wish they lasted longer the first two pair that I bought only lasted six or seven months each maybe I will have better success with the new pair
1,Sent a unit that I considered to be counterfit. Don’t bother.
5,LG products are very good I use it for everyday communication
4,I did buy this product renewed however the sound quality is wonderful for music but no one can hear me on the headset via bluetooth calls guess I should've bought it brand new
5,So these were the 1st cordless I ever bought in 2008. They lasted me a very long time. Over the yrs different brands have come out with their version and I even tried the pods but when I found out that Amazon still sells the LG brand of these I jumped on it! They're great for exercising with and they won't get lost because they're around your neck!
5,Used when I needed hand free conversations
5,works well
5,Works great
5,3rd one of these I purchased my favorite Bluetooth. Whether it's watching a movie playing poker or mowing the lawn LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. Down side while talking on phone  if move head to right or left it covers the mic so communication can be frustrating for those on the other end.
5,Gracias
4,Not as good as the old ones
5,Great item will do business with again
5,It's great for me cause I lose the earbuds.  This works and stays charged for a long time.
5,I've used these for years and I love them to me they are easier to use than the wireless earbuds and this refurbished one was perfectly fine. like brand new.
1,I was sold this product as new.In fact it is most probably either straight used or refurbished.Considering the condition it is in it is not worth its price.
4,Sound quality is good!
5,Good. All fulfill my requirement.
4,Noise cancellation not good
2,TV.  No volume control.  Difficult to set up on new tv.
3,el botón de off / on no funciona. Cuando lo apago se vuelve a encender estando apagado. Así que la única forma de desconectar los audífonos es desde el celular .Es mi segunda compra los primeros salieron muy buenos estos con defecto
