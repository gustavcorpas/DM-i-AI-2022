4,First pair sounded terrible ordered replacement only to get the same miserable product. The sound is heavily distorted. So much so as to be unusable. I'm handicapped & was unable to get assistance returning the earbuds so now I've paid twice for worthless earbuds to throw in the bin.
4,I broke a pair from three years ago and needed to replace them since I do not wish to use bluetooth earbuds near my fragile brain.  These work great. very loud.. and sturdy.  These are easy on my tiny ears and don't hurt them like apple ipod do.  Will purchase again as long as I don't let the vacuum cleaner eat them up.
4,I dislike the hassle of blue tooth earbuds so they work just fine once I put ear holders on them.
5,I received these ear buds with my first Samsung phone and have never found any that I like better they fit my ear just right and provide great sound.  I am a nurse and these fit like a stethoscope in the ears that is the best way to describe them.  most buds go straight into the ear these actually fit your ear canal to provide best comfort and sound.
4,They're not OEM as advertised however I didn't expect them to be anyhow. The lowest you can get a single legit pair for is $20 (which I also bought) and they sound pretty similar to these they're not tinny at all and they're pretty much just lacking on the bass side which the Samsung's are known for great bass they also feel pretty much the same which was most important for me. As a backup set these are fantastic not sure how long they'll last but for how cheap they are I'd be happy getting a month out of them if you have the authentic Samsung case from your original pair then storing them in that would be best if you plan to just throw them in a bag as the cord quality isn't very good so that'll help preserve their lifespan though any hard case will do.Side note I got these for about $10 for the 2 pack I wouldn't pay much more than that for these so if the price goes up to like $20 then you'd be better off just getting the legit single pair with over 1000 reviews.Update: It's been about 2 and a half months and the left earbud of the first pair I've been using is starting to go it's not completely broken but less sound comes out of it than the right one. I honestly expected these to last maybe a month each considering the 2 pack its about half the price of a single OEM pair so they're definitely worth the price bumped my review up to 5 stars for how long they've lasted will update again when they're both broken.2nd Update: the 2nd pair had the same left earbud die in less than a week so I dropped my review back down to 4 stars as I may have just gotten lucky with the first pair I've been using the OEM pair for the past few days and they definitely sound much better for music but just watching videos or podcasts there's not a huge difference. I'll be getting them again to see if I just got lucky with the first pair.
3,These headphones worked well initially and were comfy to wear but after 3 months neither side will work. There are no obvious tears cuts or fraying of the wires they just have stopped working.
4,The sound is very clear and the volume also.
3,They work just fine; same in nearly every way as the original that came with my galaxy phone but the quality of the speakers are WAY different. The factory isn't using the same high quality speakers in the earbuds as before so the sound quality is stifled and doesn't have the same amazing audio experience as the 1st generation models.
4,My son usess the item for his school Chromebook and found them to be very useful and quality sound.
5,Lovelove it so nice
5,Good light
2,As expected these are just cheap ripoffs most likely Chinese. These are not the samsung headphones that I have used for years. Just because they have the name stamped on them doesn't make them real.I only got these because they were cheap and I really really love the hook ear grip. Which I have a bunch of extra replacements that fit these headphones. The usual Samsung headheadphones I have been using for years have gone up to $50 from what used to be $20 so F that.That said these are pathetic. The sound quality is atrocious compared to real Samsung headphones which have some of the best sound I have ever heard in headphones. The auxillary jack is super finnicky and gets lots of static and sound volume going in and out so you have to wiggle it to find the right spot. Just all-around bad headphones.Only reason I gave 2 stars is because of cheap price and they at least work to a certain degree. But all-in-all I would bot recommend unless you just want something disposable.
3,Hasn't even been 3 months and getting left earbud has already stopped working out of absolutely nowhere. I guess that's why you get two because they don't last long. It was nice while it lasted though. They could usually block out basic background noise without the music having to be super loud and the ear pieces are comfortable despite having a tendency to slip out.
4,all over cord is a bit shorter than my old ones but that is not a problem; they fit my ears well! I hope the cord softens a bit over time it is rather stiff.
4,Like all Samsung products I've ever bought they worked and sound good
5,Good replacement for headphones and good deal allowing you to have a pair if one breaks or gets lost.
5,Noise cancelation is the best part as I can't hear anything around me with these on and the volume control is great and so is the sound quality. The price was also great because I got them on sale. However I would have paid full price because I like them that much.
5,My one ear piece for right was not working. Unable to return. I like them. 2nd time I have bout them. Would like a replacement for the one pair.
5,They're awesome!They're just like my apple earbuds from my old iPhone 6 but the volume up and down work for my android 😭😭😭😭😭😭It's so beautiful 😭😭😭😭😭 the volume up and down actually work 😭😭😭😭😭It feels like a miracleThey come with silicon but you can take them off and the cord is kinda flattened and thicker than my iphone earbuds these are absolutely the most usable earbuds I've ever had. And a 2 pack for 12 dollars is more than worth it I might buy more to stick up for the future!!!
5,These are my go-to when buying wired earphones. They have been reliable for me and are one of the few that still sell this style of earphone most have switched over to the earbud style that I don't like. These always come in a little plastic pouch with an extra set of the covers. The sound quality is always good even when they get older and the wiring cover starts to break. I have a pair that are about 2 or 3 years old now the wire running to right earpiece has a small split that kind of reveals the inner wire. So it was definitely time to order more sets. And unlike some other brands of earphones I have bought these have never failed producing sound in one of the earpieces on me.
2,I've purchased this item twice.  The first time the package contained one set and the cord was long enough to go on a walk and talk at the same time.  The second time the manufacturer decided to give us two sets instead of one at the expense of shortening the cord by 6.5".  That's a lot.  Now I cannot walk with a full stride without the cord tugging to pull out the earplugs.  I now have two sets but neither works properly.
3,I love the fit of this style earbud so when I broke the ones that came with my Samsung I was hopeful these would be an identical replacement. Here's what I found:- The fit is the same- Overall about 3 inches shorter than the original- The microphone quality seems to be the same. Others I was talking to did not notice a difference.- Audio is a little muffled. It's fine for talking but music is not quite as bright sounding.For the price I'm content but if you're critical of music quality and have some money to spend look elsewhere.
4,Worth it till your dog eats them
3,Like the price. However the sound quality is nothing special. These earbuds sound somewhat flat. I still have the original Samsung earbuds and their sound is spectacular compared to these.
3,Sound quality poor.  Base is poor.  Good for phone calls.
3,I have several pairs of these and they normally stop working in stereo due to my handling. they are not a sturdy as I would like. The slightest pull will cause the stoppage of one ear piece from working but i keep buying because i only use them when i walk and the price is right so i can get a couple months out of them before I have to buy another set.
4,Good for use with phone conversations.  Stay in my ears just fine.
4,Good for a wire
5,Work as she wanted. For reading and listening to her videos
4,The sound quality is good.The first one I ordered came in a hard black plastic case but I was disappointed with the second one I ordered because it just came in a plastic bag. See photos.
4,With all the bad reviews I think I lucked out and got 2 decent sets.  One set does crackle if you turn the plug while it's in the phone so I just don't do that. The other set crackles a little in one ear if the wire is wiggled.  I suspect that one ear will eventually quit working as my original pair did.  I compared them to my original earbuds and they appear identical.  For the price I am happy with what I received.  I use them mainly for phone calls and listening to spoken videos and books on tape.  The ear shape is the most comfortable for me and I was happy to find these inexpensive replacements.
5,Work fine and a good price.  I am very pleased
5,Love these headphones  since they first came out. Normally these are $30 in stores due to packaging and stocking fees. So it's nice to get quality without the price. I used to buy from Groupon  the 3 nundle deal for $22 but they would short circuit every few months. I bought 9 total with Groupon  so Ill see how these last. Will buy again if needed.
3,In my opinion these aren't the greatest for sound quality. But if you have tiny ears like myself these will fit you perfectly.
4,Pro: very comfortable good sound received 2 sets.Con: Rubber covers come off easily.
4,Lo pedí para utilizarlo en la oficina tiene buen sonido se me hace útil.
3,We have purchased a few types of these over the years one in 2017 one in 2019 and two in 2021. They seem to fail after a couple of years with constant use so we cave in and purchase another pair. We purchased this 2-pack in July 2021 and as of writing this review December 2021 one of them died... past the return window ;p[ Well guess it's good we still have the other pair but will expect them to fail in a year and a half ... Fingers Crossed
5,I had previously purchased these earphones and had them what seems like forever and I really liked them.  Then my dog chewed one of the earbuds.  I don't know what happened to the other set (I had two).  I finally ordered this new pair and they work as perfectly as the original ones.  I do medical transcription and they work so well that when my husband talks to me I sometimes don't hear him.  I like the sound quality.  I'm not a perfectionist just want to be able to hear the doctors when they speak and I hear them clearly.  The cord is long enough that I don't have to be right up close to my computer and I have room to relax.  The earbuds themselves are not quite as comfortable as others I have used but I have gotten used to them and they work just fine.
3,El sonido no es tan bueno y en ocasiones cuando se mueve el cable en la parte de entrada hay estática
3,Bought for my samsung phone and they don't fit
4,Works okay it's worth the price.
4,I finally received the replacement item after a long waiting period but I received it. Thank you!
5,Good all around
4,Doesn’t hold up to ruff handling
5,I don't even have words for how much I love these. I've bought probably 600 pairs of them. I am constantly losing or breaking them but because of how affordable they are I know it's never the end of the world. I have used this type of earbud consistently for probably 4 years now. Nothing beats them. I do on occasion use my Galaxy Buds but I am not a fan of having to charge my earbuds. So I use these. And I love them.
4,Good head phones
5,Cactus cactus cactus 🌵
4,These are some of my favorite headphones!! So glad there are 2. One was kinda static sounding but other is perfect!
5,Perfect as described. Sound quality is very good.
5,These worked really well.  And apparently they're water resistant.  One pair got washed with the laundry.  After sitting in a bag of rice they still work great.  No problems.
5,Although I have only used one of the two pairs of earbuds in this pack  I can tell you that I am very pleased. I wanted affordable earbuds I could use with my Samsung phone. These work great! I have not had any issues with them. They fit my ears perfectly and I am happy with the sound quality. Great value! I would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable brand name product.
4,Suenan fantásticos
5,Works great! Came with extra covers for the ear pieces too!!
5,Recomendado 100%
3,The unfortunate thing is I have had the corded active in ear headsets from Samsung.  Those cost more and of course work FAR better than these.  I didn't re-order them because frankly I have to buy them every 6 months as they stop working around that point.  As you can tell I use my headsets a lot and most clunk out before 6 months but I will say truly you get what you pay for.I really thought I was going to be able to get a very decent usage out of these cheaper samsung headsets but...not the case.  :(These headphones overall  are just ok.  The person on the other end says that I am not as clear as with the active.  The sound for me to hear them is somewhat lower than I am use to.  With the in ear active headphones I can have only one
3,Thought they'd be decent even for a knock-off sadly that wasn't the case. The other amazon "Samsung" headsets I've gotten were better. It does work and most of the time the sound is clear but there's better and clearer.
4,Average quality earfones. They work as expected. Very fast shipping.
2,I’ve been buying these for years because they are the only style of earphones that comfortably fit my ears.  Unfortunately increasingly the earphones don’t work upon opening.  Either one earphone won’t work or they will short out when listening.  The decline in quality Is extremely frustrating… and costly.
3,These are in all likelihood genuine Samsung earbuds. They do not seem to be fakes as other people have stated. Very well made and sturdy. That being said they do not fit snugly in my normal size ears. If you need earbuds to use when biking hiking running or even fast walking these are not a good choice.
5,Searched for the replacement Samsung earphones that usually come packaged with the phone.They are not the american oem kinda have this funnel for closer in ear sound.The sound quality is a lot flatter they are not bass heavy aswell.You get what you pay for can't beat two for the price of one.  I did not notice was shipped from England the shipping fees & time of delivery was consistent.Cord is about 4 feet.•••The takeawayShipped from overseas (not really free)Sound is a lot flatter less bass heavy.Not American OEMGood purchase for two.
2,After a couple of weeks can't hear out of one side
3,I am not a music person but the sounds on this headphone are pretty low quality. I usually don't give low feedback but I am sure that people interested in music or sensitive to sounds might give this a 1-star rating. Compared to the original headset that came with the phones it is of a different quality. I need it to listen to lectures so I don't mind but I prefer better ones.
5,I am a huge fan of Samsung and I just love these they sound great these earbuds sound as great as my husband's Bose which cost a lot more.  and for the price of these headphones you get much more than what you would have excepted! Also the sounds are clear and overall I would defiantly buy second set. This comes with 2 pair of ear buds. I've owned Samsung earbuds for multiple generations. They have excellent sound quality. These earbuds provide crisp clear sound that isn't overly heavy on treble and provides good bass. When I used them to listen to songs I've been playing on repeat I noticed new background symphonies that I didn't really pay attention to with my older ear buds. The trick to using these ear buds is to press them into your ear canal such that the earbud seals off the air going into your ear. This will boost the sound quality tremendously as I have discovered. I was thinking of returning them but it occurred to me that this trick could help and it did! They seem to be comfortable so far. the ear bud is a gel-like smooth material that is very soft. I highly recommend this as a buy!
2,Bought these after losing my old (and highly reliable) ear buds. Worked well in the beginning but after a month of SERIOUS use (I'm a recruiter) the static callers hear has made me give them up - both pairs. I can hear the caller clearly but on their end they hear a lot of static. As soon as I unplug from the phone they tell me the static is gone and the sound quality is normal. So now I'm looking for another pair that will last longer than a month...
5,I've only had Apple earbuds for my Samsung phone previously as my partner has an iphone and his earphones are great quality.  Needing another pair I bought these after going cheap for a 2-pack on Etsy that I had to throw away.  These are great.  Extra covers for the earbuds if the originals get gunked up. You can hear AND speak (the cheapies only allowed me to hear but I couldn't speak and be heard).  Very pleased.
2,I've had a pair of these before for around 2 years they worked wonderfully until about a month ago when the left earbud stopped working suddenly. So I ordered these a week ago I checked several times to make sure it was the exact same type and I've already experienced problems. The sound quality is alright nothing special the earbuds fit comfortably and come with spare coverings which is nice. I also like how there are buttons to pause and un-pause music and videos and turn up or down the volume. However I noticed a few days ago that whenever I am in some sort of call I could hear beeping noises in the background I'm not sure how to describe them. My old pair never had that problem I compared the new and old and both of the new pairs have the background noise but the old doesn't so I know it's a problem with the new earbuds and not my device. Plus one of the new pairs makes a loud static noise every time I plug it into/unplug it from my computer. I'm now starting to hear the background beeping regardless of if I'm in a call or not and sometimes a high-pitched ringing comes from the earbuds randomly.
3,When I look down buds start to fall out too many times I have to adjust the buds when on the treadmill
3,Stopped working soon after purchase
4,These earpods are more of a necessity purchase than a luxary. For $9 however you can't go wrong with two pairs of first-party earpods. I bought these because the AKG earbuds that came with my Samsung Galaxy S9+ were not so good for my ear (I cannot keep earbuds in my ears I much prefer earpods). The only issue I had with these earpods were that the gel on the pods would move around sometimes meaning I would have to realign them with the speaker from time-to-time. The volume/play controls on the right-hand wire had a bit of a delay from the time I would press them until the time the command was performed. All-in-all though I would recommend these earpods to people who want a solid first-party experience; the value is unbeatable for the price.
5,I only hear left ear my right no heartrying  not get mad trouble with right for long time
3,These ear phone sound and performance is great but they won't stay in my ears while running or working ok if your just setting at  a desk.
4,The buds were ok. One pair has trouble on the right side but overall they work. The sound quality isn't the greatest but what more can you ask for for 10 bucks. I recommend for just a casual pick up and listen. Want excellent quality your gonna have to spend more money.
4,They work
4,I have been using Sansung Earphones for a long time. Always ORGINALS from the box. I can tell this one are not the same material but are really good for workout and answer calls. The quality is NOT like the originals but work well for me. The size is exactly the same as the original. The sound quality is 90% (If you really want a good sound quality u should choose another brand). I will give 8/10
4,I got these to replace the original headset that came with my Samsung S6 active.  They are comparable in quality as the originals that came with the phone. The bass is clean the sound is crisp and the mids are very good. I'd say these are pretty decent and I use them every they. I like them. I like how there's a mic with volume control. It's made out of the material where it is difficult to get all tangled up which is nice. And again the sound and bass are good.I think the price is really good for what you get and I don't expect them to last forever using them every single day.  If you want super crisp sound and superb quality you should be willing to spend more money for a pair of earphones.My only problem is that it doesn't come in any other colors just white which is boring.
4,I have used this device for years.  I have purchased MANY.  Sometimes it is shoddily constructed but it is so inexpensive that I don't consider it a major drawback.  The biggest problem I have with earbuds in general is that the wires are a bit too long so they snag on things.I do not use it much for music so my assessment is based mostly on hearing voices clearly and my being heard clearly on calls.
3,Sound is good volume easy to control no outside noise interruption.  The fit is not comfortable they are too large and they are not soft.  My ears were sore within less than an hour of wear I had to remove them and was not able to finish even one movie while on a flight.
3,I bought the 2 sets from a seller on here other than Amazon so I am not sure if there is any different. Both sets look nice and have some weight to them which kinda make me think that these are better quality which is worth the price for what I paid. I have no idea whether these are authentic since I have not own a Samsung phone before. All I can say is the weight to the earphones seems like it is at least a bit higher quality than those cheap $1-3 earphones from overseas/dollar store. I only used one set for about 2 weeks so far and the quality of sound is quite good. I have not had any problem with it. I actually received two sets with volume buttons and call/pause buttons that does not work. However seller stated that the fulfillment was made from Amazon and replaced two new sets for me directly from their warehouse which call/pause buttons work but volume still does not. It could be that I am using an iPhone rather than an Samsung phone but just does not makes sense why call buttons work but volume is not. At least I be able to use it to speak on the phone while driving.  Overall 3 stars is worth the price and I like it a lot.
5,These have held up surprisingly well; I wasn't expecting much because of how inexpensive they were. I've had them for a few months and they're still working great. The shape is a bit strange to get used to but overall I'm quite happy with this purchase.
2,They do not stay in my ears when I move my head from side to side.  I do not have big ears either.
5,Nice price.  Like the silicone ear buds that stay in
5,This is such an amazing deal for those of you looking for a replacement set of headphones for your Samsung Smart Phone. I had just broken mine and found this deal on Amazon. They actually arrived within a day and was so happy to find out that they work just like my old pair. Now I not only have a replacement set but a spare on top of that for what I would pay far below at my local retail store. These are the same quality ear buds that fit inside your ear with the microphone and volume control attached to midway down the headset. You can't even tell these are not the same ones I got when I purchased my Samsung Phone. Would highly recommend this seller and the shipping time and packaging was perfect. In fact I would go so far as to say above my expectations. Will definitely keep this seller on my must buy from list. I would rate this product a 5 out of 5 stars.
4,I liked all them are good I loved my items excelent
3,Liked the price. Dont last long
4,Llegaron bien y funcionan muy bien
5,I'm a little surprised. I bought these on my phone without reading the reviews and after using them I do have to admit that the audio quality is lacking something (I'm hardly an audiophile so I can't put my finger on it. It feels like there's not as much impact with the sound so I'm assuming there isn't as much bass or something but again not an audiophile by any means — if I was I wouldn't be buying $10 Samsung headphones). But contrary to the reviews I'm reading on here they're hardly unusable. There's no static the sound is at least clear the buttons for volume and music control work just fine and while I haven't had the chance to check if the mic/call end button works I have no doubt that it does. It does say Samsung on the sides and it looks pretty much just like the picture. It comes with two of these and includes spare earbud covers (?). Honestly if you're buying headphones that literally cost $5/pair you can't really complain. T
4,Great for the price!  Would be nice if it were better quality.  Overall ok.
4,The product works very well. I love these earbuds because they are very comfortable in my ear.
1,Bought as a replacement for my last earbuds (same earbuds but from a different vendor that no longer has them for sale.) These earbuds had extremely tinny and bad sound quality compared to my last ones. The wire was also quite a bit shorter for some reason.
4,They look and sound like my original Samsung. Actually one does and the other has less volume on one side v the other but at least one works perfectly od 2 pairs so for the price still a good deal.
3,Lied it was only 1 in the pack not two
4,For the price these ear plugs work very well. They can feel awkward in your ear because of the length of the ear bud with the rubber and that negatively impacts the noise cancelation but besides that these are a great purchase. I would buy them again and recommend them.
4,Sound quality is good.There are points when the microphone does not work. Then the earphones die one at a time.it is for working out. My children do not work out but use then for online school.
3,I ordered as a replacement for my original earphones but the sound and volume is low quality compared to the original.  Not as fine sound as the original product.  The prices is right for the product.
2,It didn't last long and I would hear weird sounds coming from it that made me think that this item was bugged I wouldn't suggest buying it because it's highly likely not the real thing.
1,*** 2nd Update:  Was able to have this item exchanged and the same issue - one of the pair seems to have been used (residue on the volume aparatus as well as inside crease of speaker).  Each pair also had one earphone which registered very low audio - nearly inaudible sound.**Update:  One of two pairs was used - earwax or dirt found under silicon bud-covering.  I'm not kidding.  Just opened my second pair after the first I was using for about a month went bad (right earphone stopped transmitting sound).Note to self: Always check that second pair or item that you thought you got as a "deal" to make sure it's in working and new condition especially if you're going to put it in your ears to make sure it in fact is a "deal" to your liking not a "deal" to "their" liking.  I've waited beyond the return time so I've no recourse friends.Note to you:  It brings me no joy to write such a review.  On the contrary I'd prefer to have given 5 stars because I enjoy spreading love.*Initial Review: Great pair of earphones... if you are super gentle and handle with extraordinary care.  They are seriously fragile - not durable.  Expect to have these fail on you in some manner primarily the sound going out in one earphone within a month or two if you happen to commute or use these in transit.  These are my third pair of these (the first came with a Note 5 the second were through Amazon from a different retailer) and it's the same issue each time - one earphone fails and you're left having to order another pair.  Grrr.*note the second pair of these earphones I received (from a different retailer) were quite muffled actually so it's sort of a crapshoot.  For the price though it's worth the risk.
5,I keep coming back for more. For the amount of abuse they take (sleeping bathtub working out) I'm amazed they last as long as they do.I like them for the subtle midtones I can hear in my music.And I get frequent migraines and these have a quality of sound my sensitive headache can handle.They also don't go too deep into the ear canal so you can sleep in them without too much pressure on the ear.Just know they are cheap and if you abuse them you'll be replacing them often. At the easy price and good sound that's worth it to me.
2,Obviously these are knock offs and the sound quality isn't great but I was ok with that for the price but the first pair has stopped working after not even 2 months whereas the Samsung headphones that came with my phone lasted for a year so even as cheap as these are I'd say they're a waste of money.
4,They are as described.  The sound for music is a little tinny  the sound for the spoken word is fine. I don't use them for working out. The ends don't quite fit my ears so I have to adjust them often.For the price they're fine.
4,Love Samsung earbuds  integrate perfect with Samsung phones and i feel the audio quality is more than satisfactory.  The part I like the best is how they fit in your ears.  Of all the earvuds I've owned these fit in my ears thr best.
4,Products are OEM this means made with the same design and components as Samsung ordered for the headphones that they would bundle in the box with new phones. Difference is the headphones you get were never sold to Samsung and thus do not come from Samsung. They have been lots of complainta about defects....that happens....return them and have them send you new ones easy as that! Mine are working fine however it seems like they lack a bit of bass but my original ones broke so I cant compare the two :(I like them and I have a spare set which I decided would be best so I got the two pack.The are made in China though...I thought I was getting the ones from Vietnam but maybe that was for the singles not the 2 pack
5,Good earphone. I don't like the ones that you put inside the ears and this one fits perfectly for me. They don't get inside but don't fall down either.
4,I  received this item quickly two pairs of headphones.  My only complaint is that the rubber ear pieces don't fit flush in the ear they can fall out easily don't feel tight.  There is an extra pair of plugs but they are the same size as the ones included on the ear buds where as I needed smaller plugs for my ears.  They are also not noise-cancelling. Other than that (and I'm wearing these as I write this review) I much prefer the Wicked Jaw Breaker buds (flush noise-cancelling high quality) of which I own several pairs.  Wicked WI2154 Jaw Breaker with Mic Earbud - Yellow        Don't get me wrong they are adequate and are sufficient for my devices iPod Galaxy Note 5 Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Tab S.
3,I have been using apple headphones for a long time and have about 3-4 pair from all the devices purchased over the past few years. The apple buds sound great but they dont work properly in samsung devices so i decided to get a pair of these when i saw 2 pair for $10. These are the OEM headphones that you should get with a Samsung phone or device but only get with their high end devices now. They worked great and sounded great. I FORGOT HOW NICE IT WAS TO HAVE A PAIR THAT WORK PROPERLY ON MY GALAXY. I am only giving them 3 stars because despite my satisfaction I must report that one pair has already died in the right ear volume and play/pause button included. I had them in my ears and dropped my phone and the stress on the cable disconnected something. They are vastly more comfortable than the iPhone headphones I have definitely not as durable. I would buy these again if they were on sale but wouldn't waste my money on a pair of them at $20 to $30 when you can get a pair of bluetooth headphones for the same price
5,There was nothing to dislike.. Thank You Shun..
4,Llegaron a tiempo. Se escuchan bastante bien pero a veces los demás no me escuchan y tengo que jugar con él. Pero si es para escuchar música o videos es excelentes y la cantidad por el precio me pareció justa.
5,I love these headphones they don't fill your ear canal like earbuds so they're comfortable. This shape keeps them in place with no discomfort. I also love the mute/volume option on the wire. This is my 4th pair over 2 years so everyone in my house has a pair. I've only had one set break bc my son is a daredevil. Again great price and great product!
4,I would have given another star but one of the cover peace keep coming off. Should be one solid plastic peace like the Apple ipod. But i still like these and they are great ear buds
4,I don't understand all the negative reviews these headphones aren't bad and are at a reasonable price. My only complaints are that the cable is a bit too long to be comfortable and there's a little less bass than I'd like as most of my playlists are full of bass-heavy songs. I own a pair of bluetooth Beats which obviously sound much better but when I'm out in public I prefer to use a cheaper pair. These fit the bill and are good enough to satisfy me wherever.
3,Only one speaker works on the plane
4,Great i used them for work now that we have virtual meetings
5,So I love these earbuds and was so excited when they came. I teach Tk-1st students and they make it possible to hear what they are saying because it cancels out any background noise that I have. They are also comfortable to wear for long periods and my ears don't get sore. Plus it a 2 pack. This gives me an extra in case my bird chews up wires again.
5,These work extremely well. The protective cases are a must if you just want to throw these in your purse or gym bag.
1,I bought these as a replacement for the original earbuds that came with my samsung s7 galaxy edge. I loved those earbuds and they sounded great so I bought some before they died so I'd have a replacement on hand. Since my old ones were still alive I was able to compare them and the ones these sounds horrible in comparison nowhere near the same sound quality. They sound tinny and have much worse bass. They sounds like I'm listening to someone listening to music over a phone call. The look the same but the wires feel cheaper as well. Disappointing. Don't waste your money they're unusable if you care at all about your music sounding good.
4,Good hearing quality.  I received 2
5,This package came with two. Each child of mine has their own. Great out and input reception
4,The only bad thing I can say is that they don't last as long as I'd like.  I have to replace the two pairs every 9 or so months.  Otherwise they are great earbuds.
5,just what I wanted
4,Bad quality for Kareoke
5,Both sets of earbuds microphones didn't work.
3,Sound quality was good for this size. This particular set had stiff wires that made one out of two sets in this order unusable. They earbuds kept flipping out of my ear. The second set had a more normal feel to them so were earlier to keep in my ears but the microphone feature did not work which made this set unusable for work calls. I've ordered twice before different vendor similar issues on another order first time the set I received was perfect. I travel tons and have had Samsung phones for years. The shape of these are great ergonomically.
4,I am pretty satisfied with these.  I'm always losing my earbuds but always need them.  I listen to music for at least 10 hours a day while at work and working out.>The sound is okay  it's not as good as the sound quality from the earbuds you can put into your ear holes.>The mic works well and seems to go through clearly on phone calls>My biggest complaint is that they don't fit well in my ear and fall out often. I have to wear them in a strange way to get them to fit and usually have to tuck them under the arms of my glasses to get them to stay.
4,Headphones is ok for a back up plan to another pair. Sounds is not that great
4,They perform as they should.  The big issue I had was falling out of the ear when I moved a lot.
2,I bought these in early December got them about 2 weeks ago and they just broke for me today?? Sound only comes out of one ear I have never had a pair of earphones break This Quickly. It is impressive in the worst way.Would not recommend as noise canceling headphones. They worked fine WHEN THEY WERE WORKING. I cannot say they are worth the cost when they break that quickly.
4,I really like how these headphones fit into my ear very snug but without being too deep and uncomfortable like other earbuds. I have had them for awhile now and they still sit in my ear well they don't fall out. The sound quality was awesome at the very beginning but now that I've had them for awhile the left side will not produce sound sometimes; I have to play around with the audio jack to make both sides work at the same time. But hey that's where they're in a 2-pack! I don't use them with my Samsung phone regularly so I don't know if the buttons work.
2,I was so happy at first. Then a week in the first set started this horrible clicking sound. I decided to switch to the other head set. It seemed to be going well until I disconnected it from my phone to place on another phone and then the clicking started again. This time no matter how I moved the jack it did not go away. I switched between both so often I just stopped using them. Do not buy these to try to work out they just slip out and are more of a bother then a help. I'll stick to my skull candies and just call it a day. I have never struggles more with a pair of head phones. I guess you really do get what you pay for
5,The ear buds work as advertised and are very comfortable to use!!
5,i love them! my old Samsung phone came with a similar pair but i lost them and my new phone didnt come with a set. item just as pictured. i didnt read that they would send 2 for the price of one but that was awesome!
3,It was delivered a whole day late.
5,Bueno
2,They do not get loud enough- audiobook in the car was hard to hear on full volume.At anything above half volume the high pitch sounds like words with the letters "st" and "ts" are painfully sharp.And lastly they arent secure in the ear...You'd think the silicone grip would make them fit better than Apple headphones but they simply would not stay in place.Part of the volume issue was "fixed" if I physically held the headphones pressed firmly in place but obviously thats not a solution as they are loose 30 second later... and yes I cleaned them and my ears thuroughly and it made little to no difference.
3,Broke after a week of use. Look feel and act like the original equipment for my Galaxy S6+ but they sure didn't last like the original.I am hard on earbuds in general and they don't typically last long when I use them.  The original earbuds from my Galaxy S6+ lasted longer than any others I have owned.  I purchased these to try and replicate the experience.  It didn't work out as well.  I originally posted a review with 1 star because they broke so quickly.  Upon further reflection I adjusted my review up to 3 stars.Honestly these are at least as good as similarly priced earbuds available all over the place so they aren't horrible.  I just had higher expectations because of the brand and my previous experience.  Now I need to find a relatively cheap pair of earbuds reinforced enough to take the abuse I dish our.
2,I have ordered these headphones a couple of times and each time (especially this recent purchase) one of the headphones doesn't work or I only get sound in one of the earpieces. The first time this happened I thought it might have been the device I was using but I have tried the same pair on several devices and still the same thing. The other pair however works very well I don't have any problems. I thought maybe it was just that pair but even this pair of headphones is the same way. It just stinks cause I need 2 pairs so that I have a pair at work and at home.
4,They lasted a pretty long time. One pair was an "experimental pair" that I didn't take EXTRA care with. The other I did leave at home and used it for other times when I couldn't find the experimental pair. Needless to say I ended up not being able to hear out of one ear and the silver back part came off of the same side. The other pair are still working fine but do have a lot of static. I would recommend these to be your pair for about half a year until you can buy better ones since they are cheap.
3,The sound quality was good and they felt good but both did not make it past 5 months.
3,Right side plays at a lower volume than left.
3,Average quality headset
4,It sounds good and I sounded clear
2,Purchased these to use for work.  1 never worked and the other one lasted a month.  Very poor quality product that doesn't have any longevity. Sounds like a tin can when playing music.  Would not recommend.
5,Like sound quality and fit in my ears
4,Its okay for the price
4,When using it on phone calls some people said it sounded like a helicopter was near me... I was inside. But it works adequately well.
4,Sounds good for the most part
4,It does job great deal for pkg of 2
5,Best earbuds ever! They're wired which is awesome because they're just better. And they're long enough and they're sturdy and these are my favorite! They were great and I've ordered extras so that I have them. That way I can have one in the car and one home Etc.
1,right side didn't work on either headset.  Piece of junk!!!  Didn't open it until too late to return it.  Don't buy this product.
4,One side stop working after a few months.
5,Liked the extra pads. Comfortable fit.
5,These came in an original Apple container and are great for any Android. They have a 3.5mm male connector so they won't fit an iphone.
4,Great to use for talking on the phone.
5,Very nice headphones
1,I ordered these again because the FIRST order was great we received the proper product as well as the correct quantity and they worked great for a long time..... HOWEVER our SECOND order (this one here) was a disaster!! We NEVER received the correct quantity! The ad states that it's a 2 pack which is what we received with the first order.... however when the second order came in we ONLY received a single set and it was DEFECTIVE you could only hear out the one ear piece!! I contacted Amazon who immediately processed a replacement order we had to wait another week+ to get the replacement.... and AGAIN ONLY RECEIVED A SINGLE SET!!! I contacted Amazon AGAIN and they immediately processed a refund! I WILL NO LONGER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS SELLER!! THEY FALSELY ADVERTISE THE QUANTITY AND THEN SENT DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS! NOT WORTH THE TIME MONEY OR FRUSTRATION
5,Love them
5,I ordered these headphones since it came in a two pack and had a free $10 gift card.  Not disappointed since it was $7.99 and free shipping but this Is likely a knock off product.  Both pairs had sound in one ear after one day and slightly ripped-I’m kind of rough my purse. I would not recommend simply because It’s best to get a high quality pair.  If you need a quick cheap set of headphones to hold you over until you get a quality pair get these and you get 2.
2,Product does not work efficiently.
4,These are not very loud. They are probably designed for taking calls vs. streaming music or video. For the price however these are useful as backup headphones w/ a microphone.
5,These headphones are awesome! They sound great! I bought headphones at Target for $40 but they were huge wrapped around my head over my hair. The ear things were big they went over the ears. The bad thing was when I worked out they got sweaty and smelly.I bought these to work out with they completely replaced the huge ones. They sound as good and they fit perfectly on my ear. I had some like there from Phillups they sounded great the first time but then not as much. These are great. The ear pieces are different than Phillups too. I love these next time I need head phones I'm buying more of these.
3,I have purchased many of these in past.  This set has some static in right ear.  Also they seem to be larger then previous sets.  They hurt my ears.
2,I started using them the second I go them and I was very carful with them. About 2 weeks after arrival The left sound one the first one stopped working a so did the volume buttons. I started using the 2nd pair and the right side stopped working but the volume buttons still worked. Honestly they still work but you can hear a lot of noise and its not as loud even with the volume all the way up. I wont not recommended buying these. They are also not OEM like they claim to be. I didn't give them a one star because they worked nicely before they broke.
4,It works as described. Nothing special about it but nothing bad as well
5,All I can say is perfect.  I couldnt find the pair that came with my (company) Tablet.  These in fact are the exact same ones that came with my work tablet.  Very happy.  And work great.
3,They weren't even worth me returning. Very old school. Thanks but no!
2,They may or may not be counterfeit but the quality is not not what I expect from Samsung. They worked well enough for basic use for as long as they worked at all. I was told I could be heard clear on calls and I used them most of the day to listen to podcasts and music.  I am old fashioned in that I treat all electronics with care but one pair had an earbud fail within a month the other is holding up but is lightly used since I bought a different pair.In other words they are as good as any cheap headset I've purchased in the past for a similar price. Please pass to electronics recycle center when they inevitably fail.
1,Within a few wks one the left ear stopped working couldn't hear my music. Purchased the 2pk for backup lucky thing I did or didn't as I might face problems with that one as well.
4,Sounds good but doesn't block sounds quality is not very good.
5,I like it. It worked perfectly for one and half year.  This  time came 2 for the same price not bad. The sound quality is good to me and people listen to me very good.
5,Are these TRULY 5-star earbuds? Eh probably not. But they are some of the more comfortable ones I've worn in a long time (that are as affordable as these are).Many people complained about they were not what they got with their phones. These are EXACTLY like what came with my Note 5. I bought the 2 pack to replace my original pair that broke (after 7 months) while I was at work not paying attention. If it wasn't for that I'd still have my original pair.So if you like the earbuds that came with the Note 5 and (I'm assuming) S6... I highly suggest getting these as a more than affordable backup.
5,When you don't necessarily read everything carefully and expect a single set of headphones and are surprisingly opening up TWO sets of headphones it feels like a real bonus! These are exactly like the headphones that came with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which everyone with a headphone jack has been stealing in my house.  This solved all the problems I had from my headphones going mysteriously "missing."  They don't tangle easily owing to that flat cord.  They will tangle but they are not as obnoxious as other brands!  The sound quality is good the ear bud covers are comfortable and it's an amazing deal!
3,Got the two pair earphones one worked the other doesn’t work just static in and out noise. Sound quality is okay but for the price it’s decent. Some of these earphone may or may not work.
3,These really have the look feel and sound quality of those free headphones you get for free on airlines.  Not good quality to have a Samsung logo on it.  I would not buy again.
5,I purchased two of these (four sets total) because this is the only set my daughter likes and I can't find them anywhere else.  The shape of the earpods fits more snugly into her ears and they're more comfortable to wear for longer periods.  She accidentally washed her last pair in the laundry (that she's had since she got her phone over a year ago).  So I went ahead and purchased a bunch in the hopes she'll have them for a few more years.  Samsung needs to keep these in production as I have seen off brands trying to imitate them but not coming close.
5,I think these are great. I don't like the headphones that wrap around your ears or the ones that stick all the way into your ear I like the "old fashioned" (apparently) ear buds that sat just inside the ear and these are as close as I could find. They don't put a lot of weight on or into your ears they actually are pretty comfy the sound is good and the buttons all work. I have been using them mostly for watching Netflix and they handle all the noises and music beautifully. And two? One for on the go and one for at home!
4,second order of these for a family member came in slow but overall these headphones are durable and comfortable I have slept with them on many times.They also come with replacement covers incase the originals rip or get dirty. Sound quality is good and mic quality can be a little muffled but overall works as intended. The volume adjustment works on my Samsung Phone and Tablet as well as the answer button. the answer button can also pause video so it is very useful.
4,Exactly what I needed great sound good noise cancellation Samsung usually has good quality
1,Do not buy. The volume button doesn’t work and people can’t really hear you talk.
5,I have been using this headset since March 2021. It's been awesome. Seriously.  Worth it.
3,I don't think these are OEM. Very tinny sounding. No bass. Not like my originals I received with the phone.
4,Great earbuds same ones that came with Samsung phones pre 2018 (i believe). Good sound quality.
3,Only one of them work. Am very disappointed 😞
5,The quality of the sound was the only reason I bought them for and they work perfectly. Sounds better then any other ear buds I've spent money on. They last quit awhile too. If you take care of them.
4,Shipping was fast and packaging is very simple. I love how the earphones come with an extra pair of rubber tips which feel great in my ears. I can tell that these are knockoffs being that the lettering is a lot smaller than the originals. Sound quality is a bit worse but I can barely tell the difference. Overall a great product. Given 4 stars because these are not as advertised the earphones are not Samsung Electronics brand OEM headphones.
4,IT'S AMAZING.This truly represents a quality that it totally irrelevant to it's cost. I was tempted to go with the flaw and buy the "spendy top of the line"  eadbuds but i convinced myself anything that's outside the comfort zone always works and it certainly did. I highly recommend this great anticipated pair (comes in two pack)  as it guarantees what it's been for.Good price good pair what else you need beyond that?
5,Me gusto tienen buena longitud del cordón se escucha a buen volumen prefiero 100 los auriculares de este tipo no tienes que estar recargando
4,Value for money
5,I bought these for my husband to use to hear music on his way home from work. Since it comes in a 2 pack I have a pair and like to use them to make phone calls hands free. The sound quality is great!
3,One of the two ear buds already had a crack in it. When I was changing the cover I noticed the crack. I just received them. I will be sending back. Great price however for 2 pair. They work as well as any Samsung product.
5,Before I bought them I asked if the earbuds were like the original ones that come with your new phone and got different types of answers. People were saying that they weren't like the original bad sound quality they're cheap no bass etc. So I had to get them and try them out for myself and I was really impressed!! Good sound quality has bass sounds like the original ones brand new and I got two types of earbuds as shown in the pics. I would totally recommend these. If your earbuds are defected or aren't working properly as I mentioned just get a replacement.
4,(Have had them only an hour or two) They look feel and sound exactly like my Samsung headphones i got with my phone about a year ago (which is good).  I have had several Samsung headphones sets and after about a year or so one or both the earbuds short out which is definitely not great but havent had any better luck with the quality of other brands especially at this price.
2,Yeah don't buy this. I bought these because they were the same design as the headphones I got with my phone years ago. My original pair finally lost sound in one of the speakers so I ordered these as a replacement. Hearing sound from both ears was amazing.Then the sound shorted out in the left bud after about a month. I thought it was from walking in the rain but now I am really second guessing that. I was thankful for the second pair and used those for about 3-4 months before the right side stopped. That meant the mic and volume buttons also stopped working. I used my headphones to take calls for work when I'm at home and with the broken mic I was definitely more inconvenienced than not being able to listen to music.One headphone okay maybe I damaged it in the rain. Two headphones failing within a few months? Yeah that's a sign of a bad product. I Shame because I liked how they fit in my ears.
5,They're my favorite type of head phone I am updwt samsung has ruled out the headphone port on the new phones. I won't be able to use these again.
5,Excelente
5,Samsung brand headset works well with my Samsung S6+ - there is no background noise on the receiver end with these.
4,The price is reasonable for the quality. Thank you.
5,I didn't want to guess if it was going to work on my Samsung Galaxy J3 phone- it is made for it so it works.
3,Sound quality is great volume control is working well too
5,use for phone and other devices
3,First pair broke after a week. So fair second pair is doing good.
1,I guess you get what you pay for...  The cord is already damaged at the connecting end to my phone.  The covering has deteriorated.  They still work but I don't expect it will last for long.  Dissappointed...  Additionally it is advertised as 2 pair - deceiving...  you get 1 with 2 sets of covers for the ear pieces.
5,Excellent sounds and mic save me from lots of radiation caused by a blue tooth will order more.
5,I love the sound quality of these ear buds.
5,I usually loves these ear buds but the 2 pack I bought had very different sound quality. One set was great the other had one side louder than the other.
1,Both sets of these earbuds crackled like a campfire in surround sound. I checked to be sure they were fully plugged in but both were terrible. No quality control at all. I had thought since they said Samsung like my original pair they would work well. Those original ones were great until the 2nd year when one side finally went out. These were bad straight out of the package the first time I used them. The first pair not only crackled and had poor overall but a malfunction in the volume adjustment. I wondered why my podcasts were still playing but no sound came out. The - on the volume control kept engaging to mute with any movement. The second pair crackled or went off with any movement even walking. Useless garbage. Don't buy.
1,The only lasted me a week before i couldn't hear anything on either earbuds. I tried contacting the seller with no luck. Im not one to leave a bad review but i don't know what else to do.
3,I had ordered these a few years ago and loved them. I used both pairs until they were worn to the point of unusable. I decided to buy them again but these aren't working very well. When I press the volume up button it turns on the Google assistant. Also the right headphone in one of them isn't as loud. The most annoying part is that they randomly turn the sound all the way down. I may have just been given two duds but I'm pretty disappointed with these ones compared to the previous ones.
3,They work ok.The left earbud didn't have good sound right away and now no longer works.Only the right earbud works and does not have good sound.
3,Not bad I use it for evening PC routine
5,Dude I literally had my phone on one of the highest settings yet my family literally couldn't hear my music. 😧
3,Only 1 of the 2 pair worked and the quality isn't that great as they have been packaged too long and the wiring has broken down on the pair that sort of works.
5,Great sound and noise cancelling.. worth the the money.. good backup for when the battery of your expensive wireless ones die..
3,Good sound qualitypoor ear comfort.
3,Although the sound quality is fine I call not use them to talk with someone on my phone. It put out an awful output loud on the receiver end .
5,This product was everything I wanted in a wired headphone set. The mouth peice works with my phone which is rare.  The earpeice fits perfectly in my ear canceling out the noise around me and not falling out which makes it great for working out. One set came defective but they very quickly sent me new ones and the return was easy.. It also brings up this awesome quick access tab in my pull down bar when I plug them in. I wI'll be buying more very soon only because I'm always misplacing mine.
4,These are great earphones to use with any android device since you can control the volume and play and pause from them. They are pretty comfortable in the ears and much more comfortable than in-ear earphones. The sound quality is decent however don't expect anything very spectacular. The frequency range is pretty good but can sound a little muddy in some areas. Overall great for casual listening.
3,Don't last much only 2 weeks then one side stopped working
1,I had the real Samsung earbuds that lasted for years. BEWARE: These are not OEM as stated they are knockoffs. Both pair broke within a week of usage. (No sound from the left bud on one pair and no sound from the right bud on the other pair.) The seller was extremely difficult to work with. I ended up just eating the cost of my purchase and have nothing to show for it. Lesson learned!
5,While I'm glad I can find this item online quite easily and at a great price I wonder how long exactly are they supposed to last. This is the second pair I've bought in a little over a year. It's always one side quits working.
1,These are unusable.  The person on the end of your call hears a buzzing or static.  These are terrible and of course not returnable.
3,This was second purchase of these headphones because I really liked them but my first pair bit the dust while traveling. (My fault; I wasn't watching where the excess cord was and they got caught on an armrest while making my way down a plane aisle. C'est la vie.) The second set I ordered arrived with one of the two pairs having a short in the right (microphone) side - a little static and no audio through that side (thought I'm told the mic still works). Bit of a bummer but they're so cheap it's hardly worth the trouble to ask for a replacement.
3,In mine one of the set wasn't working but it was just the left earbud but otherwise they work great
5,I saw some negative reviews and ordered anyways. They appear to be real Samsung buds to me. I've used one pair for several months and they still work despite being accidentally being yanked several times.
5,Son muy buenos de buen material aunque no son muy buenos para hacer ejercicio se salen mucho de los oídos como que es muy resbaladizo  por lo demás me gustan mucho
2,The head phones which go into the ear keep coming out of the ear every few seconds.
5,These earbuds are just as good as the original. They look exactly the same and come with a case and extra tips incase they fall off or you lose them. They are super comfortable and all of the controls work. They look just like what was showed in the picture and having two pairs for that price is totally worth it. Other people said they got two different types but mine are the same as the ones pictured. They aren't Beats or Bose quality but they work well and are worth the money
3,Maybe I received a defected item it's been 2 months since I received it in the mail.  Right side earbud stop working I tried straighten out the wire hoping it was just a glitch but hope... it's broken already.
4,It's just what I ordered however the last time I ordered these headphones they came in the hard plastic cases. This one was just in a plastic bag. Product is fine however for now. Last ones stopped working after a few months just like the factory ones from my Galaxy phone so nothing against the seller just think these products aren't meant to last very long.
5,They work and sound pretty good
4,I like this earphones. Good quality sound. It doesn't come in luxurious boxes which at the end doesn't matter. Box goes to trash anyways. They look nice and very comfortable Much better than those from department stores that cost 25 dollars and last 2months and sound is not good. I would definitely recommend it if you lost you original earphones.
1,I have ordered these 2 different times. The first 2 sets worked awesome so I thought I would order more for other members of our family. The next order I did 4 sets. Well every single set has stopped working in the left ear. The use of this range from one set the left ear didnt work at all to I just started using the last set and it worked right for 4 days.
5,This pair of headsets is genuine Samsung and performs exactly like those that came with my Galaxy Note 5 when it was new.  Great price and they perform as expected.
3,Update: The second pair began fully functional. However after about a month of use it too lost functionality in one ear.The headphones are likely OEM: made in China one left one right circular buttons long bit on the output look like my original headphones. HOWEVER the quality is VERY POOR. Within seconds of the first use the right earpiece stopped working. After moving the earpiece around a few seconds I got it working for all of 3 seconds. I've had the headphones for less than 24 hours. Will update when I check the second pair. Seller was the Amazon fulfilled seller.
5,sounds great works well
2,I changed original headphones for these and the sound is completely different.These have very high pitch and no bass (actually pretty uncomfortable to listen to for too long)They work well (besides sound quality): stereo + volume control and look good.
5,The product arrived as advertised. I have been using for all my calls. I didn't face any issues with the sound or mic.
2,These were so easy to break! When you roll them up for storage it makes it easy to mess up the wire. I just really didn't like these.
4,The ear buds initially acted wierd and required twiddling the cable to get audio but after about a week it stopped for some reason. One of the pairs didn't have a functioning pause/play button or volume buttons but other than that the pairs are identical to the ones I got with my s7 edge. The sound quality is amazing and these are awesome.
2,received these about a week ago I noticed right away the crackling noise and cutting in and out of sound ANY time I move the chords. The sound quality is not good either. Negligible bass and the treble sounds a bit cloudy despite adjusting my equalizer for both. They aren't good quality at all. these are not up to par at all.
5,I like the fact that I received just exactly what I had envisioned and it arrived on time.
2,Saw multiple complains already in the review section I agree those do not have the same quality as the original Samsung headphones of the same model. A while ago I got a pair of these headphones from this seller and they were quite good except at some point they broke and I had to get new ones. Then I got 2 packs one pair had a broken right earplug not working mic and buttons already when i opened it. the other pair started having problems on day 2 of use mic was not working buttons stopped working after several days too. The speakers themselves seemed damaged as well one of the pairs had right earplug much quieter than the left one when I just started using them. The whole construction is sloppy I really hope they fix the quality of these headphones.I ended up using them anyway to listen to music and didn't bother to return but this is the last time I've bought those. I really liked this model...
5,I love them the first pair I had I drop them in water. You can answer your phone with them. They are great I have had many of them but these are my favorite.
3,These are basically the same headphones that came with my S5 or S6. I bought these because I missed the way they felt in my ears after using the AKGs included with my S8 and S9. The tuning by AKG makes a huge difference but these are still comfortable in the ears and still produce pretty good sound from stock headphones. Not as good as the Apple Earpods or the newer offerings from Samsung but still pretty good.
1,I bought these because I liked the comfort provided by the ones that came with my Samsung S10 and these were allegedly the same thing. The right earpiece started going in and out on the third use of the first pair. The second pair had the EXACT same issue on the second use. If these had been free the cost would have been too high.
4,LOVE the shape of these headphones and the sound is good. Wish the industry would make this shape with 2 speakers the standard. I had two that came with our new phones they lasted about a year each so not great but not bad considering the price. Hope these last longer because I love them!
5,Works perfect! I was surprised it came with 2 pair. I didnt even notice it was a two pack lol
5,These come with a pair silicon covers. They do their job quite well. Highly recommended.
2,Long story short im a letter carrier and I use headphones daily for about 6 to 9 hours. The first pair within the first 3 weeks the right earbud broke. I started using the 2nd pair and within a week you guessed it the right earbud broke. I give it a 2 star on the fact that the sound quality was actually pretty good
5,Its looks and feels like the same Earphones you get when buying a new Samsung phone. I am very happy with them. Will buy again...
5,Got them for my kids to use on their laptops for school and they love them. Sound quality is great and awesome on noise cancellation.
2,If you want these for talking on the phone don't waste your money. They're definitely not OEM quality from sound build or any aspect. They are unusable for talking on the phone due to static. The best value in these is to use the earpieces on your real Samsung headphones.
5,these perform just like my original set that came with my S7. My entire family uses these. They are great and affordable. They don't ever break or quit working....replacement is always due to loss.
4,Great sound the quality overall was decent. For me it was worth the money. The sound did go out but they lasted me for a couple of months. I had no problems. The shape of the earbud was quite comfortable as well. I recommend these.
1,One worked for a short period while the other did not work. I couldn't return because I would have to pay alot.
5,These earbuds seems to be original with Samsung quality. So far they have been working OK.
4,Cant really say anything bad about these they were purchased for a cousin in central America who was asking for original Samsung buds like these. He cant even tell they were bought online which prices its legitimate.
5,These headphones are great.  Don't let the cord  fool you.  Great microphone clarity.  Good sound and they stay in my ears.
4,I use these to replace the ones that came with my s7 they're not the same the cord is shorter and stiffer and the mic isn't as good quality.
4,I was worried about getting head phones since I tend to have really small ears. These head phones actually fit well and they seem to cancel some outside noise. It doesn't cancel a significant amount but enough to make a difference. I really recommend these they even have a handy volume adjustment on the wire.
5,Out of 2 one's right ear piece didn't worked working earphones sound quality ia good
3,They're not that loudthe earbud covers keep coming offand they kept falling out of my ears
1,*** UPDATE: as of today the right headphone stopped working. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Better yet!If you hate someone like you're breaking up with someone you found out is cheating on you! BUY THESE andGIVE THEM AWAY! Great prank and poor quality as a gift for someone would be a great F#$*I YOU!I don't post reviews often. . but these headphones have me feeling some kinda way. HORRIBLE!!!!Please oh please do yourself a favor my dear amazon shopper friends DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!I've had the Samsung S5 S6 and S6 Edge all with original headphones. OK so I though tobuy a new pair for work and guess whaaaaat!! They sound like s***. Actually static distorted s***.I wish my eardrums could be cured from such noise but lesson learned. If more than one amazonshopper is WARNING YOU DO NOT BUY THESE! You should listen why in the world do theseheadphones have SAMSUNG printed on them. They sound bad trust and believe. Place twouncooked beans in your eardrums to get a similar sound and save your money. Good luck !
4,Both pair lost hearing in one of the ear pieces when the cord got caught on something and jerked away from me. I have no doubt that they were original Samsung headphones but was just surprised that one tug on each one of the headsets was enough to cause this.
5,These are just the same as the ones my Samsung came with I have a hard time with earbud fit but these stay in sound great and very very affordable!
3,They hurt in the ears
4,Good quality but not as loud as the head set that came with the phone. The ear jellies came off way to easily. Sound was crystal clear and the performed well other than the two issues I mention before. I would buy them again if I really need to.
1,This did not work for me.
5,Love these it works perfect for playing video games you can hear everything talk normally so no problem at all
5,⁸
4,Great sound never had complaints that prole couldn't hear me throught the mic. Only problem is the gel cover on the ear buds comes off way too easily and then they don't fit in your ear properly. They do send spares but I've already lost one of those too
5,Volume and quality of sound of these seems better than Sony . For someone getting up there in age it great. Mic quality seems better than most. According to the people I'm talking to. Picks up voice even with a lot of background noise. Don't have to yell. Very happy with these why I bought 2 at same time.
1,The first pair of headphones of the pack didn't last a week. The connection between the jack and the microphone unit got super loose and now the right bud doesn't work. The second pair works but is starting to have the same issues. I know that they are cheap but I expected them to last longer. Look elsewhere!
5,Takes awhile coming from UK  but customer service was prompt and the price was unbeatable.
5,Covid has made earphones a must for calls and zoom these are great sound excellent don't need to charge they last as long as you want!
1,Headphones didn't work good
5,esta bueno para llamadas telefonicas
5,You can't beat the price for 2 pair of simple corded earphones with a microphone.  They overall sound doesn't go as loud as some others that are of similar style but they're small clear and affordable
2,Headphones lasted maybe a month before crapping out. Basically it made it hard for the other person to hear me while talking on the phone because the headphone got a short in it. I always kept the them neatly put away in my drawer to prevent a short but it happened to both headphones anyway
5,Although I enjoy these earphones they do not last long. I get a good month's wear and have to purchase more. Unsure why but it's always been like that with these.
4,I bought these to replace my originals after I accidentally washed and dried them. These are a 2 pack - one pair was a perfect replacement but the other had was louder in one ear than in the other. I guess you get what you pay for!
4,They are the most comfortable.  But the volume control doesn't work.  I have them hooked up to an Apple iPod.
5,Works fine comfortable shape
5,Tiene gran calidad y potencia de sonido en relación al precio.
3,Definitely not the quality of headphones you'd get with a new Samsung phone. I'd frequently lose sound from one earbud or the other but neither cut out completely or permanently. I hesitate to say that these are knock offs but it seems like samsung keeps a big pile of crappy headphones that they sell independently from what youd receive with one of their products.
4,The sound is great but I usually like to write a review after I have had them for quite some time and honestly I'm a little disappointed becasue one pair has already begun to act up and I could only hear from one side which kinda sucks since I really like them
5,Very nice worth the price. Excellent soundcancellation and volume control.
4,These are excellent but from time to time they will send you one that doesn't work right! Send it back! They will refund your money. Other than that they work excellently. I know cause I lose them all of the time! :-)
3,Thankfully it came in a two pack because on one set the volume control doesn't work and on the other set the microphone doesn't work. I got these so that I can answer the phone while running without having to fumble with my armband. The ones where the volume doesn't work are fine for that since I don't mess with the volume very much anyway. In this case I would say that you get what you pay for adequate but certainly not great.
1,I compared the new units to the same unit provided with my new Galaxy S10e purchased in 2018. Could not believe the units I received were genuine Samsung.
1,Got this for my kids and I think Amazon combines all of the headset reviews based on the type.  I forgot the seller we got this headset and it's always been a hit or miss.  Sometimes from certain sellers you get a great product.  Thinking you're buying the same thing and not realizing that it's a different seller the ear buds don't last  At least that's been my experience in getting the 'I think are the same headsets' but are different.  These didn't even last a month but our previous ones are lasting for at least 6 months.  First with these the mic broke then the right ear bud stopped working and finally it just stopped working all together.  Since my kids use these daily and they are looking for one with a mic I thought these would be good since it's a Samsung product.  At least that's the description.  I guess I'm back to looking for new headsets and will write down the seller so I will know who to order from and who not to order from.
5,These are great earbuds highly recommend them and they have good sound quality. Would definitely buy again!
5,The sound quality is ok the noise cancellation is ok good for working out.
3,They Aren't the same that came with the phone. The quality is way different it sounds like it has water damage. One pair of the headphones sound really terrible while the other is decent sounding but still doesn't nearly match the quality of the original ones. Lastly whenever you use them to talk to someone on the phone they hear static so basically you get what you pay for. They aren't terrible but once you've used the original pair you'll notice the difference.
1,Not worth it. Lasted 1.5 months !! And now can't return or exchange. Past 30 days.! Started out good and then..Gliched out phone noise ringing muffled sound. Shock feeling to the ears. And not just 1 but both pairs that came in package did the same thing. Very upsetting.!!
4,Great quality the only issue is that the volume controls do not work. Otherwise they are comfortable don't have a tinny sound and work great especially for such a low price. They arrived to my home (Canada) in under a week so delivery speed was impressive as well.
4,They block out surrounding noise decently but I am sure there are other brands that are better. Rich sound. Just wish they could last longer. One side always dies.
1,The mic stopped working after the first day they feel like cheap plastic.
2,These earbuds are very comfortable however they do not last very long. The right side seems to have some sort of defect with them. I have had to purchase multiple sets of these just in the last year as the right side keeps going out on them. In fact I purchased my last set on December 31st. The right side went out in February so I barely got a month use out of them. I pulled out the second pair I received when I placed my order and the right side already did not work. And here I am past the return cut off time frame so now I am more or less stuck with all these ear buds that no longer work properly. Needless to say I have finally learned my lesson and switching my orders to a new company.
1,I bought these headphones because my old OEM Samsung headphones were starting to give out. At first I thought I just hadn't pushed in the connection enough so the sound was a bit scratchy but after about 2 weeks my husband mentioned that when I was talking to him on the phone with them it sounded like I was ten feet away from the mic. This morning I opened the second set and right away my husband said it still sounded like I was ten feet away from the mic and the sound quality again was scratchy. I always use Samsung OEM headphones because they are comfortable and up until this point have been  good quality. I don't know if this was a bad batch or they're not OEM but I am unable to use either set. Very disappointed.
5,I will give the product five stars just because they arrived on time and they both worked. They are Samsung product but these are made in China. Not the same sound quality and the one's that are original and made in Vietnam. Trust me on this one i compared these to my mother's sound is not the same. Hers are made in Vietnam and these where made kn China. Just go the extra mile and make sure you order yours from Vietnam.
5,Great Audio
2,THESE EARBUDS DIDN'T MAKE IT FOR ME AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO PLACE IN MY EAR CANAL I HAD TO REVERT TO THE BUDS THAT THESE WERE SUPPOSED TO REPLACE. I CAN'T COMPLAIN DUE TO THE VERY LOW PRICE THOUGH. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THEY WORKED.
5,2 for one price. Very good deal
3,These are Samsung earbuds that I use on an S7 so I don't have to worry about compatibility issues with any of the buttons. They get the job done and while they sound better than a lot of cheap buds they are terrible at noise reduction. If you're on public transportation be warned you'll lose a lot of sound. They're best for listening to talk more than music on the street or a bus. They're fairly worthless on the subway.
3,I would give them a 5 but one pair only works on The Right Channel.  Other than that great
5,When I began searching for some decent ear buds never did I imagine that I'd find the actual Samsung ear buds. This was like striking gold these cost 3 5 times as much in the T- mobile store. Not only are they a whole lit cheaper they're the real deal. Quality sound and a great price. I was just looking to try out some cheap generic brand but found the real thing. I LOVE THEM.
5,Sound quality excellent. Comfortable.
4,Over all good product.I use the wired earplugs for my phone. One pair still works and the other stop working.
3,I was shocked with the price. I’m always skeptical about cheaper stuff specially from Apple. But as always I was right. The quality is “okay”. I can hear well and control the volume. But it doesn’t work with my singing app Smule. The originals do. I guess I have to keep paying :$32 for them.
1,Dont waste your money both of the ones i received were really cheap made and both of the earphones on one side you hear a noise and for mine once i had them plugged  in my phone  my screen was going crazzy... on my screen the volume kept going up and down as if i was pressing the buttons then turning on my google microphone and the volume on and off and i tried pressing the volume buttons from earphones and my phone to see if it would get it off from my screen but didnt work... i expected way more from this product... i think walmart earphones are better quality than this ones and last longer(at least for a week)... me and my husband didnt even got to get a use of them...oohh and i forgot to mention the ones my husband tryed on his phone the plug inn part stayed stuck and the cable came off... he struggled to take it off... we ARE DISAPPOINTED... if i could give 0 stars that would be my rate...
5,I like the sound and doesn't hurt your ears
5,sounds good looks good
4,Fairly good sound and don't fall out of your ears easily. No problems after a few weeks now but the cords seem fairly thin. They do not cancel out exterior sound which my previous set of Samsung headphones did.
3,these aren't true Samsung ear buds. However they are shaped the same which is what I was looking for. Might be cheap (and possibly break easily like other reviews say although I haven't had that yet because I haven't owned them real long) but at $5 a pair I cant complain. they work for good and are a good price for what they are. if they break after a few months so be it they are cheap enough.
2,Overall nice looking pair (comes two in the pack - so that's neat).  The first one broke really quick and the second one is hanging in there.  Not the best quality sound or connection but very economical and expected with the cost of the item.
2,At least one pair is faulty as the right side is significantly quieter than the left. Additionally I have to unplug and plug in again multiple times to even hear anything on the right side. I haven't tried the second pair out yet but I have very low expectations as of right now.
4,I've found these to be a good low-priced wired headset.  They're cheap enough to wear to the gym and not worry much about sweat or hooking a wire on something they fit well in my ears and the sound is decent.
4,They sound legit...both of them work .I was freaking out cause I didn't read the other reviews before buying them and when I saw all the bad reviews I wanted to cancel my order but they turned out to be just fine
4,These were a great replacement after my 7 year old found my husband's wire strippers and cut my old headphones in half. My only complaint is the size. After having them in for a while my ears throb.
3,I wasso excited to get this.  I was glad that I got a 2/pk.  The first one stopped working.  I went out of town and found the second one so enjoyable on the plane and while traveling or at places that privacy is so necessary.  I love having the volume control/end on the earpiece.  This is such a handy plus!!.  Thanks so much.  I reallly love this!!
2,I was so excited to be receiving two pairs of headphones and then when they arrived one of them was already broken—it didn’t play sound in one ear. I was really disappointed because I was looking forward to having a backup pair. Doesn’t really pay to have a backup when one of them arrives broken.
4,Love this for the gel covering that it comes with. because it protectsthe inside of your ears from those scratches.I believe it came with extra gel covering for the headphones.
5,Im giving this 5 stars based on how they sound when I hold them in my ears - with that being said they dont fit my ears well but I cant ding the ear buds for my ears. Its my opinion that you need bigger ears for this to be a better fit. I like the older style standard fit but my last few pair were probably counterfeit and fell apart almost immediately.
1,The right side of both headphones had no sound coming through. Only the left side worked.
2,It was a cheap two pack and one almost instantly stopped working.  The other one is working but crackles a bit.  Its okay for what I use it for(audiobooks) but dont think I would be happy if I was listening to music.
5,Good value and delivery was fast
5,Very good sound was great for going for a run kr walk.
2,Comfortable but too much bass and too little treble. Even when changing sound settings does never sound natural. But wait - found the problem. These come with comfy rubbers but they degrade the sound. When taking the rubbers off it is less comfy but much better sound.
1,One ear went out the 2nd week. The talk button doesn't work on the other one.
4,The plastic ear bud covers may slide off a bit from time to time with a lot of use.
4,These are nice headphones for the price. If you are looking for something of high quality these are not your ones. The set I got sound hollow as you listen and the ear protectors keep falling off.
4,Only frustration is that the covers don't stay on well and get lost :(:(:(
5,I like Samsung head phones because the stereo is decent. The seller shipped these out super fast. I was scheduled to get them on the 30th but received them on the 23rd. How's that for service!
4,Although one broke within a few months one pair has lasted me since I bought them which is longer than my original pairs. So I am fairly happy with them. I plan to re-buy as well!
1,Both headsets exhibited exactly the same problem.  The person I was talking to kept telling me that they kept hearing crackling on the call and sure enough when the wires near the microphone were moved or bent there was extensive crackling.  Thus these headsets are useless.
3,they work great and stay in your ears while out doing activities.  I was using them at night to listen to audiobooks while I fall asleep.  It does not take long for the cables to severe.  I wanted to use them because they did not hurt my ears while lying on the pillow. The sound quality was fine for voice and worked for me with music as well.
4,The right ear bud of the first pair went out within a month.  But I'm normally pretty rough with headphones and that's not even mentioning the kiddos. They're very comfortable
5,Good sound quality for the money.
5,The set did not fit my cellphone. It was returned for a refund.
4,Broke one pair already by accident. Feel like it happened a little too easily..
3,Cheaply made. Don't think it'll last
5,I purchased these to use with my Samsung device because my Apple earbuds wouldn't play  nice with my Samsung. I use the earbuds for hands free driving and have no complaints at all.  While they aren't as nice for music as the Apple model they are very close. Not to mention that i could purchase six of these for about the same price as Apple. Save yourself some money and get these.
1,Sound is horrible muffled and somehow on both headphones left ear is louder and by louder I mean almost only the left one works.. cheap fake advertising not the actual headphones I used to have (actual OEM) which I had for 4 years and they still (kinda) work...
5,Me salieron super buenos como esperados y mi paquete trajo dos audiculares. Fantastica compra
3,First pair lasted 2 weeks before shorting out on the second pair lets see how long this one last
5,I'm not sure why everyone who writes a review is saying they're fake or knockoffs. These are OEMS by Samsung and look exactly the same as the pair of headphones included with an S6. For me these work great for the price. Sure they're not Beats quality but that's not what I expected. Sound quality sounds just fine to me and I really enjoy the volume bar; it's very convenient.
4,Didn't really get a chance to use these as I had received Wireless  headphones. These were a really Good price. Thanks
4,It feels good they look good they work inly that i was expectint a better quality sound some bass no it preaty stable  not bad sound get the work done good but i was just expecting more
5,Sound quality is awesome will buy again
5,Quality and budget...
5,Great purchase.  👍
5,Work good.
3,I still own a half pair of working headset and I could compare them. It's not near as good as my original ones but it's not as bad as the othe custumers state.For traveling to my workplace it's ok. But for listening quality music it's bad.Next time before I buy anything on Amazon I will read every digit to save myself from situations like this one.
4,Not sold on the shape of these vs the original that came with my GS5 as they fit your ear differently. No other gripes. Seem to work as good or better than originals.
4,Good charher I've had for about two wees now and it hasn't bugged out or anything. It doesn't charge very quickly but if you leave it over night it should fully charge your phone.
3,Only one of the headphones worked for being able to talk into the mic the mic was messed up the other pair of headphones worked just fine. I was upset about this but I did not want to spend more money shipping the headphones back I would have liked to have gotten another pair but paying shipping 2x is not something that I would want to do
1,When I bought my first set everything was ok but after those got old and I got another set the sound quality was very poor I can hear but they can't hear me so they refunded me my money back and I stupidly got another set which was the same thing person can't hear me but I can hear them...I am not sure what is going on with this seller.
5,Used for tablet to watch movies.
5,Se oye muy bien y son bien  cómodos.  Gracias
3,Right side stop working on 2nd day of use.
4,These OEM headsets are great for the price and with quick delivery.
4,The first pair of received blew out within a month so now I'm using the second pair that came in the pack! Nevertheless though the headphones are great and they come with extra ear buds
3,These are so so quality headphones but they work and aren't too expensive. Long wait for shipping.
5,Great product
4,Nice replacement for my original headset.  Small and light but with great sound.  The only issue is that they could fit the ear a little better for my workout.
5,Ive compared them to my samsung galaxy s6 headphones that came with my phone and they work exactly the same the are the real deal some people got ripped off and that sucks for them. They came with two sets and the bass is amazing so is the sound quality depending on your phone iphone it might not work as good for it as a samsung phone
4,not bad not bad
4,Great delivery time and we'll packaged. Unfortunately headphones don't last long. I already need to buy a replacement. 2 pack of headphones one worked and the other set didn't work at all
4,Ordered these after losing the pair that came with my Galaxy phone. Great headphones despite the lack of care from my part. Both still work after months of constant use.
4,I like them. Good for the price. I like the ear bud shape.
2,They are nice and a good price for 2 pair but both new pairs I just got yesterday already have a loose wire in them so now I still need to buy another new pair
1,One set lasted about 10 minutes before the control module disassembled while I took it out of packing. I then took the other set out and tested it to give it to my wife where upon she broke it over the night during normal use.  I liked the look of them and had hoped they would fit my wife's ears nicely. They were extremely flimsy made of equally cheep materials and we're disappointing. I would never recommend them to anyone for anything more than a bulk recyclable material to use in a way other than their logically intended use.Nothing against the seller either this is just the truth of this product as I see it.I'd take a refund but as it isI probably put more effort into this review than I ever thought to put into the product after my initial time investments in finding and initially paying for it.
5,Muy bueno
5,These work great for power walks and I have no complaints with the sound. Great product for the price.
5,They work great!
5,Very bad quality product.  Look identical.  But are obviously knock offs and sound terrible.
3,Normally I can say I find these head/earphones to work well howver I ordered a two pack hoping to not have to replace these so quickly. The second pair of unused earphones proved to be defective as no sound produces from either earphone. If you want something that works great and long term look elsewhere this is good for something for a few months faulty to a degree
3,Have ordered a few of these this is the first time I have had a problem. One of the headsets is broken out of the box it crackles & will sound distant intermittently. They did not come in a case as received in the past. This time the were in a small ziplock.
4,I didn't receive my package the delivery they contacted me a wk later n helped resolved the problem n i received the products. :) quality is awesome after all its Samsung even in a noisy/windy area.
2,The left bud is way louder than the right one.
1,Are these "Samsung" earbuds seconds? The first order had only one out of four sets that worked even close to properly. But nothing like the set that came with the phone. They sent another replacement order and it was the same. So 2 out of 8 sets were "ok". The others had static and RF interference plus the person on the other end of the line couldn't hear because the mic output was too low. I gave up! Don't waste your time!
4,I use to like it so much until they sent me a defective one... But I still like this product . but I really hope when I order a new one its not defective
5,Son excelentes.
5,Absolutely love these. Just like original or actually are original but whatever they are perfect for me. They typically hold up for a year or two before I break them but never have a pair malfunctioned due to the product mfg..
3,I wear mine to sleep. I listen to sleep meditation and one side always stop working. You get what you pay for.
4,I love the sound quality but if they could make a better fit (one that stays in while exercising) that would be amazing.
1,I got a dud set apparently
5,Worked fine for me
5,These headphones feel so much more comfortable compared to the headphones that were introduced with the iPhone 5. I lost the pair I got with my Samsung Galaxy S6 and was glad that I was able to get them again at such a decent price not to mention that TWO pairs came! I'm still on my first pair and they work perfectly!
2,My daughter uses these for school and they are not the greatest quality
5,Have been purchasing these for years... great product.
5,I just loved these earbuds. They are so comfortable and love the sound quality.
2,The product was good while it lasted. I bought this because my mom needed a pair also. A week ago from today we both lost use of one ear piece on our headsets. Unfortunately the side with my mic went out so they're useless to me now.
5,Looking for a decent pair of ear buds that stay in and have decent quality?  These are the ones!  Admittedly not the greatest sound quality but still a decent pair and cheap.  I'd rather buy another pair of these headphones than those expensive brands.
3,Samsung earbuds are a good quality earbuds wit great bass an sound but be careful if they are not the original the earbuds wont last you 5 months like the ones u get wit ur phone..
3,Affordable but not good enough.
4,I bought these for my son to use with his PlayStation four because they had a microphone in them. They work great on this phone but do not work with the PS4
5,very good
1,Got these as a replacement for my Samsung earbuds that came with my phone. Selected this specific one because it said 2 pack. Unfortunately I only received 1 pack. I tried contacting the seller directly through Amazon. After more than a week I had not received a reply from them. The one I received works well. I just wish I knew before purchase that it was not a 2 pack as advertised.
5,I use this on my daily workouts works great.
5,I continue to order these when my old headphones go bad. Always buy the same ones. They're cheap work great sound great. I'll be disappointed once these become discontinued.
5,I really like these headphones. They work well and stay in my ears. Good price good quality.
4,Listen to music
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I love it. I use it for musicphone call etc.
2,I'm still getting complaints that it sounds like I am in a echo chamber when talking with these buds.  I can hear well but the person I'm talking to says I sound distant and echo-ey
5,I like the quality of sound!
5,Loved them the original thing
3,They look exactly like Samsung headphones in every aspect. The difference is in their sound they are a little tinny. Compared to the original pair I got with the phone they lack the deeper full bass sound. At the low price it's a great value to have two extra pairs.
5,idk what else to say they work great
3,So it worked at first but then I started to notice volume issues no matter what I played everything sounded lower. Then one ear bud went out and the other sounds like a whisper.
4,This is my second order. They don't develop shortage with a few weeks of consistent daily usage. But for the price you can beat it.
5,These are great ear buds. Using for work or just listening to music.
5,Exactly what I wanted! My headphones that came with my android broke and they were my favorite pair so I wanted to get the exact same kind. I'd say they're authentic but I'm not sure how to prove that. Bottom line they work and they feel like the ones I used to have
2,I thought this product was ok but unfortunately the sound is horrible and I try to use in a samsung s 9 plus. Apparently is a metallic sound that is background and I can't hear very well so I hope this can help you
5,Works perfectly. I love that I was given two sets and with extra replaceable ear bud coversion.When originally going thru Samsung for a replacement they were attempting to charge me 30$ just for 1. No way. Thanks amazon for hooking me up for a much cheaper price . .  . And they are still Samsung headphones
5,Good quality
5,I purchased the 2 pack in March and they have been working great ever since.  Mine say Samsung on it. They just as good if not better then the ones that came with my Galaxy Note 5. They work so well that i will be buying another 2 pack for my husband and I. Can't beat it for $10...
5,These are the best earbuds I've ever owned.  They fit comfortably in my ears. They never fall out. They also work great for talking on the phone.  The people I'm talking to usually don't even realize I'm out for a walk.  I own a Samsung S7; I'm not sure how they would work on other brands.
4,These work good I was just disappointed when my friend said they started sounding more static as they get old.
1,These earbuds are disappointing. I expected them to be knock offs and I was ok with that but I also expected them to work. I have had them less than a week anf the sound quality is fairly lousy and it crackles whenever the connection is bunped. The button is unreliable- sometimes not working when I press it and sometimes it pausing when the wire was bumped the button never touched. The mic seemed to work fine but again there is loud cracking whenever the connection it touched. I will credit that they came with a spare set of rubber for the ears and they got my ears nicely. Too much of a hassle to return them.
2,My husband used the first pair and dropped them and one of the earbuds went out immediately. He hasn't tried the second pair yet because he is worried that they will also break easily.
4,Great deal perfect for using in place of a Bluetooth  device for calls. Music isn't as loud as I would like but great sound quality.
3,I was looking to get an exact extra set of headphones for my samsung galaxy s6 so i bought this two pack. They look normal and work but i noticed that the ear buds are harder and bug my ear more than the original pair I recieved when purchasing my phone also they are shorter than original pair.
5,Just as advertised
4,I prefer the regular headphones. These are kinda uncomfortable. Hard to fit into the ear. They work good although. Good sound and have a long cord
5,I liked that it came fast and the hearing is perfect! I'm very happy with my purchase!
5,Good quality product and great price
5,I get two for one so that's great. The Mic is pretty decent people usually can hear me clearly. The sound is not as sharp as I would like but I am only paying about $10 so I did not expect it to compete with a $100 pair of earphones. Overall they do their job and work well.
5,Good
2,Disappointed ☹️
5,Perfect
4,Sounds good compare to previous Samsung stock earbuds. It could have got five stars if those little rubber thingies were not keep falling off occasionally.
5,Love the product
2,Out of the package only one worked properly. The other one only transmitted sound through the right earbud. I don't have high hopes that the working one will last for very long.
3,I like these earphones they work but only for around 3 months then dead but they sound amazing and are reasonably priced so I've bought 1 replaced it and bought another and another all im saying I support these earphones so can these guys sponsor me with lifetime replacement I wont abuse it.
5,The sound quality is good for the money.
5,These are great sound great and very useful for conference calls!
5,Got a pair of these with a phone I bought and loved them so much I bought 2 more. Only issue was the rubber came off the earpieces when they got old so keep the provided spares.
5,Some people complained that the listening quality wasn't great but they're comparing them to the original Samsung earbuds that come in the package with the phones and break within a few months. These are great listening quality and exceptional for the price. I'd recommend to anyone looking for a great listening experience at a bargain price.
5,These are the only after market headphones i've liked in some time. These sit flat in the ear. That's good for me as I wear helmets for biking and skiing. Great for falling asleep with meditation music too. When you have headphones that stick out (like most) they get smushed into your ear and that makes the sound inconsistent..
2,This purchase was for 2 pairs. One set worked great and one set does not. Not worth the hassle of returning. I ordered on April 21 and just received them today May 11. Waaay longer than the 4 days promised. Not happy not satisfied but not wasting any more energy on it. If you order you are taking your chances. GOOD LUCK!
3,I bought 2 of these originally but had to but another because one of the headphones was not functional. Otherwise the pair that was working were great.
3,At first i was very impressed with this pants I tested it by working out vigorously  in them then was the wash test it was ok until now i realize that the paint on the side are sticking together and peeling.  I love them so i am feeling disappointed.
5,El producto es perfecto buen sonido y concentración del sonido.
5,Love them a lot bought two and buying more
5,Cant tell the difference between these and the ones that came with my phone.
5,Very comfortable in the ears.  The cords are durable. I have not have had the experience of a wire connection to an earbud giving out which happend with other earbud brands that I have bought.  Good quality of sound. These are so good that I bought 4 of them.
3,These are the kind of headsets I wish were made with better quality. I mean they work perfectly fine for a week or two and then bam money wasted. Please invest in the quality of these headsets and people will have no problem buying them until then I DO NOT RECOMMEND.
5,Me encantan
4,Excellent buy for the money it's a two pack!
3,I 've ordered 4 parties of these and the sound quality is excellent but there has to be a design flaw. On every pairthe left earbud blows out with 2 weeks
5,2 pack of headphones for $10? I was sold even if they weren't the best quality but they're the exact same as what came with my Samsung note 5 when I bought it and (tragically) lost. Microphone works to use with calls I ordered another pack because it's great to have a pair everywhere.
5,I was so excited when I received my new headphones....I can hear again!  The order came quickly and was exactly what the description said.  I'm so happy with my purchase
4,Had a problem with the first pair I received only one ear from each worked but after they sent out the new ones they work great!!!
2,As others have said these are definitely NOT OEM. Garbage sound quality comparatively but if you're not picky about sound quality and are looking for something more or less disposable these are a decent choice. I order these 2 or 3 times a year because I lose them and occasionally one of the pairs will show up not working or have one ear that is really quiet. This will be the last time I buy them because other options are out there at a similar price point with better sound quality and quality control.
3,You can tell immediately they are fake if you've had the original one like there is no cord connector and one ear bud cord is longer than the other but they get the job done and have good sound quality and look on the bright side at least you get two.
1,I have used plain cheap ear buds as well as the newer Apple ear buds that curve to the ear similar to this product.  As I loved the improved feeling and fit of the  Apple ear buds I thought I would give these a try.  The fit is horrible... constantly falling out of my ear.  The removable soft plastic surrounding the bud does feel nice but if it won't stay in the ear then it is pretty useless.The volume and pause/play buttons on the cord work well.  However they are very close to the ear itself and awkward to use.  Due to the poor fit and closeness to the ear any time you try to access the volume buttons the ear piece will fall out of your right ear.The clarity is good but style of bud and placement of volume control make this unusable unfortunately.
4,arrived on time and exactly what I needThank you
1,These things never worked well. Feedback is so easy to get.  I will pay more and probably switch to another manufacturer...!? One that has quality goods a day doesn't deal in junk at any price.I already got burned by a low end Samsung phone on Amazon.  Luckily  Amazon took it back and allowed me  credit.  Never again like a bird " Cheap- Cheap "
5,Working from home remotely... this product is amazing!
4,I have upgraded my phone since I purchase these plugs but they did work fine.
5,Sound is good. Mic works. What more do you want for the price.
5,Our household is forever losing and breaking headphones. We've ordered these a couple times now and have been pleased with the quality and durability! The mic works very well and does not pick up as much background noise as others we have tried. And the price point is great for what you get.
5,This are original Samsung products my case less then a week they work good and for the best price to. Each one go for around $30 but you get 2 for $10 that the best deal I ever seen. And there the new one to so I love this product
4,He earned buds work great. I just hate that the covers come off so easy and I keep loosing them.
1,Both ear bud sets arrived defective. The right side of BOTH sets did not produce sound and when using the microphone the person on the call couldn't understand me due to how bad the sound quality was. Currently sending them back for a refund. If you don't want an errand to run to return these when they arrive defective then don't buy these.
3,I like these headphones. They aren't identical to the ones that came with my Samsung Galaxy 6. They get the job done. They were an awesome deal for two. Not going to find a deal like this. They slightly fall out of my ears as I walk around.
5,I love these headphones. I have the capability to answer and end my calls with the just touch of a button. There are volume buttons on the cord as well which comes in handy when listening to music or while on the phone.
5,Sound quality is good
1,Cheap not OE and they don't work without a ton of static. DO NOT BUY THESE
5,I've had these for a while I use them with an HTC and they are perfect and still work unlike others I have had I would buy it again.
5,You can't really go wrong with this purchase. I originally got these with my GS6 and I really liked them because they're comfortable they stay in my ears and the sound quality is actually quite good. They're not noise cancelling but the silicone covers do help dampen outside noise. Other than that the price is unbeatable!
5,Great fit and sound. Seller was quick and courteous.
1,I bought 6 of these. I am able to listen to music and can hear on the phone but NONE of them worked when it came to talking on the phone. The caller on the other end usually heard static and crackling at best they could hear that I was talking but couldn't understand what I was saying. I could not use any of them for freeing up my hands while on the phone which is why I bought them. Clearly a poorly made product.
3,Great solution if you lose the battery on your bluetooth set. I kept getting it yanked though and I find the wire unwieldy. After a month both stopped working I think the cable broke even though I can't see the break
3,These have good sound and I like the convenience of not having to pull my phone out of my pocket to mute them and I like having the speaker.  I seem to go through a lot of them though which makes me think they are not very durable.
1,These sound terrible. They are nock-offs. I can tell by the 3.5mm jack.
4,They actually aren't bad. They fit my ears wonky but that's my issue. Button functions are correct.
4,One is defective. If you replace it would appreciate. I am giving 4 star because all other work but one.
5,These are exact replacements to those you get with Samsung Galaxy phones. My daughter broke her original set and has since gone through ear buds like toilet paper. These stopped the flood of money I was spending on cheap ear buds! The product is as shown. There is no misrepresentation in description.
5,Gift for nephew And he loved it.
2,This is the second time I buy this to pack of headphones and the second time they only last for a couple of months. I bought these in August and by the end of November neither microphone worked on the headphones. I do use these daily however they do not get rigorous use. I never get them wet and I don't Yank on them. I'm not sure why the quality is so poor but I would not recommend purchasing these.
4,Arrived well.. IS OK.. I did not liked the Sound Much but GOOD choise for the money.. 2 Pack.. very neat.
1,I easily figured this was a bootleg the moment I compared my old earbuds (the original OEMs)  and this pair. The length of the cord is much longer than the original Samsung earbuds. Otherwise the style is very much parallel.However that wasn't the problem. The problem is that the sound quality is AWFUL. The right earbud is slightly quieter and everything sounds like it's echoing inside of an elevator.Seeing how this was sold so cheaply as a 2 pack should have easily been a red flag for me. I'm very disappointed. I can't believe I even paid extra for faster shipping which in due is probably my fault for that. Do not buy these! It's better to search for a pricey pair because you're more than likely going to get the original & not this knock off garbage.
5,Very fast shipping
5,Just got my earbuds and im really satisfied so far. These were a replacement to the samsung earbuds i lost that came with my phone and i haven't noticed any differences between the two! Previous reviews got me a little worried about the product but i really am satisfied with the product
5,Work very well
1,Had to discard. From the first day or two I used them people kept telling me they couldn't hear me when I was speaking to them on the phone. I kept trying since I JUST purchased them but since I used them for work calls had to just throw them away.
4,Love these earbuds. Great sound and durable. The only thing I don't like is the rubber buds slip off from time to time.
3,I gave 3 stars because only one pair works. The first pair I used were pretty scratchy when I put them in and by the end of the day one side and the remote had stopped working. The other pair works great.
3,Didn't work long. One seemed to barely pick up noise via the mic upon delivery. One worked alright for less than a month to end up completely stop picking up sound. & now it struggles to maintain connection when plugged in.
1,I bought 3 sets and on all 3 the right ear bud stopped working within a couple weeks of use. I probably used them a couple hours a day. So frustrating. Loved them while they worked. Very comfortable to wear and sound was great. I'm just so surprised that all 3 sets had the se issue. I don't recommend.
2,One pair was damaged called to fix the problem and receive a no for answer customer service blamed the manufacturer .
3,This was my first time using this style. Unfortunately the buds are too big for my ears and made them sore for the first couple of weeks I wore them. Still decent for the price though.
5,Great
3,Not the real Samsung quality different from the ones I usually buy. Bad sound quality and cheaper materials make these break easier
5,Good product with reasonable price
4,Works good
2,Ordered these because my old headphones stopped working. I thought that I would be getting real Samsung headphones but was greeted with a horrendous knock-off. Immediately I could tell that the sound quality rivaled that of the cheap $4 headphones you find at the checkout lane of a Walmart. Among inspection and comparison of my real pair I found that they were in fact fake. And to top it off the volume control does not work. I can honestly say I am terribly disappointed by my amateur mistake of not purchasing directly from the company. Oh well live and learn.
1,Definitely not OEM as I have a pair that works fine.. wanted extra sets to keep near computer and on nightstand. These are not even close. Very disappointed.  Right ear not working. Static in left ear.
1,I purchased 2 sets and they both were very poor quality. every pair works great for a few weeks and then one side just completely stops working. I do not recommend these.
2,I ordered this as a gift and did not open the wrapping until the birthday.  Unfortunately one of the head phones was broken and completely unusable.  Be aware of the product quality.
2,BOTH HEADPHONES  on the right side stopped working 😔
1,the volume button does  not  work you  sell  it  under  name  of  samsung  but totallly  it  is fake  not  even close.  this  is  a shame  that amazon  distribuiting  materials  that  are worthless.give  my  money back asap
2,It took three pairs of these earbuds to make a decision and confirm that these are not from Samsung they are good enough but they are not from Samsung first pair the right earbud went out in like 3 weeks second pair there was no bass on the left earbud the third pair open them today and the mic does not work but sound is just fine i don't  know if i would recommend them every pair had something wrong with them. Get them at your own risk but I'm not no more left see what is your luck.
5,love 💘 it
4,They work great happy I found them on Amazon.
4,It was the same quality as the ones that original came worth my phone so I'm happy with the purchase
5,Good deal for the money I paid
5,Works great.  No complaints.
4,descent earbuds at a cheap price.
4,Útil
3,The ear buds are great love em one problem though. The microphone sucks. I used it to talk with a friend over Skype and it wasery staticy. There that that their great You also get two in one package
5,Good sound!!
3,One of the pairs was nonfunctional upon arrival.Sucks :(Aside from that I enjoy having the Apple Earpod form but with flat cables and grippy silicone tips. The sound is actually quite good for 5 bucks a pair.
5,These are very close if not identical with the ones you receive with your original purchase of the phone.
3,Great deal but both earphones when bad after 1 month. ...One ear bud did not work.I have other earphones that I bought from Best Buy and they still work as good as the first day I bought them
4,very fast shipping just as described
5,The headphones work great! They fit my tiny ears perfectly!
2,bastante bien para escuchar musica etc pero hablar por telefono...no sirve...la otra persona no te escucha
3,The higher and lower volume controls didn't work on my iPod nano.  The earpieces didn't quite fit my ears.  But it is well put together and is a quality product.
3,For the same price they make one by Samsung also that sticks into the ear these tend to fall out of the ear and the other ones sound better these allow air between plug and your ear.
3,Sound quality is acceptable.  The Buttons don't work with my iPod Mini or my Nexus 6P phone.  Perhaps they are somehow custom programmed only to work with Samsung products?  If the buttons worked I'd give it 5/5.
1,Don't work long at all
1,Per the Amazon listing the manufacturer of these earbuds appears to be 'Samsung' and the listing says OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and there's no mention of these being refurbished. However when the earbuds arrived and I tried them out I was expecting them to sound identical to my other pair that came with my Samsung phone but they clearly sound muffled and bass-less. It's shocking and disappointing that I could be deceived into buying this product. Being that it was supposed to be OEM from Samsung I didn't think there was any risk. But now I am worried about the other Amazon products I'm considering buying. Save yourself the hassle and your money and find something with the quality you'd expect from the genuine earbuds. I'm not sure how to know to find good quality via the Amazon site though.
1,Stop working after the second day these are not Samsung. Good thing they stopped working with the time frame to return items. Buyer beware!!!
1,You can clearly tell they're not the real ones I compared them to mine. DO NOT GET SCAMMED
1,Stopped working within a few uses. No damage to them.
1,I ordered these because they were the Samsung brand and had loved the pair that came with my phone. After 3 months one side of these ear buds went out. I opened the new box and in a few weeks one of the ear buds went out on it also! It is past my return date so I am having to work with Samsung direct now. It is a real pain to deal with when you only spend $13 and still don't have working ear buds and no way to connect the seller. I will not re-order with this seller.
4,They are very sensitive I end up hanging up with the slightest touch. Decent quality though :)
1,I purposefully bought this item because it claimed that it came in a two pack which was a total lie.  Buyers beware this only comes with a single pair of headphones.
4,If you are looking for cheap and very comfortable earphones I really recommend these. Also they are durable!
1,Microphone does not work at all. Sound is terrible. Headphones looke and feel cheap.
5,These are the same earphones that you get with your phone. They are also the best earphones I have ever had. It's worth buying. You also get two of them so I have one I keep in my backpack and one in my home.
1,These are junk and I've thrown them away.  When I used them I got complaints of buzzing/interference that made it difficult to hear what I was saying.  I could not hear the interference on my end but got complaints using these with laptop zoom calls and cell phone.  As soon as I unplugged them the sound quality was fine for the person on the other end of the call.  The problem happened on all 3pairs purchased.
5,They work fine
5,would buy again
5,It's amazing. The sound is clear and balanced.  Samsung (2 PACK) OEM Wired 3.5mm White Headset with Microphone Volume Control and Call Answer End Button [EO-EG920BW] for Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ / S6 / S5 Galaxy Note 5 / 4 / Edge (Bulk Packaging)
3,This product will stop working quick.  First one ear then the next it hilarious
3,Giving three stars because these won't work properly with my iPhone. I've had Samsung earphones in the past and never had this happen.
2,I order these and only one side of the headset works. So either the left or the right works on either headset. You are better of to go to get it at another store (where you at least can return it).
2,Sound quality is alright better than no head phones at all.. however not the best for boucle cancelation.
1,These are disappointing first pair lasted 2 weeks before right earbud stopped working. The 2nd pair had static right out of package.  I would not waste your money. The only good thing is that they are acceoting my return request.
1,The first pair started out great! They worked for about 30 days then one side went out. In my head I'm thinking "no biggie I have another pair" Boy was I wrong. 2nd pair didn't work at all ONLY COULD HEAR STATICSAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. DO NOT BUY!
1,These things are junk. Please see MY photos for the REAL shape (not shown in the listing). They don't fit in my ear and I'm a 6' male. I wear hearing aids and other ear buds just fine. Returning product.
5,My daughter goes through ear buds faster than I can eat potato chips. That's why it was nice to find this bundle of two on amazon at a reasonable price. These are good basic headphones. I am sure I will buy them here again!
3,Both sets only lasted 2 months. On one the right side went out and the left went out on the other yesterday. This is my second order of these and the others only lasted 2 months as well
5,waaayyyyy better than the standard pair that comes with apple products. These are the same shape but have little rubber pads around the plastic ear bud which makes for more comfortable wear. Plus for 5 bucks per headset you really can't go wrong.
3,Decent headphones but one set has already lost sound on the left side so I am already on my second pair. I'm so glad that i I bought a 2 pack!  Hopefully the second pair will last a little loonger.
2,The volume controls don't work on either pair of headphones in the two-pack. We didn't use them right away so we didn't know until after the return window had closed. Disappointing!
4,Nicer than your average $5 headphones you'll find in stores by a long shot
5,They work the same as the ones that came with my Samsung Galaxy 6 phone. The best thing about the head phones is the fact that I got 2 of them for a great price and they arrived just a couple of days after I ordered them.
5,Losses one star because the mic always the problem when I make calls in the phone with it or chat over the PS4 controller in a party.
5,I had ordered these headphones prior. They are a very good set of headphones. 2 for $10 is an amazing deal and they last long. I am making a second order of these several months later. Good buy good quality.
4,One set worked and the other did too but one side was very static
5,Good price good quality
5,Got these for my sister. Even though people say they don't last too long my sister says they don't last long in the gym anyways. It's cheap and affordable and stays in your ear well.
3,I would've given 5 stars but one of the headphones  had a lot of static. I liked the idea of buying two because I give the other one to my husband and unfortunately I'm stuck with the static
1,These say Samsung on them but I dont believe they are. None of the pairs I got work. I can hear on them but they give off feedback. You cannot use them on a call because the other party cannot hear you with high pitch feedback from mic cutting off voice. Voice goes in and out.  I wound up throwing them out. Super dissapointed.
5,They are awsome sound very good quality
4,Good earbuds.  Seems to lack in clarity near higher volume ranges (~75% volume and above).
2,I purchased these thinking they'd be a replacement for the ear phones that came with my phone but they don't say samsung on the side and the volume/answer button is like a phone call button. How am I supposed to adjust the volume? They have the same shape as the ones advertised but I did not receive these ones. The sound quality is subpar too. I needed some ASAP so these worked but I would rather have spent my money on something I thought it was going to be. Unhappy with my purchase
3,I love these headphones but for some reason the right ear which has the microphone tends to stop working somewhere between the second or third week of use. This was my second order and it has happened again??????
3,The price was nice for a two set of headphones but the sound quality was not that impressive. I use apple headphones on my Samsung phone because they are much better sound quality than these.
5,Use with Samsung Galaxy S6 and HP laptop.
4,I bought these for my 14 yr old daughter.  She says they fit best in her ears.
5,I love this headset and use it with my cell phone. Great product!!
5,These are the best earbuds available.  They are the only ones I have ever owned that don't get tangled.  I have multiple pairs that I use for running the office and travel.
5,Estan muy lindos
4,I had for maybe two months after stop working
2,The first pair from the two didn't last long at all maybe a couple of days and the other still technically works but the microphone doesn't. They were inexpensive so I don't know what I expected. I would recommend always using the advice of a friend of mine which is "Pay more now for better quality so they last longer and you get more out of them."
3,Got these in today the pair that works is great but the other pair literally just makes a clicking noise in my ear like it isn't making a proper connection but won't let me play media
4,Good  quality headphones. Last quite a while. Talkin 3-4 months
4,They are great
5,These are the best earbuds! They stay in your ears and the rubber covers rarely fall off. Sound quality is good. Volume control on the line is awesome! I haven't been able to find these in stores so thank you!
3,My seven year old techie will go through 2-3 pairs of these a year. I'm so glad that they are affordable and work well. These are an automatic re-buy item!
4,Worked good!
1,Both pairs had lots of static andnperson on other end had great difficulty hearing me.
2,I recently bought these earbuds with the thought that these are the same that you may receive when you purchase a Samsung Galaxy phone. Though I don't think they're the exact ones the sound quality is ok but not as good as the ones you actually receive with a phone. I recently got a cord stuck between something and as I was trying to get them out the cord literally stretched. Terrible quality rubber/plastic that covers the wire. I don't see these lasting very long.
5,Good
1,Both pairs quit working a week after the return window closed. I feel jipped.
3,Not the same as original.
4,These headphones are so awesome & convenient!!! I just love them!!!
5,Work really good highly recommend!
4,They're great; but they don't stay in my ears. That is the only problem I have with them.
1,right earbud does not work or quickly breaks. these didn't even last for a month
5,It was great to have 2 sets of headphones that were exactly like the ones that came with my phone. My original pair broke and ended up missing the cushions. These came with extra cushions for each headphone plus cushions on each.
5,Works fine for me i broke one by stretching it by accident while working out. one side works but it was my fault the other pair work perfectly. the other works fine but i only use that one to work out
5,I hot them and they work great. All the bad reviews made me very skeptical about this product but i recieved them today and they are just like my old ones. And both of them are exactly the same. Great product. Recommend it
4,Way cool these are just as last model grat sound and they stay put so well!
5,Love these and after the ones that came with my phone broke I was upset these were the perfect replacement.
5,Love the price gave the second pair to my cousin wish I hadn't I think I accidently shut my car door on one of the buds and it broke through the rubber. Going to have to replace it soon.
2,Earbud covers easily fall off and naked earbuds are too small for some ears making the buds unusable without the covers.
3,The sound is a little distorted like it has too much bass and cant handle it.
4,Great value. And yes these are legitimately the ones that come with the phones.
4,cheap imitations the wires striped very easily.
5,Arrived quickly great quality
3,These headphones are incredibly flimsy. If they catch a corner while in your ear the wire will 100% break.
3,I'm done buying these I buy like 4 a year and one ear eventually goes out after a few months. I give up.
4,These fit my ear better than the apple ones would recommend these
2,Break easy and there's better options in bluetooth technology.
4,2 packs came as promised as well as the extra ear pieces
1,I bought these as a backup and I just opened them and only one earbud works
4,I got mines today and they sound great good bass good in general.fast shipping
1,Both in total lasted little over 2 weeks. I recieved these headphones on the 28th of september and didn't start using them till the 30th. The next Friday I'm using my first pair and suddenly i realize there's sound only coming out of the left side. Im upset but decide to not be dramtic about it. I have another pair. And the next Sunday. The same thing happens while im just casually listening to music and then no soynd on the right side. Bad enough i recieved one with out bud covers on them. At least the replacements were in there. No heaphones should last 2 weeks not even in the worst conditions. I live for earbuds/headphones so treating them well is like top priority for me.
2,No good quality for me
5,Fantastic earpods better than the apple ones! Super comfy stay put and easy controls to use! My favorite set yet!
5,N/a
5,I like the sound quality & price. I lose my earbuds all the time so it's great to have a spare pair at a great price. My order shipped right away - perfect since these were a replacement pair.
5,Sound great.
4,Didn't last very long but it's worth the low price
4,Awesome!! Great seller!
5,I love that the inline mic is so close to the ear piece  picks up your voice much better than other ear buds. I mostly use for Xbox chat but also work great with my Nexus 6P.
5,Perfect ear buds for walking my doggies everyday. Sound good cord is long enough without being too long. Would buy again.
4,Love the flat chord & the shape of the earbuds
4,I like these better than the headphones that use to come with a new phone.....
5,These don't suck for what i paid mine said samsung and they look legit only problem i had was that they were staticie at first so i just played music on my loudest setting and after like a minute they sounded fine great actually
5,clean sound
4,ONE OF THEM ONLY ONE SIDE WORKS
4,just as listed best price here. And I got them quickly.
1,👎🏻 We are lefty's & prefer the left ear. These particular headphones has the mic on the right ear & if u try to switch it to the left ear it dosen't fit properly & it keep falling out of your ear. Dont even try to excercise with them. Theyre a headache!! Also samsung headphones w mic & frm Amazon seem to (always always ) falter or don't last.😡 🧐  CANT RECCOMEND.
5,very good and it fit my ears . good quality.
4,thanks a lot I am enjoying this product.
5,These earbuds are awesome. They are the exact same ones that came with my Galaxy phone initially. Getting 2 for the price is a steal. Even if you don't need them right now you should purchase these as a back-up
1,These are awful. It makes a crackling sound when I twist the plug inside my phone and multiple phone call recipients told me they heard an echo. These can't be the real Samsung earbuds because they are nothing like my original pair.
2,Pros:None. I expected better from Samsung.Cons:These were not even remotely comparable in audio clarity. They are pretty bad.One headset of the bundled 2 was defective. Persons on the other end of my phone calls complained of annoying static/scratching noises (I could not hear the reported noise myself). Tried it on 2 phones. Same problem. Tried the other headset in the package and the problem went away.I returned these and ordered Apple Earpods. I'm now happier.
5,Great quality headphones. They were bought as a gift and they are still working months later. My daughter loves electronics so I am always ordering headphones all shapes and sizes. These are perfect sounding and stay put in the ear.
4,The earbuds work just great. No problems at all.
1,I ordered this product because it fits perfect to my small ears . But the one I got is very worst product  broken sounds from day 1 I received .  I could not return it  becaz I throw the original package  and details
5,Great headphones. They're not noise cancelling or anything but they still have great sound. When your music is at a reasonable volume you can still hear people speak to you which I kind of like.
5,Bought as replacements.
1,I only received one set of headphones but it doesn't matter because the sound is terrible. Very tinny and echo-y. I recommend buying somewhere else.
5,I like to use these to work out. They really work well
1,I got 2 sets of two pairs so total of 4 pairs and only 1 pair worked fully!! One set didnt work at ALL & the other 2 only one headphone worked. Very disappointed
4,As described
3,they lasted me a couple of months I do run a lot  one of the buds stopped working I'm not sure if it was the cable or the sweat.
5,My sister love it
3,They work on the phone beautifully but on Tablet or other devices only one ear works.  They tend to fall out of the ear unlike others ear buds .
1,Hated them.
1,One of the headphones worked. The other didn't. I don't want to send them back because I need it hence why I ordered it.
5,Very happy to have these-they work better than the ones I got with my phone. Also can be used for the PS4 party chat-just be sure to watch your mic volume-usually is VERY hot on input.
2,Nothing
2,The earbuds both have an annoying crackling noise when I talk on the phone. They work fine for listening to music but if I rotate it in the port it makes the crackling noise too.
4,Not high quality but met my expectations for the price.
4,Kool
3,The control buttons work fine if you are looking at your music playing app but don't if you aren't meaning you can't control your songs unless the app is open. Volume works fine.
3,Nice sound they get compromised easily one of the cord hooked on something and ripped in half.  I would buy more for the price but not use them alot.
5,Great fit and sound!
1,These came to me defective.. I couldn't use any of them. When trying to talk on them they gave off the worst scrambling noise. I had to toss them because one of the earbuds came detached from the wiring. Poor quality. Won't purchase from this company ever again
5,Great price for two pack! Love these earphones! So comfortable and Came on time loved that it came in a two pack so if I break it again by putting them through the washer and dryer then I have a back up!
5,Love them.
4,Exactly like the ones that come with the phone originally
4,Yeah these are good. They don't lat long but they're good.
5,Great ear buds sold a couple no complainants or problems plan to buy more in the future!
1,Item stopped working after a few weeks use.
2,I ordered these to replace the original set that I lost.  One set lost sound in the left ear after only a few days' use the other lost sound in the right ear after a couple of weeks.  I'm not sure whether these are authentic Samsung (they say Samsung on the side) but it's hard to believe that Samsung would produce such low-quality products.  They are super comfortable though when they actually work.
1,I had such low expectations to begin with and they didn't even live up to those. I would rather listen to my arguing children than use these earbuds. The wires are stiff the sound quality is like listening to a tin can radio through a phone call and there were sharp plastic bits I had to file down so I didn't scratch my ears.I can't tell you if they last because I stopped trying to fight with them before the week was up.
2,Very unhappy
5,I don't understand all the hate maybe everyone got bad batches before me. They have the samsung logo on them and they sound exactly like the samsung headphones that came with my S7. great price works awesome.
1,I bought four.  four of four sounded fine to me but sounded unacceptable to the other party on the phone.  I was very surprised by this feedback from those I was talking to and kept changing to a new headset with the same feedback on that new headset.  The previous earbud set that I was using was also from Samsung and worked great until the wires broke two years later from normal use.  very disappointed and clearly looking for the next headset to buy since I spend plenty of time on conference calls.
4,good
5,The new Samsung earbuds are much more comfortable than my previous pair. I can wear these for long flights and not have sore ears after. I bought these a few months ago and they are still going strong.
1,I've had these for just over a month and neither earbud works on either pair - no longer transmits clear sound. Scratchy audio. The buttons don't function correctly to control the intermittent scratchy noise. Mistake thinking a 'Samsung' product would be quality.
5,Have bought many times. Good quality. The buds could be softer but good none the less.
3,They came in great condition but they are uneven. On side is much longer than the other. It's pretty annoying but other than that they work great!
5,Love them... can't beat the price... I was a bit skeptical and thought it might be a fake but they are actually Samsung... Got it for my Note 5 and gave the other to my hubby who has a Galaxy 4S...
4,Volume controls won't work with iPhone. Sounds fine
5,I got the headphones and after short periods of use both of the left ear buds stopped working. Luckily I was paired with an outstanding customer service representative (Sierra)  who immediately set up a replacement order for me.
2,Neither of the pairs I have gotten had working volume controls and one of the units right monitor is significantly quieter than the other. I bought theses as a cheap throw away pair to take with me on training missions and they are definitely through away headphones
1,I was hoping to replace my OEM Samsung that came with my Galaxy S10. These are the flea market off market imitation. No clarity no bass or premium sound coming from these.
4,My old ones sound better but these are certainly very good sound.
2,I have ordered this item before and never had an issue. We were actually pretty happy with them but the earphones I received yesterday were defect. The volume button does not work on either of them. It's a shame that we cannot return it. Unfortunately I will probably have to order a different item because I do not want to receive defect earphones again.
4,headphones were great
2,I have bought these headphones over and over again because of my lack of income available to spend on headphones. They break on average after the second month. I have opened brand new headphones with one headphone not working microphone not working low sound weak pretty much everything. They are only good for a quick fix in between actual quality headphones.
1,I bought these to replace the original Samsung headphones that came with my phone when I bought it. Keep in mind those lasted almost 2 years until one of the earbuds stopped working. These new headphones worked fine for the first few days until the right earbud of BOTH of them stopped working after maybe 10 days of use. Don't waste your money. I'm going to try to return them. It's probably more cost effective to buy the expensive ones straight from Samsung than to keep buying these trash knockoffs once a month because they break so fast.
3,Exactly as advertised just like the ones that came with my phone; lacking in bass and prone to one side going dead if there is even a little tugging on the plugging...
1,The right side broke just like the ones that came with my phone. I've had these for about two months. It's a shame I love how these headphones feel and fit in my ears. But it's on the microphone side and this is the second pair that have done this to me.
4,Works well and fits comfortably in my ears
5,Headphones work great nice and loud. Lasts a good little while with rough and tumbled cowboys that tend to break things faster than necessary
1,I have others like these love how the wings keep them from falling out. Great upgrade for non-sport earbuds!!! But these are not molded as well. They don't fit sas well on ether side and on the right side they block about 30% of the sound.
3,Right ear volume went low on its on...
1,Fake. Maybe ok for phone calls but music? Absolutely not. Do not buy unless it's for a toddler.
5,Good quality headphones! Great value too and what makes it even better is that these are much higher quality than other headphones in this price range from other brands. Would definitely buy again!
5,Bought mine in November & the 2nd pair just failed... Truth is these are my favorite earphones though. They sound great & are very comfortable. But they never* seem to last very long.
5,I lost the ones that came with my phone and was looking to replace them fast and inexpensively. This did just that and now I have a spare in case I lose them again.
2,for some reason these do not work with my new phone.  too much feedback noise. when I have them on whoever I am talking asks me to PLEASE take them OFF.  not sure what the problem is - I can not use the head phones.
3,Sound is good. I was surprised the functions worked. My first one broke within 3days but that's mainly on my part and some on the ok quality
5,Just like the ones that come with phone but a third of price
4,a good pair of headphones I like and sound good
4,Sound quality is great.
5,The best Samsung headphone purchase ive made. These are great and very noise isolating. They fit in my ear very snug and they dont move around or require readjustment like other ones ive had in the past. 100% satisfied.
4,Loved them since I first tried them.
2,The mic never worked. When I took off the plastic  ear covers I noticed thet were cracked and also looked dirty and yellowed. I gave it the benefit of the doubt since I'd been using them a week or two but when I found my missing earphones  (the only reason I bought these) they weren't remotely as dirty and I'd had them for way longer.
4,Great quality for a great price.
1,DO NOT BUY!! Neither of these headphones work when I'm on the phone. The caller always says there is severe static coming from my side. I twirl the connector  & they say the static gets worse. I will NEVER purchase anything from this seller again.
5,Good headphones. Nice sound
2,These headphones aren't authentic Samsung headphones. I bought these as a replacement for mine since they broke and i loved the audio quality. These however are just your average headphones. with the Samsung logo stuck in them. They're okay if you're no too picky about sound but since that's the reason i was purchasing these I was disappointed.
3,The first time I ordered both ears  came damaged no audio. They fast send me. Anew set but The second time damage easily.
3,Audio quality was good at first. After a while the mic cuts in and out and the device hangs up on callers. It happened on both devices
5,Love these headphones and want to order more and I would if I could get for the same price as my first buy but not now that they have raised over 50%
1,The headphones were a replica of the real Samsung headphones but I noticed a big difference in the thickness of the wire and unfortunately after the 2nd day of use on one pair my left ear bud went out on the 5th day the right ear bud went out on the 2nd pair. I used them only for music so I continued to use one for the mic if I needed to make a call and the other just for music until both ear buds went out on one of the pairs. I know I could have sent them back but I didn't want to go through the hassle I just won't be ordering another pair
3,as expected for the $$
3,I like it's ease of fit in my ears
5,Great value. These work perfectly for my usage. I am not an audiophile and I just wanted something that I could listen to audiobooks on my phone and these work great.
3,El sonido no es el tan bueno Pero acorde al precio.
2,This came in a pack of 2. I bought to replace my son's lost earbuds 1 pair broke within a week after delivery... looks great but stopped working. And this product is not eligible for return. I wish I had read reviews and not wasted my money by buying this cheap knockoff.
1,So I've probably ordered 6 of these in the past few years.  Some work well and stick around for 5-6 months but then they start to wear out because it is made cheaply but what can I say?  sINCE this company doesn't care about their product or returns when they arrive defective I am giving them a review that is properly reflecting their desire to provide a working product.
5,Good product especially for the price
3,If you like high quality and volume don't get them they are OK but not high qualityTHE PRODUCT WORKS OK JUST DON'T GO TO HIGH IN VOLUMEN
1,Negative star thats what you get!.This is not even worth it. The product looks good. But there's a lot of factory defects. I bought 2 packs of this at the same time so i have four. I use the first one and only couple of days only one earplug is working so i pull out the second one and guess what the mic is not working. When i call somebody and use this they cant hear me. Then the third pair i got is buzzing on the left ear and it was so annoying. The fourth one. The last thing i have left is not working at all!. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT THIS IS A TRASH!
5,Fantastic earbuds. I love the volume and play controls on the right side.  Makes running with music very easy.  A quick double click on the play button switches to the next song. So convienent.
5,Great fit great sound. Would recommend.
2,The headphones are great good quality sound and everything but every time I get these headphones the microphone dies so I can't use for anything other than listening to music. I can't make calls send voicenotes or anything. The volume buttons and the pause/play/answer button work fine but the mic ALWAYS dies.
3,These seem to be a bit lighter (weight) and the wire seems a bit thinner than the ones that came with my phone.
3,The sound quality is not as clear as I would like them to be. But you get what you pay for. For temporary use these are ok
5,Love these for my xbox chat. Ill never go back to bulky headsets.
2,I normally really like these headphones as I have a S6 and am use to them but with the two pack i just ordered yesterday and the right earbud already not making any sound. You can see why i'm a little frustrated with it all i listened to music for one day on them turned on my music today and there was nothing being produced from the right earbud.
2,Fell apart about 6 months after purchasing
5,Just like what comes with your Samsung phone. Perfect! Exactly what I wanted.
1,With the silicon on with it off...these will not stay in my ears and are the most annoying headphones I have ever owned. Run far away. Do not buy.
3,After only two months I have to buy them again. One completely stopped working on the other one the left speaker stopped working.
5,Fits in my ears. I have small ears and these are great.
2,I got 2 sets. All the samsung related earphone that I have used lasted less than 3 months each. One of these only lasted a month. It's not my fault because I still have a sony earphones and Skullcandy headphones that are 3 years old and are in perfect condition. The sound is great for the limited time that they worked and they sit comfortable in your ear.
4,I always use theses headphones they always works good.
3,These work ok but.... they never work well with my iPad. It never controls the sound. No matter how many I buy it never does
4,Luv these head phones
5,I compared these to several headsets that came with Samsung phones and they are definitely the same. They work great and are the best deal around. Glad I took the risk and ordered these.
1,I have purchased Samsung OEM earbuds for a while now because they're pretty durable and have good quality sound and are relatively cheap. These are not Samsung earbuds. They arrived loose in a small plastic box instead of wrapped new and when I tried them the sound had zero bass it was all tinny and almost painful. If you buy these expecting Samsung OEM you will be disappointed. I don't know what they are but they're not Samsung.
1,These are 100% NOT OEM head phones. The sound quality is mediocre at best. Also the rubber covers on the buds come off very easily. Although they give you extras it's very annoying when you pull a headphone of out of your ear and the cover comes off. If you don't notice it fall then you have very uncomfortable headphones. On top of that the headphones started malfunctioning after maybe 8 weeks. The volume buttons broke and turned down my music by themselves every few seconds which rendered them useless. Heed the other reviews stay away from this product.
4,Good so far
4,YES I RECEID IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION THANKGOOD SERVICETHANK AGAIN
3,These are definitely B-grade earphones. The length of the cables to the ears are different sizes and one pair died after a few weeks.
3,One pair didn't work.
5,Awesome for the price. Well made
4,Good
4,Great value would purchase again.
4,Good just what was promised
1,Bad quality. You can hear other people and audio just fine however its not the greatest quality of sound it sounds really cheap like dollar store headphones. Also there is a constant buzzing noise when you try to use the headphones for phone calls.
1,The description calls for 2 sets of earbuds and only received one pair i paid for 2 sets as advertised
5,Our FAVORITE HEADPHONES so far!And to get 2 pair for such a great deal makes me feel all tingly like:)And BONUS MATERIAL yall--they came in quick! (But of course we do have primelol)
5,Love these!
5,I used these always on full volume i have dropped them and left them in my car on negative six degrees and they still work perfect also the mic is clear
1,These are definitely not original Samsung equipment. I have the original Samsung equipment in my hand to compare them with. Other than a superficial similarity of appearance they have nothing in common. The materials are made out of are different inferior. The sound quality is atrocious. These are not usable earbuds.In addition to the fact that these are copies and not originals they are not returnable. I would recommend that you buy nothing from this seller.
2,The actual headphones I was sent were NOT the ones pictured in the listing.  I really like the Samsung style where the head is shaped with the off-set speaker. They fit in my ears well and do not fall out unlike ones where the speaker is in the center surrounded by the rubber boot.
5,My kids like these earbuds more than any other. They go through earbuds a lot!! They also use these for xbox.
2,The product came in and it was amazing I loved it but after a while I finally try 2nd headset and for some reason it didn't work that's the only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars. Other than that the product was delivered on time and works great but for some reason one of the headsets didn't  work and the other didn't.
1,They appear to be legitimate samsung earbuds but the background noise (from sitting in an empty room with NO background noise) was so bad that the person in the other end could not hear me. Very disappointed. The deaign of this particular style earbud is the most comfortable to me. Wish I could find another set that work as well as the original ones.
1,I was sent the first order and both sets of headphones were defective.  I could hear fine but no one could hear me.  Tried to adjust with no good result.  Provider sent second set of headphones to replace the defective ones and could not be heard but so scratchy that I had complaint after complaint from whomever I was talking to.  I thought because they were Samsung the quality would be good but not so in this case.
2,You get what you pay for with these headphones. The two pack I received has only lasted me about a month. Neither set has a working microphone so not a good option if you're using these for making calls. Also the left earbud on both sets no longer works and one set you have to angle to get sound to come out. I wouldn't recommend these.
1,Not as advertised.Sound quality is OK but the product is inferior. I bought the two pack and both of them stopped working within a short period of time. I feel pretty confident this is not Samsung OEM
4,Great Product!
1,They say Samsung on then and look right. I have gotten replacements before and they always came in a case and when they didn't  have one i was skeptical. These must have been seconds if they are truly samsung. Right side headphone works good. Left is less then half of right. Not only on one pair but every pair i ordered.
5,This earbuds are great!! Since day 1 i used them...they were off the charts!! Really recommend them.
4,Nice headphones good quality.
1,These are nothing like the original Samsung OEMs that came with my phone. These look and feel fake they sound horrible and both pair I purchased stopped working within a couple weeks of use... I'm disappointed!
2,One pair doesn't work properly. The right side the one attached to the microphone I am unable to hear from. The left side sounds muffled no matter what I tried to do. The other pair was fine but still seemed muffled. I would return them but my boyfriend has the "good" pair and it's cheaper to get the 2 pack than it is for a 1 pack.
5,Have repurchased a few times love em...I use earbuds for quite a few hours a day so they die quick
5,All is good
4,Excellentperfect sound
1,These earbuds absolutely SUCK. I've bought sets of two twice and all four have stopped working (one side goes first) and one of them literally came apart at the bud when I took them out of my backpack.  For Samsung to have put their name on these very poorly made products surprises me.  I have always bought anything Samsung with confidence.  But I've learned my lesson on these.  They can't sell them cheap enough to offset the short lifespan and poor quality.  Unfortunately they are too big of a hassle to return so I'll just never buy them again.
3,Downside: It doesn't fit my tiny ears. It keeps popping out. Inadvertent upside: not having it too close protects my eardrums from potential hearing loss.
1,Ordered these to replace the earbuds I got with my Samsung phone. Worked fine for about a month and then started having to turn volume up more and more.  At week 5 the left stopped working completely.  Not good at all considering I've had the real Samsung for 2 years with no issue.
4,Work great
1,I don’t usually write reviews for bad products. I just return and move on but the fact that amazon allows this seller to put OEM is a bit embarrassing. I love amazon more than anything but this piece of garbage should not be sold here. Save your money and time cause I guarantee you’ll have to return them.
2,Of the two headsets that were in the package only one of them worked with my Samsung Galaxy Note 5. The other partially worked - i was able to listen to music but I was unable to use it to make phone calls. The recipients on the other end of the call were unable to hear me. Disappointed that headsets didn't work as it was supposed to.
5,These r the ones that my girls requests.  They use these all the time with their cells.  No complaints from them.
2,I've had these for a couple of months. One pair works fine. However the left ear bud of the second pair went out within a day. The volume is 20% of the one on the right. I had only used them to check to see if they worked! No wear and tear or moisture. Indeed it is poor quality.
5,So glad I was able to purchase them  I have been looking for some a while . The buds don't stay in my ears. Love  love them :-)
5,I am pleased that this package came with two sets of ear buds. Thay are comfortable to wear and very light weight. I wear my buds all the time !
2,The quality is cheap the second pair of headphones does not work. I'm very disappointed. The seller is a cheater. One couple lays down the worker and the other does not. I would love to return them back just do not want to mess with them.
3,Would give 5 cause these headphones work great but in one of the packs of headphones one of the ear buds didn't work
1,One pair fell apart out of the box. I had a pair like this that came with a phone & stayed in my ear well & had great sound quality & were snug enough to block out most noise. These are the exact opposite. When using at a high volume I could hear all conversations around me which was tons of fun on an 8 hour international flight with a screaming child. DON'T BUY THESE!
5,I have tried many earbuds through the years my ear-holes are small and these fit so nice & comfy. The sound quality is phenomenal these are the only earbuds I will buy from now on.
2,Theres static in one ear occasionally and they dont come with the different size of rubber covers. They are just the same size and one of mine had a defect that rendered it useless. Sound quality is pretty good otherwise
1,Absolute garbage! Another example of what happens when you fix a design that wasn't broken. The redesign diminished every function!The buds do not fit the ears. No matter how I adjust them they will not fit or stay in the ears.The microphone is poor quality. Merely switching to this headset made the voice to text feature on every software start consistently failing. Receivers of my calls said the quality was screechy and made them want to hang up on me.The sound quality was no better. In fact the lousy fit to the ears made listening less enjoyable.
5,These Samsung brand headphones look good and they sound good!!
3,I dislike the sound quality.
3,Sucked
1,The moment I plugged them there was static and it only worked out of one ear (both in the 2 pack). I rotated the plug to get sound in both ears only for the it cut out randomly for no reason when my phone was stationary.  I did everything I could to make sure it wasn't the headphones after first plugging them in (cleaned the port tested other headphones etc.). After doing so they still did not work.I do not reccomend this purchase.
1,Unusable.  Definitely not OEM.  They LOOK like it.  But One pair crackled insanely with unintelligible sound and the working pair was audible but noticeably poor quality. So disappointed
1,these are cheap chinese knockoffs not the originals  I got these to replace the samsung ones that came with my galaxy S7 (lost them somewhere).  Figured I would buy a direct replacement since they sounded great.  The ones I got here came in cheap chinese baggies (not samsung) and they feel cheap and sound TERRIBLE. I somehow bought 2 sets of 2 (four total) and they are ALL going back.  These do not compare to the samsung ones that came with my phone. No bass just tinny treble.
5,Headphones were really cheap but the quality is great perfect if you need an extra pair of headphones will buy again
1,I got 2 pieces but each of them has it sown problem1st one I used worked fine for a month and a half and then suddenly one fine day it started behaving strangely - the microphone started working on its own. It would reduce/increase the volume on it own play/pause music on its own and all the while I am not even touching it. It played music while I was on a call.Then I started using the second one but as it turns out this one has 2 LEFT earbuds instead one right and one left.(picture attached)
5,Great earphones to have as a backup. Great price.
4,Good!!!
2,While the earphones sound decent enough I'm glad I got the 2 pack because after a couple months of very moderate use the control side/right earphone went out. Maybe it was a defective unit.  I'll give the second set a try and will know soon enough. I missed the return window by a couple of weeks so either way I eat the purchase.
5,This is a good Product  !
1,These are fake. It says SAMSUNG but the quality it's far from the original ones that came with phone. The sound is terrible and hurt my ears. I trusted the SAMSUNG brand on it and the fact that I'm buying from Amazon. I had to return them right away and purchased these pair " Samsung OEM 3.5mm Tangle Free Stereo Headset with Microphone for Samsung Galaxy S5 - Non-Retail Packaging - Whiteby Samsung" but these are even worse. I had to return them too. I'm thinking to go to Samsung web site and find something there. DO NOT BUY THESE.
5,I was ordering these for my son. He loved them and they were exactly what he needed. The microphone works great as well as the earbuds. They arrived on time and were packaged very well.
2,Love these ear buds. It came in 2 pack which is a real good deal but one if them doesn't work properly. The right ear bud doesn't work. But the other one works great.
1,I bought these before and lost them. So I purchased again. However this set was cheaply made. The volume on both pairs keeps going in and out. It's been like that since I took them out of the package. VERY disappointed.
2,The sound quality is fine but one of the one of the buds stop working before they should. I had only one side working for months while no sound came from the other. They will work and sound find. Mic works fine but don't expect them to last long. save your money and find something else
5,I go through headphones like crazy and these Samsung stock ones are my favorite to sleep in. (I am almost always wearing headphones ) they are the exact same ones you get from the box.
1,Supuestamente eran 2 productos y recibí solo uno encontré otros a mejor precio
1,They were horrible sound they sounded robotic and static and the second pair the microphone and ear lost its sound within less of an hour of use
1,My second pair's right wire connecting the earphone is about an inch shorter than the left as the other pair's is not. Ignoring the previous statement the earphones are great for the price they are not adjustable in size and are pretty large(for my ears atleast) but after about 3 days I was already used to them.Bad review for a bad-ish product the length of the cable thing probably only happens once every few thousand pairs as a factory defect but it happened to mine and the world should know!
5,Thank you soooo much! Would definitely biy again from you. They work perfect and you just can't buy the Samsung headphones at Sprint where I got my phone from. Satisfied customer
1,The scratchy sounds started 5 weeks after I used the first set so I opened up the other pair. They were bad from the beginning. DO NOT BUY THESE.
5,Great headphones for the price. Exactly what I wanted.
3,I ordered two one came just fine but in the other one side was longer than the other and I don't like it
3,I love the sound but the right headphone stopped working after a half day of use. Definitely not a durable product.
3,One was made in China the other was made in Vietnam. They work fine. One side is shorter than the other
5,It works for me and it's a good price.
4,it is very good
5,Great value for the money spent! (This is not a fake review)
1,The first pair I opened only had one working ear bud. I decided to let it go and just use the second pair but with in a few weeks only the right ear bud worked. I'd get it if they got alot of wear and tear but I only use them during my lunch hour at work and am always careful of not putting the volume too loud.
4,Arrived promptly and work great.
1,I use these headphones for only 5 days and the right side stopped working. I thought the earbuds would be round and instead they are kind of L-shaped and do not fit snug in the ear.. the sound quality was fine and the microphone and volume control work perfectly. It's a shame that they broke so quickly. I am glad I have an extra pair but do not know how long the second pair will last. I recommend that you do not waste your money buying these. It is a waste of money.
1,I received the earbud well packaged and in a timely fashion. HOWEVER a few days after getting these headphones I gave a pair to my sister and kept a pair for myself. My sister's pair malfunctioned a few days after their arrival! The left earbud stopped working. I disregarded this being that my pair still worked. Now the left earbud in mine do not work. Must be counterfeit like people said. I should've listened to reviews rather than the price. DO NOT BUY!
1,Even though head phones are appealing in look and price do not let this fool you. they do say you get what you pay for. the first set of earbuds only one side works when I pulled out the second one there is noises in it like if its just going to explode in my ear. save you some time and do not buy these i might consider buying some other ones a little more expensive rather then having to go through the Inconvinince of having to return them.
1,I am very disappointed in these headphones. They are brand new already have issues with them. One pair only has one earbud that works. the other pair doesnt work at all! Do not purchase these headphones! You will be disappointed and they are not eligible for return. They are advertising them as name brand Samsung headphones when in reality they are just some cheap knockoff.
5,Good
1,Definitely 100% fake !!!The sound is horrible:  - highs/mids are fuzzy and unclear  - lows is non-existentI compared the headphones received to a pair that I have at home.  The appearance is identical with 2 subtle exceptions:  - the volume +/- is slightly different  - the plug tip-ring-sleeve separator is white not black like the original.It's a shame that amazon would facilitate a bogus product like this.  How does Samsung let this happen?
1,I had my OG Samsung headphones for years and they finally gave out so I ordered these to replace. They are not authentic they do not work if you move at all static and the main use is for talking with them and the person on the other end couldn't even hear me! For both pairs. Steer clear b/c this is garbage.
3,Get what you pay for
5,It was perfect and arrived earlier than expected
5,I love my head phones makes my phone sound crystal clear.
4,So far so good
3,The rubber protectors keep coming off the ear pieces. Also the when you talk thru the mic the reception is not clear.
2,Shipping was fast but I thought they were the same Samsung headphones I had before but the audio quality is so bad. I guess you get what you pay for. Ordering better headphones
5,I love how these fit in my ears!  Everyone should have a pair
4,Good condition
5,The initial order the two ear pieces was not working. No one can hear me when I tried to use them. I requested for a replacement and they are working great.
1,I received 2 pairs which is what I bought. The left driver in one pair was so weak that you could barely hear anything with it. The other pair has the sound quality of 90s dollar store headphones. Complete trash. When I filed an issue with the seller they asked for a photo of the problem. The units look fine! They just sound terrible!
2,The headsets arrived quickly which was great but the quality was very poor. After less than a week we noticed that both sets were either full of static or only one side worked. Before I discovered that both sets were less than high quality I ordered two more sets (because they were so affordable) so we'll see.
5,They look and act like they are supposed to!
5,Got these 2-3 years ago and still going strong. Use them to play ps4 for game sounds and comms.
4,Good
1,I can hear others clearly but the person I am speaking to hears terrible interference. One said it sounds like a drill is running another person on the phone said I sounded like a robot. I cannot use them to have conversation on my Samsung mobile phone.
2,Used to be my go to purchase for headphones. I've purchased the product many times and I'm not usually ticked when the only last 2 months a piece because it is a low price for decent quality. My issue is that now these headphones are only lasting a few weeks before one side shorts and stops working.
4,Good
3,In a matter of days one of the earbus stops working.
4,I like it.
4,Works good for me
2,These weren't absolutely terrible because they still did function perfectly fine as headphones. The mic did not work at all on either pair. I bought these more so for the mic so I could use it on my phone and other devices but they let me down hardcore. Also the shaping to the silicone buds themselves is irritating at times.
2,This is the third or fourth time I have purchased earbuds and every single time play and volume buttons don't work inat least 1 set
3,I love them 😎 I was scared at first but when I received them... I smiled.
5,Pretty good you should get them if you get a chance.
1,Waste of money.  Haven't had these a week and the sound goes in and out. Had 2 pair and they are both trash.
1,Of the 2 headphones I received one of them had a malfunctioning mic which made it totally useless. The other one has been working fine so far. I would have returned this but I didn't open the package till over a month later so I missed the return deadline. Lesson learned.***UPDATE***These were so cheap I decided to order again and this time the sound is louder in one ear than the other. Not having much luck with these headphones at all.
1,The worst headphones ever. The sound is terrible and they create a lot of noise and crackle like static or something. I'm going to attempt to return them or get a refund. Amazon should pull this product from here. Also in case you think this are the original Samsung headphones ( I did ) they are not. Cheaply made knock offs.
1,no bass the material making up the rubber wiring and the rubber ear pieces are cheap knock offs that dont stay in your ear and if you looked hard enough like i did on the tip of the piece that plugs into your phone is white instead of black like it is with the real pair that comes with your phone would give 0 stars if possible i went back to my broken ear buds and ordered some from the samsung company.
5,Love them! And they came with replacement ear piece covers.
3,These hurt my ears... why aren't they round anymore??? Hopefully these will last longer than the previous 12 pairs I've purchased!
1,These are very low quality knockoffs.  The sound quality is bad with what I can best describe as a hollow distorted sound.  The build quality is bad.  The durability is bad the left side stopped working within the first week of use.  Do yourself a favor and spend a few more bucks for a better set of earbuds.
3,Idk if its me but not as loud as the previous ones and get blown much quicker
1,Do not recommend.  Both sets of earbuds have stopped working.  Specifically on both sets the left ear bud stopped working.  It must be a manufacturer defect.
2,These are inexpensive and perform like an inexpensive headset.  I ordered a 2 pack (since I knew I'd misplace one).  The first pair worked fine for a couple weeks and then one bud stopped working. The second set lasted a few months before the same issue occurred.  I paid about $5 for each pair.
4,It worked good
1,Total junk...should have read reviews before buying but given "Samsung" under title I thought I was buying from them.. I bought to replace the pair that came with w/ my S6 Edge+ that after a year were damaged.  These are not real. These are horrid.- Volume is "tinny" and not very loud.  Sounds like in a cave.- If cord bends...in any way on both pair...the sound cuts out.Returning now.YES THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 'CAUSE IT AINT!!!!!DON'T BUY.
4,Product received as listed!
1,This can't be by the real samsung it must be some knock offs. The order came with 2 sets of earbuds. The second day I wore one it had statics. The 3 day one of the earbuds is working. I tried the second pair and it also has static. The quality of both sets of earbuds are beyond bad. The sound coming out of them is very low quality and muffled. I really doubt this is samsung selling these crap. Waste of money. do not buy!!!
4,Good value...
2,Very uncomfortable! Not like what's pictured.
4,Great product
1,If the left ear worked they would be fine.
1,These are horrible! They must not be real Samsung headphones because the connection malfunctions all of the time.  It feels like they have a mind of their own muting my music at random times or turning the music up to the max all of a sudden.  It signals certain apps on my phone to open up sporadically.  It is the weirdest thing!  I am currently trying to decide if its worth it to return it or just consider them a sunken cost.
1,Right out the package and both headphones on the right ear bud do not work properly. I can compare these to dollar store headphones.
2,These headphones are not durable at all. I've bought these same exact pairs three times and they always last three weeks or less even when taken good care of...would not recommend.
1,Bought these headphones as a replacement to the pair I received when I bought my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Excited that they arrived today only to be disappointment that from the pictures you can see the left ear piece extends longer than the right ear piece so the two are not even. And to top it all off both ear pieces are for the left ear. So these are pretty much useless. The manufacturer should be more careful. These will be returned.
5,So happy I found these my daughter goes through them quickly and it is nice to be able to order a few at a time.
3,Works but one of the sets seems to have a short sound is in and out if I move too much.
5,Good marshmallow earphones. Has pause and volume up and down. Comes with a extra set of covers. Superior to them gas station headphones you buy that break in a day.
1,Buy these headphones if you need some expensive fishing tackle weights. These are useless for all other purposes. I've went through 4 of these pairs in less than a week and I will never buy these again. One headphone jack goes dead after about 5 hours of use on every single set I've had. These are defective.
4,Great product
5,Kinda sad because on both of my ear buds one of the ear pieces doesn't work. But I love the quality so I am okay with this.
5,Mines seem real all the functions work properly like double pressing the pause button to skip so yeah it's a great deal for 2 headphones
1,I got to enjoy the headphones for about a monthSadly the speakers on both of the headphones stopped working. The buttons on it still work but I can't hear anything. Very frustrating to have that happen within a month of purchase. It was well packaged tho and they worked well for the time they did.I tossed them being upset so no refund could be done. It was just upsetting.
5,What i wanted i was skeptical because of the price but yhey were what i wanted and you get two! They are worth it. Will buy more if i need too.
2,Bought these thinking they were original but they are ripoffs. In the first week the first pair blew out and i dont even like loud music in my ears to say it was high volume. The wiring broke inside of the plastic so it was just a long wire with nothing inside. Very disappointed
1,Sound quality is good only for 3-5 days. This is my 3rd set. All of them trashed. End/answer call button does not work. Would not recommend
1,THE PICTURE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET! The headphones are not loud at all and dont say samsung down the side. " thinking they were was the reason I bought them.Only one side has any type of volume the other is so low it might as well not work. Horrible product. I wouldn't waste my money ever again!
1,I ordered a set of these headphones and they lasted all of 24hrs before both started giving me problems. The sound goes in and out through one ear and adjusting the cord does not help. On one set the volume would adjust on its one it would hang up on calls and try to open Google voice because all three buttons malfunction. DO NOT buy these! The hassle and headache are not worth the $10. Spend a little more and get an authentic set.
3,Quality is decent but nothing to brag about. Fit is perfect but sound quality deffinitly could be better
5,Love them great and super cheap! I bought 2 of there for $30 on sale at BJs and they were the exact ones as amazon. Great buy!!
3,they didn't fit my ear properly
5,There great for cheap earbuds..... an u get 2 for di price a 1
3,Audio quality with these is particularly bad. You can find cheap ear buds with better sound quality but mic feature is great!
2,I bought these in bulk over a year ago and they lasted a long time. Repurchased 3 months ago and all 4 broke one right after another. :(Guess they are not genuine Samsung earplugs anymore
2,I purchased the 2 pack due to my son being rough on head phones.  1 head phone works great however the 2nd pair did not have any sound at all.  The time had expired to do anything about it.  Next time I'll check it out  when I get them.
1,I just received it and compared it from head to toe wit the original ear bud that i used to have. I had a little hope that this would be legit before since these earbuds came directly from Amazon. These ear buds are NOT Samsung OEM ear buds. I still can't believe Amazon carries countefeit products and sells them. I got this directly from Amazon through Ship and Sold by Amazon. I just should've listened to the others. The sound quality is horrible. Wayyyy too low bass and it feels like it's missing few channels. It def doesnt sounds like original one.
1,Not like the original Samsung headphones. Cord length 6 inches shorter. Sound quality is horrible metallic sound no bass. Returning ASAP. Stay away.
5,I just receive this ones and to but honest they are pretty good so far of course the quality is not as the original ones but works as good.
1,I just compared these with the original headphones I got from Samsung when I bought my phone. These are definitely not OEM. Moreover they broke within 2 weeks of use! Pathetic!
5,I loved my own samsung buds so I got 2 more for spares. Fast shipping and great price!
1,This is my second time ordering these. The first time was great! So great that I had to give them up to my daughter and my wife.  So why would this be any different from the first time right? Wow was I wrong. From the beginning the was an echo on both pair when talking on the phone. They were still great for listening to music. Now one of the ears just went out for no reason. So disappointed this go around.
3,One pair works beautifully but for the other pair only one of the two earbuds work. Very frustrating
3,Sound quality definitely not that of headphones that come directly from Samsung. You get what you pay for what these unfortunately:(
2,Wow ...I was stunned as soon as I put these in my ears they hurt!! I really thought these Samsung (2 PACK) OEM Wired...Earbuds  would be just what I wanted for my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Along with the shape and covers...but no they were terrible -:(
1,It came in a 2 pack and one stopped working within 24 hours and the second stopped working within 72 hours. These are not samsung durability.
5,These headphones are very good quality for the price. I would recommend this over any store bought earbuds unless your wanting to drop good money.
3,one if the pack wasn't working - other than that they work as expected
5,THE BEST HANDS DOWN YOU DONT WANT TO PUT THEM DOWN
2,falls out and is very painful when worn
3,Don't compare to the ones that came with my galaxy....but don't cost as much either. ..soon hey
3,It's worth the money.  The microphones don't work on either of the two that I ordered
5,Using this product
4,A+
3,The quality is ok but it's not the real thing. It's good for the price
3,1 of the two was broken but the price is still cheap and the other one was fine.
5,Excellent product.  Fast shipment and reasonable price.  Highly recommend this Amazon seller.
3,Did not like the way they fit into our ears however they work just fine.
3,Sound was ok but they both stopped working in one ear after a few weeks
2,These are not factory headphones. They definitely work and feel about the same but are not as good as the official Samsung headphones that ship with the phone. First thing i noticed is that these are much shorted in length than actual Samsung headphones and the sound quality is bad compared to the Samsung OEM.
3,Expect one ear to go out. On both headphones. Good price
1,I was so excited to get these seemingly OEM headsets but they are not like the ones I got when I bought my phone. The sound quality is horrible and I have to hold the jack at just the right angle to work. Often times all people here is static and I end up having to put my phone on speaker. What a disappointment!
2,I use the product for my PS4 phone and Ipod. You get two ear phones with purchase but they are low quality. NOT the same quality as earbuds that come with samsung phones.
5,This is not the first time i buy this headset  and my experience with this one is absolutely wonderful an amazing sound and worth it.
3,Physical quality is great however sound is lacking - definitely knock offs but good knock offs.
1,Within weeks. Both headphones only worked in one ear.  I got them replaced and the next two concked out with 9 days
5,The best sounding stock throw always the only one I can fall asleep with em in
5,Great value for 2 sets of earbuds.
2,Stopped working withing two weeks of purchase.
1,They seem to be working ok but they don't stay in the ear. I simply cannot fit them to stay. They keep coming out. I seem to have a pretty "standard" ears ...
5,Good earphones they are lasting more than the original earbuds my galaxyss6+ came with . Great for the price definitely buying in the future
1,Yeah I'm pretty disappointed that Amazon would even sell these. I compared them with my original samsung earphones from the box and they are a very convincing fake. Everything looked good until I plugged them in! First pair only had sound through one ear and the second pair had the left ear's cord longer than the right's. These might be useful as convincing movie props but not worth buying for any sort of audio experience.
1,Received a single pack of headphones labeled "2 pack".
5,Both sets work perfectly for me all of the buttons do as they are supposed to and the sound quality is exactly what you'd expect.
2,One of the two I got had a wiring issueThat caused painful feedback and the second lasted only a couple of weeks. 0/10 would not purchase again.
5,Love love love my new earphones....it arrived quickly and functions very well.It does not hurt my ears...And with the low price you will never go wrong.
1,within a week or two the sound in one ear bud diminished completely.i purchased this item due to the fact of OEM and i have a Samsung phone.Mind you i had two pairs and the same happened to both pairs. the lost of sound from a earbud.I utilized a iphone earbud and no issues. that is what i have been using and works great.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!!!!!
3,They are comfortable but they have a muffled sound to them compared to my original Samsung S5 earbuds.
1,Do yourself a favor and listen to all of the reviews that say that they came with 2 left or 2 right earpieces. I read the reviews but thought they must have been isolated incidents. Well when they came one set was okay but the other had 2 right earpieces which makes it useless since they are designed to fit the ear canal for each side. These must have been factory seconds that should have been destroyed.
1,Up until 3 months no issues. And then both pairs lost sound in the left ear. What else can I say they suck
5,I normally go thru ear buds pretty fast these have outlasted the ones i had before.
4,Fabulous...i'm happy.
5,Sound grate use them in school everyday 💯. I cop for me and my lil bro. 10 of 10 on baby
3,they worked well when i got them now the right ear bud isnt working?
5,Very happy with these headphones! I hate squishy earbuds these ones are solid and sound great for the purposes of listing to podcasts.
1,I bought the 2-pack. One pair had its left side defective OUT THE PACKAGING with poor sound quality on the right side. The other pair was fine for about a week of use then the left side died then the right side died the day after. If you want broken headphones buy these.
1,I purchased these new and tried them both out. Neither of the right earbuds play any sound. Do not waste your money on these.
4,Good
5,I got them on time and I opened the package and there were 2 sets of earphones. Both of them function properly and sound clear.
5,I bought the 2 pack and one stop working and I don't know how to return for a replacement or refund.
5,not loud as I was expected but over all pretty good headphones.
5,I love'em They don't come out of ear especially in strenuous situations. The noise pick up is wonderful from the mic and the ear bud.
3,One of the two sets of headphone has a right earbud dead. But I guess that's why it's so cheap.
1,Disappointed because i bought from this seller over a yeat ago and they were so good but maybe the product is old and tainted now because there is a shortage. There was a shortage problem the very first time used out of package.  The right side works less than more. I dont have the time so i just deal with em.
5,Great for the price. They dont last longer than three or four months. But  you get 2pair so it works out
1,I was expecting the regular dome shaped plug bud.  These reject shaped bean things are horrible and don't form a tight seal.  Meaning I have crank the volume way up (mostly audio books and podcasts) just to follow what's going along.  Even then I can't hear it as well as I can listening four or five clicked down using the normal plug shape.
5,I like them. Will order again. Already lost one pair. Just like the ones that cane with the phone... I think. I lost those too.
1,Neither set worked with a Samsung Galaxy. Static in the mic caused every call to be distorted and complained about by the person I was talking to. I had to remove the headset to carry on a conversation. Yes they were cheap so I should have expected those problems. Will not reorder or recommend.
1,Came in a 2 pack and both of the mics did not work.  Seller never responded to my emails.
1,It deserves zero stars. I got the 2 pack and none of them worked  I complained to Amazon and got replacement ones and those didn't work either! Ugh! I complained again but I can't get a refund bc I threw them away. My fault I know but I was so upset they didn't work after the 4th pair I chucked them in the garbage because that's what they are!
3,The quality of these headphones definitely does not seem as though they are authentic. They do work though.
5,Good product deliver before expected
5,Price is great shipping was fast and they perform just as good as the original headphones that came with the Phone (Gallaxy s6)
2,One set of earbuds only had incoming sounds the microphone doesn't work! The other set only has 1 working earbud on the microphone side. A disappointing purchase!
1,It's not real Samsung a cheaply made one you can get from Dollar store
3,The cord broke for unknown reason and I just had it for a few days.
3,I think it's not original earphone.  But it's okay quality not very bad.
3,These were ok but thd ears did nof fot as well as the orogj ax lz
3,Lasted a few months then broke. Good thing you can buy them in packs of 2.
5,Nice and clear and loud
5,They work perfectly. Great quality and great price. I gave the second pair to my mom to replace the ones I broke. She liked them as well.
2,I actually loved these ear buds--comfortable to wear and I love the volume button but it's in the past tense as they already don't work. First one pair a couple of months ago and then already the second pair is toast! :(
3,Good enough for 10 dollars... But one end is longer than the other a defect!
5,Great price and sound great.
5,Great earbuds.  I have a small ear canal and othet earbuds hurt amd don't stay snug in my ear.  These fit perfectly.
5,super fast shipping - just as described and work fantastic!! took them out and plugged them right in :) :) :)
1,Definitely not legit. One pair came with 2 left buds. Great if you happen to have two left ears. Or two heads both missing the right ear. The other pair works fine but the cord is about 5 inches shorter than the pair that came with my phone. Poorly packaged I'm disappointed in Amazon for selling counterfeit products under the brand's name and logo.
1,One pair was damaged. with the coating exposing wires and other pair is useless... inaudible on receiver's end.
2,Within one week of having it the right earbud stopped working. When I started using the second one the pause button didn't even work. I might've been too rough with it or they aren't that good of quality. I don't know. Buy it if you want.
2,They sound really cheap. These are NOT the same quality as the headphones that came with your phone. they look really good. I Paid 12 bucks for 2 pair so I guess that is still a good deal for the price. Everything works so far its only been 4 days though.
3,I don't think these are original.... but they are ok for the price....
5,Great quality for price
3,I got the two pack deal  however only one of them had the microphone working....
5,Very nice whole family use them
2,After the first week the first fair broke the wiring inside the headphone snapped so I can only use one headphone switch to the second pair and within that next week the same thing started happening. In hindsight just spend the extra money and buy yourself a decent pair of headphones
1,And i bought 2 pair......these ear buds are not from Samsung....the reason i had to buy these is bc i evidently lost the ones that came with the phone. The ones that came with the phone i had for almost a year no issue....that is until i lost them smdh. Bought these thinkin im back in action but no sir....these are for the garbage. My people save ya $10. Be blessed.
5,I love it. The quality is good and fast shipping. Don't listen to other negative reviews.
5,PERFECT EAR BUDS FOR MY SAMSUNG.2 SETS WITH BACK UP COVERS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
5,Best headphones I have ever owned
5,Theses headphones sound great and come with extra ear gel tips. I would definitely buy them again. They are a great deal.
3,they're working fine but the volume control buttons on the wire itself are not working on both items
1,This is NOT OEM they are the worst sounding headphones I ever purchased.
1,These stopped working in one ear after 24 hours.  Returning them and not buying again.  Should have heeded other reviews.
3,Same headphones that came with my phone. Only one pair worked and the other didn't
3,They are ok not great i like my skull candy more than these
5,I lost my original pair. These work just the same and they're at a great price!
3,Good buds just wish the ear gels would stay on them.
3,One ear bud always stops working for no reason. Won't buy again.
1,they don't work. both have the same problem and that is you cannot hear from the side with mic and sometime callers cannot hear you (more often than they can actually hear you). I got refund but thought it only right to give a honest review.
5,I received my product and I couldn't be happier. It did arrive a little late but I am still a satisfied customer.
1,These were not the same quality as the one's that come with a phone. The sound is less clear and lower; beyond that the two headsets only lasted  a couple of weeks before both broke. The microphone is glitch and eventually started phantom clicking - changing the volume and switching songs every couple of seconds.Sound Quality  1.5/5Microphone Quality  3/5Build Quality  0.5/5Comfort  4/5
3,Sound quality is decent there is a slight scratchy noise when first using them.
3,I bought 4 and only 3 came. I want my money back
3,I was happy how fast they got here but one of the headphone mics don't work... :(
2,I purchased got them and after listening to one pair for 3 days they went completely out. Then opened the new ones and after about 7-10 days the left side stopped working. It would be more to send them back than it was to purchase them.
5,Worked great just like the ones I got with my note
3,Does not work for my ear. They keep falling out
2,One of the two headphones  that were delivered  to my house  were defective and only had sound in the left ear bud otherwise  I would give a higher  rating  .
1,These headphones have a lot of static noise and are very positional. If the wire moves at ALL half the headphone will stop working. The sound quality is okay but you get what you pay for. I do not recommend purchasing these.
3,The headphones weren't having any good sound quality
2,The shape of these headphones is very uncomfortable to me and the mic seems to have problems. I only tried using it twice though because the shape was so uncomfortable. But both times the other person shouldn't hear me. Shipping was quick.
5,well worth it my son breaks head phones all the time most dont last week these have great sound
3,Its a good headphone
3,They stopped working after a month ( both of them at the same time )
2,I received both headphones in a good package. They looked good but when I tested one of them the right earpiece wasn't working. So I basically only received one proper working headphone. I'm an amazon prime costumer and I'm hoping I will get this resolved.
3,ok but the first pair broke within the first month
5,lost the one that came with the phone. both of these feel exactly the same and work just as well. glad it was cheap
2,They earpods cannot be real. I compared them against my real Samsung's earpods and they we not as comfy or sounded as good. Also I do have to admire how great of counterfeits they are because they look I identical down to the individual details.
5,I like the way the buds fit. Sound quality is fine. Microphone works good
5,Good cheap earbuds
3,Both broke after 2 weeks of use.
5,It's my favorite headphones
1,Both gave out just over a month.  Garbage. Don't buy.
5,I love these headphones. They are clear and easy to use. I also like how they fit in my ears.
1,They sound awful and is NOT a good product to buy.
2,1 pair of head phones works fine the other pair disconnects my conversations. Because I paid so little for them and I don't have time or patience for returns I give a 2.5 star rating since only half my order works
1,No one could hear me clearly on it and it stopped working after a month.
5,They fit well
3,I do knot like the new s5 ear buds they hurt my ears after a while.
5,I love these headphones
2,Bad sound sound low volume level I don't think this are Samsung OEM!Easy refund process!
5,Great product. Still using the first headphones. These are the most durable headphones you can get for a good price.
2,Second day of use and they are already cackling poor sound quality. I needed headphones but I'll have to get the 30 dollar pair since these are obviously not authentic enough to last.
1,The volume control buttons do not work and the sound is faint. Should have read the reviews first!
3,One of the ear buds of my 2 pack doesn't work there is no sound what so ever
3,Great fit but terrible mic quality sounds very quiet and muffled.
3,Couldn't even control the music or talk through them after a week
5,Product exactly as expected
1,These are not Samsung Earphones they are a knock-off brand that is poorly made.  The microphone quit working after an hour of use.
2,Ordered as replacements for the headsets that came with my phone.  Sound quality is nothing like the originals.  Cannot find a part number on either set of earphones to figure out how to order replacements of the same quality. looks nearly identical.
5,I ordered these because I have a pair and figured my kids needed some too! Would recommend them to anyone!
5,I love these so much that  I bought 5 two pks for gifts to my friends with Galaxy devices for such a low price
1,I was very excited when I got two pairs of earbuds for such a great value! They got here in time and I started using them right away. It was to my disappointment that within a few uses the sound in the right ear bud cut in and out. I'm a little surprised at the quality of this product from amazon and how quickly it had broke.
5,Always had a hard time trying to use regular ear buds because I have small ears......these stay put and sound great
1,Poor quality.  Only one side works.Do not buy.
2,When i got product 3 out of 4 of them worked. 2 pair of the ear pieces when out within a week of getting them. The one pair that is working. Works fine. I like how they fit in my ear.
5,Real Samsung headphones just like the ones that come with my S6 Edge. Comfortable fit. Great for talking on phones while driving.
2,These headphones are not good quality. Neither works anymore. They aren't broken in any way. First one pair stopped working (both sides at once)  and the second pair first the right bud and then the left. Won't buy these again.
1,Item was cheap took a chance. Right ear bud on one pair did not work.
2,I opened one of the 2 sets and after just 3 days the side with the mic stop working so only one side produced sound. The same day i opened the other one it was brand new and only one side produced sound.
1,cannot leave a zero rating........ one ear bud not even connected to the wire..... the other set will it be better?  no.  one ear bud did not work.  Look somewhere else or feel free to send me your money same result crappy or no sound
1,Don't recommend.I got the 2 pack and I was excited cause my old ones broke out of nowhere and it was very disappointing.I tried these out and noticed my right side bud wasn't working and thought oh well ill just use the other one.The left side is out on this one....Sound quality is also horrible. I made a better speaker junior year out of plates and a cardboard tube.
5,Comfortable no static!
5,These are  a great pair of earbuds. My wife does not like things in her ears and she loves these.
3,The don't last long after 2 pair I'm not buying anymore.
3,Set of two but one came broken. Not the best sound quality. Expected better.
2,I haven't had them for a good week and one pair has already stopped working! Now I know why you get 2 for this price because they know they are some bs earphones. Can't be original
1,Exactly one month later and both my pairs of head phones have broken. One pair broke the very first time that I used them. The other pair lasted the rest of the month but now they don't work either. Ironically it was the right ear that went out in both pairs if headphones. Not worth the buy unless you want to buy again in a month.
5,Great for Samsung replacement headphones
1,Horrible quality. These are obviously fake. I loved the original pair that came with my Samsung Galaxy S7 and ordered these when I unfortunately lost that set. But the difference was night and day. The sound quality was fuzzy and kept cutting out and the right ear bud barely had any sound at all. On BOTH pairs. Do not waste your money on these. Invest in the real deal.
2,They both look and feel like the original headphones I had from the Galaxy s6. However one of them already stopped playing audio from the right ear after  only a week. The second one is working fine for now the buttons work and everything.
2,It last for about two weeks before the mic stopped working...it always last for a few weeks and then one side stops or the mic stops..the only good thing is the price. I guest for get what you pay for.
3,They arrived quickly and are inexpensive but break very quickly
3,One headset didn't work properly. Mic volume was very low.
1,I bought these pairs of headphones and they both shorted out in the right earbud after about 2 months. I wasted ten dollars to see both of my pairs of headphones break; They are not the real brand and they're really bad unless you lose a pair of headphones every 2 months... DON'T purchase these headphones they are a fake brand and that's why their so inexpensive.
5,I love it
5,Good pair of headphones for the price.
5,Samsung brand and you get 2 sets in a pack. They fit perfectly in my ears and don't fall out.
5,Great Headphones.  They are just perfect.  I bought two and I really love them. The Sound is just great. I Recommend.
2,Breaks after 2 years of use for me your mileage may vary.
3,Are so weak on the cables.
5,I've ordered several due to a new puppy chewing the others and all have worked perfectly. Delivery time was as promised.
1,It doesn't last more than 15 days very disappointing
5,Great product
1,The microphone goes in and out on both of these. For listening only they are fine but the microphones do not work.
2,With the first one it Worked for a day or two then one of the ear went out.  So I started to use the second one that one was good for about a week then went out as well.
2,What are the speakers came in blown on one pair the other shortly after about 5 or 6 times using it started to go out to I'm Samsung man but I would go with apples headphones over these
5,Got exactly what I wanted and even came in a bit earl . Love these type of headphones. Great quality.
1,One pair lasted about a month but was never as good as the original Samsung ear buds I got with my phone. And the second pair is bad right out of the package. Of course I am outside my return window. I wouldn't waste your money on these.
1,As soon as I plugged them in everyone I talked to said all they heard was static. They are not even usable 😕
3,I got two of them but one of them hardly work...
1,They did not work at all these are extreamly cheep nock offs of the real samsung earbuds you get with a samsung phone DO NOT BUY THEM THINKING ITS THE SAME PRODCUT. AMAZON SOME HOW THINKS ITS OK LET THIS SCAM OPERATE ON THEIR SITE.
3,One earbud on one headset doesn't sound right like something inside of it is loose or faulty.
3,One of the sets right one is already not working.
5,Its sound good
1,first pair lasted almost a month second pair lasted until late July.  highly not recommended.
1,These look like they're Samsung but they're not. I bought two pair and I'm having problems with both of them. One of them the right head piece doesn't work at all and on the other one when I plug into the phone it brings a static noise and the callers on the phone can't hear me. Totally useless and waste of money...
1,One set had bad left earbud and second set had bad right earbud no sound. Returned for a refund.
3,One pair was awesome! Worked great the other only the left ear worked..
1,Should have used my better judgement and NOT have purchased these. The reviews are definately accurate and my headphones stopped working after 2 months. On one set the left one went out and the right may work if you play around with the cord. The other set just flat out stopped working! WILL NOT be purchasing any more products from here. Very disappointed
5,I've ordered a pair several times and they have lasted me quite a long time
1,Worked for about a day and then the right headphone was staticy and bad. Can barely hear. Haven't tried the second pair yet but I'm not hopeful. At least the microphone works unlike the last pair I bought. I guess I should just give in and buy the expensive ones next time. Will probably return just waiting to try out the second pair.
3,Both pairs stopped working not even two months later.
3,1 ear stopped working after a month of use
5,Yes my wife loves them. I love them when my Bluetooth headset is dead due to quality is same perfect
5,Well wrapped and the product is really good. It took a little bit longer to reach but it worth it.
1,First set has two right ear buds. Even though it is labeled as [L] it is clearly a right ear bud.The second set is crackly and sounds horrible.
3,Not as loud as I would like. Good for phone calls though.
1,Right ear on both sets does not work. They are cheap crap!
5,They were exactly what I thought they would be and they were exactly what I needed.  Would order them again without question!
2,I just opened my "new" packaged earbuds and neither pair work!!! One pair you can't hear anything the other set  only the righr ear works. I'm not happy because I need these hand free device for daily use
5,Im satisfied 100%  it was amazing headphone thanks for cheap price with a great quality.  Original product its worthy
5,Good stuff
5,Good
5,They work great but one of the two pairs one speaker didn't work but for the other headset it works great
1,I liked that they had a great sound and they were noise canceling but they stopped working the day after they came in. I tried to listen to music the next day and couldnt hear anything from the earbuds. I do not recommend these for anyone.
2,I gave 2 stars for the price but you get what you pay for. They gave off a lot of static and I was unable to use the microphone. Buy the higher price item for a few dollars more.
1,Not the same in the pictures also pretty cheap and terrible sound quality
1,Was not pleased at all.  Both headsets stopped working within 3 days. Very poor quality and a waste of money my money that is .So unfortunate that people get taken advantage of this way .Because of my disappointment I will never purchase such items on your site ever again. I was always sceptical about shopping online. This is why.  I was ripped off.
1,Horrible earphones. Talking mic is fuzzy and ear buds are not clear. Called Samsung they said they stopped selling this model in 2017. This is in no way oem and total garbage. Dont waist your money.
1,After a few weeks something shorts out in the plug and the sound either starts cutting in and out or the headphones start sending phantom control signals (pause forward voice command etc.) to my phone (a Samsung Galaxy Note 4). I've had the same thing happen with three pairs now. Even reinforcing the jack area with tape to keep it from bending doesn't prevent this.
1,I have bought these twice now. The first time I recieved exactly what was described and they were great! So after my husband inevitably lost his I ordered more. The second time I recieved off brand ear buds in sketchy packaging and they looked used! Gross.
3,Bad quality it sound bad
5,I've ordered them 3 times.  Love these headsets.  They stay in your ears and are o so comfortable.
2,Only 1 out of the 2 sets of headphones worked. It sounds nothing like the original Samsung headphones.. very disappointed in these I would not recommend them unless you want subpar headphones for cheap
2,These don't work well.  Of the 4 pairs I ordered 3 started cutting out right away on the first use and made hands free conversation impossible.The purchase however was very smooth.
2,It's the what was shown online but there was one problem one of them already went bad. Now a few days ago the other headset went out on left side just like the other one.
1,I bought this headphones on May 16 2021 and 3 weeks later only once side works......very disappointed
3,The silicone keep coming off
2,Only one of the two headphones work properly. This was after only having the product for a couple weeks. I spent thirty minutes on hold trying to contact customer support and they never connected me to an agent.
1,the picture of these headphones is completely inaccurate.  What is pictured is the standard headphones that come with the newer note 8 galaxy s7 edge etc.  What is sent is the old samsung headphones that are completely round and almost seal the ear when you use them. Totally misleading and deceptive.
2,I have bought 3 sets of these since summer time 2016. Each time within a couple months ONE of the sides would die.. my daughter and I feel that they died quickly and I don't understand.
5,Great for the price
1,This doesn't seem like OEM. I would not recommend buying. The earbuds broke way to quickly.
5,Great deal! Great quality and you get two for less than the price of one set of Apple headphones.
3,They are ok for the price.
1,Bad quality broken after two months of used. Don't buy!!
3,One earbud was longer than the other. Good sound
1,Product is not what is described. It doesn't even have Samsung on the headphones as it is in the picture. Very disappointed in the product. Does not have the same sound quality as my original headphones that came with my phone. Poor product.
2,The product worked well enough and I was happy. Until one ear went out after pretty limited use.
1,I liked them fine for about a month and then they broke. I had my original Samsung earbuds for over 3 years and was hoping for the same quality.
1,These are not like the old model Samsungs. These fall out of my ears and I can barely hear them. If there is any background noise at all I can't hear them even with the volume turned up to max.
2,Really great quality when you first buy them. After a few months they short out or one ear plug shorts out. The rubber covers that go over the ear plugs also fall off too easily.
2,Barely received them just now and I only received one set of the earbuds. The title does say "(2 pack)" so if that isn't the case you should change the name because it's pretty misleading.
5,I got them to replace my original ones that I got with the phone and they are great.
1,Horrible sounding. When ever I call my mom and she's using the earphones there's always static in the call.
5,Very good product ... sounds just like the original ... Very high quality ! Would definitely buy again
1,VERY FLIMSY. I HAD THEM FOR LESS THEN A MONTH AND THE RIGHT EAR PIECE IS ALREADY BROKEN. AND THIS HAPPENED TO BOTH OF THEM. I GAVE A ONE OF THE PAIRS TO MY BOYFRIEND AND THE SAME DAY HE TOLD ME THAT HIS WERE STARTING TO HAVE STAIC COMING FROM THE RIGHT EAR PIECE MINE STARTED DOING THE SAME THING.
1,Not durable at all stop working after a few days
2,Very Generic decent temp earphones but terrible quality an you can see they will break very soon was the worth the wait to be conned by this amazon seller
1,Will return
5,These headphones are fantastic.  Indicative of Samsung quality.  I use it for many other electronics.  Received very quickly!
2,I actually liked how these headphones sounded and felt in my ears however within the first day of usage the right earbud stopped working on one pair. Dissapointed on the quality control of Samsung here.
1,Product is not Samsung.  Does not have the Samsung name on the ear buds as shown the pictures.  Sound quality is very subpar.  I have had the Samsung ear buds before. These are not it!  Product description is very misleading.
3,works really geat!!
5,Coworker likes them. They came in a two pack.
2,They break so fast but they are comfortable headphones. I bought 2 pair and the first pair broke within the first month and I'm still on my second pair. 2 stars because they tried.
5,Awesome 👍
5,learned my lesson with other off-brands - Always use accessories designed for the phone. These are great!
2,No cusions for the ear so the insert is hard.  It's okay for some time use.  Uncomfortable though.
2,They're okay and they work. They are not very comfortable and don't fit snugly inside your ear so they don't block out sound. I would not purchase these again; there are better cheap headphones on the market.
2,One of the pairs of earphones broke or came apart within a week of beginning use of them. Normally I am satisfied but this time I am not because of defective product.
5,Like OE
1,These headphones break within two weeks. Do not waste your money.  They replaced the first pair.  I said that I would give them another shot.  Now  the other two are both broken and they will not accept returns . The left side goes out  so if your looking for a one eared plug this is your set.
2,NOT OEM!!! quality is bad and is only good for making calls not music i LOVE listening to music especially when its in high quality THESE DO NOT SOUND LIKE THE OEM!!!
1,Both had a lot of static from the headphones wasn't great and the static from the talking headset part had so much you couldn't even communicate. Clearly either broken or just poorly made
5,I like this product
3,Volume control doesn't work very well.
5,Excellent
1,both the right earbuds on both in the set of 2 stopped working after a very short time of use.
1,The earbuds were very disappointing. There was a lot of static on the caller's end and they could not hear me. I emailed the cellar and they were so gracious to send me another pair unfortunately I had the same issue with the new pair. Not satisfied at all.
5,These are far superior to the ear buds that come from Apple. Better fit better volume better quality half the price.
5,Good
1,Ive bought these headphones from amazon and every time one ear goes out. I just bought these and BOTH sets had one ear out. I used to think it was my fault but i just opened these and barely used them and they are already messed up. It is the SAME problem for every pair of headphones.
1,Both sets of headphones were broken. The first pair one ear piece did not Work. The second pair one of the ear pieces was cracked when I took it out of the package so now all there is just a metal piece and some wires. We'll see how the exchange goes but right now im very upset i purchased these.
2,I overlooked the fact that the sound quality was not as good as original. But it has been a little over half a year and both earbuds are broken! Not a fan!
1,Ordered a set and neither one could be used for a phone call. The microphones didn't work. They replaced them after I said something but neither replacement worked. The microphones were junk and all the other person could hear was loud static.
5,Fantastic.  The only headphones that fit in through the hole in my charging case.  Great sound!
2,First one broke after first use. Wires are not flexible all kinked up.
5,My cats love to chew my headphone wires.  These are my go-to cheap-o headphone replacements.
1,Both defective one headphone on both sets stopped working
2,Both worked great - for first week. Then the left ear went out on both.. so random
3,I doubt they will last long though...
3,Ear buds aren't shaped the way I like
1,Honestly the sound quality is terrible I mean you can heat sound but it doesn't sound that great these are not the actual samsung headphones the quality is not that good one pair broke within a week so wouldn't reccommend buying them because they won't last long at all just buy a cheaper good quality pair instead.
5,Excelente calidad en Sonido.
1,The 1st 2 came in hard plastic cases legit work great. Sec time I ordered a week later were plastic wrapped no case these are not like what your phone comes with fake. The real ones work with ps4  apple buds no longer work so these are great if you can find a place that sells the real oem ones.
1,This is 2nd set I've ordered. All 4 pairs have shorted out...one ear (usually right one) doesn't carry sound. (Yes I'm gentle on them and don't pull on the wires.)
2,Disappointed with this product. I have bought this multiple times and they dont last more than a couple of months. Everytime of the sides stops working.
1,Both pair lasted less than a week before I could only hear out of 1 speaker. Weak wiring.
5,I love these headphones
1,Looking to send back day one. I bought these before and they lost the Microsoft ability. Gave them a second change and the head phone are already breaking up.
1,Got these for my girl for while she drives. Cannot hear her echoes back when I talk. Sometimes dont work at all. Very frustrating because these are the style that came with her Samsung phone and the only one that ever fit her ear correctly!
1,Always breaking headphones as a mechanic so good to have backups once one of these goes I'll order another 2 and keep it goingUpdate: 1 set already broke! 3 days of use and left side earbuds don't work already.Update again: both broke both are worthless. Should of burned the money it would of lasted longer
2,When I got these earbuds one of the pairs had 2 right earbuds ??? I want a refund or a replacement pair.
2,I have only tried both  pair and it has a horrible static  in them when talking on them... They are good if Im just listening to music... unhappy with this purchase....
3,Not what I spected
1,Lasted only a month.  Have bought this two pack TWICE and every single pair has had at least one ear bud lose sound after minimal use. The covers slide off easily as soon as you pick out of your pocket or off the table. One of the sets I ordered were uneven as well.
2,It does its job but ladies destroys it fast
1,Two pairs and neither of them work. You have to wiggle the jack just so and MAYBE one ear will work? I love the headphones that came with my phone and wanted an extra to leave at work. These are not the same. The marking on them is different they don't work or sound nearly as good. Don't waste your money.
1,I take care of my stuff and these earbuds broke within weeks. The first pair within the first two weeks of wearing them indoors to watch tv on my computer and the second one after wearing it for about 3 weeks while I rode the train to places. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
5,Practicos
2,Both headphones' 'right ear bud' crapped out on me in less than 2 months. All i did was wear them and they just stopped working for no reason.
2,It worked for two months then people could not hear me or vice versa.  I'd rather pay more for a superior product.
3,They have already broken so No
1,No Lmfso this is a joke. These are a joke. Do not buy them please. I just plugged them in and they barely work😂
5,Good Product
5,Perfect
5,Had these for 4 months without a problem.
1,Purchased these less than two months ago and they are already not working I wish there was a way I could return them very poor quality
2,They worked great for about a month and one ear bud would just quit working. I purchased two of them and the same thing happend to my wifes.
5,This is an awesome deal love it GET IT!! It comes skill an extra rubber ear piece thing 😊
5,😍
1,They stop working after only using them a few times.
1,Lasted 1 month.
5,Perfect design of headphones they will never get off you perfect for running or sports activity.
5,Both worked no issues. Seem to be the same ones that came with my phone.
1,Both earphones came in broken in pieces. Wrapping was horrible and had dust all over it. Do not buy!!!
5,I got exactly what I ordered. The hardware seems to be authentic Samsung merch
1,These have been fine up until now.. I use to use them for monthsat a time just minimum use only in public places while I'm looking at social media. But they're not lasting as long now I even opened a new pair and can't hear through them.
1,Bought the two pack. Opened the first one and the left ear was annoyingly quieter than the right ear.Opened the second one used them for 3 days then the right ear stopped working. They might have given me refurbished ones even if I was expecting brand new ones.Needless to say forget this I'm better off going name brand.
5,Happy with this product
3,they work
5,These headphones are excellent and work properly. Great sound quality and remote functions properly. I'm glad i bought them.
2,One pair broke within 3 days glad it was a two pack. As if my sons college tuition wasn't expensive enough I have to buy more ear buds. Hopefully it was a one time thing.
3,BAD PROUDUCT:(
1,I thought I was going to like these but I don't at all. These are not noise cancelling ear buds and they are prone to fall out of my ears often. They don't come with other size ear gels.  The only thing I do like is the robust flat wire but that's about it.
1,After 3-4 uses the rt ear stopped working
1,Both earphones stopped working in under a month. The samsung headphones that came with my phone that seem identical to these lasted me over a year. These are a cheap knock off and it's hard to find good quality headphones in this style.
1,It's awful
2,i know its cheap and not original but this thing broke within two weeks. I bought 4 of these and there is only one of them working properly
1,Both pair stopped working within 3 weeksDont buy
2,Used only a few time and the left earbud doesn't work just like my last pair
1,Please do yourself a favor and do not buy these. They say Samsung but don't compare to the real ones. The cords are stiff the buttons have very little tactile feel and the sound quality is horrendous!
5,soune quality is amazing there was 2 that came in both perfectly fine.real samsung too good s*** good s***.
2,Haven't even had these for a full month and the left ear bud already stopped working. The sound also sounded slightly muffled when I first used them.
1,There’s an awful interference sound. Waste of money.
5,Great earbuds great price and got it really fast will buy again
5,Yes I enjoy very much when I go to walk and talking or music
5,Great sound and they also work great when using them with phone calls. I would definitely buy these again.
1,One set did not work and can't exchange for a new one so sending back.
2,The price was right.  But one of the ear pieces has already broken off.  Glad they came in a two pack.  Do Not Buy
3,Good quality and sound
1,VERY disappointed.  I ordered 2 dual pack earbuds.  All 4 are terrible.  I cannot use them for phone calls - horrible feedback/static.  After 1 or 2 uses  one bud stops working.
1,Very uncomfortable!!The silicone covers are not the right ones and don't fit.. these are 100% NON USABLE!!*** dont buy****** read reviews!!***
5,Not quite OEM match for my Tab 4 but close enough.  Especially for the price.
5,Stays in my ears and has great sound! That's all I ask for.
1,Bought these in the middle of November 2016 and both of them are broken already. The right ear bud connected to the mic won't work. I take good care of my stuff and was shocked that they both are useless already. They didn't even last 6 months. Waste of money...they're probably refurbished.
1,within three days of using it it stop working on the right side can I get new ones?  Samsung (2 PACK) OEM Wired 3.5mm White Headset with Microphone Volume Control and Call Answer End Button [EO-EG920BW] for Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ / S6 / S5 Galaxy Note 5 / 4 / Edge (Bulk Packaging)
5,Neither like nor dislike. Standard OEM headphones. That's what I wanted. That is exactly what I got.
2,The mic didn't work for either one of these
5,The value for the price is right. Good sound quality.
1,used 1 previously and bought a pair here but the mic does not work properly on either of the new ones
5,Original product from Samsung and for a price that can't be beat.
1,Fresh from the packaging brand new and both pairs of headphones had some sort of failure. One pair had large differences in volume between ears and the second pair only had one working ear bud.
5,Love the headphones with the mic. Will be ordering if I lose money again. Thank you!
1,I normally love these headphones but not this time. No one can hear me when I am on the phone with them. I can't answer my phone with them. The volume doesn't work on the headphones. Sad and disappointed. 🙁☹
3,avvarage
1,I bought these - didn't really care about the sound quality just wanted to be able to use the remote function. Sound is not good which is not a problem but the remote doesn't work with either pair. Not bad if all you want is a cheap throw away pair of earbuds otherwise by something else.
5,Super purchase
1,Both of these were broken on arrival. While  they appear to look like the original Samsung ear buds and even have the Samsung name the wires are MUCH thinner than the original. I had one set that would not play on one side and the other set was all static resulting in a useless purchase.
2,I've bought that before but this time I only got one set...even though the package says two pack.
5,Original headphones.  Two-pack is great!!
1,Not Samsung product. 3 of the earphones didnt work at all...and the other only worked in one ear.I tossed all of them but that's what I get for buying something like this
1,Didn't last long
1,Horrible waste of money! Static now sound quality. Ended up tossing in the trash.. Don't purchase!
2,These are garbage. Don't stay in ears and it sounds like they use 70s technology. How do headphones still sound horrible these days? Will not buy again.
5,These are the original headphones that came with my galaxy s6. They work great!
1,This was the second time i ordered these for me and my bf and they never last. The first 2 pairs lasted longer then this newer pair but both broke within a month of use and i keep them in a case when not being used. Will not be buying again
2,They did not last long.  One side of headphones in both headphones went dead! Not buying them again.
2,This is my second time buying these headphones and for some reason they don't sound like they used to when i bought them the first time.
5,Works perfect ....met my expectations ...doesnt fall out of my ears which the other brands does.
1,I have not contacted the seller but would like to request a refund or replacement of this item. I can hear music and phone calls fine but the microphone on both of these that I received are not working and callers cannot hear me when they are plugged in.
1,I ordered these in hopes that it would be as good as the original headphones that came with the phone but for some reason when I use them in my phone it sounds like  a motorcycle engine is in the headphones. It is inconvenient when I listen to music or when I'm on the phone.
5,This item meets my requirements and got them on time as described. Thanks
2,Crackly sound mic hardly works. Spend your money elsewhere.
2,Fast shipping and they work but.....sound quality is horrible. Everything sounds like its in mono and if your ear buds were underwater. Would not recommend or purchase again.
2,It was delivered today and both the headphones suck u gotta twist it around to hear it properly would not recommend
1,Both pair of these no longer work and i haven't even had them for 6 months! Don't waste your money!
2,Earphone sound quality was so bad. It sounds so muffled compared to the originals that just broke on me. Low quality fakes. They even have plastic molding flaws.
1,This order comes with 2 headphones. Only one set works properly. The other set one of the earbuds has no sound coming out.
2,One of the earbuds worked the day I got it the next day the earbuds doesn't work I am already on the second pair that I hope would last longer
5,perfect - they came as two pairs of oem headsets. love them.
2,The second pair didn't work at all and I also noticed there wasn't any wiring in the cord. You could stretch it like a rubberband.
2,One of the headphones works great! One of the headphones the earbuds work but the speaker that you talk into does not work.
1,The right headphone of one of the earbuds had very low sound and could barely hear through it compared to the left one. These earbuds are nothing like the real Samsung headphones you get with the phone.
2,very disappointed in the quality of these earbuds. the microphone doesn't work and the audio is very weak on my Samsung 6 Edge
5,Second set order. 1 of the first set I ordered did not work at all!
5,Just like the ones that come with your new cell phone
3,Decent product
2,They sound great and comfortable but within a month both now have only one working earbud on each. Great quality but not durable.
2,Kept oen and gave the other to my son and noticed the reinforced connection link to earpiece bud was causing static when touched.
3,Good value
5,Great packaging great quality great pricing. There are zero flaws to this product!
1,One of the two pairs sent did not work
1,Right side doesn't work at all.  Barely heard my friend on a call as the quality was also bad.
1,ive ordered this before and it was great this model the earpieces are way too small they fall out constantly for me and my wife...waste of money
1,Feels very cheap
1,It is almost two months and one headset stop working I can only hear sound in one ear plugs
2,Controls do not work with iphone 6. No pause/play or volume. Stopped working after 6 days. Second pair is on day 8 but still very poor quality.
5,Yes but one earphone was longer than the other one side didnt work
2,One of the headphones had went out.  One of them the caller can't hear me talk.
5,They were just fine.
2,These were great at first. After about a month of so the left speaker went out on one pair and the other set quit working.
1,These headphones are awful!!! I purchased these for my son two weeks and both are already broken.  After the first week the first headphone the wires are exposed where the two earpieces connect.  The second one broke a week later.  The earbud came off of the wire completely.  Such garbage!!
1,I am indeed a buyer and I suggest NOT buying these. I ordered two be cause of the price and tthe arrived only one pair actually workded and exactly 43 days later the right ear bud went out. Complete trash if you ask me and money wasted. Will not buy again.
2,Bass doesnt kick and theres a scratchy sound. The bersion before this or 2 versions before were a lot better and super loud
1,Both pairs of headphones stopped working in the right earbud within a few weeks. They delivered on May 11th and today is June 12th so it was stated on AZ's website that I cannot return them since 30 days have past---just barely. The return policy needs to be amended since this product is flawed.
1,It only worked for a week before quitting. The charger port continued to work but it doesn’t recognize the the headphones when they are plugged in.
5,We received the headphones in our mail box on the day promised. They work great.
5,Great sound
2,The microphone is sub stAndard
1,2 week after that not working
5,Works just like the ones that came with the phones that they lost or broke
2,Left ear stopped working after 2 weeks
5,Thank you shipment was received and item was as listed.
5,These are the only earbuds we use!
2,One of the headphones was built with two left ear pieces. As a result one of the earbuds doesn't quite fit into my ear.
1,This product never got deliver at my house and in the tracking  link it says that arrived and that the adress I put it was wrong .. but not at all I recheck  the destination  and it was right .. they charged me  for something I never received. ...
1,item came and was not wrking i got a return label the same day returned the same day and new item came next day came fast on replacement.but replacement were jus as bad as the originals they send me i will be returning them again for a refund.dknt buy these they don't work
1,I did not like this item because of bad quality. As soon as I started to use them they malfunction on me. They were dialing numbers I wasn't asking it to dial during listening to music it will bring up my search engine without me touching any buttons highly annoying and very disappointed
5,Very satisfied. True OEM parts at a great price.
1,I was happy with the price for these but on one set one ear doesn't work at all. The other has a short somewhere and changes settings and volume without any reason.I should have returned them earlier but felt like others should know.
1,I dont recommend this at all.  Received two pair.  One pair only one of the ear buds functioned the other ear bud was dead.  The second pair very poor sound quality muffled sound when hearing people speaking to me.  Pass on this item and look for a different set.
1,I am glad for the prices but sad for the quality. They don't work that well I used them for 1 hour and now one ear has a scratching sound same with the other pair and that was from the beginning these don't seem like new headphones but rather used.
5,Mi teléfono
1,These come in packs of two earbuds.I bought two sets so 4 pairs of earbuds. Out of box first set did not work at all. Second set the volume control did not work. Third set finally a set that works. Fourth setyou guessed itonly one of the earbuds works. Total waste of money.
2,Had them for about 8 days one pair didn't even work. The other pair the left earbud is quieter than the right one.
5,Good quality... Don't know why Sony decided to stop making their similar but superior ear buds
2,One of the earpods didn't work and sound quality is low for one set. The other set works fine although the sound is subpar
1,These headphones were super s***ty. Very bad quality and either I couldn't hear the person or they couldn't hear me. Plus with one of the headphones only the right ear worked and not the left ear. Why does it feel different than Samsung headphones are supposed to feel? What a rip off
2,Sound quality is only okay and both headphones broke within 3 months of purchase. I won't buy these again.
2,when i received the headphones there was a buzzing noise on the left ear plug. it sounded distorted and wasn't a pleasant experience
2,The sound on both sides are not even. One is louder than the other. I must've gotten a defective one.
5,Wirth the buy. Works perfectly with my xbox one controller. Hehe
2,The quality of the headphones is not so great. I dropped them once and they stopped working in one side
2,These are some great headphone but they had problems with it and it didn't even last a month for me.
1,I wanted these to use as a mic on the xbox because I had a pair before but no one can hear me when I try to speak so they suck
5,Great product. As shown and showed up on time. Thank you!
5,They work great.
1,I have tried 3 different pairs of these headphones. The work great for about a month (maybe 2 if you're lucky) and then one of the ear buds will stop working. This has happened with EVERY pair. Don't waste your money this trash.
1,The description for the Samsung headphones says "(2 Pack)" but only one was sent. This is real misleading
2,Sound is great in only both headphones worked. Opened up the package and there was no sound in the right headphone
2,Got them day 1 and the right earbud is muffled. Obviously a knock-off thanks for the crap earbuds.
1,No my needs weren't met!! This is the second time I've given you guys a chance and it hasn't even been a week and already the right headphone blew out AGAIN! It's always the right ear that goes out !! Waste of time & money !!! I'm not satisfied at all
1,These earphones are TRASH! I’m highly irritated right now😑 I could have spend my $10 at five below and got earphones that’s 10x better🙄 never will I ever purchase again👎🏽
5,Great  you got two for the price of one. And they work great.
1,The left ear bud didn't work at all.
1,Don't waste your money. These aren't genuine Samsung earbuds. Cheaply made. One pair has already stopped working.
1,Didn't work.
2,one of the headsets didn't have a functioning microphone this is a 1 day review hopefully the pair that works will continue working well.
1,They are not real the sound like crap. I wanted to get a couple extra pairs and compared to my real ones they sound like crap. Please give me a refund!
5,Very pleased with them and they came with the Bat man Shirt.
2,The quality isn't as good as I thought. Wish it was better and the rubber ear pieces keep falling off. Not too great
5,Love how you get 2 in one pack. They work like a charm. :)
2,The first pair stopped working after a couple of days. The second pair is working OK for now.
1,These headphones are literally garbage with a capital G. It stops working after a week sometimes 2 weeks and stops working. This is a total rip off. Don't waste your money. It isn't authentic Samsung product. Buyer be ware
2,I just opened my headphones and only one of headphone works on one of the pairs.
5,These headphones are really good for such a low price I'm very pleased with them.
5,Good
1,The headset on the right side does work bet the left side didn't work.  Giving it a poor review since I've bought them a number of times but the didn't work.
1,The sound quality was bad did not sound like the pair that comes with phone. Bad wires as well moving the wires around causes static. Buyer beware
5,These headphones work great and don't hurt my ears while wearing them.
2,This is my second time buying these and within less than two weeks a pair of earphones stopped working.
5,Very happy with the product.  Thank you
2,The ear bud doesn't  fit my ear.
1,Have had these replaced once already and the replacements were received in the same condition. Both times the headers came in looking official with SN# but non functional. Believe these to be either really decent clones or the defective products off the line. Do not waste time on them.
5,Same headphones that came with my Samsung Edge 6. Good Quality....will order again
5,The Samsung head phones were good quality and a excellent price
5,Great!
5,excellent as displayed
2,Pulled out too hard sadly they broke and turned into the new apple airpods. Better off buying those instead.
1,These are definitely not OEM samsung ear buds. They are fake. Wish I would have checked the reviews before I got them. Absolutely garbage. Do not buy!
1,Literally the worst headphones I've ever purchased in my life. Comes in a pack of two the first set broke within the first week. Started using the second set and the volume button is now stuck so the volume constantly goes up and down while I'm listening to music.
1,Thise earphones are litterly garbage! Dont buy them! Both of them are stopped working after a few days! You cannot hear anything on one side. When i try to talk to someone on the phone nobody can hear me! I'm very disappointed with this product
5,Thanks alot came fast...perfect for me
1,FIRST PAIR WHEN I RECEIVED THE HEARPHONES WORKED GREAT IF I WAS LISTENING TO MISIC BUT IF I WAS TALKING ON THE PHONE OTHER PERSON COULDN'T HEAR ME. Second pair worked great for a week then same thing happened. When you talking on phone other person couldn't hear you.
5,I like these earbuds because they are sleek and provide good sound.
2,the sound quality is staticky for the caller.  They can not hear me clearly because of static
5,✅
5,They really give a great sound. I have no problems with them.
1,These earphones are awful 2nd time I bought them and there is always a problem with them. Whether 1 ear stops working or one of the  earbud wire comes out of the volume control component. I believe that they are a knock off product.
2,Sound quality is not the same as the original earphones that came with my phone
2,Poor quality use it the third day and it broke of one side.
5,Fantastic replacement for my Samsung headphones. It was exactly what I was looking for.
2,After a month the right one quit wrking the microphone is always hit and miss and the ear guards constantly fall off..
5,Shipping was fast very happy with this product.  Would buy again.
5,Products arrived faster then expected and they are very comfortable earphones.  Thank you
2,Ugh don't buy them. One stopped working after 3 days!!! And the other after 2 weeks!! Complete disappointment.
5,This is my second time buyung these and i really love them !!!
5,Earbuds are great! I have really liked this version of Samsung buds.
5,I've been buying my headphones from thia company for a while now. Never been disappointed!
1,I bought these earbuds two times and for all 4 of them the right-side earplug breaks after a month of use. If that had happened only once it would be acceptable but not with all the products I bought. Don't waste your money on it.
1,I bought this item based on  the pic with the angled ear buds shape I received the regular ear buds shaped earphoneI don't even know if I received wrong item or they are deceiving customers
5,Exactly what I expected. Loud and snug fit .
5,Love these especially for the reasonable price
1,Used these two for a week. One had an intermittent right ear connection. The other failed completely. Poor quality
5,These are every bit as good as my iPhone earbuds and a great price.
5,Only headphones  I buy in this price  range!
5,Nice delivery and  good staff
2,One out of four I bought did not work
5,There actually Samsung!! I was surprised for the money! Two pairs for ten bucks!
5,Best value for your money good bass stays in ear relatively durable.
1,I've had my headphones for about a week and a half and the right ear has already blown out. I would like to know if something can be done because i barely used them and for an ear to have gone out already is ridiculous.
5,Love em the official one's that come with the galaxy s7
5,Great product it look sound and feel like the original ones
2,Volume buttons don't work! The right headphone is louder than the left and the bass is terrible.
2,I like how they feel and fit in my ear but they don't Las for long.
1,Audio quality is abysmal. I have 2 pairs of Samsung earbuds that are a different older style and (for the price) they are great. Not these. These have terrible mids. They sound bad enough that I'd expect them to be free.
2,After a month of only moderate use one of these failed and no longer works
5,Very comfortable fit. Good sound quality.
2,I received the ear buds one was "broken" when they arrived. The second pair looked good but do not work correctly.
2,One set worked. The other set only one ear piece and tht one fell apart on the first day.
2,They don't handle any controls on my S6 people complain they hear an echo just all bad.
1,In both pairs the right ear bud has gone out.  Worked great for a month but that was it.  I would not buy or recommend.  There are better products out there that will lost longer and for a better price.
5,They are exactly like my originals that came with my phone
2,They worked fine for about 4 weeks then one stopped working
5,Same quality as those sold in stores.
1,Poor quality not original. Static. Requested refund.
1,The 1st pair that I used once I opened the package works great! The 2nd pair is horrible. Makes crackling noise when plugged in and mutes my calls. I am totally disappointed and unfortunately I didn't use the 2nd one until after the return deadline.
2,this items does not have the same sound as the original. Good for the price.
5,Definitely OEM my favorite headset out there! Really comfortable to wear!
5,They sound great!
1,These Samsung headphones arrive with only one earpiece working.  This is the second set of these I have purchased and both shipments had the same defect.  Sorry to say I will not be purchasing these again even though they fit my ears perfectly.
2,One of the set worked great.  The other one was not fully functional; the pause and play button didn't work.
2,One just had terrible quality the other was fine but street like a month the sound stopped working
2,One of my earbuds broke within a week of hashing them. Other than that they're perfect.
1,I bought these a few weeks ago and neither pair worked right out of the box. The wiring was coming out of one of the ear buds and neither of them played through both ears. Ended up throwing them away - I wouldn't buy these again.
2,didn`t work for nexus 5x but the earphones work well on other devices.
5,They are good quality. Idk what else to say
5,The headphones work great. Glad they came with the extra covers for the earbuds
5,Works as expected and came with extra ear piece covers.
5,Just like the headphones you get with original purchase of the phone.
1,That didn't last long and one of my headphones came with one of the ear plugs not working. I really hope they improve this but I will not be ordering from this company again.You will taking a chance on your earphones working are not.Thank you and have a good day.
2,Unfortunately one pair was detective; one of the ear buds doesn't work... disappointing.
2,No it's oem because i buy a pack and one headphone listen bsd.
2,My shipment was pretty fast! Although once I used my ear buds only the right side worked!
1,Don't buy it lI bought them after reading some of the bad reviews that they broke or didn't work and regret not taking the warning. For one pair the mic didn't work and the other pair broke within 24 Hours being out of the box.
1,I've in total ordered atleast 4 pair of these headphones. ALL BROKEN WITHIN 3 MONTHS TOPS!! I stopped wrapping them up stopped playing the volume at 100% and they still fizzle out. Very very disappointed.. save the hassle and purchase a pair that'll last.
1,1 pair stopped working out of 1 of the earbuds after 1 week. The other pair stopped working completely. I don't think this is OEM. I have my original earbuds that came with my phone and they've lasted over 1yr....less than 2 weeks for these
5,They work as well as the ones that came with the phone.
5,Son says they work great for his Samsung phone.
1,If it barely get snagged while they're in your ears you'll just lose all sound. And by barely I mean wont  even rip them out of your ears. Went through four pairs in two weeks
2,Don't stay in my ears and the control buttons are on high up.
5,Great fit
1,These aren't very good. Its turning down my music without me even pressing anything. The buttons that control the volume dont work instead they bring up random menues.
2,Headsets broke very easily
2,One pair were broke and one side didn't work please address this problem
1,They aren't like my original that came with my Galaxy S7. The mic and the buttons (volume and other button) do not work. The sound is not anything close to quality and have to be manipulated to work properly. Not a good bargain. Disappointed.
1,The sound quality is pretty poor. I expected more from these. Compared to apple headphones (I'm not a fanboy I'm being objective) these are very muffled sounding and I won't be using them. I should have assumed as much from the price. Oh well.
1,Just over 40 days & one of this stopped working. Total waste of money.
1,This is my second order in a month and the sound is horrible. All my callers can hear is static.
1,Quality sucked. They were damaged since I opened it. You couldn't even hear sound through one of the earbuds and the other headphone wire was just so messed up that you had to move the cable around to let the sound come in clear.
5,Some headphones are squiky but this one is definitely not
1,Everyone I speak with using these complaints that there's a knocking sound that overpowers my voice. I wont return them because it's too big of a hassle
2,Broke a week I got it
1,I bought this item 4 days ago. Took one of the pairs out to use it for the first time today and one of the earphones stopped working after about an hour. Also the sound quality is horrible.
5,Works just like the original headphones
2,kind crappy. not very loud. short in both pairs.
5,This are good earphones I recommend them for y'all.
5,Just like original. I bought after my son dropped his headset somewhere.
1,Do not ever purchase these ever! Horrible yes they are knock offs. My first pair worked fine. The second is horrible. The Mic is broken internally causing static to come through the ear buds. Don't waste your money. The reviews are true.
1,These dam things was defected when I bought it. One of the set was static in 1 ear but the other 1 worked. Smh waiting for them to break and not work at all soon since they all have so far.
5,love them
1,One headphone broke in a day. The other stopped working in two weeks. I don't use the headphones a lot just in my office so it's not user error. I believe i received defective headphones. No wonder they were two for one.
1,Do not work! Cannot make phone calls where people can hear you over tremendous scratching sounds. When playing music the volume controls goes haywire and turns down media volume without any touch. Cannot use button to pause or track forward your musis apps.
1,It says 2 pack but I only received one pair of ear buds and only the right ear bud worked. I tried to use the earbuds with a Galaxy S7 Galaxy Note 3 and an iPhone 6s and only the right one worked.
1,The microphone barely worked on either pair. I literally had to scream in them for others to hear me. They were only good for listening to music.
5,Great headset for that cheap price. Very comfortable for daily use.
2,I buy these one week earlier and they come with case these not with case
5,Great product!  Great service!
5,Works perfectly. Great price.
1,I I bought 4 of these for my sisters  2 of them did not work  one hears only one side and the other works well .. I want my money back. (I put a star because i cant put no one
2,One headset was perfectly fine. The other has two headphones for the right ear.
2,This is false advertisement. The two headsets came without a mic and do not have a volume control
1,Both of them have stopped working. One pair never worked at all (right headphone would not play sound). Now a couple months later my other set of headphones have also stopped working (this time the left earbud will not play sound).
1,Worked great until they didn't. One day they just stopped working about 1 month after I started using them. Started using the 2nd pair and one of of the headphones is dead again so within 3 months both have broken.
5,Son was pleased to get these he finds them better than the other brand
1,Lots of popping with these headphones not sure if these are knock offs factory seconds or just improperly stored and shipped. Did not last long at all.
5,Five Stars
2,They worked well but after 2 weeks the same ear on both stopped working
2,If you're an audiophile/engineer/serious about audio .. Don't waste your money.
1,El producto me salió malo no se escucha y tiene un ruido insoportable
5,Replaced the set that came with my phone.
2,Did not last as long as I thought it would
2,The ear pieces are huge and hurt. Not comfortable whatsoever.
2,Product broke after 3 week. The microphone doesn't work during phone calls.
1,I've had these two headphones for two weeks and both pair are defective. The mic is broke on one pair and the left headset is broke on the other. I've ordered two pair before that worked great and this pair is bad.
5,Very good quality. Exactly like the ones that came with my phone originally
2,Both pairs broke in 2 weeks. DON'T BUY.
2,Probably fake breaks easily.
5,Perfect
1,These headphones did not work at all. With the initial use several callers said that there was a loud helicopter noise and some said that they couldn't hear me at all. There were 2 in the pack and neither one worked properly.
5,Exactly what I wanted
2,Came fast but after a week they stopped playing out the right ear
2,One set of earbuds did not work (buzzing on left side).
5,Works Great! I love that there are extra silicone bud covers
1,The one pair I used died after 2 days of use.... I havent bothered with the other pair... I ended up buying another pair from Walgreens and they still work and its been almost a month since I bought the Walgreens pair....
1,I have had the same problem again with buying these two pack of Samsung headsets. One earbud stopped working on Both headsets after small use. I just expected better quality from Samsung. I will not be buying anymore Samsung headphones.
5,Great deal! Fits in my ears well too!
5,Great deal for two pairs of good headphones
2,They're not as good as the pair that came with my Galaxy S7 edge
2,One side ear piece stop playing on the forth day
1,These came in a set of 2 and one they can't hear you and the other you can't hear them
2,I used it but it doesn't work for the right.
1,I should have read the review before buying these. As I feared they're fake.
2,They both broke within a month.
2,Just got them and one pair already has short. They great without a short.
5,I got what I wanted thank you for your service!!
5,works perfectly. very happy with these
1,Do not purchase these headphones. Although the price may be tempting the volume of the headphones are extremely low even when there isn't much background noise. You are better off spending the extra money to a more quality pair of headphones.
5,The products were in great conditon and worked perfectly.
5,They sound GREAT! I wish I could give each this ten stars. :-)
1,Piece of junk!The earpiece separated from the wires as I put it into my ear. This was a (2 pack) of headphones so I started to use the second pair which lasted for about a month.
1,Very poor quality sounds. Not the real Samsung headphones!
1,Both Broke within 1.5 monthsBad products dont buy!!
1,They are the most horrible ear phones I have ever experienced.  Was so happy to be able to get a pair for my husband and myself  huge huge mistake  I would pay them to take them back!
5,Came with all the parts I expected and they have worked well.
1,No funciona la opción de micrófono y en un solo día dejé de escuchar música no merece la pena gastar el dinero en esos auriculares
1,These have been absolutely awful. It started with the microphone not working at all and then sound only comes through one eat piece of I'm lucky to get any sound at all. Extremely disappointed with this product!
5,Arrived sooner than the initial date given. I'm pleased!
5,Just as I expected. They sound very good.
1,After 2 months the 2 earphone stoprunning now need to buy again
5,Got what was in the description. Good low price.
5,Not bad for the price
2,On both earphones the left side didn't work. I want my money back
2,Worked well until they stopped working after about 3 weeks.
5,The worked great and I got a backup pair
2,The right earbud stopped working on both sets.
5,Love them works well with my note
2,These sound nothing like the original Samsung headphones . Waste of money  smh
5,Earphones for Samsung works - works well for calls.
2,It stopped working after 3 months
1,these are "NOT" OEM Samsung headphones... sound quality isn't stereo .. they are horrible.  They don't fit in the ear properly and actually hurt when you try to put them in.  I wouldn't ever buy these again.
1,Both headphones didn't work well. One worked for a couple days and the other the microphone didn't work at all. The headphones were clearly used and not documented that they were had to clean the dirt off of them..
1,I only had these headphones for not even 24 hours and the right one stopped working! I then use the second pair and a few hours later the same issue happened! I'm extremely disappointed especially from a Samsung lover
1,don't buy these!! They're cheap for a reason. I bought them 8 months ago and both pairs are now broken. One earbud stopped working then both. Pieces of crap taking up space in landfills!!
5,Good price and feels much better in your ears.
1,Sound quality is just bad. I first thought it was just the one pair I opened but I tried both and they both sound bad. I should of just payed the extra money for a good pair of earplugs.
5,It met my expectations.  The sound is really good.
5,Excellent for the price and you get 2!
1,I thought these were actually Samsung headphones as they say so on the ear bud however these are just knock-offs.The sound quality is very poor.They did however come in a nice case to carry earbuds in.
2,Left headphone broke in a week in a half
2,one earbud stopped working on both in 2 weeks.
1,I've bought these earphones before and was more than satisfied so I was sad when I had them stolen. These ones thay I purchased recently are NOT AT ALL of the same quality. They're terrible. Save your money.
2,One was good the other didn't work
2,One pair of headphones sounded like the speaker was blown on arrival
5,These are the best replacement earphones for your Samsung galaxy
1,Would have given them 0 if it was an option 2nd time i bought these headphones and they both broke within 3 days of using both pairs. DD NOT BUY THESE UNLESS YOU LIKE BROKEN HEADPHONES MADE TERRIBLY
5,I love these headphones so much. They sound great.
1,These are rip offs. They are not the same as the ones I got originally with my note 5. The sound is horrible and there is a buzzing in both sets in the left ear. Do not buy.
1,I came in a pack of 2 and one of the pair of head phones didn't even work and the second one worked but the sound quality was worse then the s3 headphone not happy. Don't buy these
5,Great price good quality for the $
1,Worst quality headphones I ever got from you guys. Would like a refund
5,Love these...stays in and has good sound quality
5,We order these all the time and they work great
2,Low sound and one pair broke immediately after purchase
2,They did not include the larger set of earbuds. Very disappointed.
5,The earbuds are comfortable and i bought at a great price.
1,I Was Excited To Get My Headphones But Wen I Opened The Package It Wasn't It. To Top It Off?!?!? Both Of Them Wasn't Working 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑. Waste Of Money
5,Great price. Arrived quickly
5,Works as stated and a great price
1,1 pair had faulty wiring so didn't work
5,Amazing thank you.
1,I ordered 3 pair. None of them worked for more than a week.
2,The controls on the earphones do not work.
1,Huge rip off!  I bought these for my husband to have spare pairs. The speaker for sound (phone calls) and the volume/song toggle button didn't work AT ALL. Buyer beware. You get what you pay for...
1,To much statistics
1,These are knock offs. Just opened the package and tested both sets. Only one of them fully functions. The other is dead on arrival in the right ear bud. Poor sound quality compared to the actual product.
2,The sound quality isn't as good as the original Samsung earbuds
2,Both mics on each head phones had an echo
5,I love them  they don't hurt my ears.
5,So disappointed comma one hair
5,The sound is great from these! Thanks!
1,Was very excited to get these at such a great price but once I got them the mic didn't work.  The earbuds have good sound but without the mic I can't make phone calls with them.
5,perfect sound
2,The sound is not as good It has no Buffer
1,These are fake. All three buttons lower the volume... The Samsung logo is faded and the sound quality is garbage. The only reason I kept them was because I lost the gummy part on my real ones.
5,Great quality voice and hearing clarity.
5,Good quality! Sound is great and year lining very soft..
5,It's great works well and affordable! Thanks!
5,fits great works great comfortable fit :)
1,Sound quality is awful don't buy these headphones
5,Awesome ear buds. Great quality and great price.
2,Volume buttons didn't work.  Play/Stop button shorted a lot.
2,Product is not good
1,These are knockoff headphones with the sound of a pair of headphones from Dollar tree. Don't waste your money.
5,Original Samsung earphones with a great price!
2,The sound one has static on the right earbud
5,Really happy with my order
1,BOTH PAIRS defective.  I didn't open until I needed them because they were my backups.  Out of the package one didn't work at all and the 2nd pair has a bad short in it.
1,Garbage! I bought 4 of these.  One didnt work right out of the package  and the rest died in less then a few weeks each. Wow I cant believe how bad these are manufactured.
1,Very poor mic quality (person on other end said sound was gargled). Ear buds had ok quality. Don't buy.
1,THESE ARE NOT MADE BY SAMSUNG. THEY ARE CHEAP KNOCK OFFS. Upon arrival I opened them and right out of the plastic the right side didn't work on either pair. Don't waste your money.  Horrible.
1,they don't work good when am making a call the receiver gets a lot of noise from my back ground also it adds and turn down the volume on its own I just regret getting them
1,The first pair broke in my purse second day I used them and the second pair I just took out the pack only the left bud work.ionly gave1 star because I couldn't give half a star.
1,Todavía sigo esperando que lleguen jamás llegaron ni me devolvieron el dinero
1,Not sure how these are OEM.....the speaker is horrible to use headphones work fine. *Update---headphone stink too. Keep having to twist to make sure connection is good. GARBAGE
1,Came in a set of two.  Two weeks into using one set the right ear bud stopped working.  Moved on the second pair and the microphone doesn't work on that one.  Very disappointed.
5,Loved
5,Quick delivery no problems with the product.
1,False advertising. I only received one pair the title says (2 PACK). Not worth it. After a week one speaker broke. After 2 weeks microphone broke as well. Piece of crap.
5,What I was expecting love the headphones fast shipping
2,One of the earbuds did not work
2,After a week they stopped working
1,Did not work with my Mac book
5,Great fit in the ear and great sound too!
2,they break easy
1,Pretty well made knock offs beware buyers these are not OEM samsung earbuds the sound quality it's ok but nothing compared to the original earbuds DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.
5,Perfectly paired to my phone and music.
1,One set the right speaker didn't work at all and the second set didn't work either.
5,Works Extremely Well...Good Base And Endurance
2,Only one pair of headphones worked
5,great samsung headset just like the original ones i had
1,These are terrible. I thought they would be exactly like the original​ headphones that came with my phone. These sounded terrible. One of them you had to twist in order for the sound to work.
5,So far so good for inexpensive headphones!
1,Bought this two-pack to replace the original earbuds that came with my Galaxy S6. The first lasted a week before the buttons started malfunctioning; the second lasted a couple of days before the same thing.
5,Only gave 5 stars so you would see these DON'T WORK
5,These headphones are great. The microphone is really nice for calls.
5,love them light and fit well
5,Very pleased my my purchase it was exactly as described
5,works great
5,Very good quality and excellent seller
5,Work nicely and fit comfortably
1,I cant even hear out of them
1,These headphones were quite disappointing. The sound quality is spotty and the button controls don't actually function to change the volume or to initiate/end calls on the iPhone. Overall did not work as advertised.
2,One did not work very well
5,quick delivery and great product
1,These earphones lasted less than a week  Don't waste you time or money!!
5,Very good especially considering how reasonable the price is.
1,Fast shipping and actually work but sound quality is very very bad. No bass and too much midrange. I don't think these are ones that come with the galaxy phones. I would not recommend these to anybody unless you don't care about sound quality
5,Everything was great. Will continue doing business in the future.
1,They both broke within two weeks of purchase (and very light use). I also bought a real pair from the T-Mobile store and compared the sound and the sound on these is clearly worse.
5,Stays in my ear while i jog quality sound
1,Out of package garbage. Phone call quality was unusable and for music all you hear is static. F-.They look and feel exactly like the ones i got with my phone but are garbage.
1,How is it that I just received these headphones yesterday and already one of them is damaged. The left ear piece on one of the headphones already broke! What kind of quality is this?
2,Highly uncomfortable ear buds.
5,Excellent
1,These headphones are terrible!!! They don't last past a week order two both headphones did the same thing. Never again these couldn't be actual Samsung headphones.  I've better results with  $5.00 headphones.
1,One side which is the left side that is working on both headsets I'm extremely disappointed because I thought these are the real Samsung headsets but guess I was wrong completely waste of money.
1,These are not OEM quality - one earbud is louder than the other and its not even close to the same level of sound quality. Not worth the money pretty unbearable to listen to.
1,These are knock offs.  Sound quality is poor. Original Samsung headphones are made in Vietnam and not China (marking is on the white pad where the headphones split from 1 wire to 2).
1,Bought these to replace a lost pair but they sound terrible. These are NOT Samsung quality false advertizing
5,Very happy with my earphones and at a great price to.
5,Real Samsung headphones that does the job well
5,Very nice sound and fit comfortably
1,It's good for about a week then boom one side goes out and 10 bucks go down the drain... recommend getting multiple pairs at once if you are buying this.
2,Disappointed with the quality on both earbuds
5,Great for the money
2,Useless doesn't even last long.
5,Pretty good price and decent shipping time.
2,Cheap and horrible sound quality
1,Sound quality is very poor and the ear buds are a strange shape that won't stay in your ear.Junk.I couldn't use them but had already opened them so couldn't return them.
1,AWFUL product. Don't buy it. Sick of these headphones breaking after a few months of normal non negligent use. No reason at all one of the headphones stopped working. Garbage product DONT buy.
1,very bad qualityi have the original that came with my Samsung galaxy s6 edge +and there is huge differencethis headphones doesn't have bass and the sound is very low quality
1,Worked fine for a few days. Now a lot of static. Most people cannot here me because of the static. Wanted them for driving and can really only use to listen to music.
1,As soon as I took them out the package I out them in my phone and one ear did not work and they're low as well...bad product will never waste my money again!!
1,Terrible headset only lasted a week. Using a Samsung Galaxy note 4 the headset turns the volume up and down on its own and also with apps that uses voice commands acticates it.
1,The headset quality is aweful. When speaking with someone it appears as if im muffled and the quality is just poor on both. When i swap to my original headset its crystal clear.
5,bought 4 pairs to have in every room
2,Sound quality is not the same
1,I just recently opened the headphones and both pair are VERY static prone. I am outside of my return window. I am very displeased with the items I purchased. A waste of money!
5,Great quality for a great price!
5,Great product with excellent sound quality and a great price.
5,Very happy with these headsets
2,These headphones break within two months  the left earbud stopped working
5,Works great sound is great
1,Music goes in and out headphones don’t sound good at all for two pair
5,Best purchase. Great sound and fit.
2,Eh
5,always great
5,Excellent product! A+
1,When they arrived one of the headsets was already broken with no sound coming out. The other headset died 6 months later. Not good quality.
5,I love the comfort and the sound is great.
1,These headphones seem like a great purchase right? Both of mine broke within one week I can’t get a return and I’m extremely frustrated
1,Broke apart agter about 3 uses
5,These work very well for me. Awesome sound.
1,Drastic difference in sound quality. When I got these one of the two broke within 2 days. Do not buy these i repeat DO NOT BUY THESE. Waste of money.
2,Shorts were in both cords.
1,These were not good quality headphones. The cord tore on them within a week so they no longer useable or working. I would never get them again.
1,When I ordered the earbuds. I expected them to be just like the ones I received with the Samsung galaxy note 3. But the were a different type. They irritate my ears.
1,First pair lasted a couple weeks before one earbud stopped working. Just pulled out the never used second pair and again the same problem. Sound l ly comes out of one bud.
5,Very comfortable. Blocks noise pretty well
1,Only one came in the pack the earbuds look like someone took to them with a lighter. They work sort of buy why should I have to walk around with these things?
1,I couldn't wait to get these ear buds!! Only to be disappointed that the microphone does not work!!!! If you plan on using these as a means of seamless communication don't bother!!
1,One of the ear buds already lost functionality and has no sound! This is the first day i am using the product and I have already experienced a malfunction. So  disappointed.
1,Both sets had a bad connection from day one that requires jiggling the jack just right to get the left bud to play sound.  Confirmed this behavior on two different devices.
5,Very happy with the product and works great.
5,great just wat i was looking for
5,Great value comfortable nice looking and great sound
5,As advertised
5,It works as expected and teh price is great!
1,Terrible don't buy these. They completely fell apart after less than a month.
1,The music sounds horrible coming out of the headphones.  There were 2 sets of headphones in the package one set had the ear bud hanging off and the wires hanging out.
5,They're the same headphones that come with the phone
5,It was exactly what i wanted and they work great.
1,This is some cheap chinese headphones. I regret purchasing this item. Do not! I repeat. DO NOTTTTTTTTT buy this!!!
2,breaks easily
1,Product did not work after the first day of use. BOTH headphones stopped working the second day. Highly disappointed with a supposed pair of "new" headphones.
1,Within a week both sets stop working. I believe these are not Samsung OEM devices.
1,I took good care of the earbuds but they broke after 2 weeks...Another problem that Ibhad with these earbuds was that the left earbud cord was signifcantly longer than the other.
5,Great product just as described!
2,They both had shorts!
1,Definitely would not recommend because left earbud quit working within 2 days. 2 days!. You can buy a better pair for the same price and get a better quality after this.
1,Terrible...Im very disappointed ..Only 1 ear bud works..only the left side...this came wit 2 headphones..So this left ear only worked..& da other pair only the right side worked! TERRIBLE ..NEVA AGAIN
1,Seems to be this is not Samsung product. Both the head phone has defect as volumn control not working. +/- both direction volumn reduced only. Very disappointing to order this product.
1,After one month of use one earbud stopped working. The second pair came with a shortage. I was very disappointed but for the price I guess I should have expected it.
1,I liked my Samsung ear buds and these have nothing in common with the original ones. Very disappointed.
1,Came with 2 sets of headphones. Must be a cheap knockoff. I set i used once then 1 side stopped working. The other lasted a while but sound quality was bad.
1,Sound quality terrible.  3 of the 4 pairs I ordered had only 1 ear working out of the package.  When making calls people complained of feedback.  Never again.
5,Thank you! Great deal and exactly what I was looking for!
1,Both my headphones were no good I figured it would be just one but both?! I got them Friday and it's Tuesday I have no headphones and I'm out 10 dollars.
2,Cheaply done
5,Got them quickly and they work great!
5,Packaged well. good product.
5,perfect for me!!
5,Good product. Great vendor.
5,I love them
5,I love them
2,Decent quality.
5,They good but one of the pair came messed up
1,I bought these thinking they are like the original but they fell down from my ear immediately. The call quality from these is also not the same as the original.
1,Both pair broke within days of receiving.  Not the actually Samsung quality ear buds.  Both pair had a shortage in one ear after a couple of days.
2,Bad sound quality
2,Not the best!
2,Poor sound quality
5,Seems like original
1,Just opened from package and used it and one bud was already broken and no noise was coming out of it.
1,I purchased theses earphones a month ago and both pair are terrible. The music would go in and out and then eventually they just stopped working completely. Do not purchase!
1,purchased them and the first set one was defective. amazon quickly sent me another set and within a few days one has died again. id look for a better product.
1,Don't think they're real :(
1,This is my 4th time buying and they all broke after a week always the left ear not happy at all waste of money don't waste your time or money.
1,These earphones are fakes.  They are not the same length nor do they have the same sound quality as the original earbuds that came with the Samsung Galaxy S6.
1,Do not last. I ordered several pairs and they last about a week before one ear goes out. In at least one case only one ear worked on first use.
1,Pésimo producto por accidente tiré un poco del cable y dejaron de sonar ambos audífonos
1,I received everything pictured which was exciting. Then I plugged them into the phone and what happened next was extremely disappointing. I can hear them but they couldn't hear me..
5,Love these head phones sound very clear.
1,My earpiece began to crackle after 2 days. 4 days later there's no sound in the right earbud.
1,They arrived on time but they didn't last very long.  One side went out after two weeks.  Then at the one month mark the other side went out.
1,It was terrible I had em for like a week and I already threw em away. They didn't sound that good anyway but IG u get what u pay for
1,Bad connection works good with watching movies but is horrible for talking on the phone
5,Works great and with Samsung android!
5,Great product.
5,Love these earbuds very comfortable and sound is very crisp.
5,Works great. Use with Samsung Galaxy S6
5,great price exactly as advertised
5,My wife live it
5,Great earbuds for the price
1,The quality sounds of these earphonew are terrible ain't the originals. I bought two for another seller and it was pretty good with bass these ones sounds wo cheap.
1,These ear buds worked 35 days and no more. I can't return them because it's past 30 days. I have never had a problem with purchases from Amazon before....
1,Pretty much what the other reviews say. Stop working almost immediately. Terrible quality.
1,Horrible sound quality!! Feels like one ear bud has awful output. There is no way these can be "real" samsung headphones. Can not believe amazon would sell counterfeit products!
1,Unsatisfied because I only received a good pair of headphone that actually worked. However  that doesn't mean the one I received wasn't good .so let's said half satisfied.
1,After a week of using the headset both pair stop working literally stop. I guses the term you get what you pay for go hand and hand ....that's all
1,I ordered these headphones but one of he headphones didn't work. So I returned it and got a new one and one of the headphones once again didn't work
1,NOT OEM. The crappiest Chinese knock off headphones I've ever seen. Somehow even knockoff iPod headphones look and sound better than these.Literally unusable how pathetic they sound.
1,Only one pair of them worked.
1,These are not the real samsung earbuds they are knockoff! Terrible quality broke within 2 days. Do not buy! Total waste of money bad sound quality and total garbage!!!
1,Complete total crap.  Both headsets broke within an hour of their first use.  I'm offended to have to rate it with even 1 star.
5,Aweaome
5,I love it.
1,Don't waste your money. Strongly feel like these are a Samsung knockoff.
5,Great buy
5,Very good more like original
5,decent earphone for the price
5,It was good
1,These are horrible.  The buttons don't work consistently and they make my phone go haywire.  This doesn't happen with other headsets.  Find a different pair.
1,Both headsets came with the mic piece broken. Others cannot hear me talk even with the volume at its highest setting and the mic nearly in my mouth.
1,Stopped working after a week! The caller on the other end could not hear me..bit I could hear them. There was also lots of static when making calls.
1,They are nothing like the ones you get with your phone. I got them in the mail and after 2 days only one side worked. Save your money$
1,These usually work but the two I got the mic doesn't work I usually order these every 6 months. Guess I'll be looking for a better quality product.
5,Super and great service
1,When using these the person on the other end hears nothing but feedback.Loved the pair just like this that came with my phone when I bought it.
1,when product arrived one set of the headphones had a blown speaker and the other has a faulty wire resulting in one of the headphones randomly not working.
1,They are cheap for a reason. They aren't the same quality as the originals. Audio has no bass and tin sounding. Not worth it in my eyes.
1,Wish i could leave less star these peices of garbage were both defective straight from the package. I would strongly recommend not buying this product from this seller
1,The first pair of earbuds lasted about 3 days till the right earbuds stopped working and sound only comes out of one. The 2nd set completely no sound!
1,Not good headphones the price is reasonable for 2 horrible headphones lol
1,I ORDERED AND RECEIVED THESE HEAD PHONES AND THEY STOPPED WORKING THE SAME SAY I GOT THEM. I STARTED TO USE THE SECOMD SET AND THEY SOUND SCRATCHY
1,Good Quality Sound but dont buy this.I  tried both for 10 m And both stops giving sound.If I would now this I won't buy it.
5,Fits my ears well.
5,Awesome just good
5,works perfectly as described
5,Just love these
5,great replacement.
5,Work great for the price!  Fast shipping
5,Works great! Plus excellent value
1,The mic dosent work on one and the other is super stadicy
1,Solo se escucha en un lado pero en el otro no
5,Very good
5,My daughter loved it!Thanks!
5,Low price but a very good product
5,Granddaughter loves this gift.
5,Perfect! Showed up 2 days early. Very impressed sounds wonderful!
1,Hurts my ears and it keeps falling out
5,These are excellent ear buds
1,I disliked the product due to both pairs of right earbuds have blown out and this has been the case for previous orders. Always the right earbud.
1,Both pairs sounded terrible at least one pair had the right ear bud working properly but the left sounded like s*** and the second pair sounded awful
1,These headphones are ass. Do not buy these headphones. They are a knock off of the original headphones that come with the s6. sound like complete s***.
1,the sound quality isn't good sounds like there's an echo the left side from one of the earphones didn't work wouldn't recommend you this buy somewhere else
5,Ok for price
1,If you want to play music its cool but don't make a phone they can't hear you. Good quality for music but the worst for a earpiece.
1,I have purchased a bunch of these because I prefer low-cost ear buds but they break constantly. The latest one broke after 2 days. Do not buy.
1,Very disappointed. Both of these headphones gave out within a 10 day period.  Need to return them. I don't evev want to give them one star.
5,I love these headphones
1,They both did not work at all.
5,Great quality I recommend anyone buy this headphone
1,The sound quality was horrible. They were knock offs. DO NOT BUY
5,Great earbuds for a great price.
1,Right out of the package i plug it into my note 5 and one side doesn't work. It sounds like a busted speaker in one ear.....
1,yesterday I got new Samsung ear phones. it is a very worst product. because Left side speaker is not working. and very low voice.
1,There is a reason that these are non-refundable because they break so fast
1,Beware not samsung.  CHEAP CHINESE PRODUCT.  THE CONTROLS DO NOT WORK AND IT WILL RANDOMLY JUMP SONGS.
1,I've bought these earbuds twice and both times the right side has lost audio after only a few months use. Won't be buying this garbage again
5,Fast  shiping good quality  great price.
1,Each pair lasted only about a week before breaking when the pair that came with my phone lasted 6 months... and they're the same exact headphones!
1,These broke within weeks of first getting them.  Trash sound quality.  Better off listening to things with your phone speaker pressed to your ear.
1,This White Headset  stop working in a short time. I sorry but I do not recommend them. Maybe they are good for traveling only once.
5,Very happy. Thank you
1,One headphone doesn't work one set had two left ear caps and the second came without any at all so I had to use the backups.
5,It was just as i expected
1,I had requested for this item. Got 2 headphones one is not working. Quality also not good.I will never purchse electronic item from Amazon.
5,Very good purchase Thanks
1,Was supposed to come with 2 sets of earbuds...only came with one.
5,It was just like the original
5,They work as expected
5,Exactly as described works well
5,Very good
5,Perfect. Exactly as described
5,Work great. Good price.
5,we reveived them on time and work good
5,MY HUSBAND LOVES THESE EAR BUDS!!!!!!!!
5,You know what your buying...
1,I purchased 4 of these ear buds for family members and after a couple of uses the soft ear part detached from the main body.
1,Bought two packs (4 earphone pairs in total) and all 4 broke the day it came.Had to order new ones from someone else.
1,Got these headphones today and they do not work! The control buttons do not work and the ear buds make static noise. Disappointed in these...
1,I bought 2 phones. One broke in 2 days one side stop working and the other one still working so far.Delivery was on time.
5,good
5,Everything is perfect will be buying again.
5,Ok..for me. No complaints.
5,fit my samsung note4 perfect. sounds pretty good too!
1,These headphones were not delivered. Instead I received a pack of nail stickers inside packaging intended to have the headphones in it. Very disappointed.
5,Amazing and trying to reorder another set
5,Great product and service
5,Works as it should
1,Both ear buds went stopped functioning correctly after 2 months. Only the left ear bud works for the pair.
5,Love the new design better fit in the ears
1,These worked but i hated the way they fit in my ears. We couldnt even keep them inside correctly. So just threw them away.
1,The right side earbud stopped working on both pairs after a few months. Amazon basics are better.
5,Works great
1,One out of 2 worked dissatisfied I only use for hands free driving and the other stopped working immediately after 2 days very disappointed
1,Fake not authentic product.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT false advertisementThese are not the real deal DO NOT BE FOOLED !!!!!
1,I bought these headphones twice.. Both time one ear piece went out with no sound with the first few days. I wouldn't suggest purchasing.
1,I purchased four headsets and within two months 3 of the 4 head sets stopped working. A complete waste of money spent. Please beware.
1,One was messed up and the other one the speaker went out a week after so on both one speaker doesn't work so sad.
1,These earbuds suck. One pair broke before I even got to use them. The other pair is terrible as well. Will not buy again.
1,Didn't  last that long and I'm not rough on headphones it's like a shortage or something and it occurred right after 30 days
1,They went out within a damn week both pair . Watch out for fake.  Sound quality was bad from the start.  Boooooooooi
1,One of the ear buds stopped playing as lod after 1 week. So now you can on really hear out of one of them.
1,The left ear on the first set died within days.  The right ear on the second set was dead out of the bag.
1,One side of one pair didn't work at all. The second set broke three days later. The sound quality on both sets was poor.
1,Not at all what was described sent me 2 pairs of headphones that aren't as the picture described.
5,For the price...you just can't beat them
5,Good product
5,Good product great price
5,Everything the description said. They rock!
1,I really liked the original Samsung earbuds that came with my my S6 until they broke.  These are very poor quality counterfeits and Amazon should be ashamed to be selling these.  They sound terrible.  Do not buy these
5,Great deal for 2 pieces.
5,Great headphones!
1,These started pretty good. They only lasted 3 days and now one side is not working. Should of listened the the other reviews.
1,You guys should work on the left headset that keeps going out... I find myself ordering headphones every couple of months! NOT GOOD
5,I love it
1,These earbuds are definitely fake i owned samsung earbuds and i know how the orignal works this is definitly not the real deal
1,This Headset is not genuine. It has both mic and speaker issue. Lot of disturbance to use it .I hate it .
1,I bought these thinking they were good but I am very disappointed with this product because short cable sound quality is really bad...
1,Both sets were VERY static-ey (is that a word?) Hard to hear over all the static.  I would definitely NOT recommend these.
1,The ear price is too big can't get them to stay in my ear.The one that came with the phone fit fine.
5,Great replacement headphones for my old one!
5,Exactly what I was looking for.
1,I disregarded the reviews but these are fake both headphones dont work on the right side upon delivery. These are cheap knockoffs. TERRBLE
1,Horrible broke the next day. They are no where near the quality of the real samsung headphones. Plus they feel like cheap plastic
1,The headphone wire is so fragile and poor quality it broke upon second use. The chord ripped right out of the right headphone.
1,I bought these for me and my son. Didn't even last us a month. I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap.
1,The product arrived broken. I suspect it isn't a real Samsung product.
1,The headphones felt really cheap and the sound quality was non existent
1,Cuando me van a mandar mi orden que todavía no lo e recibido
5,I'm satisfied with my order
5,Really good stuff
5,Great Product.
5,Great Item
5,They work great good experience
1,they are so big that they hurt my ears.  There is no way to swap out for smaller size rubber piece.
5,Really good quality and long-lasting
1,Only one earbud works after a week
1,I received this just yesterday only used it for a couple hours this morning the left earphone doesn't work. This is unacceptable.
1,They did not work properly and this was very frustrating. I had to get a replacement and that didn't work as well.
1,The mic didn't work on one of the pairs and then once I used the other pair my phone started acting up.
1,Great price..... poor sound quality! I can barely hear through themeven when they volume is at its highest. I'm guessing they're "refurbished"
1,I bought two pairs and 2 of them didn't work from one of the earphones and they are not loud at all.
1,Only had them for like two days and one of the head sets is already broken dont buy its not worth it
1,2 pairs lasted 2 days. One pair the buttons quit almost immediately the other pair one earpiece pulled right off the wire
5,great deal on replacement earbuds
1,These are horrible filled with static. Would NOT buy again wish I hadn't bought them in the first place. Waste of money.
1,Left side stopped playing sound on one pair within 24 hours then the microphone stopped working on the other pair shortly thereafter
1,I purchased this item and returned it 3 times.  We kept receiving defective headphones.  I finally asked for a refund.
5,Excellent sound. Official product!!
1,The headphones do not work properly because either you hear static or nothing at all unless you play around with the adapter.
1,Worked for 2 weeks and died on me pretty disappointing that amazon is trying to pass these off as the genuine article.
1,They dont sound good.. Every time i use them theres a clicking sound.. So no good i dont use them at all.
1,One of the headphones in the package didn't work and I didn't realize it until a month after I purchased the headsets.
1,They were both defective.  I waited to late to return them.. I guess you get what you pay for.
5,Kids love them
1,No recibí nada no se donde está
1,The headphones came with only one ear working for each pair! They may be cheaper in price but also have bad quality!!!
5,My favorite headphones for cheap
5,Great pair of headphones!
1,Bought 2 in December both are broken 5 months later.  I would not rebuy these they are not worth it.
1,Stopped working after like 2 weeks!!
5,good product
5,LOVE THEM !!!
5,Awesome exactly what I ordered!
5,work very well
1,Counterfeit . Sound quality is nowhere near the real earbuds that come with a samsung phone. Would not recommend buying .
1,One set went out in the first week second one  stop working properly also.Not even last me 4 weeks
1,They're fake don't buy them. The look like the real Samsung earbuds but they're just cheap knockoffs horrible quality and sound.
1,These fell apart one week in! I am a responsible adult so there was no rough play or use. Disappointed :(
1,The sound is terrible  don't live up to the actual headphones. These are fake versions!!! Gummi especially were also uncomfortable
1,The first time I used it it broke in my ear. Very poor quality! Would not recommend that you buy it.
1,Very poor quality. I had to wiggle the cord to have the both ear pieces working the microphone never worked either.
1,The cords that plug into the phone are sounds like static every time you move the cord or move the phone...
1,It worked for about a month and them I lost audio on one side of the earphones. I would not recommend.
1,Terrible quality. It sounds like you are overhearing something from another room. Knock off of the Samsung Galaxy headphones. Huge Disappointment.
5,Will buy again works very well.
1,Do not buy these headphones.  Both pairs broke within a day of delivery. Not high quality at all. Very disappointed
5,Jist what i needed!
5,the best one
1,Mine always breaks 2-3 months after i get them... the last time i got they lasted almost a half a month.
1,This makes the 2nd time I  have bought a pair of these and within a week  one stops working.
1,I ordered the 2 pack but only received one pair so I pretty much paid 18 bucks for 1 pair wtf
1,Seems not an OEM as advertised. Poor quality.
5,Sweet
5,Great sound quality!
5,Work Great
5,Great exactly what expected
5,They work great
1,Was not fully functional and broke within a month of use
5,Good headphones
5,Good product
5,Exactly what is expected.
1,Cheap knockoffs. Would not spend $2 on these if I could try them before purchasing. Terrible bass and sound quality.
1,In One Pair Microphone Didn't Work. The Other Pair Only One Headphone Work. Its Horrible Really Want My Money Back.
1,These are total poop.....can't hear a thing and the other party can't hear you at all. Don't waste your money
1,Not good. Received one set that didn't work. So to order two and get two but only one works sucks
1,Didnt even get 3 months out of them!! They broke the same way both times. Left ear bud went out.
1,Both stopped working within 4 months it happened the same with my 1st order. Won't buy it again
1,One of the two headphone sets had no left audio and the other had the plastic warped on the earbud.
1,Both were no good no one could here me and it not worth spending more money to send then back
1,These are just some cheap ass knock-offs that sound like garbage. I should've read the reviews before purchasing. Stay away
1,One of the headphones stop working after one week. The other pair no sound coming from the right ear piece.
1,The headphones wasn't what I saw on the picture they where different and the type in don't use at all
5,Enjoyed it
5,everything was ok
1,DO NOT BUY!  Headphones are not good quality at all! they will break and lose sound in the earpiece!

1,Not real Samsung brand. Shorter chord very uncomfortable when they arenib your ear and have very poor sound quality.
1,Both sets broke on first use. The earbud is two pieces and they broke apart at the seem. Horrible!
1,Bad... 1 came Broken and the other doesn't sound good..  I DO NOT recommended this product at all.
1,Poor sound quality on the mic. The left ear bud stopped working about three weeks after I got them.
1,Horrible I payed $20 for two pairs and they were both broken only one ear bud worked on each
1,Fake do not buy....not even close to the headphones that come with the galaxy... Would like my money back
1,Very cheap! Every time I move the cord it makes a static noise. I hate it wasted my money.
1,Worst head phones I've ever bought. Bought 2 pair and neither worked. I'll never buy from this company again
1,Ordered 4 all stopped working in right earbud within first week. All four. Some minutes after opening the package.
1,These are not Samsung. They sound terrible they're about 7 inches too short and are of extremely poor quality.
1,The microphone doesn't work on either one of them 😢😢😢😢😢 . That's the main reason for me buying them
1,Got a 2 pack and only recieved one and the button controls on the ones I recieved didn't work.
1,Headphones are not good quality. I've had to return 2 sets this month due to them arriving with shortages.

3,These actually sound ok for guitar based songs and even some vocals... but add drums and... well they are better than the majority of headphones I'd found for <5 bucks plus they have a controller thingy (microphone?) so that's a plus. if you can stand the pressure in ear earphones put on your lobes you'll be MUCH better off buying whatever ieh's you can get (usually ~$20) but if not these are decent. I actually got some amazing earbuds from the dollar store (NOT the in ear variety) that wipe the floor with these (except for the cord actually this cord is great! compared with that so... A+ on build quality? mine didn't break yet so...) but other than that I've had nothing but nightmares from such ultra-budget buds... these aren't that bad.
5,Awesome. Lost 2nd set of replacement buds and reordered again
3,I was reluctant to buy these and not just directly from the Samsung website (because I'd read a few bad reviews on these)  but I did anyway because I really wanted some cheap new earbuds. I recommend not buying these. The first pair worked for about 3-4 months then the left ear's sound got quieter out of nowhere and soon after they both stopped working all together. The second pair was even worse i plugged them into my phone and one of buttons on the earbuds wasn't controlling the volume and the right ear was not producing quality sound. So if you want good lasting quality headphones don't waste your 10 bucks on these just pay more and buy them from the actual Samsung website :))
3,After two uses the left earplug went out but I have another pair. For the price it's worth it though so I wonder if they are knock off.
4,Its worth your money
3,first paid lasted about 6 months & i loved em second pair was broke left bud popped out
4,Just got my 2 pk. of headphones.2 day delivery with prime membership. The quality of sound is very good.Does answer calls.The only negative is that the volume button on the headphones does not work with my iPhone 5C.I can however cotrol my volume through my phone so  no worries.
3,I agree with the other reviewer's. The left headphone stopped working after seven weeks. Luckily it was a two pack. The second pair I had also stopped working after four weeks. I don't think their actual Samsung headphones as the ones I received from my galaxy S7 still work after six months. The quality is just not there. I'll look elsewhere
4,The product arrived on time just as promised.
4,Good simple product. Not for fine music listetning
3,They sound good but they only last a month or two before the right ear bud stops working.
3,Take the good with the bad the ear buds them self are decent in my opion they have good sound quality for being cheap but the only thing is that thry dont stay in the ear. Also they do tangle pretty easy so keep that in mind.I would recommend skull candy over these for the extra few dollars. Jvc ear buds hurt you ears and have low bass.
4,works fine although it doesn't seems original
5,As always Samsung is the go to for my wife and Step-Daughter for their headphone needs. Great quality durable and long lasting.
2,They don't stay in at all. I have to keep adjusting them pushing them in all the time  they hurt your ears from adjusting all the time and you can hear everything around you which is annoying. So uncomfortable dont get them!
1,The microphone is inaudible both pairs
2,Right side stopped working after a month.
1,These keep falling out of the ears.  don't waste your money
2,Don't let appearances fool you--these headphones may look like the ones you had but do not sound nearly as good.LOVED the headphones that came with my Galaxy 6 so I was happy to find replacements for so cheap---key word: cheap.Comfort is fine. 1 of the 2 headphones has a rattling sound in the microphone static muffles-out my voice when using it to talk.
1,Bought a pack like 2 and a half months ago. Sounds was great no issues until like 2 weeks ago the first pair got a short then about 1 week ago the 2nd pair one ear went out. So the life expectancy on these are 3 months max if you're lucky I am assuming but just a heads up
2,Terrible headphones. Received them when I got my new s7.The silicone covers fall off after a few weeks to a month of wear. they come off so easily that I lost both. Been through 3 pairs with the same experience.sound quality is decent but it not as loud as iphone headphones.not sure what samsung was thinking about when they came out with these.the plus i guess is that they don't blow up in your ears like the note 7.
1,Pure trash... I have had them for 3 days and they broke. Using them for phone calls sends a horrible noise to the person on the phone. Using them as headphones everythibg sounds muffled and sometimes it doesnt even work in both ears! Tried to review on the actual one I purchased... but interestingly the page is gone...
2,The reason you get 2 of them is they only last 6 months each then the right ear where you talk on the phone always goes bad and you only can hear from the left plug
2,Eh I just happen to always have to get new ones every 2-3ish months. Questioning legitimacy.
2,Nice price but stopped working before I was able to enjoy them.
1,They did not work right from the start. What a waste.
1,These aren't the real Samsung headphones
1,When the headphones arrived the cord was already broken. I also received 2 right pieces instead of a left and a right.
2,The sound is good but they break too fast
2,Earphones did not last. No damage whatsoever and they stopped working on its own. And mic picks up too much background noise during calls.
1,These not even the headphones on the Amazon website it said Samsung these are those gas station headphones they sound horrible very disappointed!!!!!
2,It didn't work for me
1,FAKE!!!  Junk!  Not OEM!  right side blown in one pair.  volume up/down button doesn't work to turn up.  Sound quality sub par.  other pair looks like they are junk too.
1,As an avid lover or authentic galaxy headphones I write this review in absolute disgust for the fact AMAZON allowed me to waste my hard earned money on cheap rip off click bait false adverdised junk. Do not buy mine broke in a week left headphone went out mid conversation during a phone call. Oh and I was driving basically just sitting there. Thanks AMAZON
1,Terribly bulbous and wont stay in my ears. Bothersome!
5,Great deal on headphones!
1,Didnt buy this on amazon bought it off of groupon. Great sounding and stays in the ear like the apple ones but unlike the apple ones moisture/sweat can get into the control and your phone will go haywire until you dry off your control; Annoying issue cant run/do cardio with it. Can't recommend for workouts...go get apple ones instead.
5,* Identic as the ones that came with the phone* Great sound quality* Comfortable for use in long periods of time* Volume buttons work in other android phones
5,Really really good quality...but i have iphone so it dosent work with the lil gadgets
1,Faker than George Clooney on a $1 bill..they say Samsung but you can tell right away they're fake. I wasn't paying attention when I brought it. I thought they're were sold through Samsung but was clearly wrong. The ear buds blew out within the first couple of days. The sound quality is noticeably off. specifically they sound muddy and muffled. Brought them for a friend as well as myself and the same happened to her. I'd give this no stars but I couldn't give a review without at least one. Please don't waste your money on this garbage. Go to the Samsung store... they're really not worth it
1,Although this product is only $10 I expected to at least get what the title states (2 PACK). I ordered this product to share the other pair with my girlfriend as a present and it ended up only coming with ONE. At first I thought that the title was just misleading yet my friend ordered the same product around the same time and received two pairs like you would expect. I WISH THAT A COMPANY LIKE SAMSUNG WOULDN'T HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE THIS. Other than that they seem to be working fine so far - if not for receiving one pair I would rate higher.
1,Purchased on July 4th through PrimeNow.  It is now July 21st and the left earbud has stopped working on BOTH sets of earbuds.  AWFUL.
5,After a year or so and it still work : )
5,Thanks so much!  I received my 2 sets of earbuds and they work just as they should.
5,Good price..good value
5,They the ones you get with your phone good quality
5,Proably the best ear buds ever! Amazing comfort and good sound. Lasted me about 6 months which is goo because I use them for working out
5,Yes work perfectly...I like it!!!  very good item....
1,3 weeks to come just for this
1,These are not the same ones that come with the phones you purchase! These are cheap low quality knock-offs that last weeks before breaking. It is too good to be true with these.
5,Amazing! Works great. Even better price!
5,These are amazing headphones the sound quality is perfect. Thank you for a great product!
5,Best headphones I've had in a while
1,Both right ear plugs in both sets broke immediately.
1,So mine came with my samsung galaxy note 5 and the sound is garbage. Its not that they are "knock offs" or maybe I recieved a bad one but these don't sound good at all. Again these were the original ones that came with my phone and they have very poor sound a lot of bass and there doesnt seem to be a way to fix it.
5,nice
5,2 pack makes the 5 star :)
1,I bought the one pack rather than the two pack. The sound quality was OK but not great -- definitely more "talk on the phone" quality than "listen to music" quality. I mostly kept these in a drawer and didn't use them. I would guess I had a total of about 20 hours use when one side just stopped working.
5,They work really well.
1,Doesn't stay in ear.
1,Very poor quality.
1,These are a cheap knock off. On one of them only one ear bud worked and whenever I use either of them on a call the other person on the line hears an echo. Save your money and by something else.
1,They suck! A waste of money. They cut in and out all the time! Returning them to get my money back! 😡😡
1,I've purchased these multiple times. Every time I purchase them they work for a few months and then one earphone stops working and a few days later the other one stops working as well.
1,Didn't even work properly from the first use speakers go in and out as if they were my old pair of headphones from years ago these can't be from Samsung directly
1,Definitely not real Samsung earbuds
1,I really liked the ear buds when I first started using them but within a week the right side completely stopped working. I barely used them and they were keot in a safe spot. There's no reason for them to all of a sudden stop working
1,DO NOT PURCHASE! HEADPHONES LITERALLY LASTED A MONTH AND THE LEFT EARBUF STOPPED WORKING! GARBAGE!
1,That little squishy piece at the end comes constantly and the sound quality is gross. Complete trash. Buy anything else. Not this junk.
1,One pair came broken the other one the remote doesn't work. Awful sound quality. Definitely ripoffs.
1,Junk! I had these and less than a week they quit working!
1,for some reason for both headphones the right one is 4x louder then the left
1,They don't last long and break easily.
5,Great earbuds
1,Both headphones are crap. One died in a week and the other died once I opened it
1,These are not Samsung headphones. The earbuds that came with my phone were made in Vietnam the cheap knockoff I received from Amazon was made in China.
1,These are the most uncomfortable earbuds I've ever used. They left my ears feeling sore. They came with the Note 7.
1,I can hear fine but no one can hear me as it creates an extremely static sound when on calls. Definitely not worth what I paid.
1,I wouldn't buy these for $1. Wouldn't even cop them for free.  Terrible sound and even less durable than apple headphones.  Straight trash.
1,Junk!
1,one of the headset is not working
1,These SUCK!
1,Don't work how I expected
5,Do not waste your money! The first set stopped working in the right bud the first week. Weeks later I decide to open up the second pack that lasted a couple of weeks and now that right earbud no longer works! Ridiculous these clearly are counterfeit Samsungs! Amazon needs to take these off. I should have looked at the reviews! When they did work people were constantly telling me that they couldn't hear me well.
5,Muy satisfecho con la compra a pesar de mi perdida de audición se escuchas muy bien el precio esta super cómodo.
5,Puedo usarlos efectivamente. Su sonido es claro
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 CAUTION!!!!These headphones 🎧 are JUNK! Received them on 7/29/2021. They broke on 7/30/ 2021 makes no sense. DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
1,ONLY RECEIVED 1 Headset both times placing order
3,The first thing that I noticed is the cord for these isn't as long. I could hear fine but when I would talk on the phone people couldn't hear me at all and there was an awful clicking sound coming from my end of the phone. I had to order another set of headphones from Samsung that are excellent. I noticed the cord length was in fact shorter and the connector was a little different when I compared the two. These were clearly a knock off.
1,No funcionan como esperaba
5,Great sound good length of cord provided different size ear inserts. Overall worth repurchase.
1,This product was absolutely useless. Within 2 days both went out. Tried to get information to exchange and heard nothing. Don't get these at all.
5,These work great and fit well. They do not like the fit of earbuds so these work well without trying to force that seal.
5,These arrived a lot sooner than I thought they would! They're comfortable and the sound quality is great!
2,Each set of earbuds lasted only a few weeks. I use them while walking and I think the sweat shorted them out. Not fun hearing a crackle in the middle of your workout and suddenly loosing sound.May be a good low cost option for casual use but I would not recommend considering these for workouts.
5,works as described can not complain
2,Its good to use for one month
5,I liked the sound quality of these ear buds. I most love having the controls on them so u dont have to rely on your device.
5,I was fine with it for a while and a month later they broke. Could be a user error thing but I really don't know.
1,These are cheap garbage knock offs. The jack or ear phones don't work half the time.
5,The best wired ear buds ever..
5,First ones I ever had so I don't really know how to compare but they work good❤
2,one isnt working at all the one working is only the right ear working.
5,Same as descibed
5,OEM product.  Exactly like the originals I got with my phone.
5,Great product for a great price sound quality is just fine.
4,The're ok very sturdy.
5,Very good product. I use them daily with no problems.
4,The strength of the cord is not too great but the quality provided on all other parts is good
1,I failed to read the reviews. Only one earbud works-same issue in both pair.
3,These are garbage compared to real Samsung earbuds. Half of them don't work at all even.
5,These go pretty well with other Samsung products. The quality isn't anything special but they fit alright and seem to work.
1,There's a short. Sound goes in and out
5,Bought these for my Samsung Galaxy. Very pleased with how they fit. Clear conversation and the wires do not get tangled.
5,The sound quality is definitely same of the best in the price range.  Individual controls work great as well
5,Very good
5,Very very happy with these. They fit inside my small ears perfectly.
3,Good sound quality. Microphone does not work with computer.
1,Sould quality is bad it pops
5,Great for the price
5,Well I love them 2 pack at that great value good product great Samsung headphones
5,i like hard wire earbuds work very well
5,Feels amazing I had to buy myself these because my dog chewed up my last one. The sound is awesome.
5,Para escuchar música y hablar en publico
5,Very nice headphones love them
5,Good useable inexpensive replacement earphones.  I lose them regularly so durability and the price per unit are important.
5,They come in handy and even more when we travel soon they sound great too
5,Good
5,The best and the price is awesome the sound is the best
4,I've order this style before. I like everything about it. As far as sound quality I know there not the best of the best but the sound is fine for myears. I just wish once the ear plug cover starts coming off it would stay on. I guess the covering stretches.
5,El control de es muy bueno.
2,Exactly what I wanted and based off the name of the product it did indeed bring me two sets of earphones and not just two buds to change it but when I talk on it now the person listening to me says all they hear is static and can barely hear me.. so they are busted..
2,Funny shape and very uncomfortable.
1,Los dos auriculares llegaron defectuosos. Ambos suenan solo por un lado a pesar de que son nuevos. No los recomiendo.
5,fits ear best - i still like old school wired earphones
5,Oh my oh my beautiful sound type found I was blown away at first..seriously said to myself whoever made these should just chop the wires off and make earbuds. ive bought so many earbuds wishing I could get the same sound quality as I get from these .the base is true and deep .get product and the price is unbeatable. Please make them in black and other colours .And No I didn't get a discount or paid to review I wish they did though
5,Great product
5,Llego muy bien gracias se escuchan muy bien perfectos
2,No hace un mes que los tengo y ya hacen falso contacto.
5,Se dañan rápido
5,I really like these ear buds.
5,Great headset!  I use them for my tablet & they work great.  The sound quality is great!
5,Great headphones but took forever to get to me. It was shipped from the UK.
5,The extra long cord is great and the extra earbuds are good. Would have preferred to have them in black but it was sold out.
5,Use this for my Moto Ace One phone.
5,These are trash.. they aren't even Samsung headphones
5,Good product
5,Excelente
5,Excelente producto
5,Good
5,listening to music and watching movie on my phone perfect love the sound effect
5,I bought these specifically because the earbud shape fits my ear perfectly. I hate other ear buds that just have circles of flexible plastic to jury-rig them to fit. These have sufficient quality don't run out of battery and are inexpensive.
5,Good quality! Não
3,The volume and play/stop controls have some getting used to.  They are difficult to utilize by feel.  They are small and somewhat indistinguishable.  I am used to Apple products.  The product seems good and the wires are the untangling type...more flat than round (Apple) which is good for me as I don't like the wires touching my skin.
1,One stopped working within a week.  The other one first day hours out of the package  the right earbud detached at the microphone.
5,Compré de nuevo después de un año para mis hijas ya que nuestra mascota los destruyó.
5,VERY GOOD QUALITY
5,It is comfortable and the microphone no bad at all. Arriving  on time.
5,I use these for my laptop and it's works better then my more expensive headphones
5,This product is perfect! That is if you don’t use it with any new apple product. I originally got it for my iphone 12 but unfortunately it seems it’s programmed to reject any wired earphone that isn’t apple. Other than not working on my iphone 12 at all it work perfectly on everything else. Sound quality is phenomenal and it feels great in my ears. It doesn’t have much noise cancellation but it is an older product and I don’t really care about noise cancellation much. 10/10 would recommend.
5,I ordered this set and one came broken. I messaged the seller and sent them a pic  they quickly replaced the broken one with zero hassle or fee. Great product and service. Would definitely order from them again. Thank you
5,This headphones  are great for the price I can't  buy better because  I keep loosing  them bought  6 pairs  so far good buy.
5,Just as advertised. Good headphones just like to OEM
5,My order arrived early and satisfied with the item.thank you.
5,Esta funcionando bem e agradavel para usar
4,did exactly what they are advertised to do but they have all the weaknesses of standard headphone jacks. angled ones would be a wiser choice really does less damage to the headphone wires as well as the headphone jack itself. mine is sketchy at best now seems to hit an miss when things at plugged in. especially when it goes into my pocket. choosing blutooth next i think. i DID get quite a while out of the 2 sets i received however so for the money a great product.
3,For 2 pairs of headphones you cannot beat the price. However do not expect great sound quality when it comes to this piece. It is best for when you are moving around a lot and if you are prone to losing headphones. I'd still recommend them as the price is great.
5,These are great earbuds. They sound crisp the controls work great for Android devices. The pause/play works for IOS devices too.
4,They work pretty good for the most part the earbuds move around in the ears sometimes but they have that soft padding on it that come off so if it wasn't for that they wouldn't move around they still stay in good when you put them in right and I really like them for the price
4,I must of bought 6 of these.  I guess I'm pretty rough on them because they all fail this way or that. The mic is sensitive to moisture but surprisingly performant in the wind. I talk on the phone while cycling with these. The draw back is that the quality varies per every purchase I make. I hope the next on will still be good.
5,Fantastic! These are the most comfortable headset I have tried. While others get uncomfortable after a short period of time not these. I can wear them for hours. I bought extras. These are the only ones I would ever use again. BTW delivery was fast too.
4,These are more comfortable than some headphones and you probably can't get much better at this price. There is some graininess but I really don't think you can expect much better at his price. They only last a few months.
4,I'm not sure if these are legit Samsung or not and I don't have anything to compare it to but for the price I'm actually really surprised at the sound quality. My previous ear buds were Skullcandy and these are working out to be an okay replacement. I bought two packs of these and have only used one set so far so I can't say how consistent the product is but given how cheap these were I'm really considering buy more right away.
2,The order was shipped promptly.  The quality of the chords is not that great it is a bit stiff and isn't as flexible as the one I received when I bought my phone.  The sound quality is ok but not great.  After using it for 3 weeks I kept hearing a clicking sound in the right earphone each time the chord moved and yesterday I had no sound at all.  Not sure this is OEM.  The price is excellent but quality not so.
5,They work fine but they don't fit in my ears comfortably. I have very small ears so this is a common problem I face. But they work great great sound handy great value for the price. Arrived in good time ahead of schedule zero stress zero problems. A pleasure to deal with this company
3,I got one pair of headphones with 2 left earbuds kindof funny really. They're obviously not the original but they fit in my ear really well. This is the second time i bought the pair as it seems I go through headphones fairly quick. Good and cheap you get what you pay
5,Got a 2 pack because headphones at this price can't last long. But I was plesently surprised that they lasted until I enevitably caught them on something hard enough to damage the wiring. Got one left and waiting on another 2 pack. Repeat customer. Very happy
3,Comfortable and the sound isolation is okay.  The sound itself is fine but it doesn't sound " centered" the sound for mono tracks is a little to the left which makes me think they are merely counterfeit
5,Comprei e chegou antes do prazo estimado. Tive só um problema com o endereço alguém anotou o endereço errado e o produto acabou sendo entregue em outra residência mas já resolvi.Os fones são para mim de ótima qualidade e conforto não sei se são originais mas valem a penaAcho caro porém tudo tem encarecido mesmo ainda mais produtos assimDe qualquer forma: aprovado
1,These are definitely not "Samsung" headphones don't let the label on the side fool you.  I've had Samsung earphones before and there are a distinctly inferior quality.  One set came already broken in one ear and the others (I got 4) died out within a couple of weeks of use.  They all died in the same ear too the side the microphone is on.
2,I've been buying these headphones for over a year now but the last purchase was a major drop in quality. One pair has a non-functional microphone while the other broke after the second day. The latter also has a weird substance stuck to the backs of the headphones possibly burnt plastic?This latest purchase was disappointing and I will be finding different headphones from now on.
1,One of the headsets did not work and the other was full of static noises. I threw both out since they were useless and I doubt these are OEM headsets. Will not be buying again from this seller.
3,These are just standard headphone. I bought them for my son who is young and if he looses or brakes them I won’t be out a whole lot of money.  Good quality for what they are.
3,They're okay but I don't think they're legit Samsung earbuds though.. Mine sounded like cheap earbuds you'd get from the dollar store and when I double press the "Pause/Play" button on the remote it won't ever skip to the next song. Can anyone else confirm this as well?
1,it take very long time to get this headset around TWO TO THREE WEEKSand then after few hours of use i figure out that the mic is so bad no one can hear me clearlyit does not take my voice unless i put it extremely close to my mouthI wasted my money and my time buying this !!!!
5,Amazing price for Samsung branded ear-buds.  Good quality materials and construction will not embarrass you.  The volume and mute/answer/hangup buttons work as expected.  Comes with an extra set of gel covers.
5,Loved these.  They sound great and the rubbers makes them very comfortable.  I sleep with these.  Great price as well.
5,They work well to replace my original Samsung headset that came with my phone.  Sound quality is fine and they stay put in my ears as I run to catch the next bus!  Good price!
5,These are so comfortable and they are the only ones that don't make my ear ache after long use.  My husband loves these too. We have 4 pairs.
5,Fone chegou certinho qualidade de audio e muito boa gostei bastante do fone
4,Almost the same as the original ones except the plastic texture of the cord. Come in the same little box as original. Very good build quality. The sound the mic and the remote are fine. Can't really tell the difference. Oh yeah it come with another set of rubbers too.
3,You get what you pay for. The sound quality isn't great and they are damaged easily but for short periods they are fine they make good backups or for going to the gym. The cord is also shorter than most headphones which is fantastic for me since I'm short but other people might not like it.
1,I would have been nicer but OEM ? NOT AT ALL !! I have the OEM version and you can move as you want and it does not disconnect but these one dont move or else it doesnt work
5,I have a Samsung S6 and I love these headphones I have tried other ones but these ones are the best for talking hands free. When I misplace mine I always come back here to buy more.
2,They work for about 4 months. Bought them last September.  Opened one of the packages in December then by April they stopped working had to open next package. Those ones stopped working last month. Debating whether or not to reorder.
1,The first one worked well but kept delivering little bits of shock in my ear till it eventually stopped working. The second one doesn't have a good enough sound quality like the first.
1,Honestly these earbud were a horrible purchase. I bought them as a backup pair. 1st earbuds mic stop working with in the first phone I made. Right in the middle of the convo. The second one did not work right from the beginning.
5,Works really well.. like the orginals! Sound quality and durability is good i have over month now and no issues!
5,Prix dérisoire pour d'aussi bon écouteurs. Ils sont identiques à ceux qui venaient avec mon galaxy s7
3,Comes with 2 headset pairs.1 doesn't work glad I had the second one
5,Usually when you buy replacement earphones that say they're form X or Y phone brand they're usually bad quality speakers inside similar shaped plastic structures. This isn't the case. The earphones are the OEM ones that came with the Galaxy S7.
5,Not all earbuds are made equal. I appreciate the shape to stay in my ear while I watch Netflix or use with my cell phone. Love these.
1,The sound that comes through is not good and the mic sounds so bad that no one can understand you
4,I like these head phones I find these the most comfortable ear buds available. I have had no quality issues The covers occasionally come off if I wear them while sleeping.
5,These were great.  My son will only use Samsung headphones.  Very pleased with delivery time.  Packaging was kind of big and no padding around them.  Very pleased with product.
2,I'm pretty sure these aren't authentic samsung headphones. They work ok but for one of the pairs i received the right side barely works. You'll hear audio properly from the left side but the right side is very faint.
5,great set of hands free headphones for the price.
5,Love these. Got my first pair with my samsung galaxy 6. Never like headphones as thrywhurt my ears but these are AWESOME.
2,These are only okay. Sometimes when I'm walking with them in I can hear some "movement" within the ear piece which leads me to think these are knock off.
5,Great sound quality for earbuds and seriously impressive clear mic. Top value.
5,I actually got four packs. Two of them did not work very well. So they get 5 stars because now I get extra rubbery thingies for my earbuds.
2,Neither of these headphones lasted for more than a couple of weeks. One toggle didn't work at all; the second one a headphone died very quickly. Waste of money.
5,Wonderful perfect for what I needed and there's 2 of them! I have one for my computer and one in my bag on the go. Arrived on time and packaged well. Thank you so much!
2,it was loud while it works but the right side stopped working after a couple of weeks.
1,Very poor quality. They were bent at bad angles in the package and were broken when they arrived. The sound is fuzzy and they randomly pause and disconnect from my phone. Terrible.
2,Product is ok.. Doesn't last too long as for quality.Good for short term use.
1,One broke very easily and the second pair just stopped working in like 2 weeks of use.
3,They aren't real and that's for sure. But they don't seem too bad especially for the price. I think these are a bit smaller and the cord feels weird. Not bad just not good.
4,Work well as long as they are not abused.Can't be left in the ear too long though as the insert tip makes your ear sore
3,The wire is not enough long for me. Quality was good for short time
5,The design of the bud makes it so that they stay in my ears unlike others such as Beats.
2,They are ok if you're gently with them but i've went through 6 now and the wire just give out and stops working
5,The first set I bought took 6 weeks to get here the second set took three so aside from that they're amazing
1,I both two sets and both headphones die with only 2 weeks of uses. In addition the sound it's terrible. Do not buy these headphones.
5,Good value for the money.
5,ordered cause i lost mine and didnt want to pay $20 great price for what u get amaizing all set if i lose another pair
5,2 for $10 can't go wrong
2,worked on some and not others
5,Bonne qualité.
2,Initiall all the functions worked fine but after using it for just a few days all the buttons (i.e volume control and the on/off button no longer function)
3,for the price is ok. bed headphone basically. the protection ear is not good because it detaches so easily.
2,Product broke in about 1 month of purchase
5,Great units. The quality is nice and they arrived much sooner than expected.
2,disappointing as it doesnt fit ears...sounds ok but have to hold to use
1,Disapointed....
1,Did not work with Motorola X-Play when received. Both sets had a none working left headphone also the headphones do not like to stay in your ears. So I would not purchase these again
4,4 stars
3,As expected
1,I ordered two two packs one for my boyfriend one for me within two months of regular usage all 4 pairs have stopped working in one ear bud or both. Super dissapointed they are NOT the same quality as the pair that come with Samsung phones
5,Great product. As described. Works great.
2,Work fine as headphones but when making calls create an echo for the person at the other end. Same problem for both pairs. I have owned these headphones before (the ones that came with the phone) and the call quality was always good that is why I had bought this 2 pack
5,I like them. Look and feel solid and are very lasting.
1,Terrible headset when i use it on my phone nobody can hear a thing i say. Garbage/trash one more pos to fill the landfills. Great job douche bags.
5,My son says these earbuds work for his Android phone just like Apple earbuds work on an iPhone controls on the cord and they sound very good.
5,Great
5,Great!!!
5,Tres bon achat
1,Both pairs dead after 2 months and only a handful of uses.No sound from one side and microphone unusable because of echo.
1,Not even real Samsung.  You can tell by the material. And also broke in one use . So in total lasted me 2 days one day for each.
5,Wow awesome sound n good value and most of all irreplaceable. Ty amazon.
4,The sound quality is good but it doesn't fit my ears. Make sure to try it before otherwise you may be disappointed.
5,The item arrived very quick before the due date. For now is working good. Thanks !
4,One set is not working after a month of use. on the other one the micro is no longer working. Very good customer services. They send me an other pair.
2,3rd time i ordered them. First 2 time they were perfect but didn't last long. This time it was junk mic on both headset didn't work.
4,nice
5,excellent
1,Both the headphone broke within a few days of using them. Cheap terrible quality headphones.
2,Sound quality was alright but these break way too fast. One pair lasted about 2 weeks the other around 2 months. I wouldn't really recommend buying this as you'll be replacing them in a couple months tops.
5,Good sound work great would buy again
5,Awesome headphones
4,Volume Control doesn't work great and the earphones are a bit plasticky otherwise very happy.
5,Work well nice fit sound quality is smooth and clear best earbuds I've had in a while.Worth every scent.
1,These headsets were just a waste of money. Cheap quality non-functioning microphone are some of the cons i found right after opening the packaging. Really disappointing experience for me :(
5,got it really fast great headset doesn't hurt your ears.
5,Replaced the pair that came with the phone. Great quail for the price
1,Both sets stopped working properly within only one month of usage (only one speaker working). Very disappointing purchase...
2,Product arrived on time.  After two weeks use though the left ear stopped working on both pairs.  Sorry but I will no be buying again.
1,The item is "shipped" since may! Contacted the seller and no update wht so ever. Worst experience! Dont waste ur time or money here guys!
3,So far the mics aren't working properly but I use it most of the time for music anyways so it doesn't bother me much. Though sometimes I need to use the mic to respond to calls and it doesn't work?
4,Outstanding value. The earpiece has a bit of an odd shape and takes a little time to get used too. The audio for books is perfect and the music stereo is every bit as good as much more expensive buds.
5,It's light and has an extra cover.I can hear voices very clear and microphone is perfect. Wire has enough length to put mobile in the pockets.
2,The part that goes into the phone is very delicate and the stereo starts to die fast.  Lasted maybe a month!
1,the buds are too large to fit in my ears but the sound is great.just have to hold them
4,Interesting fit sound is a bit canny but for the price you can't complain much.
4,This stays in the ear better than standard earbuds with more comfort than apples earpods. It also has excellent sound quality.
5,Exactly the same as what comes with the phone.
5,Awesome ear buds! Sound is clear and crisp!
1,These headphones did not even last for a year. They are so uncomfortable guys and gals do not get these kinds of headphones please....
2,Was hoping sound quality would be better with these Apple earpod clones. I don't recommend. You get what you pay for I guess
5,Works well!! Pleased with this purchase!!
5,The ear piece is angled and doesnt work for meI am sure the headphones are fine
5,Fonctionne très bien comme les originaux
5,OEM Headphones really liked what came with the phone bought more. pretty decent sound.
5,Great quality headphones.  Very glad I purchased these...and the price waa exceptional!
1,Both headphones lost connection to the right earbud within 1 month. Connection seems to break at the built in microphone.
5,Fantastic quality
5,Great inexpensive headphones. Product was exactly what I wanted and the sound quality is fine for the money.
2,Dislike the fact that 1 side of my headphones already isnt working and it hasn't even been 6 monthsSMH!
2,I find these much less comfortable than the original ear buds that came with my Galaxy Note II
5,For the price they work great . They are comfortable.
5,great.
1,Both sets we purchased stopped working after 2 weeks of use.
5,Great earphones & work well when talking on the phone.  Compact & fit in my bag well.
5,Comfortably stayed put in my ear and great sound quality.  I like the design of the silicone covers...
5,Good quality still working after almost two years
1,Echo in ear and lots of static
1,Cheap quality sound isn't the same as oem. I could swear these are knock offs. On top of that they make a weird sound while speaking on the phone a loud crackling noise. Very disappointed.
2,While these look and feel like the originals that came with my S6 they don't have new he sound quality.  I'm a bit dissapointed but will use them as they are functional and are the only shape of earbuds that don't give me headaches.
3,Got this in the summer and one of them suddenly stopped working when I was going back home so I have to use the other one now.
1,Fake . This product is garbage
5,Work very good
5,Good pack of headphones works great with my Samsung S4...
4,It arrived on time and so far they're working well. Only tried out one set of headphones at this point.
5,Nice that you get two pairs of headphones.
5,AMAZING QUALITY.Also came DAYS before the official shipping.Fast shippingamazing qualityAlso comes with 3 rubber replacemnt bands for your ear plus one included
1,fell apart
5,Worked as expected
1,Volume went dead on one set just within a month and the pair after a month one ear stopped working.  Also when talking to people said it sounded very static sometimes.
1,Bad quality!!!one headset the mic doesn't work and the 2nd headset one side sound too low.I'm really disappointed with the quality.I don't know what to do but is really frustrating.
5,A really great pair for the price you can't go wrong
5,Bon écouteurs à bon prix.Les boutons Pause/Play et le contrôle du volume est pratique.Les écouteurs sont esthétique.
3,One pair stopped working.
5,These are dandy - exactly like the originals.

5,wonderful
5,EXCELLENT
1,Bad Quality. (not the ones on photo)
2,These unfortunately don't seem to be the same quality as the original buds that came with an old Galaxy phone.They visually seem to be nearly identical but the microphone quality appears to be quite poor.  Voice calls are pretty unpleasant for whoever you are talking to lots of static and random sound that makes it sound like you are shuffling around even when sitting completely still.As for sound quality they are also ok but if you are planning on using them for music they really aren't too impressive.  The old pair has since entirely stopped working so I can't compare them back to back but I recall listening to music and not finding them so tinny in the past.Only reason I'd suggest these is if you want the particular earbud shape and are planning on using it for listening to podcasts or do quick phone calls but even then it might not be ideal.  Not sure if it is a QC issue but both pairs we received are equally poor quality.  Might be better off with basic old school Apple Buds just mind the media buttons won't work on Android.
2,These headphones look identical to the ones that came with the recently purchased a Samsung Note5. Unfortunately I lost them so purchased this replacement. In the interim I also purchased an older version of the headset from a vendor in Vancouver. When I compare the the fidelity of the two this older version is far superior leading me to believe this is not a genuine Samsung headset.
2,Point positif: La livraison a été plus rapide que prévue. Point négatif: J'ai effectué un retour la journée même puisque la qualité sonore était très médiocre sur les deux paires d'écouteur. J'ai vérifié sous les embouts de silicone et les oreillettes étaient égratignées et souillées. Celles-ci semblaient avoir été altérées. Ces écouteurs ne sont certainement pas du Samsung d'origine puisque la qualité est incomparable avec ma vieille paire âgée de quelques années.
3,One of two failed within a month. the second one is still fine.
2,The sound quality is much less than that of the original Samsung earphone.
5,I got 2 sets of headphones as promised. They are also of extremely high quality. I have no idea what's going on with all headphones for Samsung - I have purchased them multiple times in multiple places and sometimes I would get a total crap sometimes - 100% visually identical - they have excellent sound just like the ones that came with the phone. And you know the most weird part? I would get both crap and good ones from THE SAME seller. So it seems to be the lottery. Just choose the seller who is ready to replace them like I was doing - I bought 4 headphones (one at a time) from the same seller and each even numbered purchase was unusable crap. The seller replaced them for free though.
2,My very well used original earbuds broke last week ordered these and right out of the package I can tell they are fake. First authentic Samsung earbuds are manufactured in Vietnam not China. This can be seen on the little rubber piece where the headphones split off the wire. Second and most disappointingly is the drivers are clearly not the same ones used in authentic Samsung's. These have none of the bass and sound very tinny with static in the background when the volume is increased. On the bright side they were cheap enough not to warrant bothering to return them and will suffice for their purpose for now until they either break or I find a real pair of Samsung ear buds.
5,I was concerned based on some of the reviews that these were going to be cheap knockoffs...but I'm happy to report they aren't!! They are real Samsung and they work perfectly. Thanks :)
3,Always order a lot of them so when one pair brakes down I've got many backups. The quality really varies. Some pairs hold up several months other only a week. Gosh! I've even had a pair with two right ear pods. The sound quality and fit is really great as long as you get a "good" pair.Sometimes you might end up with a pair without base.I use them for activities where there is a high risk of breaking them so it doesn't hurt me to much when they break. Don't expect the next BOSE ear pods.
1,Avoid at all costs! Cheap Chinese knock offs! When they arived I tested both pairs out. One sets left ear bud didn't even work! So thanks for giving two pair! Second pair works but terrible quality. Totally get what you pay for! DO NOT BUY
1,These are the worst headphones I've ever had. I usually have no problems with headphones. They fit in my ears easily and comfortably. But those ones just won't stay in my ears. I don't like leaving a bad review but I'm being honest here. Beware of the shape of the ear buds. They are not the typical kind. If you look at the picture you can see. I unfortunately did not realize before purchasing.
5,Great headphones. Got the Samsung S7 that came with headphones and loved them. So decided to get some for the family.  Sound quality is exactly the same as the ones I got with phone. Great buy for sure.
1,Horrible quality. They look very similar to the original one that samsung provides but not nearly the same in quality.Both of them broke within about a month of using them. It is the connection at the microphone which is very flimsy. It was the right ear bud that lost connection in both cases.
1,These headphones are not at all what they are advertised as. They are advertised as the Samsung headset ( it even says BY SAMSUNG) that is compatible with the note 5. They are not Samsung headphone despite the fact that the company is using the Samsung namesake (which is illegal). I have a pair of the REAL Samsung headphones - which these are clearly a fake version of - which came with my note 5 and the difference between the overall quality is striking. I bought these because a couple friends loved mine so I thought I would get them a pair. The material is completely different especially the ear buds. On the real Samsung headphones the earbuds have a soft gel-like covering and these ones have a hardened rubber/plastic. The sound quality is HORRIBLE they extremely quiet do not cancel noise like the real ones and there is essentially no bass. I feel very deceived the seller should be sued for selling this fake product.
4,The earphones are a great pair of 'beater' earphones sound is tolerable and the shape is comfortable. Good for being at work or even sometimes at home when I don't want to be wearing my big headphones which is fairly often in the summer months. My mum says the microphone sounded noticeably better than the apple ones I was using before (on Android).
2,I've bought these almost 4-5 times for different people. First thing do not have too high hopes for this product. For $10 you get the quality that you get. When I first got These I wasn't an audiophile so I didn't notice that the quality was lacking faint cracklyat times and required me to turn the volume up to max for me to hear. I believed it was normal. Then after exasperation in continually feeling with customer service about the buds breaking apart every time I even breathed I decided to try something new.I bought one still relatively cheap ($25) and the difference was immediate. Please do not waste time with these. They are not good for commuting or even leisurely singing. Spend the extra $10 for what will last. These earbuds are best for little children on iPads and such because they won't notice the difference nor will they care.You can't hear the base the quality in phone calls is lost and the sound is faint almost as if the earbuds are corroding the sound. If you are in need of the bare bare bare basics get these. As in just for rudimentary hearing. Anything else please find another. I recommend the Actionpie or the Paramore ear buds for beginners. They have created quality longevity and good strong sound for those who need strong earbuds without the hundreds attached for quality that isn't necessary.
5,The 2 pack special is so amazing and they both work great. I have been looking for a next one in stores and was not successful. I went on amazon once and they had a two pack for a very decent price. Loved that and did not have to look any further.
1,These are NOT real Samsung earbuds!! These are knockoffs. The difference between the two is very obvious as these are a lot lighter and the sound quality is on par with something you would get from a dollar store. These earbuds have zero bass whereas the Samsung earbuds have tons of bass. They do look identical. Anyone who says different must be tone deaf.
5,Weird shape but these are solid! highly recommended quality product Thank you
2,I ordered these by mistake. They are the weird shaped buds designed for alien ears which I don't have. I'll keep them anyway for spares.
1,These say they are Samsung but they are not the same quality. one pair has no sound in one ear another sounds like a jack hammer on the other end and the other one has a persistent echo. I feel ripped off.
5,Arrived so quick. amazing sound. comfortable in your ears. sound is great. thanks. :)
4,Not bad at all works well with my Samsung Galaxy S4.They look a little cheap but they work at least. All the buttons and their functions work and the sound quality is decent. Definitely worth it.
2,Cheap
1,This description is not accurate. The earphones need a conversion kit to fit into your phone. Don't buy these
1,When i talk on the phone using the headphones i am told that its static breaking up the conversation
4,Great value for the price i originally bought this because i lost the ear bud on my old one little did i know it came with 2 pairs and a pair of earbuds. however the controls do not work on iPhone.
5,it is amazing
5,Excellent...
4,I bought these headphones because I read claims that the microphone and controls work with the oneplus one. I can confirm that the volume controls and microphone do work with the oneplus one and most likely other android devices. The reason I gave four stars is because the sound quality is not great. There was a little less bass compared to the regular apple earbuds but if your looking for functionality then these definitely work great with android.
1,I ordered a 2 pack I got 1. The sound quality is terrible nothing like the genuine Samsung earphones. These also sit in the ear canal unlike what is shown. I was extremely disappointed. A terrible waste of money.
1,Very disappointed.  The ear buds shipped do not match the product pictured.The title and description both say that it is a two pack but later in the description it says it only includes one pair of headphones.The item received is the in ear kind of ear buds.Probably avoid this product as it is not accurate to what you will receive.
1,Not only are they terrible quality but one of the earbuds had a hair sticking out of it and some sticky substance on them. They do not seem to be genuine Samsung headphones. Would not recommend these.
1,Context: My GF bought these as she lost her OEM headphones. We ended up finding the headphones and when these arrived we tested them to see if they were of similar quality to the OEM headphones. If they were we would keep them. Unfortunately they were not even worth the cheap price they are sold for here.Pros:1. The sound came out of both ears.Cons:1. This item is NOT OEM. These are cheap knockoffs and you are much better off buying a third-party pair of headphones for the same price from a reputable brand. Or if you are set on buying the OEM headphones move along as these are not authentic or even close in quality.2. The mic quality was horrible when trying to communicate over the phone. However for some reason the quality was not awful when I tested it as a potential casual mic to use for the PS4.3. None of the headphone buttons worked properly on either a Google Pixel or a Samsung S10.TL;DR:1/5 as this product does not meet the product’s targeted specifications. Further false advertising should not be rewarded with even a 1-star rating. Yes you should move on if the price seems too good to be true that’s because it is.
4,One side of my headphones that I got with my Samsung S7 broke so I needed new headphones. I don't like the type that have the plugs on the end and stick into your ears because they don't sit well in my ears and the sound becomes muffled. I love these and decided to try to find them again and was surprised to find them on here for such a great price. I got the 2 pack and tested them out when they got here and they both work microphone and volume buttons. I had gotten extra covers before and now have plenty of covers for when they fall off which happens occasionally when I put them in my pocket. The only thing I've noticed is that I think they might be a tiny bit smaller than the ones that came with my phone because I feel that they fall out my ear sometimes even with the cover on. It's not often enough that it bothers me but I just thought I'd mention it.UPDATE:It's been four months since I've bought these and one pair has already broke where one of the ears stopped working. Now the other pair is starting to have the same issue. I use these headphones 6/7 days a week and pretty much all day at work but I didn't expect them to die so quickly. There seems to be an issue that if the cord gets caught and is tugged that is how the issue starts. I take the public transit and usually have my purse gym bag and lunch box with me so if I take a seat I pile those items on me and the cord sometimes gets caught under it all and will get pulled on when I tug it out. I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars now just because they have died so quickly. But it's hard to beat that price for two headphones that I really like. I've never had any issues with the microphone or side buttons not working either.
1,I got them as backup headphones so I took longer to try them. When I actually needed them they turned out to be the cheapest flimsieat thing ever they didn't even work unless you jiggle the chord base. Because I took a while opening the product (and that's only because it took so long to deliver) my money wasn't refunded. I just want to warn potential buyers that this product is really not good. I recommend you keep looking.
5,These are amazing. They are not the most solid (I am very rough with my things). They last me at least 1 year per pair and I will keep buying them until they no longer sell them.They have the best mic I could find to work and use on the road. I also find they do not tangle much and my partner also loves them for calls.Among all best customer service if you have issues with your order.Highly recommended.
1,The earphones work good. Unfortunately one of the earphones I got in the second week the right ear went off and stopped working. Now I'm left with the last pair and the left ear seems to have had a faint volume reduction within a couple of weeks. The strings also has a very cheap feel to it. Like a very thin piece of rubber that can snap and break the wires inside if you accidentally yank on it too hard. Wouldn't not really trust to buy again.
4,Great headphones! Fit comfortably into your ear and the sound is nice. I'm not sure if they are true Samsung headphones because the pair that came with my S7 Edge had the volume adjust on the left cord and much further down. Overall they are a great deal for the price if you are looking for basic headphones.
2,The last time I ordered from this seller I received the OEM samsungs that sounded great. They still do but the volume and mute buttons no longer work. These new ones sound like cheap knock offs with a honky midrange prevalence
1,Doesn't fit in ear at all falls out at the slightest head movement (silicone doesn't do anything). Constantly needs adjustment to stay in ear. Cord is stiff and inflexible. Threw mine out after a few months couldn't stand them anymore. Went back to the standard Apple earbuds.
5,these headphones fit well and have decent sound. will certainly be buying them again.they will not last too long if you're rough with them
1,Microphone doesnt work after 1 day lol
5,Great product. Good Good quality.
1,These came in a pair one of them stopped working after few months. The buds don't sit well in ear and can be uncomfortable. I would not buy these again
1,Très déçu après deux semaine une oreille ne fonctionnait plus et l’autre a lâché quelques jours plus tard
5,GREAT PRODUCT AND SERVICE
1,These are definitely not the same product as what was packed with the previous generation of Samsung Galaxy phones. Sound quality is horrific cord is a rigid brittle plastic...the throwaways on the airplane are better than these. They look similar but are not like those that came with the phones back then. Disappointing.
4,They are very comfortable in your ears like the sound quality although it isn't quite as good as the original ones.
3,Volume does not adjust well. Pretty comfortable  sound quality could be a lot better. No microphone so you have to unplug to answer phone 🙄
5,Awesome customer service. One of the earbuds was not working got an immediate email response and free replacement earbuds. Happy with the product.
5,IMO the best cheap headphones you can order. They have a good full sound and they are better than the $20 pair I got from Walmart and you get 2 pairs for $15!2021 Update: I've had to buy several more pairs because friends and my roommate keep stealing them because they're so good.
5,Came earlier than expected and are exactly the ones that came with my Samasung s7 phone! Will recommend to others 😁
5,Great quality for the price and are pretty comfortable too
5,Good product exactly as described
5,Good for the price
5,what I was looking for work great
5,Work and fit as good as the ones that came with my phone. Great price too
5,great product and delivered on time...
4,Very good..  Bought it for mom and she loves them.
4,It's too big to my ears. The delivery arrived in time
3,Not convinced may be a chinese copy. However the sound quality is pretty good (NOT shallow and screechy/tinney like you get with some low quality pieces). States OEM as in original manufactured item but came in small clip seal bag not the original packaging that you would get from samsung. One pair has died on me completely (after several months) but there was no deteriating of quality they just stopped working one day. So the verdict: if you want headphones quite cheaply which have a great sound quality and your willing to risk a failure which honestly could have happened with any headphones in this price bracket then i would recommend. But as to them being the originals i'm not sure.
4,my son likes them. after buying numerous ps4 headsets and all of them breaking he decided to just order an ordinary audio/phone set. hes 12 so theyl do! he said although for talking online theyr a bit on the quiet side theyr good for music and everything else so is happy with them. cant complain for that price. all good :)
1,Very bad  and duplicate Samsung product
1,Very worst quality
5,Nothing really to report; these were what I was looking for and they worked as expected.
1,Mic does not work. Cannot talk voice or video call using them noone can hear me but I can hear them. Tried various devices and two pairs.. Volume great for listening to music
3,Un des écouteurs reçu ne fonctionne que sur l'oreille gauche. J'ai écrit au fournisseur mis n'ai jamais reçu de réponse. Je recommande les écouteurs pour leur qualité mais je suggère de bien choisir le fournisseur.
5,Les écouteurs étaient pour ma filles car avec son cellulaire Samsung a elle les écouteurs n'étaient pas les mêmes et elles aimait mieux ceux que j'ai donc je lui ai commandé les mêmes que moi
5,Love these earphones/ earbuds only wish Samsung made this style in a wireless version :)
3,I use these for the volume control and they are comfortable but one side is cutting out I've had them a month . They are a good price and you get 2 . But samsung is not as good as apple headphones the thing is my apple earphones work with galaxy phone just no volume control .
2,The sound quality is really bad. I got 2 pairs and the sound quality is different as in bad in both.  One is damaged as sound is audible in one earphone.  The shipment arrived early but the quality is very bad. Do not buy. Seriously dont waste your money.
1,I found them uncomfortable and not the best quaity
5,Its quality and design.
4,Received the headphones one worked the other didn't. Seller sent another one as replacement unfortunately that one didn't work either.  Didn't bother in getting another one replaced again...But the one that worked did it job!
3,Second time ordering. 1st order 1st pair worked great but left at our house in the US.  Second pair the microphone did not seem to work.  So I ordered another 2 pack and the first one I have tried works the way they should.
4,Works better than anything else I found for a Samsung phone.
1,Within a month the left earbud of one of the sets was dead and the right earbud of the other had quit. Unfortunately you don't have the option to plug both sets into a device simultaneously and use one earbud from each.
1,I knew the moment I took them out of the package that these were not anywhere near the same quality as ones exactly like them I'd bought off here in the past. They felt.. cheap.Sound quality is HORRIBLE. Probably the worst I've ever had. Straight into the trash.
5,Very good quality comes with extra rubber earbud pieces
4,Le son est bon mais ça tombe de l'oreille facilement.
1,Please do not buy. Mic does not work. Sound quality is poor.
4,The sound isn't as good as the original ones that come with the older Samsung phones but considering the price and the fact that you can't get this style from Samsung anymore this is a decent alternative. The fit is exactly the same which is what I was most interested in I'd but them for the fit not the sound quality.
1,Used this for listening to music but one of the two that I ordered stopped working after 2 months and Amazon would not allow me to return it.
2,Aparentemente é original porém em um dos produtos veio com defeito estou aguardando o vendedor para poder troca-lo. Após a troca vou ver se é isso mesmo que ele promete.Não consegui trocar pois o valor do frete (internacional) foi maior que o preço do produto.
1,Awful product
1,Only 1 pair worked out of the 2 pack.
3,These earbuds have excellent sound and volume control but their ear design is terrible. I did not look clearly at the bud design prior to ordering. if I had I would not have ordered them. Check the bud design before ordering!
5,Excelente o aparelho.Estou usando e não tenho ressalvas a fazer.MUito bom mesmo.
1,N'achetez pas ça
1,Not at all worth the money. Within a week of using the product both did not work. One ear pod stopped working on each and all you could hear was static in your ear and a bit of a shock.
