4,First it requires an additional charging block.  It needs a wall charger to operate.  I have the Apple 20W fast charger wall block.  At first it didn't charge as quick as just using a cord.  I tried it for the first time aa few nights ago and from 50% it took over an hour to charge on the Apple 20W wall charger.  It responded quick to the phone being on it but not today and It didn't even charge today.  In fact even with all the power drains turned off (wifi bluetooth and open apps) it actually went DOWN in charge while the charger was charging.  In a half hour it first dropped to 68% then back up to 75% and then never moved from 75%.  The phone is brand new and charged 5% in just two minutes using a car charger.  I had ordered a second was in the process of sending this back when I saw on a forum that if it stopped charging the iPhone you need to shut off and restart the phone.  That did the trick and now it responds quickly to the phone being on it and charges fairly quickly.  So I'm giving it most of the stars back and keeping both unless they start having problems again.
4,The charger has a real nice feel and is wafer thin with a nice cloth cover.  The charging alignment lights are bright and yet soft in color.  Best of luck.
5,This thing is amazing! I can set my phone down and I know it will charge. When charging your phone it pulses a blue color on and off(slowly). Also i can go to sleep without worry if my phone is charging or not since I can just lay it on top of the charger. Note: Dpending on your case it could interfere with the phone charging or not so just make sure the phone is charging while on the touchpad.
4,This charging pad works very well and is convenient to use I just wish it came with a plug for a wall and not just the USB cord.  I have many wall adapters but not any extras that support the very fast charging.  Still a great product for the money though.
4,The charger seems to work fine. However the usb-c connector is flimsy and doesn’t hold the cable well. The directions are minimal and aren’t very clear. It would have been easier if the would have just included the appropriate charger. I didn’t have the exact type of usb charger (5V / 2a)  but the 5V / 1a charger I had seems to work ok. The most annoying thing is the bright blue light it displays while the phone is charging. Since I charge the phone on my bedside dresser the bright blue light is very distracting when trying to sleep. It would have been nice if the light was much more faint.In summary this seems to be an adequate wireless charger that is cheaply made and continuously emits a bright blue light while your device is charging. Take a close look at other options before settling for this one.
4,I bought this pad to charge my Samsung Note 20 Ultra and it does the job!I like its thin design which makes it very portable; easy to slip into a pocket or bag along with cables adapters etc. It looks stylish is solidly built with a metal body and the lighted ring lets me know what's happening (green=ready blue=charging rapid green/blue=error). The non-skid coating on top keeps the phone in place and the four rubber feet on the bottom keep the charger from sliding across my desk.With a 25W PD/PPS adapter this pad Fast Wireless Charges right through my phone's case (Unicorn Beetle Pro) which another wireless charger I tried couldn't; only managed standard speed. Super Fast (wired) Charging is quicker but then wireless is more convenient and doesn't strain the USB-C port by constantly inserting/removing the cable; I think it's usually worth the wait to save that wear and tear.[UPDATE] This pad charges my Galaxy Buds Pro but not using my PD/PPS adapter--that results in unproductive green/blue cycling every minute or so (which could be the adapter's fault). But with a standard 5V 2.4A USB-A adapter (and the included USB-A to USB-C cable) wireless charging works just fine for the earbuds: steady blue to full charge.This pad does NOT charge my Galaxy Watch 4 using either adapter; any attempt results in a green/blue flashing error signal.Bottom line: Worth the price... I ended up buying another one for travel.[UPDATE] Deleted one star for needing to use two different adapters/cables.
4,I don’t know why but after connecting to this charger my two-amp power adapter burned out. I ordered a new adapter I'm sitting waiting...
4,I have an iPhone and this charger just doesn’t do the job.  I check to see that it is in charge mode and 4 hours later not much has happened (possibly charged 25%).  One night nothing.  Also the blue glow light is too bright to be in a bedroom at night.  It’s not worth sending back so it will be trashed.
5,Works great ordered first one and FedEx delivered elsewhere I contacted customer service and they sent another one which I did receive and it works great!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It charges great and I love the ease of just setting your phone down on it without having to plug it in or worrying about your phone not charging because there was king in the end of your charging port… BUT I wouldn’t keep this on your bedside table unless you enjoy a blue light flashing in your face all night like a lighthouse.The video doesn’t do it’s brightness justice.
5,I bought this a week ago and I have to say it doesn't disappoint. I am always a little shocked at how small the circle is. The diameter is about half the size of my phone so it always feels a little weird putting my phone on it but for the money it's good. You can see the outer edge of the circle light up when it's charging correctly which is helpful. Sometimes I don't line my phone up properly so it doesn't get charged. Also when it's fast charging my phone actually tells me that it's fast wirelessly charging which I love.
3,Bought it so I could charge my phone overnight on my bedside table as we dumped our land line and I could not hear my cell when charging downstairs.About half the time it quits charging far short of a full charge when left overnight on this charger.  Second one I had both same problem one both Apple & Samsung phones.  Two other wireless chargers we have work fine.
5,The charger works great with my new iPhone 13 charges quickly
5,Great Item for multiple items to be charged!  So great I bought a second one for work.  Highly recommend.
5,Sits on a side table and is unobtrusive. Just put my phone on it and it starts charging. So happy I got a second one for my wife to use where she sits
4,This was an alternative charging port when the charging port jack wouldn't work.  Charges in reasonable time.  I never give 5 stars.
3,Like that it is a fast charger; however making sure the phone is properly aligned can be painful.  I think having lighting to show that it is charging is good; however it is so bright it is like a nightlight in your face when it is on the nightstand.  When you remove it from the nightstand the light gets even brighter for a few moments before going out.  Not sure why.  Will probably look at getting another charger for my room and place this one in the spare bedroom with the other one.
4,This works perfectly with most models however when I traded my iPhone 11 in for the iPhone 13 MINI it no longer worked. I suspect the Magnetic charging area on the "mini" is too small to work with this fast charger. The company was great to work with and I was able to resolve the issue to my satisfaction. I do recommend this product however just not for a "mini".
5,Bought two. One for adult son and one for our home. Very easy to use. Plug-in and lie your phone on the pad. Fast charging and worth the money. Would buy the same product again.
5,Works well. When using an iPhone pay attention because phone can get hot.
4,I have a smartish iPhone case and it does not work with it on. Works on other phone with a thinner case.
4,I liked the charger but it is now already dead and of no use. Will not buy again.
4,It's easy to disconnect and uncharged my phone at night. It took forever to charge my phone. I will need to buy another one for sure.
5,One out of three unit stop working within two months of light usage contacted the seller. They replaced the defective unit promptly.
4,It’s very small and easy to travel with. Chargers well
5,GOOF
3,It says USB-C. The connector on the device is USB-C but the cable that they supply is USB-C to USB-A. The suggested power adapter is USB-C so I bought one but it doesn’t work with the supplied cable
5,Affordable great product!
5,So easy to just set the phone on
3,I like that I don’t have to plug it into the phone but it takes a few times for it to connect because mine is set crooked. They may not all be the same as mine but that’s my luck. The cord is short for most locations but I can see where less cord can be good for drawer connections.
5,Love this!  I use everyday and charges my phone fast.
5,its very slow and sometimes not charging my phone
3,The fabric covered one is handsome and works acceptably well. It has a certain color which it lights up while charging and then it changes to another color when fully charged. But the light never turns off! So if you charge your phone at night beside your bed there is a bright light which cannot be adjusted.So for those of us who sleep in the dark this is a day use charger. For those of you looking for a nice night light this is your charger.
4,This wireless charger definitely works faster on my Pixel 6 than the other 2 I have but it gets pretty hot.  I'm not saying it would or wouldn't start a fire but it gets warm enough to concern me that I won't leave my phone charge unattended.
5,So I got this product because it was in sale on prime day.  I have a Samsung s21. I was about to return it because I thought it didn't work because my phone was taking 1 hr 40 at 50% to charge. But I was mistaken.I looked at the directions and it said you needed a 3.0 adapter. Thankfully I had one. I had this one or you can buy a similar one. I'm putting the link here.Quick Charge 3.0 Wall Charger... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081YGKGJZ?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_shareAs soon as I plugged it in the wall with the plug and wall adapter and placed my phone on top of the wireless charger the time went down to charge. It went from 1 hr 40 to 40 mins . Make sure you have fast wireless charging turned on.Hope this review helps. Just make sure you buy a quick charger plug like listed above.
5,easy use great for travel
5,I have really enjoyed this charger thus far. I've had it for about a month and use it almost every day. It looks nice on my office desk and charges faster than I imagined. I have an iPhone 13 Pro and it will charge about 1% per minute based on my experience. I haven't timed it but that's about what it seems like.No complaints at all.
4,Works as expected and charges well. It's also padded and doesn't scratch up your device. It's not the best choice for travel as it's a bit large but it's size makes it easier to use at home sitting on the corner of a desk.
5,I got it got my wife and she loves it
3,Product was unable to charge my S20 Ultra with my UBPro case on. It would charge if phone was placed face down or case removed but not face up with case on. Small and light may work well for those without cases on phone or less rugged cases.
4,It charged fast but I had to keep unplugging and plugging it back in for it to work then it just gave up altogether after 3 months or so.
4,Not as fast as I would have liked but it works and is very convenient.
5,So nice to not have to make sure everything is attached properly. Just lay phone on charger and it charges quickly. Amazing!
3,I'm a bit biased since I hate these things.  I hate having to take my case off just to charge.I needed to purchase this after my last phone became defective and stopped being able to charge via plug.  It wasn't a fast charger.  You have to put the phone on it the right way or it won't charge properly.It's FINE for a backup but I'd rather stick to the plug.
5,What a great thing--to not have to plug in; a very welcome change to things.
3,#1  Not sure how you can say superfast charging.  Charging is based on the power block used and there is not one included with this product it is simply a charging pad with ..#2 Way too much flashy flashy.  When tryin to sleep with phone on the charger its like being in a 70s disco  the LEDs are out of control just give me a green its charging  No green BTW doe not mean charging it means something in range best I can tell.  Blue is actually charging and maybe more flashing means fast... not really sure why it has to pulsate so much maybe I am just sleep deprived.#3 the only reason I gave it a 3 star rating is that it actually does charge through the case I purchased. unless you turn it upside down to avoid the lights.
3,constantly reconnectingRefunded
3,Samsung Galaxy S22 ultra was charged fully in about two hours. Great little wireless charger for that but regardless of what I tried and was advertised it wouldn't charge my galaxy buds+. Exactly two months later and it actively DRAINS whatever I put on it with no change in the device or cord. It was 15 bucks though.
4,Is it normal for a repetitive beeping noise to be coming from this charger? Kinda scaring me
3,I like this charge as it doesn’t take up much space on my night stand and very light weight. However it’s not really a fast charger. Good for an overnight charge.
4,It is not a high quality wireless charger but it does charge the phone.
5,I have 5 of these all over my house now  love them!
3,If you're charging overnight while you sleep  this works just fine.  If you're looking for a quick charge  it's very slow.
3,Good:1) Checked it against several competitor models for my S21 Ultra plus another older phone - same charging speed as competitors given the same type of cable and wall charger for testing.2) Loved how it turns blue and green to signal charging and completion and errors (around the entire device) - the light does not turn off but what I really like it that I can tell it made a good connection with extreme ease (unlike some others that have dim or hidden lights that show behind your phone unless you are very specific about how the phone is laying. I want to just throw my phone on the charger and not worry about rotating my phone a few degrees to see the charging light underneath). Good job here.3) Nice and thin but this could also be a downside...Bad1) I couldn't get over how very very cheap this felt. It was very light like a little plastic saucer. The other chargers I had felt solid. So it's very thin and probably shouldn't be banged around at all. For this reason I'm returning the device. Plus it's almost $20 and there is much better pricing for "cheap" chargers out there to charge just as fast a S21 phone with the included cables.
5,I rarely have to use it but if I need a charge this one is quick and on my desk.
5,Would purchase again.
3,My only issue is my device stops charging in the middle of the night and if I don't reposition it it will not continue to charge
3,Not a Fast charge
3,Too small. If the phone is not exactly centered it doesn’t charge.
3,Charges without removing my case but takes a while (perhaps due to case?) have not tried to charge iPhone 13 without case. Compact and great for travel.
4,A little trouble at first with the mini USB plug into the unit but now all seems well.  Seems a bit slower than a standard wall-wart charger but I use it for overnight charging which works great especially since I place a plug cover in my charging port to keep out dirt/dust/liquids.
3,It’s not working. I bought it on may 2022…I am not satisfied with this product. Sorry!
5,Really hood charging pad. Not as fast as some but it gets the job done and it looks good.
4,works fine
3,Does not always fast charge
3,Works ok most the time but there are times it don’t charge when I wake up. I always make sure it is centered and charge icon appears.
4,Nice and compact.  Very flat design.  However I would not say it's fast charging.  Does work though with Samsung galaxy classes as well as rechargeable earbuds.  Still good for the value.
2,This charger was purchased to enable wireless charging of an IPhone SE model.  I noticed that when I took the phone off the charger it was physically quite warm.  After using the charger for several weeks I found that it would only charge to about 80% and stay very warm the rest of the time with the phone not charging.  I am concerned that the extended exposure of elevated temperature is bad for the phone’s battery and will shorten its life.  Dumping this device for something better.
3,Doesn't charge as fast as I thought it would
5,Extremely fast charge for my iPhone 8+ 25% to full charge in a little over an hour
4,Not the fastest charger but does the job. Nice to take for traveling
5,I was pretty skeptical about this charger mainly because I’ve never own a wireless charge before. It works great charges relatively quickly and is very compact. Im satisfied with it’s performance also i find it a rather economic option.
4,This is a really good charger for travelling but it get really hot when I try charging my phone which is Samsung Note 8.
5,My elderly father bought a cell phone that didn’t support Qi-charging so I bought a Wi-receiver and this 20W pad. IT IS AMAZING. This is a great buy; I would highly recommend to friends and family.
4,Slim lightweight Wireless charger.Charges great LED ring lights is just extremely bright at night. I would consider it to be brighter than a normal room night light.
4,Nothing really to complain about it works fine looks good but it's really light weight and feels cheap.
3,For months I have had problems with USB cables dying and no longer useful. I previously purchased a pad charger but it made my phone hot and took forever to charge my phone. BUT it did offer a wall plug for power. This charger is nice and big and has colorful indicators that it is operating. The problem I have is the power source for this is a USB cable. So why do I need this when its a USB cable as my others? I wish it had a wall  plug as USB adapters for wall plugs get very hot itself. I'm disappointed.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             DO NOT CHARGING TOO LONGThis charger easy to get hot.I bought two charger one for home and one in office. The one in office I not using frequently. But for the one at home I see the problem when you put your phone on too charging about 30 min it's start to get hot. And after using forabout a month it have the burn mark easy too see on charging surface like the video.
4,Nice
3,With my iPhone It does not charge as fast as published very disappointed with the product
3,Love the charging speed and the fact that there's no plugging and unplugging the phone but VERY much dislike the fact that the phone is almost too hot to pick up after a few hours on this charger.  Really bummed as the idea of not having to plug the phone every time it needed charged was pretty appealing.
2,Bought this wireless charger for Pixel 6 Pro as site lists it at 20watt charging power.  IT IS NOT!  left phone on unit for 5 hours only charged 28%PHONE SLIDES OFF CHARGER! DOESNT STAY ON CHARGER DUE TO GLASSY FINISH  definitely a guarantee of destroying your phone..Even put wireless charger on a 30w PPS wall plug and phone's cord..4 hrs and not even 40% charge....🤬Returning!
2,First it's very finicky with cases. I have both an otterbox and a speck for my Samsung s20+ and it only likes my speck case (I have to remove the plastic shell from my otterbox to get that one to work).Second the light is SO bright so this isn't ideal for a nightstand situation. Okay if you're using at work or in the living room but not if you're trying to sleep.Third my phone has super fast charging capabilities and unfortunately this charging pad charges at the same speed that the snail crossing my front mat moves. 1 hr 15 mins to go from 89% to 100%. If you want a full charge you might as well leave it on the pad for the entire day because that's at least a 4 hour job.I wish I could like this product more-upsides are that it does look and feel nice was cheap it works with a variety of phones and it does serve its essential purpose of charging (mind you super slowly) but I would rather have spent a few dollars more for a pad that actually does fast charge my phone.Last there are a few reviewers who state that it does fast charge their devices so it's possible maybe I just got a dud. Who knows? It will be going straight to our kids for their devices since they charge those overnight and don't need a fast charger.
4,The blue light it’s really annoying at night the product works though. You can’t charge your phone with cases because become hot.
5,Works great but my phone keeps sliding off
2,Got my lg thinq 7 hot and after aprox 60 days stopped responding to phone any phone all worked on my old wireless charger add says QI sertified but no were on the charger does it say this
4,Charges decent!!No complaints
4,Works well not a fan of the pulsating lights when charging.
3,It is very compact which is a plus but the charging is too slow  using it mainly for overnight charging.
4,I would have given 5 stars if I'd have known it wouldn't work with MY phone.  That was the whole reason for buying it.
5,My husband’s phone charging port is damaged and this charger saved us repair costs! It has worked very well for several months now.
3,Get super hot 🥵 really fast 💨
3,I use a 23 watt Google wireless charger at home. It moves about 1 watt every 4 minutes or so. I bought this thinking it would be just a little slower being 20 watts. I bought this for my work. I plugged it into a 45 watt USB brick not a computer so I know there is enough power being sent to it. This charger takes between 9 and 11 minutes to move the indicator 1 watt. It's considerably slower leading me to believe it's really a tad over rated.
2,Was thinking 20W would charge my android S21 faster than my $5 walmart wireless charger. NOT!!!  literly timed how long each wireless charger would charge my phone. No difference!! This product is a NO GO!!
5,NA
4,It charges my phone fine but not good for the bedroom because the blue ring flashes on and off.  I sleep with my eyes shut but it drives my wife crazy lol.
5,Most QI's seem to be far slower in charging time and a bit finicky on perfect positioning of the phone. It is large enough for most all portable phones albeit looks and feels a bit 'cheap' but at this price-point you can't expect a weighted chrome charge pad either.  Still We haven't experienced problems and for the money is a great buy.
3,Charges well through my thick Pixel 6 case but the led indicator is bright in a dark bedroom and flashes slowly while charging.  I have painted over it and I still had to drape a small cloth over to block the flashing light.
2,Bought this item back in June. I was initially very impressed . Its performance was spectacular with very fast charge times. As time has passed the item already charges slower  and the cheaply made charger port is buggy and it sometimes Doesnt charge properly.
5,Thanks
3,Not powerful enough for my Google pixel 6 pro!  Way to slow!
4,Works good
3,This charger works but not as quickly as two other Qi chargers I own.  While charging its lighted rim continues to flash the entire time an annoyance in a dark room with no option to turn off.
3,Very quick charge. And extremely convenient and met all expectations
4,Takes a while at first but once it's get used ta ya phone it charger a bit faster
3,From my experience you could buy these plate chargers charge them and then they will work to charge your phone you didn’t have to keep it plugged in and that’s very disappointing
2,The power cord that plugs into the side is loose and constantly has to be tightened and wiggled to work. Not sure if I got a bad one but picked up a different make at a clearance store for $10 that works properly and charges more quickly.
2,Easy to use and looks nice. But SO slow to charge! I can leave my phone there overnight and it doesn’t fully charge.
2,Not even close to Anker!  Night and day differences.  Its going back.  No quality.
2,Product charges very fast but gets very very hot. I've tried propping it up for better air flow but it gets almost painfully hot. Makes My phone hot too. I worry it will damage the phone or catch fire.
2,Mine died the first night I used it. I can't give any more details about the product but it was easy to set up. You will need an adapter  for it though.
3,The write up for the charger didn't mention that the ring at the bottom glows bright green and then turns blue when a phone is charging. Not only that but the light brightens and dims continuously until the phone is fully charged.  Be prepared to have your bedroom glowing on and off for hours.
3,It does work but it is not fast charging. It will heat up you phone fast though!
2,Product is not 20watt as advertised
2,This thing started out alright but after a month of use it’s really slowed down. I just put on my 5% phone and here we are at 24% 3 hours later.  That’s not fast for a charger- that’s not even adequate as overnight it seems to not even fully charge.
2,This is a 5W charger plain and simple. I tried numerous different high power USB supplies and i could never get more than 5W.That said it does seem to work fine at 5W and also at 2.5W. The coil is really small so you have to set the device perfectly in the middle too.
1,The Wal Mart brand fast charger I had before this one worked better then this piece of junk. It does fast charge my phone but the phone has to be placed just right or it will only normal charge instead of fast. And anything else that can wireless charge its like playing tetris with this charger to find the right spot to sit it on to get it to work right. The price for this is a sign that its not worth it. There's a lot of cheap stuff on Amamzon and some of its great but not this. Just go to Wal Mart and by their Onn brand fast charger for 25.That's what I'm going to do the next time I get paid. Update: I went to Five Below and bought an 8 dollar 10w charger and it works better then this one. Save your money and don't but this.
3,This wireless charger charged through the case until it stopped working. I have to move my phone multiple times to get it to charge. On the charging pad the blue light indicates when the charger is available and green when in use. Unfortunately other times the light isn't there. This product is alright.
2,I couldn’t use faulty
2,The led light is on constant while charging & is irritating.
2,This charger doesn't charge devices fast for something that claims to be a fast charger
2,I have a 10w morphine that charges twice as fast it's extremely thin and light if dropped would probably shatter
3,It does accept a variety of adapters that range from 5W to 20W but you only get the max output of your adapter. The cord doesn’t tightly into its socket ver well and requires a wiggle to make a connection. Other than that it works fine.
2,Think twice about purchasing this device. The first time I plugged it in it worked fine. Sensed when I put my phone on it and charged it quickly. Ever since that first use though I've had to unplug it and plug it back in to get to work. Sometimes when a device is put on it the phone will 'ding' letting you think it will charge but in fact it isn't. When you pick the phone up you'll find it at the same battery level as before or just a bit more and the phone/airpods will be warm. You may want to consider a different manufacturer or model.
3,Bought this charger it worked awesome for a month then it went out definitely didn’t last very long
5,This charger is perfect-it doesn’t take much room and is easy to use
3,The slow flashing light while charging is ridiculously bright for sleeping. It was blinding on the night stand. Even on the floor it lit up and flashed the ceiling and walls so I had to put it under the bed with a slipper on it. Also the the circuit board inside rattles when you move the charger or put a phone on it which gives it a cheap feel. I fixed both problems by taking it apart (4 screws under the rubber feet) and taping the board down with electrical tape making sure to cover the LEDs.
2,This thing worked for 2 wks then stopped charging :(
5,It works as stated
5,Love it. I recieved this as a Christmas gift. Liked it so much that I looked it up and bought another one for my husband. The only negative thing I have to say is that it doesn't include the actual plug in just the cord and you must supply your own plug. But I think that's pretty standard with a lot of chargers 🤷‍♀️ I just robbed the plug from my old charger and it wasn't a big deal.
4,It works really well for our cell phones. But it doesn’t work for tablet or my husband Samsung watch.
2,I returned my charging pad because it needed to be unplugged and reset constantly.  The lights would come on and the phone would start to charge but wouldn't stay charging and did not recognize the phone again without removing the power cable and starting over.  I mainly wanted it on a nightstand to do overnight charging of a Galaxy S20.  Too bad that it didn't work.  The cord could be a little longer but they need to work on their QA to make the charging pad worth anything to anyone.  Find a different model that is more reliable.
2,It di not charge well.  It took a long time.
5,Awesome and love it
3,I like this charger but you have to get it just so or it only looks like it's charging.  It has to blink only blue.  Green for some counter-intuitive reason means something is wrong and it isn't charging.  I was hoping to keep this on my night table but it's lit the whole time it's charging.  It stops charging when the phone is full and then turns green.  Many nights I reach over and knock it off the charger if I see green.  For this reason and the finicky alignment for proper charging are the three stars.  Otherwise it works.
3,I tried to use a 15W charger that comes with a galaxy s20 fe but  it didn't get the fast charge just slow charge don't know why.  Next try was with a 20w charger from an iPad 4 air  it didn't work.  The only ones that worked correctly were a pair of 10W charger from a galaxy S10.
2,Its a little convenient...but charges slow... full charge with my phone charger is less than 2 hrs... this one is over 4 hours or more
5,Muy practico y lindo
2,Charges our phones well but WOW who thought a bring pulsing light was a good idea?The phone lets us know that it's charging why would we need perpetual feedback from the pad itself?Can't even sharpie over the light - it's crazy bright in the evenings.
5,Google Pixel 6 works great
5,I highly recommend this charger.  So easy to use.  Just lay your phone on it and let it charge.  So much better than the charging cord that came with the phone.
2,I needed a charger that fast charges wirelessly. This one had a lot of reviews saying it worked great and it's supposed to be 20 watts. This charger does not fast charge. I doubt it's more than 9watts.  It takes just as long to charge as the $3 wireless charger I bought my husband at the dollar tree. Worst thing about this charger....once your phone is fully charged the charger shuts itself off and even with my phone sitting on the dumb thing all night I wake up to a phone with 33%. Don't buy this. Spend more get a good one. This one is awful. Total waste of money.
5,Charge everything
5,Meets expectations
3,The fast charge AC adapter that is promoted as brought with product is not compatible. It is usb c and the cable provided is usb a to usb c. LUCKY I have other cables.
5,I really like the size of this product. The charging power is awesome. And it fits in any travel bag and doesn’t take up any room
3,The charger will not wake up with initial contact. You have to move the phone around on the disk for it to turn on. I’m a little hesitant to leave it on the charger very long as the phone gets hot fast during charging.
2,It works an all but no different from a Walmart bran one you can get for less then 10$
4,Aesthetic and efficient.  Easy to install and use. The light is bright and it works well. But it only works with the cord it came with. No other charger cable can be used even original Samsung!
5,Easy to use
5,We got it for a elderly friend and he loves it.
3,No me agrado lo de los colores mientras esta cargando y que ocasionalmente no carge.
4,Needs to be very precisely placed and didn’t want light-up charger! Charging with a phone case makes charging for my personal plans less than effective!.
4,Charging power: Make sure you check and see what it will charge on your device. Doesn’t charge 20 watts on every device. Only charges at 7watts on my iPhone 11 Pro
2,It gets really hot and won't charge all the way
5,Great for travel
5,So far so good. Charges better and faster with case off. Very simple to use
2,It doesn't charge as fast as it advertised on a galaxy Note 20 Ultra it take about 2 to 2 and half hours to fully charge the cell.
5,Perfecto equipo mis recomendaciones
5,Has not burned up my phone so that is a good thing.  It seems to do a good job charging.
2,Takes forever to charge.
5,Works right out of the box.
2,Like: Simple setup. Easy to use.Dislike: Inconsistent detection of phone. Works after restart.
5,Charges quickly for wireless. Works great with iPhone and Android phones. Very pleased with this. Will buy another for other rooms.
2,Too slow
1,This charger did so much damage to our Iphone 12.  It made our Iphone really hot and that went on intermittently within a span of week.  Now this afternoon when we were charging and after the charging was finished we find out that due to being hot the back screen on the iphone is cracked.  We have not stepped out of the house for past day and the phone was inside its protective cover and never dropped and yet the back screen is cracked in a design format.  This is a huge setback for us since the back screens cost a lot to replace is what we are finding out.  Cannot believe a wireless charger could do this type of damage.  This should be banned from selling anywhere.
5,Easy to use.
5,Used it for iPhone 12Works great
5,It charges fast
5,Great little charger with cool lighting!  You can't beat this for the money! My only little suggestion is to have the option to turn off the lighting at night ...
3,Claims in the advertising that it worked for high speed charging mode on the Samsung Galaxy Series. I own a new S21 plus plus it will not work in fast charging mode. Thank you.
5,My husband’s iPhone charging no longer worked but he didn’t want to have to buy a new phone as the phone actually works. Now it can charge and works great!
5,Es bien funcional porque puedes cargar varios celulares a diferentes tiempos
2,I bought this appliance to charge my phone in the car.It works for 5 minutes then shuts down.I have had it a few months and have tried to use it elsewhere but the same problem.
5,Bought it for my wife; it charges her Galaxy S9 Plus just fine.  No more searching for a charging cable and charger.  No more risk of damaging her phone's charhing port either.
2,The item is very light and feels cheap.  I tried chargingy Samsung watch and it got burning hot.  When charging my s22+ sometimes it won't charge or complete the charge after hours of charging.  The phone gets super hot also.
5,It is very easy to get the charge to contact.
5,This charger works well for my Samsung S22 Ultra. So far I have not had any problems with it. It lights up while charging so some people won't like it as a bedside charger.
3,Do not charger fast
5,Perfect chargee wireless very wasy ttonuse and move it with me.
5,It charges rapidly. I love it.
5,Love everything about it
2,This charger was fine while it lasted but it was purchased as a Christmas present for my son.  He has been using it daily since Christmas.  Over the last few weeks his phone began to charge more slowly and now it won’t charge at all.  Neither will his AirPods. So in less than 2 months the unit is dead.  There is also no information about a warranty on the website and it is past the return window because it was purchased before Christmas since it was a present. I do not recommend.
1,Ive never given a product 1 star but this charger is junk.  The first couple days it worked fine charged quickly and efficiently.  Since then its been totally sporadic was on the charger for 45 minutes and it did not charge it all.  then it worked the next time.  then next 2 times it took 2 plus hours to charge it from 50% to 100%.  Do not waste your money unfortunately I threw away the box and packaging after I used successfully it the first couple times so i wont be returning it.  Going to have research out a new charger now
3,As for a quick charger it does okay however item is very sensitive and you have to be on Center had a couple of issues where item would go off and not turn back on oh till it's unplugged and replugged overall for the price it's a decent by
5,I like this charger it is easy-to-use and charges fast
5,Love it
2,Worked well for a few weeks… now it no longer is charging my phone… don’t buy this piece of junk!!
4,very easy to use worth the price
5,Product performs as expected
5,i love the charger it looks fancy elegant and it charges very fast the google pixel 6 pro. It is a really nice product for the price that I paid. It arrives very fast! Great value product. Thank you!
2,This charger quit working after only one month. I would NOT RECOMMEND to anyone!!
5,Have several and even use one in my SUV. Works really well!
5,love it
5,It works well
1,I was looking for a phone charger but this guy actually did the opposite and stole my battery and my time. I gave it many chances to prove me wrong but it turned out to be a really bad buy and cost me battery and money . Oh well  too good to be true .
3,I ordered this for travel.  When I got the package it was obvious that it was either used or returned.  It seems to work fine and for the price I really can’t complain but when you order a new item it should really be new
1,Charging my iPhone 12 Mini I'm constantly warned that charging has been halted due to iPhone overheating.  My theory is that this is an issue with the wireless charger itself being so slim it is unable to disperse its own heat properly causing the phone itself to heat up and not receive charge.  Another explanation would be that the quality of this charger is so low it just runs way too hot.My phone works perfectly fine on other wireless chargers this one is just awful.  I can put it on the charger for an hour and gain 3%.Buy something else spend a little extra money don't be cheap like me!
3,It does not fast charge my 21 ultra.
5,It charges my I Phone over night and no need to plug anything in just place and your done.
3,It is a wireless charger but it is not a fast wireless charger.
5,Nice charger for my phone. Works great with the OnePlus adapter.
5,Works fast
5,I can't wait until everything is charged wirelessly.
2,Not a fast charger..
2,works good the first day but when I try to charge the phone again it only charge it half way kind of give out when it was charging
2,Did not likemade phone over heat.
2,Cables kept breaking after 6 months or so so I decided to buy this and go wireless. But it charges so slow. Like 5% an hour.
2,Bought these because of the ratings unfortunately 1 of the chargers do not work ans the other takes 3 hours to charge from 50%.
2,The size is very large for iPhone 13 - have to fiddle around to sweet spot to charge.  Because it is not magnetic any movement to table or chord will move it away from charging zone.  Waste of $$$.
1,Bought this to charge my phone that supports up to 50w wireless charging. Confirmed that 15w and 20w are supported by the phone. On the wireless charger it only reads max of 180mA charging. Plug the cable directly from the charger into the phone and it reads max of 1580mA.Other reviews say it takes forever clearly it's mis-labeled and only supports 1w wireless and that's it.
5,Didn’t seem to work fast and didn’t hold a charge well
2,Would quit charging after 5 to 10 min. I unplugged it and plugged back in and it would charge another 5 to 10 min. and quit again.
1,This charger does not charge anything. I have followed the included instructions done every single thing change the charger attached changed everything and it will flash green and only stay on which means that it's attempting to charge but it only stays on for 5 seconds then turns off. Whichever way you position your device the charger does not charge. This is definitely a junk product and you should not waste your time or money on this product.
1,Only works when I unplug it and plug it back in.  I’ve checked all the connections and they seem tight?HELP am I doing something wrong?  It’s pretty self explanatory.Hoping someone can contact me and give me suggestion.  I don’t want to return if not necessary.
1,This thing runs hot very hot it causes my phone to run hot which will ruin the phone battery it was also draining my phone probably because of the heat. I would love to have a refund but I probably won't get it.
1,Is NOT compatible for any of the Devices that I have within my house. I wasn't aware that there was a method to checking whether or not it was compatible because on Amazon it said it would be. I would have given it a 0! Because my Samsung Galaxy A03 wasn't compatible. My tablet Leveno Tablet my kids Oon Tablet and my boyfriend's Moto G Power DOES NOT CHARGE IT!!!BE SURE BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!!! Or else you'll be sitting here like me deciding whether to return it or keep it until you can afford a phone that does charge it... smh
3,Charges my phone but seems to only wanna charge it to 70% it won’t charge the rest of the way.. so kinda disappointed In this charger.
5,works fine
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Este producto me parece muy práctico es bastante delgado y sirve muy bien para carga rápida…recomendado.
5,I was curious so I purchased it.  I am impressed with its performance so far.  It gives my phone a full charge in less than 2 hours.  This is a game changer.
5,Love how fast it charges. Not as fast as a cord but I love it.
1,I have bought 2 of these wireless chargers at the same time and both have quit working after 3 months. I have tried to contact the FDGAO store but there is no place for product or customer support. Don't waste your money.
5,Es muy buen cargador me gusta que cuando pones el teléfono prende una luz alrededor y se apaga cuando lo quitas. Lo recomiendo
3,👍👍👍
1,I will start with the likes for the product.  Easy to use; lightweight and nice cost.Now for the dislikes. It only charged my iPhone and then It stopped working in less than a week.
5,Makes charging easier.
5,Fast. Notice phone position not quite as picky as my last one. light shows you got it sitting right. works fine through my speck case
2,When I first bought this charger it took my phone and charged it whenever I set it down on the charger. Now the phone has to be in the perfect position to work. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to get it just right and it's frustrating. The old adage you get what you pay for applies here. I gave up and bought a regular old school charger. Bummer...
5,Love it
2,For the money it charges things. However it doesn’t come with a power adapter for the wall and states that in order to use the “speed charging” features of the product be sure to have a speed charging adapter. You get what you pay for I suppose.
2,No mucho es muy lento para cargar
5,Much better than my previous  charger.  New phone has bigger battery 20watts charges fast. Large pad makes it easier to mate charging loopslarge blue ring charging indicator is easy to see when charging color changes when chargedOrdered a second one for wife
2,I leave my phone on this thing overnight and it never charges over 60%. It also has the pulsing light on throughout its attempt to charge. It should time out after a bit of time. Seems nice but it doesn't work nearly as well as it should.
5,Works great for me. Use it everyday at work. No issues at all.
5,I really like this product. It charges quickly and without problems I worry about its durability as I have to schlep fro location to location at work and must put it in a canvas bag and carry it around. So far it’s been 3 weeks without a hitch
2,Too cheaply made not enough power.
5,Charge fast easy plug in great price
5,small easy to install easy to use
5,Item charges my iPhone XR quickly. Great price.
5,It works great but if I’m on a video call while it chargers then my phone overheats
1,I have this charger for almost two months . I charge at night for at least 8 hours. I have an iPhone XR. Sometimes the phone is completely charged and some times only 80%.There are times when I set my phone on the charger and it will not charge at all. Lights will not come on. I have to unplug the charger wait a few minutes the plug it back into work.Just not a good charger.  I will be looking for something different
5,I haven’t timed it but it charges my S22 pretty decent. I like the choice of fabric material w/charing led.
1,I bought 2 of these in June. I kept one at my office desk and one in my car. It is August and both of them are no longer able to maintain a connection consistent enough to actually charge any of my devices. Was great when it was working.
1,I have a fast charging block and fast charging wire and this doesn't fast charge. It gets HOT after 15min and triggers phone and smart watch safety heat features that disable charging.It also makes my watch glitchy in a way my original charger didn't. It turns on/off AO and airplane back and forth and stops charging after 10 min. Returning
2,I returned this item after a couple of days it doesn't charge fast at all I would have to say it barely charged after 3 hour I like the concept just not this one
5,Great
3,It doesn't quick charge
1,Worked for a few charges (albeit very slowly) and now it doesn't work at all! Conveniently as soon as the one month warranty ended it stopped working :/
3,I was having problems getting the regular phone charger to stay in. Like it because it's flat.
2,Perhaps my item arrived defective but the truth is that it charges as slowly as a 5-watt charger that I have.Im talking based in my own experience I thought that I would get a powerful and faster charger It was not so.Long story short I’ll return it.
2,I bought this specifically to use as a hidden wireless charger in a desk. The seller advertises 6mm of transmit distance using paper sheets I can only get 2 mm with my phone case on.  Comparing this to the Costco purchased ubioulabs charger where with the same test I get over 8mm of transmit distance.  Now that means this device is more energy efficient but it does not meet the add or my desired behavior I will keep this one as my desk top charger and use the other ubiolabs for my desired purpose.
2,It works if you place the phone just right… like I though just placing the the phone on and it would work. You have to get just right or you may not wake up to you alarm…
1,I only used it once. It charged good. But after that. I tried to charge my phone while I was in bed. When I woke up. It said 32 % charged ( IT WAS AT 65% WHEN I WENT TO BED). So it was draning my battery on my phone. I went back to my chargering cord. I am really dissatisfied with this charger. DON'T BUY THIS CHARGING STATION.  IT WORKS ONCE THEN DRAINS YOUR BATTERY.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 At first I was loving it but it stopped working flashing blue and green and a little mark appear on it
5,Needs charger box
1,This thing worked for two weeks and stopped working.Unfortunately my son never told me it was not working until after the “return window” was closed.I guess that you get what you pay for it.Stay away !!!
1,We bought multiple of these charging pads. At first they were great. Super easy to use and the colors are an added bonus. But now none of them charge. I can put a phone on all night and it will gain maybe 2% even though connected. Super disappointing.
1,I thought this was a 20w mag safe charger… it isn’t as it only plugs into a lower lever brick and takes longer to charge than plug in.  Doesn’t work with cases even if they are MagSafe.
5,easy to use and charges fast may get very hot though so may need to be checked on from time to time otherwise worth it.
1,Bought this to charge my new phone and it seemed to work for a short while but no longer charges my phone while I sleep at night. Disappointing…
5,I liked the light change colors to let me know it was charging
5,product as advertised. looks great fast charging good value
1,Do not buy this a cheap piece of trash. The quality is of something you would pay 1.99 at a swap meet. Everytime I set my phone on it it sounds like the plastic will break. It charges very slow.
5,Best charger I own now. I have a thick case with a ring on the back for my Samsung s21 and it still charges. I does take a second or two sometimes to get it to start but most Can't charge with my case like this and it's fast. I will be buying more.
1,All this does is make my phone hot. My phone sat at 25% charged for 10 minutes straight. Not good at all. Don’t want waste your money.
1,This charger stopped charging my phone after about only a week.  Now my phone will not work on other wireless chargers.
5,It didn’t work as expected
5,so far been working great and phone is always ready
1,I like the way it looks but both of them stop charging and tweak out after putting phone on it to charge. This happens within minutes of putting phones to charge.
5,It charges fast  I like it very much
1,Power cord didn’t make a connection. I had to hold our own cord in place for it to even light up and as soon as you release pressure it turned of. Seemed like a great deal and I loved the design but we had to return it.
5,Great charger works well.
1,Bought 2 of these and neither lasted 3 months.  Seemed ok at first but both stopped working after 2 months
5,Very easy to set up and use!!!
5,I like it a lot. It exceeds my expectations
1,This thing works but it takes forever to charge since it didn't come with a fast charging block. I'll put it on this pad when I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning it hasn't made it to 100% yet THAT'S HOW SLOW IT IS
2,Very very slow charge. My plug in chargers are faster.
1,This charging station is the worst and takes forever for your phone to charge. It will make your phone overheat which will stop charging. I truly regret buying it.
5,on time delivery. works great
3,Not a fast charger. It keep bounce the charging in and out. But it is nice and sleek and easy to use.
5,Great charger !
1,Slow charging 😒.. it's hot 🔥 and worse thing about it is now I CANT use a USB to charge my phone! Idk if this product damaged something very DISAPPOINTING! DON'T PURCHASE
2,This charger worked great for the first month but now it charges for the first 10 minutes or so then stops.  Hardly works anymore.
2,Very easy to use. But I don’t fill it charges my phone very fast .I have a I phone 11 and it charges it kind of slow but it is nice if not in hurry
5,Good one for Android and apple phones
1,Did not work at all for my Note 20. Wouldn't even begin to charge it. Went backwards as a matter of fact.
1,Me gusto q es fácil de usar pero noCumple con el la velocidad de carga que indica que es 20 w
5,We have 2 of these chargers one upstairs and one downstairs.  They work very well and charge quickly both my Samsung and 2 of my wife's iPhone.
1,Did not like product! Requires a 5V wall adapter. Buy a charger that is complete with all operating parts!
5,Excellent product purchased two of them and charge my iPhones android with no problems
2,Does not work with an iPhone 12Pro with a Quadlock case on. It does however with with my Airpods case an my old iPhone 8 with a Lifeproof Frē case. Not working for my main phone sucks. Wish Amazon would sell the Letscom 15W again. I have about 6 of those work great for every device I have. Will be buying more of those on Walmart unless they carry them again soon.
1,Charger came by itself in plastic bag.  No cable no instructions and no box!
5,works great doesn't overcharge
2,Doesn't change fast.
5,I love this charging pad it's the first one that charges my Samsung S21 Plus at full power!
5,These are awesome  worked fantastic  I was really  impressed  I wanted to switch my head light  assembly  to projector  but this really  did the trick.  So much  so I bought  a send set.
5,First wireless charger experience but wow this is so easy! Fast charging color changes to green when fully charged and shuts off automatically.  Definitely a great purchase.
2,Description says it will charge through case but this is not always the situation.  Must find the exact position or no charging will occur.  I have though of returning it several times.  I would prefer a charger with a permanently attached electrical cable that plugs directly into a wall outlet instead of a C to USB cable then to USB plugged into the wall outlet.
2,I have no idea how this product work I cannot give it a good review or a bad review. It did not work with my phone so I had to return it to Amazon
1,After hours plugged in it hardly charged my iPhone. Big waste of $$
2,Charges very fast but charger gets exceptionally hot. So much that I couldn't pick it up after phone had been on it for an hour. It even transmitted significant heat to the phone which I removed before it overheated and stopped charging. Will try again later after both have cooled.
2,I like the Style of it.I dislike the no Fast Charge.
1,Stopped charging my phones after 2 days of use. Almost over heated my first night using it.
1,Two months after purchase (one month past return time) and now the charger only powers the phone to 25%
2,Great price but I thought I was getting a “FAST” charge. This charges very slow
1,The power port broke within a couple days. Even when it worked it charged slower than my other 10w charger. Very cheaply made product that does not live up to its description of being a “fast” charger
1,Never got to use it came missing cable with no contact or suport info at website
1,This is a piece of garbage. Don't waste your time. Even the whole return process isn't worth it.
1,I bought 2 and neither of them worked on my iphone 13 Pro Max my mom's iphone 11 or my daughter's android.
1,Recently got a Pixel 6 that is rated for 25w charger. This thing is garbage. Got so hot I had to take my phone off of it after about 20 minutes. No additional charging happened during that time.
5,I use this charger in my office at home. It fits on my desk easy to use and charges quickly. Charges my Android with the case on! I am satisfied with my purchase and may order a second one!
1,Very disappointed in this charger.  It will not stay on long enough to give my iPhone a full charge.  I'm not a fan.
1,SOOOOoooo cheaply made.This is something you might win at a low budget carnival. Almost worked a couple of times then just quit.Poor soldering poor connections poor material.I envision four year olds cobbling this crap together in some 3rd world country.SO MUCH SUCK!SO MUCH FAILURE!
1,Worked great for a month then stopped charging. Not worth it.
1,Is it very crappy it takes a day and a half to fully charge your phone it’s a waste of money I don’t recommend it
2,Doesn't always connect; charging is sometimes fast sometimes slow ... inconsistent! Have stopped using
2,I didn’t realize the the phone case had to come off to charge!
5,I’m always happen when a product works as advertised.
1,The style of The product But it doesn’t charge my iPhone XR. I have left it on the charger overnight and have less than half a battery by the next day. I wish that this worked I have never gotten something from Amazon that did not work. Do not recommend.
2,Charger works great. Nice to have a high power charger until Google gets their logistics together for the new pixel standBut the LED lights on it are far too bright. At night it lights up my entire bedroom and I can't sleep
2,This heats up and causes the phone to stop charging
1,Muy malo demora en cargar y deja de cargar
2,iPhone cases are too thick for this cannot charge
1,Bought as a gift.  Was used for two weeks then stopped!  Was one day too late to return.
1,Garbage.  Quit delivering a charge after one day.  Just left my phone on it all night last night. Even turned my phone off in an effort to charge faster.  8 hours later I'm at 36%. Worked fantastic first time. 100% in 2-3 hours. Sucked big ones since then.
1,Bought 2 of these. One failed in less than a month. Seller sent me another. That one never worked. Second one from original purchase failed soon after.
5,It’s wireless Chaeging
1,put it beside my bed. worked okay for a few weeks but after about 6 weeks it stopped working. had to throw away because outside the return window.
2,Easy to use but doesn’t charge my phone quickly even with airplane mode with WiFi and Bluetooth turned off.
1,Stopped working after 2 weeks :/
3,Charging is not as fast as it says
1,Sending it back took too long to charge on iPhone and android and got too hot!
5,Just as expected. Quick delivery.
2,It charges just as fast as the 1st gen power bricks.  Disappointed that it was not a rapid charger.  I think if the cord and adapter to charge were different you would get what is advertised.
1,This item stopped working within 2 months of purchase.
5,Hard to find products that still advertise that they work with iPhone8. This one did and I can confirm that it does work with that model of phone.
1,I purposely used it to charge my phone but doesn’t last longer. It is just a waste of my money
1,I was expecting to charge about two times slower than my 40w plug in charger it’s unbelievable how slow it charges takes about 7 hours from sub 10percent to high 80 percent on iPhone 12 Pro Max
1,I’m circle filing both of these. They register as charging the phone we set upon but it takes hours to get maybe 15% (if lucky) since I’m on a boat now so returning is quite hard since there’s no drop off point here. Cheap trash I invested in a Belkin MagSafe charger instead and it’s amazing
1,Did not Always charge even though it said charging on my device.  Also light is distracting at night who wants a constant blinking light when going to sleep?
1,It didn’t work well for one day and then broke entirely on day two
2,Says fast charging but is very very slow. Connect right up with my phone but takes forever to charge. I guess I’ll just stick with a cable!
1,Product has already stopped working and has been used minimal.
1,It didn't charge my phone. It did absolutely nothing but light up
1,Slow to charge and after less than 60 days it will no longer charge!
5,At night there is a little glow so you can fine your phone easy.
1,This charger is advertised as a QI wireless fast charger but it is not QI compatible don't waste your money mine arrived and doesn't work
1,Product charged intermittently. Never fast. And 30 days in- it has stopped working. The only thing it did do well it light up the room with the pulsing blue light… which is not ideal for a bedside charger.  Buy at your own risk. I am contacting them for a refund now. I will update this with the outcome.
1,This product is terrible and I would not recommend purchasing it.
5,Ease to use
1,It worked for a few hours. During which it would say it was charging but extremely slow and even have a high watt charger like it says to use. Drains the phone. Next day it wouldn’t register I put my phone on it at all. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it took 10 minutes before it knew my phone was there. Showed it’s charging but an hour later my phone battery didn’t charge at all and actually drained it and my phone got hot
1,This charger was GREAT to begin with. Sadly it stopped charging my phone after about a month of receiving. Very disappointed. I will NOT purchase this brand again.
5,After purchasing 3 charging docks and never worked for my phone this one is the one fast charging
5,You get exactly what you were promised.  Price is good.  Quality is good.
1,It worked once or twice then totally stopped working.  Waste of money.
1,Maybe I received a defective unit but what a complete piece of junk. Worked intermittently and even then it was not fast charging.
2,False claims and would not recommend.
1,Could it work okay? So long as you don’t mind potentially catching the surface of the charger on fire. So hot you can cook on it. Do not recommend
5,I have one in bedroom next to seating area and in living room for simple and convenient charging stations in my home.
1,I needed a wireless charger since my charging port is broken on my phone. I spent time looking for a charger and came across this one. It stated that it was a fast charger. The first time I used it it was okay. Charged my phone from zero to 100% in a couple of hours. But since then I would have my phone on the charger and it would take 8+ hours to reach a full charge. I was very disappointed in this charger. Also my phone wouldn’t stay on the charger. It’s kept falling off. It also felt cheap when I held it in my hands. Not as strong as a simple one from Walmart. I had to return this charger.
5,Charges fast but sometimes I have to unplug and plug back in to start charge but works perfectly well most of the time.
1,Defective product stopped working after being in use for month and a half.
1,Didn't work.
5,It's great needed an other convenient but fast charger to travel with  love the blue and green lighting while charging from beginning to end.  Ty
5,Best part is that a green ring lights up letting u know Your phone is placed properly for a charging
1,I wanted to love this product but it overheats so badly that I worry that it would start a fire I will not be using this product
1,After less than one month of occasional use and charger no longer works! Don’t waste your time on this one
2,I did not like it the power of the charger is not 20w because it is slow. I expected something better
2,Don't use it at all agent back to the cord it's to slow
1,This charger is light weight and easy to take anywhere. It is advertised as 20 W charger and it only puts out 10W. It is advertised as a fast-charging system it is quite slow charging. This charger stopped working 10 days after I purchased it and after I sent in my first review.
2,It's certainly wireless but charges slower than a regular wireless charger.
1,It doesn't work
2,Slow to charge you have to have it just right. An I think the cords don’t last long if you are active and moving them around from house to car. Also doesn’t work with case on.
5,The charger was delivered quickly. It charges fast. I love it.
5,NO PROBLEM WORKS GREAT SAMSUNG AND IPHONE
1,Charges slow stop charging
5,Works as advertised.
2,While this charger looks well made. It is super slow. Imagine 3hrs and An iPhone 13 was only charged 27%.  If you are look for a fast charger this is not the one.  It will be returned
1,Did not work with any of the 3 phones in the house.
2,I’ve tried using this for a while. Mostly I go get my phone to see it hasn’t been charging the whole time :( A little disappointed
1,Update: it nearly melted my phone! Not exaggerating. Hot to the touch.Original: So it works and connects easily through a thick phone case which is great! But the charge is painfully slow. Genuinely the slowest phone (iPhone XR) charger I’ve ever had. It also has a  VERY bright ring around it that pulsates blue light the ENTIRE time it’s charging. Sleep mask required.
2,Only worked for two days cord keeps falling off.
5,Great value for the money
1,Probably won’t last like most Chinese products
1,Do not buy it it stopped working
1,I have had this for about 2 months and haven't been able to use it doesn't come with the 3.0 wall plug to charge your phone properly. Shouldn't have to buy it separately total waste of money.
2,Would not work on my I-phone 13
2,It did not charge consistently. Sometimes it actually wore down the phone battery and it does not connect to the phone easily.
1,I bought this charger and the first time I used it it worked but my battery heated up in the process. The next time I tried it it did not start charging until I unplugged it then plugged it in again. It worked for a while but then stopped charging again. The next time I tried to charge my phone it didn't work even after unplugging and plugging it back in. I will be returning it
1,After 30 days would sometimes not work. By 60 days it stopped working completely. Too late for any refund of course.
2,This product says it's compatible with iPhone 13 and yes it will charge the phone but it takes HOURS.
1,After 8 weeks of use it fails to charge.
1,no..just no. it literally only worked for a day. now it makes my phone die faster instead of charging it.
1,This wireless charger charged really slowly while also heating up enough to be painful to touch. It is also very finicky needing you to place your phone in the exact right spot
1,Received this yesterday.  iPhone was at 20% power at 8PM last night when I placed it on disk.  Disk was illuminated and appeared to be working as described.  Got up 9 hrs later and iPhone was only at 80% and extremely hot to the touch.  Never using it again.
1,Horrible product if it not on the charger exactly right it will not charge. Will not buy again
1,Don't buy it is a waste of money Stopped working after 40 days no refund as it was 10 days past the return policy  DON'T BUY!!!!!!!! if you do it is your fault!!
1,It’s slow and turns off regularly before charging past 30%
1,Doesn't charge disappointed
5,👍🏻
1,Worked for about a week. I guess you really do get what you pay for... :-(
1,Very slow. You get what you pay for.

5,This charger is great!  Charges quick the power is great! Love love this purchase!
1,Got the pad a few days ago it worked well at first then it just stopped working
1,Charges slower than any charger I've ever used a brand new galaxy s22 ultra takes 6 hours to change on this thing and 1 hour with any other charger not a good buy
1,Samsung S10+Used cord it can with and adapter Samsung have me with phone. Over 2 HR charge time starting with 42%. Not fast charging.
1,It doesn’t charged fast
1,Charging power does not work without a box. If planning on using this for travel for the charging power or how easy it is to use you will be displeased. It is not easy to use. It does not have charging power. Do not purchase this for traveling.
1,The charger worked for 5 weeks and then just quit charging the phone. Do not buy this item.
1,Lo que no me agradó es que solo me sirvió por 5 semanas y no funcionó mas.
2,This didnt work for charging purposes at all. It lights up but nothing more
1,It barely qualifies as a charger it can barely maintain the charge your device was at.
1,Stopped working after 5 weeks and the company will not respond to my request to replace it or refund me.
1,So light fragile. Dosent work all the time. Wake up and have to leave to work with no battery  not good
1,This is a terribly constructed product. Not worth it! You get what you pay for!
1,Did not work
1,Charger stopped working after about 1 week
1,Lo compré cargaba súper lento lo regrese por ups me devolvieron mi dinero y ahora resulta que no lo regrese y me lo van a volver a cobrar  aparte que sus productos son defectuosos quieren su dinero a como de lugar mal servicio que pena
1,I have never been more disappointed with something I have purchased from Amazon. It says fast charging but it says 1 hour and 40 mins till my phone is fully charged when my phone is already at 58%. A normal phone cord estimated time was 56 minuets I don't see the point in this thing DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1,It did not charge fast. While it does charge my phone not at 20w.. no break charger was with it.. it takes 2hrs or more. If not left on right..
1,This charger does not charge my phone any faster then my other pad charger and not only that but it will be charging one minute and not work the next. It’s is also very flimsy and has no grip strips to keep it in place.
1,Poor quality
1,Never charges my phone to 100% over night… very slow to charge! Do not recommend!
1,Ruined SG 21 5G Had on for 5 hours after wards phone would not turn on or charge Insurance claim on phone
1,Two days in a row I awaken to a dead battery on my phone. The blue light was lit indicating it was charging  but my battery was still dead. Sending it back. Do not buy.
5,Excellent fast charging!
1,Was fine while it lasted. Although it is super bright at night lighting up the room when you’re trying to go to sleep. Just stopped working. Had it for about a month and it no longer recognizes a phone set on it. Still looking for a good one
1,Couldn’t even get it to power on.  I would not recommend purchasing
1,I purchased this as a fast charger for my Samsung S22Ultra5G. I plug the charger to the phone and it displays Fast Charge. I plug the same adapter into this unit and it says Charging. Also the estimated charging time doubles using this device. On my Samsung branded wireless charger my phone shows Fast Charge when I place it on the charger.
1,Didn’t work right out of the box. The led indicator showed it was charging but no power levels increased on my IPhone 13 after 20 minutes. New charging cords and different charging blocks were used to identify the issue.
1,What a waste of time and money. My phone at 45% only got to 53% in 2 1/2 hours. Definitely not a fast charger. Will definitely be sending it back!!!
1,2 months and already stopped working. Ready for the trash.
1,I always use wireless chargers but this us by far the WORST EVER. you have to center it Perfectly and THEN it charges for 2 seconds and then stops then on then off (rinse and repeat!) WASTE OF MONEY
1,The only thing good about it is it was very easy to use…. When it worked. Which wasn’t very often. And when it did work it was not lightning fast. I had my phone on it all day and it was barely at 90%. I just stopped using it. But wasn’t worth the money to me.
1,Not fast as advertised. Sometimes it doesn’t even work!
1,These chargers worked well at first and charged my iPhone very fast. However over time they have lost their charging capability and is it takes forever for them to charge my phone - even when the phone shows the charge symbol. In addition the charger blinks a blue light so if you put it by your bed while sleeping the room is constantly lit up by the annoying light. Just a classic Made in China piece of junk. Find something better for your money.
1,Godd if it would have lasted
1,Wireless pad has been working ever since it was delivered but now the pad is not charging. The light on the pad is flashing green and blue alternately. I have swapped the charging adapter and the cable but still the same result.
2,It does not work to charge IPad as advertised.  Continual shifting needed to try and get a charge.
1,I did not like it because it made my phone get really hot and I was worried it may explode or catch on fire. I don’t believe I have recommend this safely
5,I like it all
1,Rarely works. Sensitive.
5,most of the time it does not charge.
1,This product seems very cheap and it got extremely hot while charging.  Was very slow at charging through a case and after 3 hours had only brought the iphone up around 20% additional charge.
2,It will charge what you want it to but it’ll take foreeevver
2,Does not charge quicklyOnly 70% after 6 hours of chargingDoes not hold a charge
5,Simple to use and easy for packing.
1,Claims to be a fast charger but that is not the case! It takes forever to charge!!
1,These do not charge phones.  I threw them in the trash.  Don’t waste your money.  Cheap China crap!
5,fast reader the battery phone charger
1,Samsung Galaxy will not charge on this.
5,Charges any phone relatively quick!
5,Bueno y barato
1,I bought this because I wanted a fast charging alternative; this isn’t it. Cheaply made.
1,Una semana y ya no funciono solo encienden las luces pero no carga.
1,30% in 3 hours my iphone was hot AF dont waste your money buy cheap buy twice.
1,Cheaply made charging time is one hour longer than my 10w wireless charger. Will probably catch fire at some point
1,Charges too slowly to be considered a fast charger. Meh for the price. Would not buy again.
1,Product description says its compatible with iPhone 8. Plugged it in and charges but stops at 49%. Does nothing after that. I DO NOT recommend this product. Maybe It will charge iPhones 9 and up but it doesn't state that in the description. Maybe I'll take the cord off and use it as a Cup Coaster.
1,Stopped working within after the 2nd time
1,It stop charging after a 2 months.
2,If the phone is at a low percentage (<20%) an 8 hour charge will not bring it to 100%.
1,This is probably the single worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. The product description does not repeat DOES NOT mention that it does not include the required 20w wall adapter. With the wall adapter the product is USELESS. This is a total deception. BUYER BEWARE.
1,product is not as described!
1,Tried to charge my phone on this 3 times now and I'll it's managed to do it overheat my phone and itself! Be careful I do not recommend
1,Takes way to long to charge
1,Does not work!! Right out of box this did not work.  Tried it first with leather case that works on previous wireless chargers.  Removed case and still would not begin charging.  Same problem with both chargers.  Tried it on iPhone 13 & iPhone 13 Pro.  Neither charges.  Very disappointed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1,I ordered this for my son who has an iPhone XR. This charger is a piece of junk. When it does work it takes forever to charge your phone but half the time it doesn’t even charge it. At first I thought it was due to the case on his phone but it does the same thing with the case off.
1,I bought this because it said it was a high output charging pad. I bought a high output USB plug to go with it. 3.1 output to be exact. And my phone says 5 hours till fully charged. One percent took 5 minutes. I unplugged the pad and plugged directly into the phone and it was charged in 45 minutes. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,Wouldn't even charge my phone overnight. My charging port needs to be fixed so I impulsively bought $5 wireless pads as a way to charge my phone in the meantime. I wanted something faster and stronger but I my phone literally dies while on this thing. Used with the included cord. Tried it for a week repeatedly and it never worked. I'll stick to my $5 chargers.
2,I order this for fast charging it take 2 hours to charge
1,So disappointed in this product.  I am at home sick and was without my phone until I could get another replacement delivered because this one quit working within 24 hours of first use!!! In addition I believe it harmed my phone battery because a full charge would normally last a full day and the ONLY charge I got with this lasted less than 5 hours.  And this was with minimal use!
1,Product does not charge quickly
1,Just died out of the blue. Basically after the return period.
2,Doesn’t work for my iPhone won’t charge it.
1,It worked well for several months and then stopped working. It wouldn’t power up at all even with several adapter’s.
1,This thing is dangerous it over heats
2,Charges very slow
5,Produce works graat
1,Worked great at first then I notice that my phone was quite hot in the morning after charging. After that it stopped working altogether. I'm returning it and getting a cradle style now. I really didn't care about the LED lighting much.
1,Quit working just after the return window closed. I did expect it to work more than a month. Nothing else changed charging cordetc.  Will have to buy a replacement but it will not be this brand.
1,there is no rubberized or other "grip" on top so my iphone XR consistently slowly slides off because of the oscilating charge (which causes very small vibrations).  Choose another product
2,Works well but the light *does* disturb my sleep.
1,This product seemed great at first but after 2 days of using it I see it’s terrible. It takes too much time to charge it’s cheaply made and flimsy. The worst part is it randomly stops charging. I place my phone there at night and when I wake up my phone is only 10% higher. Do not buy this
1,
1,I purchased this as a Christmas present and on its first time charging a Iphone the wireless charger was extremely hot and the black pad on top was completely shriveled up the phone was only charging for about a hour. This is a extremely unsafe product and poses a potential fire hazard when used.
1,Was working fine for about a month then continently crapes out on me just after the return time expired..
1,Works half the time.  The charger plug in portion that THEY recommend you buy together doesn’t even have the right adapter to work with the product!  BIG waste of money.  Don’t bother buying
1,It won’t charge
1,Después de una semana de uso dejo de funcionar bueno dejo de cargar pero ahora funciona como iluminación de discoteca al conectarlo al cargador prende luces intermitentes azul y verde…. Ya inicie reclamo para cambio
1,The charger will heat up over the time for a full charge. I had to unplug my charger from the wall because my phone and the charger pad were too hot to touch. Last time I use it don't want to risk overheating my Samsung Fold Z like that again.
1,Arrived quickly as promised but did not work.  Bought another brand and it works perfectly.
1,Not fast charging as advertised
1,Product is not a fast charger as advertised. Takes for ever to charge. I would not buy this product again period. You could not give me another one that is how sorry it is.
1,I’m not pleased on my package I bought recently
1,Thought I was upgrading... Bought it to use with 20w Qi certified Anker charger and it Overheated both the charging pad and the phone - not safe. Cannot use - extremely slow charging with 5W usb block I originally tried. Might be defective but not trying a replacement.
1,Quizás esta dañado el ingreso o socket de entrada de energía funciona pero se corta esta mal la entrada de poder
1,Charging pad only worked without phone case on. Did not work for AirPods. It worked fine for a few months with the phone but now does not provide charge. I will be contacting the company and asking for a refund as the Amazon return window closed
1,It takes many many hours to try and charge an iPhone I think after 2 1/2 hours I only had maybe six increase in my battery life. It would be great if it works because it’s convenient not to have a cord!
1,It took several hours just to charge to 50%.  Wil buy a real wireless charger that actually chargesDon’t waste time with this inferior product.  The reviews here must be fake don’t be fooled
1,THIS IS THE WORST CHARGER EVER!!! DOES NOT WORK. ITS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE TO KNOW HOW TO USE IT AND HOW IT IS SUPPOSE TO WORK. IT NEVER CHARGED MY PHONE THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSE TOO AND HOW IT WAS ADVERTISED BY AMAZON!!! THE STUPIEST PIECE OF TRASH!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1,Used on my galaxy 9 phone and worked good for about a month or two. Now charges about 10% in an hour.  I won't get another one of these.
1,Would barely charge and most times would slide off the mat and not charge at all. If it did stay on to charge it was extremely slow. Pointless!
1,Used it once overnight. Phone was almost too hot to hold. Never used it again.
1,It worked fine for months and now it doesn’t work at all.
1,So so so and so slowly
1,It says my phone will charge in 2 hrs and I don't think that's fast but it's on the charger 8hrs and still not charged
1,Charges when it feels like it..Save yourself the frustration and just buy brand name on this one.After trying 3 different varations I broke down and bought a Samsung pad and yes it hurt to dole out the $$ but I haven't had a single issue or ridiculously bright lights to deal with.
1,Seems like a real fire hazard.  Gets REALLY hot along with the phone - and is not compatible with apple.Cheap china made ugh.  I want to send back!
1,Product return
1,Only lasted 2 months.  What else can I say
2,Takes way to long to charge...
1,Stopped working after a week. No good.
1,Only lasted 2 weeks and it stopped working.Very disappointing
1,It did not work for my IPhone XR
1,It takes forever to charge and I think sometimes it just stops all together. It says you don’t need to take your case off but I always do because it makes it even charge slower if that’s even possible. Definitely would not recommend this
1,Doesn’t work well charges for 5 minutes then it stops working I left my phone “charging” the whole night and it wasn’t fully charged the next day.
1,Easy to use super light and convenient unfortunately it doesn’t charge a iPhone sometimes it does but then it doesn’t.
1,Do not purchase.
1,Charging for 7 hours should definitely leave you with a full battery you would think. However this “fast charge” device only charged my phone up to 47%.
1,This charging pad is horrible it's supposed to be a "fast charge" but it takes 6 hours to charge my galaxy Note ultra slim 5g that's crazy. I would definitely recommend staying away from this product.
1,Not a good charger.
1,Product does not work
1,Worked for a day and a half and then just stopped working
1,I purchased this product because of all the great customer reviews. Do not buy. Stopped charging after 5 weeks. Spend a little more on something branded.
1,Had to return this as it didn't charge my phone and I know it wasn't a problem with my phone because I had been using a charger like this in the past.
1,This charger takes several hours to charge my phone.IF the phone is not in exactly the right positionthis charger will light up as if it's charging when it's not.Not recomended.
1,Worked great for 2 days then would randomly stop charging throughout the night.
1,Scared to use.Gets really hot
1,Terrible no block included cheaply made not even worth the already cheap price at all
1,This product worked well originally however the next morning it was no longer functional. I recommend buying from a more reputable seller.
1,Takes FOREVER to charge my phone. I think I even saw the charge decrease while on it instead of increasing. Horrible charger.
1,Don’t work all of the time. Placed phony on pad and went to bed woke up and phone not charged and pad was not working
1,Only good for week
1,Worked once then stopped. Returning. Wasted my time on trying to find a charging plate for my phone.
1,Description says "case friendly."  I've used several Qi chargers that didn't require removing the case to begin charging.  This charger won't charge thru my case (a pain).  Enclosed instructions say if it won't charge to remove the case.
1,This charging pad has failed me more then once. There have been times it look likes it’s charging to come back to it an hour later with lower battery percentage.
1,Not a sufficient charger. Had to hold charging cord just right to get a charge. Don’t waste your time!
1,After 4 hours my iPhone 12 only charged by 35%
1,Disappointed. This charger I've used a few times and the charging takes same amount time as a 7.5 w charger. Not fast at all.
1,Easy to use and seems super convenient except the reason for the purchase was that it says it is fast charging. It most definitely is not fast. Total disappointment!
1,Charges Iphones and Androids very slowly
1,Terrible product. You have to position the phone exactly in the right spot for it doesn’t charge and even then it can stop charging when you are not looking or you are sleeping. Do not buy!
1,It quit working 5 days after the 30 day warranty expired
1,Won’t charge through my phone case
1,The charger did not work right out of the box.  I tried all the troubleshooting tips and returned it for a refund.
1,worked well for a month then slow and incomplete charging
1,It claimed to be a fast charger but it is not.  My iPhone 12 was on it all night and it did not fully charge.
1,Very slow ; looks like 5w . iphone 13 charging very difficult . Lucky if its charge .
1,They don't work. I got three and none work no matter what cord or charging block I use. Total waste of money.
1,Stop working after 30mins of use no charges. I can’t consider it’s a charger now it’s just a flashing light paper weight..
1,I purchased for my young adult son and it only worked for (4) days before quitting so I just put it in the drawer.
1,The charger would not complete a charge even when it indicated that a charge was started. The charge light comes on then goes out.
1,Was expecting a quick change and it’s a slow charge. Would not recommend. I will be returning to buy an apple for the cost of two smh
1,I bought this thinking oh this will be wonderful and took 3 days before it broke. Not worth buying at all in my opinion.
1,Only charged my phone for about 2 weeks then stopped working
1,Doesn’t change fast enough. But useful
1,More often than not the phone is still dead in the morning after on charge all night.  This happens with iphone 13 and samsung 20.
1,Product failed 3 days after last return date.
1,My phone continuously comes off the charger I will put my phone on charge when I go to sleep and wake up with it off change with no battery.
1,Charger doesn’t charge iPhones even after letting it charge overnight it doesn’t even charge up to 50% (yes I verified that the phone is showing charging)
1,Does not charge quickly. I have a brand new flaship phone that supports QI quick charging and this device does not provide that.
1,Didn't work
1,This is my second one that I've purchased the first one works flawlessly but this one doesn't register as fast wireless charging on either of my phones it's not worth returning.... 😡
1,Charged overnight and got 18%. It worked at first and then died within a week. I ordered an authentic Apple charger.
1,Is not compatible with iPhone 11
1,It didn’t work with my IPhone 13 mini.
1,Worked for about 24 hours. Then just died. Worked ok at first. Have had better and faster wireless chargers.
1,Worked for like a week. Now it just blinks rapidly and doesn't charge.
1,Bought two of these and neither one gets our phones completely charged overnight.Waste of money and time.
1,It says wireless but you have to keep it plugged up in order to use it and it charges slow
1,Quit charging on the second day. Very dissapointing.
1,Wont charge.  Only a few days past return date.
1,It's not charging my tablet.  And there are no instructions describing what all the flashing lights mean.
1,Don't waste your time or money. They rattle feel cheap don't come with a 20w charging block and most importantly don't work.
3,A PHONE CHARGER IT SHOULD COME WITH A POWER CORD.
1,Stop charging after a few seconds and the blue indicator becomes green.
1,Does not work well you have to keep adjusting the phone and is very slow. A waste of money
1,Gets real hot
1,Takes forever to charge!!
1,The product doesn't meat the standards of the box.It doesn't meat the 15w standard
1,Did not work
1,Don’t bother
1,Charges an iPhone easily but charge does not last
1,It depleted the charge on my phone. I returned it immediately
1,No not buy! Takes forever to charge even a couple percent. Junk
1,Not dependable
1,It turned on for 20 seconds and never worked again  absolute a piece of garbage
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             it doesn't work it gets very hot
1,This product stopped working after just a few weeks.  It sucks!
1,Didn't fast charge my Galaxy s20
1,Do not purchase
1,Cheap quality can't leave next to bed because light stays on while charging.
1,I used this product for about 1 month and it no longer charges.
1,Worked for a couple charges then stopped
1,Did great for about two weeks then starting g getting hot and stopped working
1,I was a very slow chargerDon’t buy
1,This charger is not a fast charger liars
1,It doesn’t charge well
1,This charger only works 25% of the time
1,I need one that works
1,Dose not fast charge
1,Sadly it failed to charge despite correctly using it
1,Doesn't work after few months
1,trash
1,This fast speed charger is real slow speed.
1,Overall did not work.
1,Bad
1,Doesn’t charge.
5,Nothing to regret on purchase
2,This is definitely not a fast charger. It charges slower than my non-fast charging chargers. Also phone gets really warm when charging. Might me normal might not be. It doesn't overheat but thought I'd add that in as well.
5,Te proporciona la carga necesitada básica. No es muy rápido pero te saca de apuros.
1,I had it less then two months and it quit working … very disappointed
2,After a few weeks my charger crapped out 🤷🏼‍♂️
1,Did not work I couldn't return it fast enough.
1,Do not buy!!! This product sucks. I had it for two days and it stopped working. The first day everything was fine and I woke up this morning to my phone almost dead. I plugged it in at different spots and it still doesn’t work. It turns on but shuts right back off. Not worth the money and won’t charge your phone!
1,Sooooo slow
5,ME ENCANTO Y A MI PAPA TAMBIEN
4,Not a fan of the new trend for not including a wall plug so you can plug stuff into walls instead of having to plug them into a PC. This unit works on the iPhone 13 you have to get it centered just below the camera lens bump and it charges pretty quick at least for me. I would like a wall plug option as I wanted to have this on my dresser to charging the phone when I retired for the night but it doesn't. Otherwise I like it so far.
5,It charges my iPhone 13 very nicely.  Centering on the charger pad is not a problem.
1,
2,Update yea I'm returning it it doesn't change even when I take case offIt works kinda if I put it on a certain way and don't move it but I can't blame them I know it's hard to find a wireless charger that actually charges with a case on but this might be the best I can get I guess idk I might be returning it
5,Intelligent charging circuit prevents overcharging.
5,Works great
5,I tried two other types which claimed to be fast wireless chargers and this is the only one that actually is.
3,It comes with a power cord to connect to a power supply. But although the pad end is a USB "C" plug the other end has to be a old fashion USB "A'. I can not get it to turn on by using a "C" plug on each end. It is also rather flimsy.  And it sometimes takes some encouragement to get an apple phone to charge. Samsung no problems.
5,The power level is no way near what the box says (i.e. 81%) nor does it come with an adapter just the cord!!! So far I'm not impressed at all hopefully it lasts.
5,It's speed to charge is well worth the low cost
4,Works nicely.
4,Great product for outside the bedroom.  Couldn't figure out how to turn the light off at night.  The only downside. :(
4,Charges slower than expected
5,I ordered the one with material I love it no slip I was pleasantly surprised how quickly it charged my phone thank you
5,Works good
5,Excellent product
5,Es muy cómodo
1,Not sure if case was too thick but I did not have success with this
5,great product
2,Its honestly just a small plastic circle with led lights surrounding it. When placing my phone on the charging pad my phone will heat up after a short period of time.
5,My son loves this!!! Makes me want to get one for me!
4,Unit works as advertised. I do not believe that it fast charges but it does supply a charge and is useful for desktop lay down use while working to maintain your charge.
5,Love this
5,I use this charger at my desk. Very convenient to charge my phones or other devices.
5,It arrived quickly and was ready to charge my phone immediately....good product.
4,Very Good Product quickly charges my Galaxy S-Note 9. The only thing that I don't like about this Charger is that when your battery is fully charged the charger green light stays on continuously (not saving your electricity). That is why I gave a four star rating.
5,Just plug it in to a USB connection and set your device on it.
3,Dog is but has to be lined up exactly or no charge at all.
3,Won’t work unless you have the phone perfectly on the right spot. Slow at charging
5,hoping to charge my new google pixel 6  faster.have to use my wired 30 watttried to  use that adapter didnt workbought a 20 watt adapter nope didnt workit works with my 5 watt only
5,This thing is awesome  works better than the original charging cord plus the led lights in it look cool
5,Love it  buying more
5,Great for fast charging phone wirelessly.
5,i love it it works just fine anywhere
5,Really nice looking and they work well
5,Very convenient - just wake your phone up lay it down on the pad and charging begins automatically.
5,Works as expected
5,Other than a delayed delivery(two days late) and I used prime delivery the charger works as directed and well.
5,I unfairly gave this a bad review but now realize I was wrong.  I bought a 20 W 3.0 wall adapter and that changed everything.  The charger works very well.  I recommend.
1,Product heats up and does not charge fast
1,Device worked for one charge received charger yesterday and it has not worked at all today. I’ve tried multiple devices as well as well outlets and the device simply doesn’t work
5,This was perfect to use for traveling and works very well at home.
5,Very fast and great.
4,Does a decent job nice and light for traveling as well. Works great Especially for charging over night.
5,Works well and charges our phones quickly.
5,Used this for iPhone 12.
4,Great product so far great for on the go traveling or home just drop and go.
5,Very Professional
1,The charging power is no better than the 5 watt wireless charger I have unless my iPhone 13 Pro Max just doesn’t charge at the 15 watt stat it claims. I’m in line to believe iPhone. So I want to return this (to me) fake wireless 20 watt charger and not feel bad at all.
5,I used this to charge my galaxy S20 ultra
5,It charges fast and I just set my phone on it at my desk. No more caught with low battery!👍🏻
4,I find this charging pad to be much easier to align than other charging pads I've used.  It is a little annoying that it does not come with a cable or plug.  I find that it charges my phone super fast though my phone is a bit warm so hopefully that's not going to lead to any long term issues.Be sure to pair it with the right cable and plug because most chargers we've all accumulated over the years will not put out enough power to maximize this pad's charging ability.
2,I've bought two different chargers now and neither one is compatible even though it was listed with it on amazon. Fortunately I had an older charger laying around that had a USB end that works good. Dissapoinint they don't come with the correct charger or at least clear details on which one to buy. The 9v 2.2a doesn't work!
5,Love this charger box can just set my phone and it charges! Super time saver.
5,Great gift if you don’t know what to give A friend
5,Charger works as described. Good amount of space to place your phone or airpods. I like the velvet texture on the charging surface which prevents scratches. The color led changes color when an item is charging which is helpful. Overall simple to use.
5,Works great
5,Love this.Perfect for my iPhone 13
3,I don't consider this to be a "fast" charger at all. My husband bought 2 to charge our new iPhone 13's quicker than my last (anker) charging port. I agree with others that first it takes a min to get your phone situated just the right way. It is nice that the lights go on to show you that it's in the correct position. However... it is not fast at all. It takes hours to fully charge my phone so I'm not really sure why we "upgraded" to it.
1,Plugged provided cord into certified LG fast charge outlet. Only chargers slowly. Unplugged cord from unit and straight to phone. Immediately fast charges. I wish you would not lie to customers just to get sales. Your product does not fast charge. Tried fast charging one Samsung Galaxy and one LG .  Nothing works. This product is cheaply made and does not do what it says it does. Gonna send back
5,When I first unpackaged the wireless charger plugged it in place my phone on it it was not charging right off the bat! However the first time you plug this into power you need to at least give it in my case 2 minutes to ready up. After the two minute period place your phone on it and the wireless charging begins. Doesn't really fast charge my device which is a Blu g90 pro. Regardless of fast charging or not to me it charges faster than other wireless charger products I purchased would recommend it
5,So easy & convenient great value blue lighting while charging & green when fully charged. My teenage daughter seen it and took it for herself not having to plug it in especially when your constantly breaking your cord she like it a lot so I purchased 2 more.
5,Fast charging is the TRUTH! Also easily noticeable in your home with every IPhone carrier. It’s an awesome charger because it gives what it says….FAST!
5,The look of this wireless charging pad is stunning.
5,I took it out of the package set it up and it has been working well sense.
5,Easy to use just lay your phone on the charger and don’t have to worry about cords. Great product. Highly recommend.
5,This is very convenient and charges very fast.
5,Excelente producto recomendado
5,The charger is very convenient to use and economic. All you have to do in lay your phone on it and it begins to charge. They only problem is that it is slow in charging.
4,So far it seems like a great wireless charger.  The only down fall is they advertise how slim it is (which it is surprising slim) but the usb-c plug on the supplied cord is thicker than the charging pad so it doesn't sit flat on a desk.
5,Carga bien pero no es muy rápido
1,It quit after less than a week.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Charges as fast as a plug-in & i will by more for around the house. thank you !!  Runs like a Rolex !!
5,As I ripped open my package in excitement this disc shot out like a flying saucer! Luckily for me I have carpet. I was worried at first. As I picked it up I was amazed how light it was. And really knew I messed it up. But I hurried and found the nearest power block wall outlet and my wife's iPhone 11.Slapped that bad boy on it.And BAM!!!Works like a charm.Lights are cool features. Gives it an Alexa vibe with Green as ready and Blues as charging.
5,Phone charging port stopped working. This charger works great. No plug in.
5,I like itI love itThis product very helpful and very useful
5,This is the very best charger I have ever purchased. We were recently at a hotel in Boston and used one and liked it so much I wanted one like it. I looked on Amazon for one that was compatible for our phones. Tired of the charging cords that you wear out in less than a year. I got this for my husband and I’m going to buy one for myself because I like it that much!
5,Works as described no problems at all and even charges my iPhone 13 with the otterbox case on.
5,This charger is small but does the job. No end you fumble with to insert Just lay the back of the phone on top and it charges while you sleep. It was able to charge without needing to take the phone cover off.
1,This charger changes brightness of my iphone 14 pro even when I have auto brightness off. So I am forced to change brightness every morning. I googled and it says iphone will lower brightness when reacting to overheating. Not worth the risk
5,Plastic surface more slippery than slightly rounded units but still works very well.
5,Perfect
2,Si funciona pero mi Samsung s20 se carga más rápido en su cargador original
1,Se calienta mucho el teléfono y ya no está cargando correctamente y eso que tiene un conector de 20W
3,My s21 charges brilliantly but I should of looked at the description properly. My Samsung watch does not charge on it. I thing the watch charger is only for apple.I will still use it for my phone for now but disappointed with myself for not reading it properly
3,Was a good multi charger. But after just a few months of light use the charger has randomly died and no longer works. Bit disappointed
3,When this works it’s great. However I have to unplug it every night to get it to work. After I’ve plugged it back in I have to place things on the charger in a specific order for it to start charging. Phone first followed by I watch. If I try the other way around then the phone won’t charge.  We bought two and it’s the same on both.
3,The initial description states it will charge a series 7 Apple Watch. We brought this as when searching for a multi charger this says it will do a series 7. It doesn’t well it will charge it to about 70% over night. Upon reading the box and the full advert I believe the initial description to be very deceiving. Granted it’s my own fault for not checking but I’m not the 1st and I won’t be the last.
5,Very happy
4,Won't charge samsung watch
5,I use this to charge my iPhone Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Buds. Works a treat. Charges all three items at the same time.  I would definitely recommend to a friend.
3,It looks good size is as expected perfect fit for the shelf where i wanted but the watch charging part is really weak and slow to charge :( phone part is ok but need to make sure you place it right and same goes with the AirPods. I had a few disappointed mornings when the AirPods were not charged because i didn’t put the case to the exact point..  thought about sending it back…
3,it takes time charging up my watch
1,Bought this thinking my high speed Apple charger would work with it. It doesn’t but that’s my fault so I bought the correct/ suggested 9v/3a charger (which cost another £17.00).Is it worth the overall spend?No.The system (with the correct charger bought separately) should work well. I have iPhone 11 Pro AirPod pro and Apple Watch 6.They all locate where they should.They all show as charging when connected.The iPhone and the AirPods are great. They charge perfectly every time.The Apple Watch locates with the chargers magnet and the watch screen shows it is charging. Then the screen goes blank (which is normal but not helpful).The design flaw is that the watch will slip slightly and stop charging.There is no warning.The only visible sign (if it wakes you) is that the watch will light up then go dark again during the night very intermittently.In the short time I’ve used the charger this has happened to my Apple Watch three times and I’ve woken to a watch with not enough charge to get through the day. (The phone and AirPods are charged fine).I’ve tried the watch strap tight and loose. I’ve tried putting the watch the right way up and upside down. There is no “position” in which the watch will sit and guarantee to charge 100%.It’s a shame but the watch charging element just does not work properly.If I were to buy a charger now I would go for one where the watch sits flat on its charge point so it can’t slip off as this one does.
3,Doesn't charge my Note 20 Ultra or my Galaxy watch (which others did mention but I didn't notice).  Have galaxy pods too which it does do if you get them just in the right spotWill go hunting for a product which does what I need
5,This is by far the best all in one charger. Works like a dream and does what it needs to do.I would recommend using a high watt adapter with this product (20W+) as it is trying to provide power to three things at once your standard apple charger will not cut it.
2,Looks sleek and compact but feels a little cheap in hand - However works well with 3 Apple devices charging (iPhone pro max 13 Apple Watch series 5 and Apple Earpods Pro (2021).Tow major downers for me was that this does not come with a 9V/2A power plug which the label warns you to use  - which is a huge disappoint considering the price point. Also doesn't charge my iphone 13 pro max whilst in it's case. Was going to send back but luckily i do have spare wireless chargers.  Seems to be a common thing these days to not included the most important part of an electronic device - the power source. Big no no.
2,This charger looks smart but compared to others is not consistent in picking up and charging. Four times out of ten when I place my phone or watch on it to charge it does not work so I have to fiddle around finding the exact spot for it to start charging. This is irritating to say the least.
5,Good product. Really happy with it
3,The charger looks very tidy and smart which I love perfect for charging all items however ive had just issues with charging the main item being my iphone. I have a iphone 12 with a genuine apple case to encourage wireless charging but i found from about a week of owning this charging it would only charge the phone when plugging and unplugging the the wire in. Today its stopping charging the phone entirely with no wiggling of the wire. But the element for the apple watch and airpods charges perfectly.
4,Not sure if it's my unit but overall by reading the comments I believe is something quite recurrent. The charge has a prioritization around the chargers I was never able to get three devices charging at the same time. Phone and watch charge kept failing and i must remove and reposition them. Airpods worked only when it's the only device charging.
3,Not so fast charging as i thought
5,Brilliant quality productIt charges my Apple Watch AirPods and iPhone simultaneously without any issues!It came with a USB cable and Quick Charge wall adapter!The illuminated area around the bottom serves nicely as an indicator for the charging status whilst also doubling up as a soft night time bed side light for when you get up and need the bathroom!My only critique would be the length of the USB A to USB C cable. It is rather short and the closest convenient plug socket is about 1.5m from my bedside table so I purchased another from AmazonOther than that though excellent product does exactly what you’d expect incredible value for money!
5,Great charges well with watch and phone compact tidy and even has a light around the base so I can see the stand if it's dark but can turn off too. good value and watch and phone charged at same time and in the same place bought a second one
2,It charged my Apple Watch fine but only sometimes charges my iPhone 13 with/without its case. This morning I took my phone out of its case and charged it it was red hot after a few hours so took it off charge! Refund please!!!
3,The unit makes a high pitched almost “cricket” like noise which sounds louder than it actually is at night time. Advice don’t leave it next to the bed. Also charges a lot slower than anticipated :(
1,This the worst charger I have ever bought.  Takes over 3 hrs to charge my watch which is normally half charged anyway.  Phone doesn’t charger unless it is mm perfect position which takes forever to to find that position even then I left it all night and phone was only 3/4 charged in the morning.  Absolute rubbish. DO NOT BUY.
5,Really like this product
5,Essential for recharging both your watch and telephone at the same time. This is also essential for keeping communication between them ongoing.
3,Good item but NO WAY is it a fast charger.
5,This is an awesome product.It looks stylish. I use it on my bedside table and charge all my stuff overnight.It charges it fairly fast and looks great with the lighting around the base.The magnet to hold the watch on is good. My cat hasnt managed to knock the watch off yet.Only takes 1 USB-C lead which is supplied plugged in to my original apple charger. so frees up my wall sockets which used to have other chargers in.If you have iphone and apple watch/airpods then you should definitely get one.
5,Great Product! Your certainly getting your moneys worth with this charger. I was worried about it charging my airpod pros based on other comments but honestly it's absolutely fine! The light I also think looks great and it's even better that you can turn it all off when you choose. It’s well made looks great and certainly does the job. It deserves more praise than it currently has on Amazon as I was a little concerned about 4 stars on 25 comments but I took a risk and am glad I did.
5,Very easy to use and looks cool also. Overall extremely happy with my purchase.
5,Bought this to replace my wired phone and watch bedside charging station. This is brilliant. So easy to put the phone on especially during the night no more struggles trying to get the phone back on the charger port when you can’t see!!  Built in watch charger no need to use the apple watch cable which frees up the cable to be used for another location e.g take it to work or keep in car for emergency top up! Great quality build.
2,Was really excited to try it. IPhone and Airpods were charging but the apple watch wasn’t charging at all!! Very disappointed. Don’t recommend buying it as it charges way to slow aswell. Not satisfied at all!
5,Great upgrade from my old wooden docking station. The old one was basically a wooden stand that you could plug various USB chargers in to so you still needed the physical chargers. This one has the chargers integrated so much better for cable organising and means I’ve got spare chargers for the kids which is always good! Mood lighting is a nice touch and it’s a very sleek design so fits in well in the bedroom. Very impressed!
1,I would not recommend this product at all! Insane buzzing and clicking noise when used charging lights constantly flashing blue and green. No steady charging of products. Not worth the money clearly a cheap alternative
1,This item worked for a few weeks but the watch charger part has broken.  Avoid.
5,Good overall product
4,prezzo un pochino alto ma era quello che cercavo!Unica pecca la spina inclusa è quella inglese non avendo un adattatore a portata di mano non mi è stato possibile provarla.
5,This charges over night it is very good
3,Think its relay good item only downfall is doesn't support samsung watches
5,Good price nice design and does what it’s meant to and charges various devices. Only small draw back charging is not the quickest.
2,Watch wouldn't stay in place to charge so dissapointed
1,Wasn’t great connection to start broke in mess than 2 months
5,Fantastic bit of kit. Great for the bedside table that’s where I keep mine. Build quality is nice. However I wouldn’t exactly call it a fast charger. Takes roughly 2-3hours to charge the watch. That doesn’t really bother me I have other chargers around the house. This is perfect for overnight charging all in one dock
3,Does not work with the iPhone 12 pro max worked fine with the xs max though
5,Perfect 👌 for charging without having to disconnect it to take a phone call it evens stops charging when your battery is full there is a visual and audio system to let you know the item's put on it are charging. Works extremely well for my S20 5G and Galaxy Watch
2,Slower than my other charging dock by a considerable amount and the fact that it won’t charge my iPhone 12 pro max with a 1.5 mm thick case on is shocking. The blue light is a bit cooky  but when I place my phone on it’s like I’m at a rave with the blue and green light flashing away.  Not what I was expecting at all to be honest.
5,Good steady product! Doesn’t feel cheap and it’s got a strong stand feeling to it for holding a phone and a watch! The strip light has a perfect blend to it and not bright in some parts like most others! Might just get myself another one!!
5,Easy to use. Slick design
5,From opening the box you can tell its a quality product sits well on my desk next to my computer saves space and 1 cable rather than 3.I can charge my phone as well as use it as a steady work station.Very happy with my purchase.Saves space tidy as less cables quality feel sturdy base.
1,Absolutely useless. This arrived and everything looked good until I connected it up and actually tried to charge anything.  Initially placing the phone on the charger did nothing. No charge no indication the phone was recognised.After a bit of playing with cables etc I noticed that sliding the phone up so it was still touching the charging pad but sitting 2-3cm off the base caused it to start to charge. Obviously letting go of the phone caused it to slide back down and stop charging.I’m using an iPhone X but it’s like it was designed for a much bigger phone so the charging loops are misaligned.I now have a charger that works perfectly except I have to constantly hold the phone in place which defeats the purpose of the stand.Utter garbage please don’t buy!
5,Good value and fast charging 👍👍
2,Works but takes so long to charge up the Apple Watch even with nothing else charging. Seems to take twice as long as the original watch charge cable and keeps having issues with dropping the charge connection. As a phone charger worked as needed but due to the watch issue have stopped using it.
5,Brilliant - exactly what I was looking for. The lights can be turned off if you find them annoying and it looks very smart sat on a bedside table. Charges my iPhone and Apple Watch mag lock devices perfectly.
5,I bought this as a xmas gift for my son. He is over the moon with it. The quality is excellent and love the LED lights which indicate the phone in charging mode. Fantastic product would recommend!
5,Works good but you must buy the UGREEN usb-c cable fast charge for it to work properly... Once set up brilliant.
5,Easy to use looks good & excellent value
1,Excited when I saw this product plug it into a new Samsung USB plug as the product doesn't come with one. Tried my Samsung S20 phone and it charged OK put my Samsung Frontier watch and earbuds case on the charger and nothing tried watch on its own no charge tried earbuds case on its own again no charge removed the plastic covering first as well... product not suitable as described..
5,The phone charger work okay but the Smart watch charger don’t work that will
5,Very impressive. Stable high-quality plastic. Fast charging. Maximum compatibility with my apple products. And I especially like led light which is also great as night light. I can only recommend I have been looking for a similar product for a long time.
5,For the price it does the job. Looks slick although can’t quite work out where to put the AirPod case so it charges properly.
2,Works ok but iPhone 12 pro max won’t charge with a MagSafe case in portrait mode and the watch charger is so slow it’s painful. If you have a different phone and happy to charge your watch over night it’s ok I guess
1,Works well with iPhone but doesn’t charge the watch at all… I’m shocked for the price I paid.. for it to work like a cheap little thing.It’s broken and I’ll be looking to get my money back.
5,Love this product charges phone even with hardy case also charges airpods & apple watch. Slimline too & only 1 lead fab product.
2,Purchased this to solve the multiple charging issue doesn’t work! Need to get the phone bang for on (includes messing about with the charger) to work. Took the watch off this morning after being on charge all night to die at about 11... poor at best!
5,Bought this for my hubby for Christmas he’s used it every day since. Great charger 😊
1,This is a terrible device although it charges the phone and AirPods it does NOT charge the Apple watch every time I placed the watch on it it drained the device altogether after 3 weeks it will now only charge either the phone or the AirPods absolute waste of money. Checked out some internet sites and apparently only devices bought through the Apple store will change Apple Watch reliably this one is going in the bin! Would try and get money back but for £30 it’s just not worth the time and energy DON’T BUY IT!
5,Would be better for travels if it folded down. But it’s better than I expected. Really simple. Not hard to get everything on it at once.
5,The whole product was exactly what I needed for my bedside. Saves space and looks stylish
2,Doesn’t charge my Apple Watch. Bought two of these. One works fine and the other clearly is broken. Unable to return.
1,Got this out the box and had it plugged into my fast charge plug. It charged my phone no problem and my air pods but would not charge the Apple Watch only made this extremely hot and drained the battery even when it was only item charging. Wish I had read reviews first have now sent this back and will purchasing from a different supplier
5,It works with my iPhone and Apple Watch
5,Doesn't charge my phone thought it would as 8 have the s20 by samsung
5,Looks good and  not too big
5,I loved
1,Worked ok for a few days. Then watch part stopped charging watch. Phone still charges it’s just the watch part. Sending back for a refund
5,Great looking and does a perfect job
5,keeps all apple products together for charging
1,Worked great for a few days now it doesn’t charge my phone quite annoyed as spent an extra £10 getting the adapter for it would not recommendEDIT: after seeing similar reviews about it not working I seen someone’s worked if the phone is sideways it charges if I do that which is better but still not ideal
5,Real useful addition!
1,does not charge watch even with the right power
2,Does not work with iPhone 12 pro max. Only charges laying down. Disappointed
1,it is not good for the apple watch as it does not stable and sturdy hence does not charge properly.
1,The product does not work tried to return but as I did not within a period I am now stuck with a product that does not work
1,Phone side is ok but the watch side won`t hold my watch as is stainless steel  and heavy for the magnet to hold it in place also the charging cable is coming off so easy. It is going back
1,This item works intermittently.  On a number of occassions now whenever I have my iPhone Apple Watch and airpods all charging simultaneously the charger cuts in and out.  More often than not my phone ends up only being charged to 80'ish% charge.Not good!
1,Don’t buy sends phone into a frenzy trying to tap buttons then no one is near it. Opens apps and emails while phone is on the charging port and to top it off didn’t charge the phone at all.
1,Looks fantastic charging a iPhone 12pro but it’s now fully charged and it’s still flashing blue which means it’s charging still should be solid green I’ve seen other reviews saying the same thing very disappointed returning it.
1,Have it over a month now and it has failed me to buy a 3pin adapter to suit ! Only place I can find is a 2 pin in America ! Can’t comment on the performance as I cannot get it to work emailed the supplier to date no reply !
1,Charger cable to the product does not stay in position it isn’t secure and stops powering the dock all the time. Not happy with the product
1,Stopped working after a couple weeks andBrokeMy appleWatch
1,Charger cable keeps falling out charging is hit and miss
1,Charges my I watch but Not my iPhone 12 pro Mac which is why I brought it
1,Still charges watch and AirPods but stopped charging phone 2.5 months after purchase
1,Worked very well for 14 days but now doesn’t charge any phones anymore.
1,This charger not very good charges phone but won’t charge watch
1,Al conectar el cable se tenia q mover de un lado para que prendiera y ya funcionaba bien sin embargo como unas 3 semanas después dejo de funcionar ya ni enciende el led y ya no carga…
3,No me gustó
1,No me gusto porque no lo carga como se debe y tienes que buscarle la forma para que pueda cargar y muy lento
5,Excelente accesorio ideal para cuando los cables se te han roto en varias ocasiones y no todos cargan igual
