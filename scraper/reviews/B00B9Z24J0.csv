5,We purchased this binocular recently. We have the Nikon Action EX 8 x 40 which we absolutely lovefor birding and nature activities. The minimum focusing distance on this binocular the Acculon A211 is 49.2 feet. It will be used along with a tripod for stargazing and mountain viewing. The weather has not cooperated very much for stargazing but from what we have been able to see the images are sharp the stars are pinpoint and we will update after viewing the moon and planets. We expect to be able to see the moons of Jupiter and possibly some semblance of the rings around Saturn. The view of our moon from our smaller Nikon binocular allows us to see the craters on the leading edge almost as good as a small telescope.  We have higher expectations for this larger pair of binoculars particularly when zoomed in. The binoculars are not particularly heavy the grip is nice and they are water resistant although I think not waterproof. I did want to mention that there is a trick to using the eyepiece cap. TURN DOWN THE RUBBER ON THE EYEPIECES as is instructed if you wear glasses. The single unit eyepiece cap will fit perfectly if you do this. A tripod is a necessity for viewing objects at higher magnification. The daytime views appear to be sharp and there are adjustments for central focus diopter and a 10-22x zoom lever.The Interpupillary Distance is 56-72 mm. The tripod adapter is included with the binocular. Overall this seems to be a decent unit and will update the review in the future.
4,Great binoculars.Reasonably priced accessory case strap and tripod included detailed instructions good optics zoom works well and whole system lightweight.But one small problem.Beware the hidden staple in the top of the plastic bag inside the small box inside the bubble wrap that houses the included TRA-2 tripod adapter.Got used to the ease with which the packaging was coming apart for the tripod adapter so just tried to complete the final step of unwrapping the tripod adapter by tearing the plastic bag surrounding it with one finger.That is when I found the staple.One leg of the staple punctured my finger all the way up to the crown of the staple. Since staple was hard to see in the stretched out plastic bag it took a few seconds to figure out what had happened and it took a few seconds more to figure out how to dis-attach my finger from the bag and the staple.No big deal. Just a tiny wound just barely worthy of a band-aid.However maybe this feedback will keep you from making the same mistake if you decide to buy these great binoculars and decide to unwrap the included tripod mount.Rating would have been five stars without the tiny puncture wound to a finger.
5,Excellent manufacturing  magnification is crisp at highest zoom!Don’t think twice and buy this! This is a quality product!If budget is a problem go for Celestron upclose instead. My Braska became little faulty after few years so cannot really recommend that anymore.If you are still deciding and tempted for a cheap alternative please check my experience/review on another non-branded oddly-named binocular as there is a lot of false advertising on stated magnification on those. you’d what i mean!
5,They are clear and the zoom feature is awesome.
5,We now can see things in our wonderful view.  We zoom out get theeagle in view and then zoom in and can follow him.  On high magnificationthe view is very shaky so we are getting a tripod.  I can only compare withone other binocular but am very happy I got this one.  Easy to focus.Easy to zoom.  A little more difficult to get the left and right the correctdistance apart when my wife has just changed it.
5,great quality and great price point for them.
5,Light weight simple to use
5,Best I’ve ever had! I tried some of the other manufacturers to save a little money. I wasted that money! These Nikon binoculars work every time and I will probably keep them for the rest of my life.
4,These binos are everything I had hoped they would be when purchasing a Nikon product. Easy to use super clear and simple target acquisition. The only reason I didn’t give these five stars is because they’re pretty heavy and take a toll when hanging around your neck all day.
5,The first pair I got were defective. I called the company they apologized requested some information from us paid for return shipping and sent us a new pair. These do have a good quality view and it’s really nice that you can adjust each eyepiece separately as there is a big difference in vision between my eyes.
5,My husband loves it
5,I compared these to the Sky Master 10 x 50 the Celestron 10 - 33 x 50 and the Celestron 10 x 50’s.Incredible high definition flatscreen TV like clarity  at several concert halls in NYC. You can even see craters and crevices on the moon. Blown away by these and even bought a tripod for moon viewing.My 72-year-old mom had a hard time holding them at a concert but I had no problem (I’m 37 female work out regularly).Only downside: Not easy to take photos through these. I bought an iPhone adapter but it didn’t do much good. Will need to keep shopping for one.
4,Rated 4 stars for this reason. Did not say it came with a tripod adapter. A review said it did not come with a tripod adapter and the frequently purchased together items recommended purchasing a tripod adapter so I purchased one. Upon receiving the binoculars wallah It came with it's own tripod adapter. Now I spent money on something I didn't need and have to deal with the hassle of returning the extra tripod adapter. Otherwise they seem to work well. We are surrounded by  mountains and have seen I lot of stuff that was not noticeable with my 8x24 binoculars. Also I can now spy on my nosy neighbor who has been spying on us for the past 4 years HAHA.
3,Not what I expected from Nikon. I know that zoom binocs aren't going to be as good as their fixed-zoom brethren but I at least expected to be able to get a clear sight window. Vignetting and small field of view make these unsuitable for most tasks.
4,Wanted to have a pair of binoculars that I could have my cake and eat it too.  That is to be able to see close up and then be able to reach out for distance. So I decided to go for zooming capability.  The only down side is a bit more weight and size.  For the money these are very good.  I could have gotten a pair for under $100 bucks but after reading lots of reviews I didn't want to risk not being happy for the sake of a few more dollars for something I will have for years to come.  These are clear at minimum and maximum zoom focus smooth and easy.  If you stick with the same object as you zoom in and out you will not have to refocus.  I took these out at night and can clearly see street light lit up areas no problem from 100 yards away.  Only negative as others have said are the lens covers.  The eye piece covers are a joke and seem like they were meant for something else.  Like putting on a bucket hat when you’re wearing a tuxedo.  So I deducted 1 star for that.  I will be looking to replace them with something else.  Besides that the best zooming binoculars for the price.
5,I wanted high powered binoculars to see the wolves in Yellowstone. These were great. Unfortunately due to white out conditions we didn’t see wolves but I saw a pair of bald eagles on the ground with these binoculars. Such a clear picture. Can’t wait to take these on an African safari.
5,This is exactly what I was looking for – large objective lenses for lots of light and Zoom. This is a great combination and a nice price.
5,I love them because they were inexpensive nikons. I wanted them to be something  I wouldn't  worry  about if something  happened like drop or swim. I knew I wasn't  going to get a Nikor lens quality piece. Not for a buck and half. But I knew it had to pass muster to have the nikon name stuck to it. The zoom is a little crunchy not smooth like others ive had at a premium. Field of view is alittle small at 10x compared to the fixed 10 50. not a deal breaker. I wanted the zoom. Tripod adapter comes with it. I use a mini mono pod to stabilize while using it past 14X . Great buy. No disappointment. just like buying a truck the no frills will haul the manure as well as the full monte. If you want more spend more.
3,The picture quality is below average. Bushnell were far better and half the price.
4,I got these thinking with a zoom I could use them for anything - not so much.  But they are great at some things.These have a fairly distant minimum focus point (20 or so feet) so trying to use them for bird watching was just frustrating.  By the time you get a bird at least at the minimum distance and focus all you see is a very shaky view (your hand trying to hold the glasses still).  These are just too powerful for bird watching - at least the kind I do.Now for distant viewing from a tripod or with your hand steadied on something these are GREAT.  The picture quality is out standing and the zoom is easy to use.  I used these for mountain viewing from a room and really appreciated the quality.These are also good for viewing the moon - on a tripod it's almost like having a small telescope.  You are not going to see planets (except as fuzzy dots) but you can see a lot of detail on the moon especially at the light/dark edge where you get a lot of contrast.
5,I had read one very good review where they had stated that they were not binocular experts but went on to say that they had bought several pairs of binoculars over the years that didn't have the clarity that they had expected until they bought these.  Their review compelled me to write my review!!  I agree with them 100% these binoculars are of very good quality you feel it in the weight at a solid but fairly light 33 oz. ( or roughly 2 lbs. 1 oz.) and rubber armored!  I have had several pairs of binoculars myself and when you zoom in and refocus you just can't get them to come in clear unless you back off the zoom a bit then they will become clear. So what good is zoom if they're not going to be clear when zoomed in all the way.  Well good news for the folks that bought these because these are crystal clear while zoomed all the way in!!! Also if you focus these in while zoomed in all the way as you back the zoom off they will stay focused!  Also what is not mentioned is these binoculars come with a neck strap a padded case that has a belt loop so you can ware it on a belt up to 2.5 inches wide and lens covers along with the tripod adapter that is mentioned.I would definitely recommend these to anyone!!
5,Excelent binocular
5,Bought this as a gift for my husband. HE LOVES THEM!! He uses them a lot. I compared shopped and for the money this set of binoculars was one of the best priced for the distance they covered. I would recommend this product.
5,Great binoculars true test is coming up in Yellowstone for a month
5,The binoculars these are replacing are older than a lot of you reading this. I don't remember exactly when I got them but I know Reagan was in the White House. They should have been replaced long ago but they worked were comfortable sharp clear and got the job done when I needed them. I wasn't itching for new binoculars but I was messing around with them and it hit me that they're older than 80% of the Dallas Cowboys. I was a concerned about spending $150 on something I don't use a ton but that nonsense has been blown away.  These things arrived at 8PM in November when it's cloudy foggy and rainy here  and it only took 5 minutes to blow me away. These things are are crystal clear and razor sharp when zoomed all the way to 22 even at night. They are shaky at full zoom but not blurry and the shakiness isn't distracting. However if you demand perfection it has a Tripod Adapter. So if you're asking yourself like I was 3 hours ago do I really need these things? The answer is YEAH YOU DO!!! I might update this after I test them in the daytime but I don't think I'll need to.
5,Very good image resolution. The zoom is great. Very confortable to use.
4,Really great optics. Bright and crisp no doubt and a GREAT price. I would only knock off one star as they are bulkier than other 10*50's. Not a problem in many situations. I wish I could give half stars as they are a 4.5 really. Combine the FOV brightness and sharp image of these with a slighter build it'd be a perfect bin.For the price very very good.
5,Very clear view quality product.
5,Another great Nikon product. Made in China. No tripod adapter in box as some stated.
5,For years we carried two sets of binoculars on our bird and wildlife watching outings.  One set for long distance viewing and another for things closer. But no more!  The handy zoom feature of these binoculars takes care of all our viewing needs in one package. The optics are sharp and clear. We recently took them along on a snowmobile tour in Yellowstone and this sturdy set of binos stood up to a couple hundred miles of bumpy jarring riding and endured the cold. They are relatively light weight considering their size.  Our only complaint is we wish they had come with a better carry case and a different eyepiece cap. The case itself has no carry strap (the bino strap laced to the outside of the bag serves as a carry strap). The case does have a belt loop but it is really much too large to be carried on the waist comfortably.  So once you remove the binoculars from the case for use there is no way easy way to secure the case out of the way.  The eyepiece cap is rather useless...it constantly falls off.  The cap does have a way to secure it to the strap but it doesn't work out if you're using the strap as a carry strap while the item is within its case. The case is also VERY tight fitting and makes it difficult to remove the binocs quickly for use. For just a few more pennies in materials they could have come up with a better carry/storage system.
5,Light enough to bring along for leisure and visiting trips.
4,Can you get a pair of 16x50 binocs for $40? Yep. Then why pay $140?Because the quality is worth it.I have bought dozens of Nikon products over the last 30+ years and have never not once been less than thrilled with the quality and dependability of their products. You simply don't have to question whether it is going to be good or not.These binocs are no exception.The only criticism I have is that the diopter adjustment knob is a little hard to use if the eye cup is down all the way and you have large fingers.Apart from that these are great!The case is nicer than I would have expected too very well padded.The Nikon tripod adapter is not plastic but solid thick aluminum.Even the neck strap isn't El Cheapo.
5,These work better than expected exceed expectations.  You will also see these same binocs for $25 more saying it includes a case lens covers and a fitting for tripod. . .don't spend the extra dough.  For $175 these ALREADY come with all those times.  The explanation did not note this but I had assumed Nikon would include at least the case and lens covers.  They did   AND the tripod attachment.  For me these are not overly heavy but nice to know I can use tripod if want to.  When you zoom from 10X to 22X you do have to adjust focus a bit but very acceptable.  Very happy with this purchase good quality binoculars.
5,Super nice. Powerful. Nice case. No cleaning cloth.  Pleasantly surprised for the price.
3,***I am in favor of big name brand manufacturers designing and building products for the average consumer in a less than pro standard budget. However Nikon is associated with Japan's uncompromised quality build an precision. In this particular case they nust placed their big name on a Quality Chinese pair of long eyes. No Nikon glass and no Nikon precision manufacturing standards.Don't get me wrong if you are an outdorsman you could still use them but don't expect a true Nikon performance rivali g tbe Big German and Austrian names.Soccer Moms should be so very happy and content with these binoculars. They come in a mid level elegant case but unfortunately not very secure. It can open accidentally if you're not careful. Bird watchers also will find it useful but only in the lowest powdr setting. The Zoom design anyway is not all that great. No precision and likely unreliable for anything beyond the most marginal use.All in all they are great on a generic name but marginally OK when you expect a Nikon optical product.One thing to consider however if you as I decide to feturn it and invest in a German name;  You will pay at least five fold the price. I have a need for the German name Extra Low Dispersion glass and the precision along with the indistructible build quality therefore It is well worth my investment to go the German route.***
5,These binoculars came packaged well to wrap for a gift.  We bought these for our grandson who turned 14 so he could use them at football games hunting and camping.  He was thrilled!  He should enjoy this gift for his lifetime.
5,i just received these and have not fully vetted them but they are very nice.  The adjustments are easy to use and intuitive.  The lenses are well secured and provide a clear image.  These are Nikon optics and they don't disappoint.  I've very please with the images including the neighbors TV the boat out on the lake and the moons of Jupiter.  If you've read this far I will say that these binoculars feel well made but not too heavy.  Even still there is something missing in the Nikon quality I remember.  Of course I bought my first Nikon F2 35MM SLR back in 1972.  I still have it and it still works if you want to use 35MM film.  That camera was made very well.  So with that said these babies ain't too bad.
5,We use this product to look out our windows at wildlife. Love the zoom feature. Excellent picture.
5,Somewhat weighty and well built but not too much weight. Excellent quality. First lens/ first eye adjustment ring hard to turn but is a set it and forget it function. Would recommend.
5,I bought these binoculars in April to use for astronomy and was not disappointed. It has very crisp and sharp views with minimal chromatic aberration the neck strap is very secure and the rubber-coated body is soft enough to hold comfortably. I took these binoculars with me when I flew to Australia to see the July 28 total lunar eclipse. I threw six airplane rides at it in the span of a week and it still look the same as the day it arrived in the mail. With the 10x magnification many craters on the Moon are clearly visible and I could see Io when Jupiter was near opposition. Earlier this month I even resolved the International Space Station (though I couldn't discern any detail due to its small apparent size). And just tonight I used it to see the asteroid 4 Vesta Saturn M8 and M20 all at once thanks to its 6.5° field of view. The only drawback is the same one inherent in any 10x50 — the large size and high magnification makes the image rather shaky unless you can find a way to brace yourself. Overall I'd wager this is one of the best binoculars you can buy for under $100.
5,I would buy them again.
5,The best. Recommend to buy
3,Would not recommend this China made binoculars.  I have a pair of binoculars by Bushnell (10 X 50mm) that are much better quality and more effective viewing and better priced.
4,The binoculars are well made and the optics are great. Compared directly to a previous pair of 12x binoculars or a different but popular brand these appear brighter by nearly 1 stop at 12x. The 1 stop brightness seems to extend close to 16x mark after which they lose perhaps 1/2 a stop of light. Having the ability to go to 22x is great but at that magnification I observed a little bit of purple fringing and aberration on the edges of high contrast subjects - not a dealbreaker but just something to be aware of. For the photographers amongst you these are not at par with the high cost high magnification camera lenses in terms of optics but then they cost just a fraction of what those cost and yet come close (when magnified unto 16x). In the 18x-22x range I would compare them to basic kit lenses of lower end consumer grade cameras. Overall I would rate then as great considering their relatively low cost (when compared to camera lenses).
5,I like the clarity of the view.  It's very bright at all magnifications. Focus is easy. It seems to hold focus throughout the range although getting up to 22x you may need to fine tune it some especially stargazing.Of course with high magnification the shake is noticeable especially trying to see stars.It comes with a tripod adapter and a tripod is helpful and necessary for astronomy.The weight isn't to bad. Very easy to hand hold.
5,These binoculars are heavy but you can easily hold them up for 10-15 minutes and you can attach them to a tripod (need to order the attachment separately). The picture quality is amazing and they are easy OK the eyes for glasses wearers. My first pair of binoculars and I am very pleased.
5,I am warming up to these now(they require a little more fine focus adj. than others).  There is a lot to like here for the majority casual viewing ''good enough" crowd...while perfectionists will have reasonable minor quibbles over different technical aspects.  At the 16x setting they pretty much exactly match my 16x50 Nikon ATB bino's.  Downside these appear more fragile and are not weatherproof like the ATB's.  The difference between 16x and 22x zoom may not appear as striking(zoom) as some might expect.  Zoom above 16x and view slightly degrade(less light) though at max 22x I would still call it surprisingly good.  At 10x due to the nature of the zoomer beast the FOV seems narrower than stand alone models.  I like these overall and rate them good for fair weather light duty operations.  My suspicions are they won't handle rough handling nicely.Important to note these have a 3.8 degree field of view.  That's pretty small folks. Great test...look down a paper towel tube look around and see if that suits you before buying. Zooming in and out does not seem to widen or tighten the field of view any.
5,Outstanding product. Great price. Versatile. Just what I expected. Very pleased with this item.
5,These are the first Binoculars we've bought. Wanted something of good quality and easy to use basis for all our purchases. This met our expectations and better. They are very clear near or far and the zoom feature is nice to have. If you want some thing light in weight these may not be the right ones for you so be sure to know the weight you want before purchase. We use them mainly for birding on our property and they are perfect for that. We also bought a tripod to use with them which has been nice if your in one spot for a length of time. Would recommend these as high quality binocs for many years of regular use.
4,The only reason why I don't choose 5 stars is because I don't reserve "love" for inanimate objects. That being said I really like these binoculars.  I have terrible eyesight and require glasses for everything except sleeping.  These binoculars can be used with or without glasses.  I find it easier to use them without glasses.  I have folded over the rubber eyepieces to use them with glasses like the instructions say and that's okay but simply removing my glasses for a second seems easier.  The clarity truly is everything everyone else says it is.  The fact that it comes with a tripod adapter is really nice.  I put mine right on a tripod as soon as it came in.  I've been out in the yard "pulling in" tree tops to look at birds.  I can read the numbers and letters on trashcans at least 100 yards away with absolute clarity.  Some of the birds and nests I "pull in" are at least 300-350 yards away and appear to be as if they were 20 feet or so away.  These are very underestimated numbers I believe so I can convey the quality of these binoculars.  I probably don't want to know how Nikon can offer these so affordably.
5,Great for my  use
4,Hard to focus when fully zoomed even when using a tripod. Tripod mount is cheap.  Wish i would have held out and gone for a better model but for the price this is a decent option and much better than some of the models i looked at.
4,Serve my needs nicely.
5,Love them better than I expected
5,Quality
5,Very nice.  These were a gift for my Wife for bird watching.  She does not like to go hiking into the woods but prefers to stay near the car.  These binoculars give here the "reach" to see the birds without having to walk long distances to get close.  She likes to use them on a monopod especially when she is using high magnification.They provide a clear "crisp to the edge" of the field of view.Note that these have a "close focus" of 49 feet.  For astronomy purposes or many sports and outdoor uses this may not be an issue but for bird watching many people would prefer something more around 12 to 20 feet.  However for my Wife this is not an issue.Also note that these have a field of view of only 3.9 degrees at 10X.  Compare this to a typical 10X50 which would be around 6 degrees.  Again my wife is fine with this but if you are expecting something like 6 degrees these may not meet your expectations.  Just something you get used to.I would recommend these to friends.
5,Excellent and great product.  The merchant is respectable and I recommend dealing with him
5,Bought these for viewing the Super Blood Wolf Moon a couple nights ago.  Excellent magnification!  Even while zooming in all the way picture not distorted.  True that view is a little clearer before zooming in but compared to our pair of Bushnell  there is no comparison.After doing research these sounded to be the best for our occasional use for astronomy & nature looking.To carry the case attach included binocular strap to binocular then put in its case keeping the strap out.  Feed the top case flap through the strap close the flap.  Velcro on flap seems to be strong enough to stay closed while carrying.  Con:  Eyepiece caps to not stay on.  I believe their only purpose is protection while in the case.  Useless if carrying the binoculars outside without the case.  Couldn't rate the durability yet only having them for two days.  These binoculars are worth the extra money.
5,These Nikon Zoom binoculars are top notch. Exceptional optics from 10 power to 22 power. 10-15 power view is superior; 22 power setting requires slight focus adjustment for my left eye based on my eyesight and you must anchor the binoculars for stability. However this is necessary for any high power zoom binocular. I have compact $800 10-power Swarovski binoculars and at the 10-power setting this Nikon binocular is comparable and a great value for the money.
5,We live on the river needed to see the wildlife and barges. these are perfect.  can see historic town across the river and details of every tree & Pelican
5,I use these on my ocean boat - Very good optics - There are better out there but not for this price and they zoom to boot!  Very happy with this purchase.
5,Nikon 8248 ACULON A211 10x50 Binocular (Black)        Shopped for weeks decided to find three brands (roughly same price range) and models in a sporting goods store to be sure I liked them.  Immediately eliminated Vortex even though it has a lot of good reviews.  It was not as clear as the Leupold and Nikon.  I preferred the Leupold but that ended up being sold out (discontinued model) from some highly rated sellers and could not find the price (at the time) that competed.  The Nikon price was dropping (as many do when models are discontinued) and I ordered this.  Arrived quickly very pleased with clarity sharpness and depth-of-field.  Eyepiece focus was very stiff but once I got it to rotate it was okay holds its setting.  The only disappointment was the lens caps which would not stay on.  Contacted Nikon support was told loose fit was intentional and I should consider buying a third-party flip-up type. Not impressed that this design is intentional. Fixed them myself so gravity doesn't pull them off.
4,I am not tech savvy when it comes to focal lengths and prisms and all that other science stuff. What I can tell you is that these are bog binoculars and they zoom in far enough for me to (kinda) see where my shots hit the target on a 300yd range. They are great for the 100yd range and I can see where all the bullet holes are on a target. The 300yd range is a little trickier. I bought them because they had good reviews and I agree that they are very clear. I don’t know if I would take them into the field for a hunt since they are bulky and after a little while hiking through the woods I would imagine they would start to become more of a pain.  I am pretty happy with them and would recommend them for regular shooting range or viewing wildlife etc but if you are trying to see where your shots land at the 300yd range you night want a little more magnification.
5,The only complaint I have on these are the lack of study strap connectors.  I would of preferred a loop connector to attach a strap to over whats on the bino's.Anyway....The image quality is amazing.  These things are easy to get on target and focus the image and what ever magic they do keeps foreground and background targets in focus.If you look at the moon you will see it with pretty clearly defined craters... I'd rough guess it to magnify the moon to the size of a 50c piece.
4,The optics quality is excellent. CLEAR!  If your eyes are close though as are mine then be aware that the eyepiece design could prevent optimum view.  I kept the binoculars and I use them several times a day.  They are not perfect for me though.  This is a good example of the risk of online purchase without in-person evaluation of a product prior to purchase.The eyepiece design (for close eyes) is the only product deficiency that I see.  I would rate 5-stars otherwise.
5,Exactly what I wanted. 10-22x variable zoom and good view size. Great brand name. Less than $200. If you care about quality you know it costs a little more. The mid-price market was limited during my search but these were the winners.
5,Real easy to adjust! And to spot your target!!
5,For the money you cant beat it.  The first day I had it I dropped it off the porch and it held up.  The picture is very good.  You do have to be patient with getting the focus to match your eye.  I set my zoom feature on 15 and leave it there.  I am very happy with Nikon always have been.  I have sent several pairs of binos back to them and each time they have sent me a new pair back.  I would buy again.
3,The binoculars are pretty decent for the price. The lens covers they sent were not the correct ones for these binoculars though and do not fit. Very disappointed with the fact that I have to buy different covers
5,Great binos. Being porro prisms you're getting your money's worth. Being zoom binoculars nikon had to narrow the field of view quite a bit to give these binos their 22x zoom. So the only benefit at 10x is less hand shaking. The image quality is great. At night the 50mm lens makes things look brighter.I use a harness to mitigate the hands shaking at higher resolutions.
4,Muy buena calidad de imagenFácil de utilizarAmplio rango de aumentos para llegar a ver los cráteres de la luna sin problemasIncluye adaptador para utilizarlo con un trípode fotográficoLa tapa de los oculares no permanece en su lugar. Además no hay forma de evitar que se caiga. Hace falta un sistema para asegurarla al cuerpo del equipoLas tabas de los lentes principales no incluyen una forma para asegurarlos al cuerpo del equipo por lo que es necesario contar con un accesorio adicional para asegurarlas (del tipo de cordón que se utiliza para las tapas de los lentes de las cámaras fotográficas)Es un equipo de buena calidad y recomendable para aquellos que no tengan inconvenientes para utilizar unos binoculares de tamaño grande
3,The binoculars seem okay so they are probably worth the purchase price.  I haven't actually used them since October when I bought them because I can't get out or travel.  But even so I can tell that the image clarity is high.  However they are provided with lens covers that not only don't fit but they are absurdly oversized for the eyepieces.  It is not even conceivable that they could stay on when the optic is carried.  They are several mm too large.  Lens covers are important to protect good optics.  Nikon is a premier maker of optics.  They should not be sending ill-fitting accessories with their products.
5,I have no alternative but to give this 5 stars. I got this early from my wife for Fathers day. The quality fit & finish are excellent as are the focal. Impressed by the lenses they produce sharp & clear picture quality. I also own a High End Celestron Orange Telescope but there are just times when you need something fast for whatever your needs are. This fits the bill perfectly. Good stuff Nikon although I am disappointed they now come from China.... What doesn't!?
4,I've used these for the past few nights in my urban (light-polluted) area. The few stars that were visible looked bright and shiny. Tonight I viewed a new moon and was excited over the various lunar features I could see. I've ordered a tripod adapter so I can mount the binox on a tripod to minimize the jiggles. One thing: the diopter adjustment (right eyepiece) is very hard to turn -- I'm hoping that will ease up over time although I don't think I'll need to adjust often anyway. The binox feel fairly light at least lighter than I was expecting based on my dad's old all-metal binox. The eyepiece cover fits loosely although hasn't fallen off unexpectedly. I'm new to binocular astronomy and these binox are the first serious ones I've owned -- if you're in the market for binoculars I'd say these are fine but you would do well to get info and guidance from more experienced binocular-users (eg cloudynights.com).
5,Used these binoculars recently in viewing the migration of sandhill cranes near Willcox AZ.  They were from 50 yards out to over 400 yards. The clarity brought them remarkly close and the detail was way beyond normal binoculars. They are a little heavy but they are worth packing around. Will use them for hunting in Montana this fall.
5,Definitely worth the price.  I will note that they work really well on objects about 25 feet or further.  I am a novice user of binoculars but have several 7x50s purchased previously.  This Nikon 8252 Aculon A211 10-22x50 Zoom Binocular is noticeably better in image quality.  The clarity when zoomed in is excellent.  Fully rubber armored which is good if you don't want them slipping from your hands and bothersome when trying to slip them in and out of the carrying case.  The exit pupil is easy on the eyes - easy to center the view and enough peripheral coverage to make it easy on the eyes.  Definitely will appreciate the included tripod mount for occasions when I'm zoomed in 22x.  Overall as a novice I am very happy with this purchase.  This is now my new go-to binocular.
2,Go with the fixed magnification action binoculars instead of this variable set. Image quality is better and better light transfer. Bought these for my wife to use hunting as I have the 12x version. This set wes on sale for only $20 more so I figured why not. Not worth the extra money had I paid full price I would have sent them right back. But instead they will be used as my pair I leave in the pickup year round and next year get a pair like the ones I have.
5,I’d buy these again. Makes things seem closer than they really are! Just look at it zoom in and it even seems closer. Look at it just look at it.
4,I got these so we'd have a somewhat heavier set of birding binocs our others were a couple pr. of pocket-size ones that are tough to hold steady. These are definitely heavier and help keep down the shaking.These seem to have a very slight bit of color fringing especially at the high power range but I'd rate them as quite good at this price point. Zoom works well but forces re-focusing at the new zoom level so may not be idealif you're trying to zoom in to a bird in flight - you'll likely lose track before getting re-focused. Otherwise very nice happy to have them. Hoping they will last like the Nikon 10x35's I have - inherited from my Dad who bought them inabout 1970. Still work perfectly with no fogging or problems. Maybe I will hand these down to my kids someday.Ken - Author of   The Pellet Stove Almanack: Home Heating Joins the 21st Century
5,great quality and sturdy has no clue standard of humidity proof but was okay for two season for nowlittle shake for nearby shores but great quality and price  you can watch and spot logo of landing airplanes well not after whiskey for sure shakes a lot need a sturdy hand  yes it is 22x50 for sure will shake
5,The Clarity on these is outstanding. But what can you expect it's Nikon. I used to have some cheaper brand 10 x50 not the greatest picture in the world not clear the reason I bought those was to save some money. After struggling to see game in low light for a while🐗  I figured i would put a little more money into my binoculars.So i went with Nikon one of the best things I've ever done 😀. I have read they are not waterproof so just be conscious of that. Clarity is wonderful I am a hunter so even in a low light situation or at night in a full moon 🌕 it's almost like you're looking out in daylight with these. I would definitely recommend these. 😀
5,Don’t go on that trip where you are going to be viewing things afar with cheap binoculars.  You’ll be sorry you did.  These are a great pair of binoculars that I bought after a recent cruise to Alaska where I had the cheap binoculars and a friend had these.  The difference was incredible...so much so that I bought these the instant I got home.  You can see so much clearer at so much further distance and they are easier to hold steady than smaller binoculars.  Love the ability to tripod mount as well and the lens covers for front and back.
5,I used it for hunting and moon watching. Very nice.
5,Some products try to do two or more things well. This one actually does. I have two of these. They are phenomenal.
5,Absolutely amazing! Definitely worth the money!
5,Nice binoculars  except  for a blemish in the right lens. I own four other pairs of Nikon binoculars (I only buy Nikon glass) and a prostaff spotting scope. Just bought them on a wimm not expecting too much for $150. I would recommend them if not for the debre/blemish.  Take my chances return them and get another pair. Also someone in another review complained about dabre in the barrel.
5,Nikon optics are always good
5,I bought these for a stargazing friend.  His binoculars gave me such a headache! They are more than I expected.  Definitely more than what he had.  You definitely have a good view of the moon and stars.  They are not too heavy or bulky.
5,Did exactly what they said! Took them out west to stargaze in Arizona and used in the grand canyon and worked amazing for both I LOVE them!
5,Hunting
5,Awesome product as usual from Nikon
3,The stem on the adapter does not match the hole on the binocular.
5,Not the lightest but good quality nice coating.  Definitely worth the price
5,As Advertised
5,Love it thank you very much!!!
4,WELL MADE LENSES ARE CLEAR NO FOGGINESS UNLIKE THE ROOF MIRROR PRISM TYPE BINOCULARS THAT ARE 1/3 SMALLER/LIGHTER BUT  NEED BETTER MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES... THIS BINOCULAR IS THE OLDER TECHNOLOGY CALLED PIRRO LENS THAT IS ACTUALLY BETTER THE TELEPHOTO IS CHANGED FROM 10X UP TO 22X  BY A SMALL WAND AND FOCUS BY A KNOB BOTH ARE SMOOTH AND PRECISE.  YOU'LL BE HAPPY.
5,Great viewing angle sharp exactly what I needed ( was looking long time for the correct one )
4,Just a bit hard to focus and weight does not help to keep steady at higher zoom. Anyway I am pretty satisfied with the product overall. For the price the overall quality is very good.
5,I am a semi-professional photographer that shoots Nikon exclusively. Canon makes truly great camera gear but I chose to go with Nikon because of their slight edge in optics. These binoculars prove again that I made the right choice. Compared to all of the lesser binocs I've owned these are amazingly sharp and bright without the eye strain/tension. I would recommend using the tripod adapter on a good tripod (or even a monopod would help)  They are expensive but certainly worth the investment. You won't regret purchasing these.
5,Nikon glass is always high quality. I have used their lenses professionally in the medical lab for years. Now I have a beautiful set if their binos. Easy to use and crystal clear picture quality.
5,I compared this to a Bushnell and the quality difference was noticeable. The coating has excellent grip and durability. The feel of the whole binocular was just amazing! The focus was not super sensitive and the lens cap can slip onto the straps. I'm very impressed overall with the build quality.
4,For the price it's great value. Crystal clear picture. Only complaint is that the arms on the focus wheel are a little too flexible so when you push it up to your eyes it can throw the focus off a bit on one side.
3,These feel nice in the hand but in the field they don't hold up. My pair constantly slips the diopter adjustment which leaves me with a blurry image every time it counts. I also have focusing issues at the full zoom setting so have to back it down a degree to get these to focus. Most importantly though is the poor field of view. I feel like I'm looking through a tunnel with these at any magnification.I ended up grabbing my $20 bushnell 10x50's out of frustration on my last birding trip and was shocked at how much better the field of view was with them. I haven't gone back to these Nikons since and my only wish is that I could send these finicky things back.
4,Heavy but good
4,This is replacing the pair I had one of the lens let go inside. But it was kept in a bin of the work truck. This time I'll keep it either in the cab or the inner compartment so it will stay cooler during the summer. Wish I could find a place to get that pair replaced. The zoom it a really huge plus for getting up close to your subject.  They did cheap out on the lens caps they are slotted instead of being permanently attached to the binocular themselves and didn't supply a lens cloth.
5,These are the sharpest clearest binocs I have ever used.  When using the zoom I find using a tripod is best to make image stable.
4,For a zoom binocular image quality is pretty sharp even in low light easy to zoom easy to focus. Over all quality is good may be a little over priced.  Case is pretty cheap. The biggest complaint is the lens caps. For binoculars costing this much the lens caps are a piece of junk. I have $40 binoculars that have better lens caps than these.
5,I love these! We bought them to see nature closer in our backyard.
5,These binocs rock! I had a smaller pair from a different manufacturer but wanted to go 'bigger'I am an amateur photographer (NIkon DSLR) and really enjoy photographing wildlife. Particularly birds of prey.But birds of prey are sometimes shy and also nest and sit in high places. These bad boys will zoom in to where you need to goThey are a bit heavy but that's the price you pay for the extra power (channeling Tim Allen. . . UUUUGGHHHH..power)I saw another review complaining about a sometimes wavy image. But when you are viewinglong distance heat waves are going to be a factor. That's not the spec's fault. That''s just natureI've really enjoyed them so far. And Nikon makes top notch products
5,This is like night and day compared to my old $50 set of binoculars from Walmart. Looking at people walking along the tide on the beach toward and away from me I was stunned how clear the view was almost a 3-D movie quality of course without the depth perception. Amazing product and worth every penny!
5,Useful for bird and volcano watching
5,Amazing optics with a very user friendly zoom mechanism. Worth the money. The Night vision use is suprizing - really pulls in the light! The extra magnification is an asset when you want a stronger image- great for ‘older’ eyes!😁
5,They are pretty big and heavy but for 10x50 and the price they are worth it. Using for elk hunting. They are pretty heavy for hiking with but for the price I will drop weight somewhere else
3,Great binoculars overall. The eye piece caps are good but the lens caps are a joke. You might as well just figure on purchasing some others if you can find them because the ones that come with these binoculars are totally worthless not only in their attachment but as far as staying in place. Kind of insulting for a good pair of binoculars.Update 3 weeks after I got these binoculars. I had attached the "lens caps" as well as I could using a special cord for the purpose and today the caps are gone. Very poor design. Also the cap on the tripod attachment fell of  in the field and is lost. I take excellent care of all my equipment and have had no problem with a set of 8X40 Nikon Monarch Binoculars. Why would a good company that makes good binoculars put poor quality attachments on them? I guess they must be saving quite a bit of money on the junky pieces. It makes a person wonder about the internal parts.
5,Really light and clear! I love it!
5,and a home run set.  for the $$$$ and what you get it's great...I'd recommend to others as a going in set of binoculars.  they work great.
4,These binoculars were  a bit bigger an heaver than I expected Took me a while to get use to them  there great if you have a place to set them on to sturdy them while looking thru them!! If your looking for binoculars to travel with these are not the greatest for that!!  Will get a smaller pair for traveling with!!
3,It just doesn’t feel like a Nikon. The zoom control is Not Smooth as advertised. Very sticky.My Nikon camera bodies certainly don’t feel like this. The optics are good but not great. I think the zoom feature is a good idea but it creates too many compromises. I will be returning.
5,Planned another trip to Yellowstone and last time we took the first pair on the last trip and found they worked very well. We knew we would be both want to use them at the same time and decided to just get a second pair. Both times we looked for a long range binocular we picked this design.She uses them to watch wildlife when at the cabin and we both use them for trips. Well made and clear optics. The zoom feature is ideal. Worked well into dusk at Yellowstone.
4,A nice set of binoculars to keep in your car. At the higher magnifications you will want to use the supplied tripod adapter to mount these on a tripod. These binoculars have good color and a nice field of view. I still use my 8x40 nikons as they have the widest field of view. These binoculars are great for when you want to get in real close. They would be perfect if the were waterproof and fog-proof.
5,Great binoculars! The images are clear and sharp. Easy to focus and zoom. The field of view is fairly narrow in comparison to non zoom binoculars. Great for looking at a specific object.
3,As soon as I opened the box and removed the binoculars from the enclosed plastic the smell was overwhelming. From what I could tell from my VERY limited usage (approx 3 minutes) it seems put together well the focus was sharp although the adjustment was somewhat rough. I'm not sure what they make this item out of but the chemical ingredients are dangerous. I can't give a definitive review because the odor was making me sick. This is a prime example of a Chinese made item manufactured without any product quality scrutiny/ over site at best. At worst  it's intentional without any concern for the purchaser of this product. I have Nikon scopes and find them to be excellent. This is made of some cheap rubber/ plastic material that gives off a horrendous and probably toxic odor.
5,I am blown away by these. Can it go wrong with Nikon. Looking forward to years of use with these.
5,Top quality and my wife uses to check our remote bird feeder. They are a little heavy but they come with a tripod attachment for those long sessions.  Yes would buy again and more than likely will!!
5,I'm thoroughly delighted with these binoculars! I would highly recommend them to anyone who would like to discover the world around them close up!
5,This thing scared me to death! I looked through it and everything seemed much closer. What kind of witch craft is this?
4,These really are a great pair of binochulars. The only reason they got a 4 star instead of a 5 is because of the lens caps. Nikon should have done a lot better with them. The nochs themselves are top notch though. The 10 to 22 magnification feature makes these an excellent all around multi purpose set-up. I'd buy them again. They came with a tripod adapter real nice strap and a nice simple soft case.
4,I am comparing these against "AVANTEK Binoculars 10 x 50"... What I like the most about this one is the image's quality. Is it like looking at an UHD image. Terrific! I dropped one star because when compared to the other product this one doesn't feel that well on your hands. This one feels like it will drop if you don't hold it very tight. In addition it is noticeable heavier than the other product.
5,This is definitely an upgrade from my old Tasco binoculars which was given to me as a "5 year gift" from work. I had it for a couple of years and served me well from watching my son play soccer to watching concerts. When the eyepiece came off I decided to indulge and get myself a pair of Nikons.These Nikons are brighter easier to focus and you can feel the difference in quality just by holding it.No regrets... no buyers remorse here.
5,I highly recommend these for the Price hard to beat.  I use them at night for Star Gazing and they are sharp and clear.  Very good even to the edge at this Price Point.  I have used other at this price and 50-75 dollars more and the Nikon Aculon are better.
5,Bought as a gift for a relative who has everything.  They were/are very happy with them.  So I guess I am still in the will for now.
4,I bought these to supplement the Bushnell 10x50 Wide Angle binoculars that I already own.  The Nikon cost twice as much as the Bushnell's and they are heavier and larger.  I bought them for the ability to zoom-in on sailboats that go by our place. The Bushnell has a much wider viewing angle and I like that better than the Nikon.  I think the quality of the image I see in the Nikon is better but overall I don't see enough difference between them to have paid the extra cost.  If I was to do it again I would look to see if the Nikon comes with a wide angle model.
5,COMES WITH A PADDED CASE ! Even though the description doesn't say it & the pictures don't show it the binoculars came in a padded case!! I bought the recommended case  & going to return !!Great value for a Nikon product ! Watched beavers feeding 30 minutes after opening box !!
5,Altho rather large the zoom feature is smooth and very nice to have.  Good for birding:  locate subject at 10x and zoom in for great closeup
5,The weight is ok for their size. Case and straps are ok. Clear lens zoom works great. Focus fast and easy
5,Llegó en menos de lo esperado muy buen producto cumple con las especificaciones al pie de la letra 2 meses de uso y siguen en perfecto estado y sin un tipo de daño.
4,They’re good binoculars and they work well
5,easy to adjust easy to hold and they work really well for scoping birds and distance looking.
5,The name Nikon is synonymous to quality in optics; whether camera or anything else.  These binoculars are no exception and just very high quality for the price point.  I'm thrilled with these and I selected the zoom optic style because I have another pair of cheapo binoculars that are zoom and i like them but they are hazy and blurry at full zoom but I've had them for 25 plus years.  I wanted another pair and man what an incredible improvement these are!  They even come with a tripod mount included which works great.  You won't be disappointed with these binocs.
5,I live on the 19th floor on Biscayne Bay and I wanted to look at the islands and Miami Beach.  They’re perfect!
5,Optics are great... maybe not Ziess but only 10% of the money too.  Full clarity to the outside if the view.  Very good in low light even at 22 power.  They have reach! I can't wait to see if the points I couldn't count this year will be known next year. Current binocs: Pentex 10x50.  I am very impressed thus far.
5,My husband loves them. They work great..
5,I got these for my husband to use for work and pleasure.  He was impressed with the sharpness and clarity.  We recommended to a friend and he also bought a pair and was really pleased.
1,I do not want a gift card balance.
5,These are outstanding.  I was able to see Jupiter and four of its moons with relative ease as well as Saturn.  Really nice pair of binoculars to get into stargazing as a hobby.
5,Absolutely the best binoculars for the money
4,Bought it on sale so couldn't complain about its price. Once properly focused it works great with very clear view; however adjusting focus is a must when changing the magnification and it requests two adjustments. So it is kind of a pain. Also the protective caps for the rear view optics never stay on very frustrating for me. Lastly it is made in China so that kind of lower its reputation and prestige. I gave four stars because less flawed binoculars would cost two or thee times more.
2,For them being Nikon I expected alot more for the price ass well they are blurry when you zoom in even a little bit and they fogged up very easily I would not recommend
5,We needed a tool to watch our bird feeder that is about 20 yards from our home. Our 10x42 did not give us enough magnification. The Acculon allows us to zoom in to see the birds in greater detail! The binocular is a little heavier but the versatility is worth it. It comes with a tripod fitting too.
5,Very clear and sharp! Worth the price!
5,It works very well even at x22 (minor aberrations).I love the classic shape (no futuristic pseudo-Star Wars shape).It comes with the tripode adapter that is mandatory if you would like to use in the dark.Recommended.
4,rubber caps for the large lens will not stay in place and can easily be lost.
4,Very nice binoculars for the money.
5,Just buy a pair. They are great quality. Can not go wrong.
5,i took it to yellowstone & tetonsgot a good look at bears moose elk eagles buffalo......ect...while the wife took shots with the camera.i still think the cost was high but good deal considering others.GOD bless America.
5,I purchased this exact pair 10 years ago and they have held up very well. I chose Nikon because of their reputation for making quality camera equipment and I have not been disappointed. The shoulder strap is very comfortable and the lens caps are nice rubber ones that don't fall off. I am not an optical expert however I have owned one pair for 10 years and the lenses are still very clear and the body looks very clean after being handled so much. I purchased a 2nd pair as a gift recently I liked them so much.
5,I also have a pair of Celestron 20-100x70 astronomy binoculars any image on these Nikon's at full Zoom is by far better! They were far better in low-light than I would have expected in the zoom feature makes them so functional and useful you won't want to go anywhere without them. I would definitely buy these again these are the best zoom binoculars you will find in this price range!
5,The only down side of this purchase is they are a little heavy for a product claiming to be lightweight.
5,Felicito de antemano al vendedor muy bien empacado muy rápido. El artículo es genial la calidad de los materiales espectacular. La calidad de visión excelente. Lo recomiendo sin dudar. Muy feliz. Gracias
5,Either at night or during the day the view just blows me away!!  The zoom is also very easy to use.
4,Lens Caps are too big and don’t fit the eye cups.  This causes them to fall off.  Apart from the cheap and ill fitting lens caps I am satisfied with this purchase for my needs.
5,These are just as advertised. The view is clear and the zoom is great!
5,Amazing value and clarity was not sure what to expect in a sub $100 pair of binoculars. The optics and general feel of these is exceptional.  We have an $800 pair of 7 x 50 Fujinon (7*30') purchased 15 years ago and other than a  slightly wider field of view but at a lesser magnification the Nikon is every bit as good.  I am not sure how the outdoor environmental protection is on these versus others but we are not taking them out doors for birdwatching or boating.
1,One lens is darker than the other possibly due to low quality control of coatings ?
5,These are so much better than our old ones. We live in the Colorado mountains and are always watching deer antelope birds etc.  I bought these for myself because my husband and I had to take turns with our old ones. Now he just wants to use mine. I'll probably get another pair for him
5,These are a good set of binoculars at a very good price point.  The binoculars were a bit bigger and bulkier than I thought they would be.  The vision quality is very good.  They seen super tough and I'm quite sure they will last a lifetime.  I will use them on a tripod for star gazing and panoramic viewing.  The binoculars are too big and bulky for concerts and sporting events.
5,Like the Nikon cameras I own the optics and materials these binoculars are made of are excellent quality.Priced under $150 these are a good deal for the money. I had to send the first pair back to Amazon because of a defective seal around one of the eyepiece lens but Amazon's outstanding customer service department had a replacement pair sent to me in 2 days.Love the finger zoom control and sharp images. Eyepiece covers don't fit well. Cover is a one piece protector for both eyepiece lenses but think separate lens covers that fit tighter would be an improvement. A small complaint for these high quality binoculars.
5,Can't beat these for the money. I fully expected them to be useless at the higher power but I was shocked at how clear they are. There is some blurriness around the edges at 22x but most of the image is just as crisp as 10x. Glad I took a chance and got these variable bins.
1,Returned to Amazon 5 minutes after opening the box. Yes they are on the inexpensive side for their category but even at this price point the quality is unexpectedly bad. The variable zoom lever is absolute garbage. It's loose flimsy and feels like it will break at any moment. And guess what? It broke after one turn. Not the lever itself but the internal zoom mechanism. One side would zoom the other was would not. Then the lever stopped moving entirely. The optical quality is so-so and the overall feel is not that of a quality item. It feels more like a kid's toy than a good pair of binoculars. Chinese-made rubbish from a once great Japanese brand. Spend a a few bucks more on another brand or at the very least get the non-variable zoom version and hope for the best.
5,these are one of the better binoculars i’ve invested in!
5,these are my first binos and I intend to use them primarily for astronomy.They are light-weight feel comfortable in the hands good construction and the images are super sharp.if you intend to star gaze with these be aware that they do jiggle a lot. Now that's not the fault of the product and there are ways you can minimize it.I didn't want to go for an ISB model because of the price and the fact I still don't know if ill get into this new hobby so much to justify the cost.
5,I don't write review too much but I was amazed with the quality of this binocular. I didn't regret to purchase it though it's somehow expensive. But I know quality has a price so I recommend it to a serious person who want to watch birds natures animals ...It has already a strap a case and an adaptor to the tripod so I think I gain when buying this. Stay blessed!
5,I needed a decent pair of binoculars for my boat. Nothing too fancy but nothing too small and underpowered either. These fit the bill. Clear images good weight nice case. Very happy with these.
5,This is my second pair of Nikon binoculars; very pleased with the optics durability and overall quality and ease of use.  I would recommend this product.
4,They are what they are! They work don't expect high end clarity but not bad for the money!
5,These are great! I did some basic research on these and another pair of the same specs and price range. These are built very nice and I hope to get years of rugged field use out of them.
4,I dislike having to actually back away from some objects because minimum focusing distance is so long. I use them for bird watching mostly so when they're farther away there's no problem...Wish I had checked this particular item before I bought!
4,I normally don't bother to leave a review on items but let me tell you that the complainers are "wanting something for nothing!"These binoculars are in no way a top-notch set BUT "for the price" I don't think they there are any that are better.You could definitely buy another pair that would put these to shame but you will spend a minimum of twice the amount!I am PLEASED with them!!!!
5,OMG These are great!  I bought a pair of cheaper 10-30x50 binocs.  They were very hard to focus and clarity was lost over 20x.  You get what you pay for.  Yes you could see with them but not a great experience.So I decided to spend more and try these.  Night and day difference. While these are 20x and not 30x they are crystal clear.  The focus is acute and spot on.  The zoom is super smooth.  Can't see anyone being unhappy with these.
5,The 22x zoom makes seeing and identifying game easy.  The light gathering quality makes seeing in low light conditions awesome for those end of the day shots.  They're a little heavy but for sitting in the blind it doesn't bother me a bit.
5,These were a gift for my husband and he loves them
4,We like the zoom feature. Purchased for a Christmas gift.
5,Though none of this is in the Amazon description mine came with the Nikon TRA-2 tripod adapter plus a Nikon branded padded case and carrying strap in the box. The tripod adapter ($15 if bought separately) worked flawlessly with the inexpensive "AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag" I bought for it.
4,These Nikon binoculars are the cats meow. Nikon has done an amazing job of creating a nice set of glasses at a price point that pleases.These binoculars have extraordinary clarity are easy to focus rubber coated and seem to be well constructed. Overall I'm very pleased with these Nikons and would recommend to anyone. I wish they were a little more compact so as to be easier to hike with but they're not to bad as they're very light weight.
5,Good quality came with nice soft sided case
5,These are really good quality and easy to use binoculars. I was pleasantly surprised to find how useful it is to have variable distance settings.
5,I am not a binocular expert but over my years i have bought several sets of them for the first time i feel like i have gotten my moneys worth they are crystal clear and the magnification seems to be just about correct it feels good to hold comfortable around the eyes and operates smooth seems to be of very high quality and  i am very pleased not often do i feel so completely satisfied with a purchase i have read about people saying about all kinds of technical stuff maybe just to feel important just saying it like it is they are crystal clear and works extremely smooth magnification is fantastic hope this helps
4,This is the second pair of Nikon Binoculars I have owned. Part of my job in the law enforcement field is patrolling the local airport and the Nikon's are perfect for day time as well as for night. And for a fantastic price. I have recommended Nikon to other officers as well. Not counting the ones that used mine and decided they wanted a pair and purchased a pair for their own.
5,Just received these binoculars and love them. Perfect for watching wildlife on the lake or getting really close up to the players on the field. Easily focused and adjustable for minor differences in the vision of each eye. If I had any recommendation for improvement I would just like the lens cap to fit a little more snuggly on the eye piece but I've noticed these are loose in a lot of binoculars. The grip is great and weight is fine. Great product for a great price!
5,We're birders and I KNOW people say these are to big the image range makes it hard to find the bird they weigh too much etc. But for a closer look at bird when you do find it these binoculars are amazing. Can see so much more detail. We found with practice and regular use they are much easier to spot the bird with. We do use these to watch our feeders too and they are perfect for that. Recommend for the price!
5,Excellent binocs!!!
4,I like them for bird watching however they are larger than I had expected and heaver. I took them with me on a cruise to Alaska and did use them while on the ship mostly to scan the mountains and landscape.
5,I really wanted something that would get me way out there. I'm the kind of guy that wants it all. I don't like to have to "settle" for something. I feel I got everything I wanted from these. The image quality is AMAZING!!! The distance is AWESOME!!! The feel Great!!!If I had to say anything bad about them it would be the eye piece lens caps that came with it. It's WAY too big!!! It doesn't even come close to being the right size for these bin's. The objective lens covers are good. It's cool that it comes with a tripod adapter as well.
5,I think they are great only thing was when I ordered amazon throws up another pic of a strap and says most people purchase together so I buy for another 9$.  well the Nikons came with a strap. I wish Amazon would give better descriptions of products. for example the Nikons don't say they have a strap or a pouch or the bag to keep them?? the only reason I knew was because I kept reading reviews and someone bragged on the pouch
5,Crystal cleat at sunset.  I have had other glass but these are incredible.  Its not about daylight for hunters its about in low light.  These binoculars deliver on every front.  Don't hesitate. Spend the money for these.
5,I live in the country and so I look around at birds and wild life.  If you live in the city in a highrise than there is no telling what kind of wild life you might see with these binoc's They get you up close and personal and they are clear and easy to focus.  They take a bit of getting use to before you quit seeing double.  I think they are worth the money and I would buy them again.  I don't usually use them in the telephoto mode too hard to hold still (must use a tripod)
5,Optics are awesome it's like viewing in high def. I spent more than I initially set out but this was worth the extra investment. Feels nice and sturdy in your hands the anti-slip exterior is nice. My only criticism is that the storage/carrying case is a bit too small for the binoculars and the caps for the eye pieces and lens ends are on the cheap and flimsy side. Fortunately the quality of the glass and incredibly sharp view make up for these issues.
4,I love their clarity and the light gathering capabilities.  The zoom is easy to use.  The only reason I did not give them a 5 star is because when I zoom to full power I am unable to get the focus just right.
4,I purchased these to replace a 50 plus year old pair of binoculars. What a difference time makes! These have proven to be easily adjustable and have worked well with my glasses. I primarily use them to observe wildlife in a pond adjacent to our property and they have been great for that purpose.My one negative is the weight but I was aware prior to the purchase that these were not light weight binoculars.
4,Don't like the weight but has crisp clear picture and easy focus
4,I think this is okay but not great. Would have been mad if I had paid full price. I have a older Bushnell 16X50 that is much more comfortable when you put them to your eyes than this Nikon. That is my only complaint binocular is well built with all accessories you need including tripod mount.
5,Boyfriend love this gifted for Christmas!!!
5,You definitely need a stand to hold these steady while you're looking at things if you zoom in. Your hands are way shakier than you can possibly imagine until you go 22x zoom.I found something (a glasses case if you must know) that's about the right height stickiness etc to rest these on without buying an actual stand but it's still a bit shakier than I'd prefer.Some day I'll get onto my lazy butt and order the binoculars mount for a tripod.
5,I had an old set of binoculars that were a little foggy.  I looked around and checked reviews.  I chose these for the ability to turn a knob and get 22  power.  They are great!  I find the objects in 10 power and then zoom in to 22 and I can read license plates from 550 feet.  I even looked up at an jetliner up in the sky and could tell what color it was Honestly!  I swear these are so powerful I looked at my wife with these and I see what she was thinking.
5,These are great! Very easy to focus them after I fiddled around with them for a minute or so. Very crisp and sharp focusing I can watch the wrens from a distance going in and out of their birdhouse and it looks like they are right in front of me. I really can't believe the low price on these. For under $100 you are getting a great deal in my opinion.  Very happy with my purchase.
5,Very nice pair of binoculars. Easy to adjust and clear.
5,Great pair of bonoculars. Very bright with a nice field of view. I don't find them to heavy for use in bird watching and star gazing. I've owed several Nikon cameras because of the high quality of the optics and knew these binoculars would be equal to that quality. Well worth the price.
5,Super strong very clear heavy duty actually a little to powerful for my property these are not your average 100 yard glasses awesome long range product for the money
5,I bought these binoculars to replace my 22 year old 10X50 binoculars. I stayed with Nikon because I was so happy with my old ones. The quality of the glass gives beautiful clarity and the 50mm opening lense brings in lots of light to enhance your viewing image. The additional 10 power zoom gives you that extra power needed to pull in birds from afar. Viewing bald eagles I often wished I had more than the 10 power and now I can zoom an additional 10 power to see more details. These are great binoculars for bird watching.
4,Extremely well built. Great lens and use it mostly for bird watching during my hikes. The lens cover does not stay put - can be improved. Overall very happy and planning to use it for many years.
4,Good - one prob though  could not focus on near by items - ok with different zooms though seems that 10-12-15 X are universally better than higher ones.
5,Very happy with these...exceeded my expectations.
5,These binos are easy to focus and are comfortable although they are fairly heavy.  The overall quality seems to be very robust and the lens clarity is good.  The lens covers are designed to pop into place; however they do not stay in and are constantly falling off.  I gave up using the covers.  The provided neck strap is very thin and was hurting my neck so I purchased a neoprene camera strap that is much better.
4,We got for our trip to Yellowstone. Was great to have this untill I looked through one of those fancy binoculars on a tripod. Now we want one of those. But for carrying on a hike this is fantastic. We have 2 smaller binoculars we could take but the added bulk is work carrying.
2,I bought a pair of the Aculon 7x50's and loved them so much that I bought the 10-22x50's. When I received the 10-22x50 pair they preformed to my expectations until I noticed a piece of debris stuck on the internal lens of the left barrel. I figured it was just a random manufacturing error so I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement pair very quickly.I examined the replacement pair very closely to make sure that the lenses were absolutely clear like my 7x50's and I found 3 visible particles of dust on the internal lens. Being that the 10-22x50s are ~$60 more than the others and given the quality of my other Nikon binoculars I am insanely disappointed. Get a pair of the fixed magnifications by all means but be weary of the zooms.
5,I've wanted a pair of good quality binoculars for quite some time and finally made the purchase. I'm very pleased with the Nikon Aculon. I'm still learning how to adjust for the best possible viewing. Not difficult at all just takes a little getting used to. Good product very happy with these binocs.
5,It made a great Christmas gift.
5,These are terrific binoculars the zoom is fantastic!  Very nice binoculars for a good price.  I use them for concerts and a few outdoor events.  The clarity and magnification are outstanding.  I can read the license plates of a car that is more than 100 yards away.  The weight is manageable and binoculars are very well made.  I would highly recommend these binoculars to anyone.
5,The zooooom is real. Nikon never fails!
5,Great pair of binoculars! Well worth the money. The one and only downside is the crappy lens covers provided. They don’t stay on well. Other than that I love these binoculars!
4,Prefect for mid range very clear and the lightweight makes it very easy to use. Highly recommende them. Only thing not sure how long they will last on the ocean due to  salt  ( marine usage.)
5,In my light poluted neighborhood I don't see that many stars with the naked eye.  These make the stars jump out.  I can't wait to take them camping to pick out Messier objects.  Their nice for terrestrial viewing too.
4,A very good set of binoculars. It has a great zoom range and my only problem is that it would have been great if the focus remained sharp throughout the zoom. Refocusing however is not a problem and I enjoyed being able to get closer that I would with normal binoculars.
5,I had a a pair of 10x50 bushnell binoculars before getting these. These Nikon's with 10-22 zoom is absolutely incredible and they are so crispy clear to look through too. These are great to take hiking or birding but keep in mind that these are pretty large binoculars and can become quite cumbersome to carry around on long hikes or walks especially if you are already carrying other equipment. Weight aside the optics on these are really incredible. These come with a carrying case lens caps and the tripod mount.
4,They work pretty well for me. I saw Jupiter and some of its moons. Was a little big and heavy. Harder to hold still than I thought it would be. The zoom feature is nice.  It came with a free tripod mount and it works great on my old camcorder tripod. I'm happy... Now all I need is some warmer weather and clear skys.
4,we gave it a 4 out of 5 grade because of it's size. The last two binoculars we bought were much smaller but not as good for bird watching as the Nikon's. Don't get us wrong for the price we are very happy with the Nikon 8252 Aculon A211 binoculars and the zoom feature is awesome! My wife and I are glad we maid the purchase!
5,These are just great.  I can see every detail of the wildlife that shows up in my yard even when several acres away.  I can read street signs that are at least 1/4 mile away.  easy to adjust comfy and well built.
5,I shoot a 9mm pistol on a 100yd outdoor gun range (the length of a football field). My target is a 8 inch diameter paper bullseye centered on a 3ft poster. These binoculars are so clear that I can see the hole shadows (about 1/4 inch diameter) from the missed bullets that land in the white poster from 100yds away! Enough said?Ron
5,I have bough cheap binoculars for years with expected results. I popped for these 2 weeks ago. I mounted them to a monopod for stability. I could actually see  the 4 Galilean moons of Jupiter. I couldn't see the stripes but these field glasses are amazing.
5,Great quality. We love them for bird watching cause there is literally nothing else to do.
5,These were perfect for viewing animals at Yellowstone and other parks out west. We were very pleased with the crispness of the lenses and the zoom was exactly what we needed for a family who wanted quality but would only use them occasionally.
5,Was a little nervous because of the suggestions of buying an extra case and carry strap they are definitely not needed comes with everything you need this item is very well-built extremely clear . Will be buying a second pair
5,So far they are just what I was looking for my trip to Alaska in June of 2019!  All the features:  power light weight plus carrying case.  Also the lowest price by $20. for this area.
5,SUPER pleased with these.  I am a tour guide in National Parks and this year Denali.  These were instrumental in spotting and viewing the wildlife.  Super crisp.  Always received compliments on their quality when guests borrowed them.  AND they're durable - I dropped them I don't know how many times and they are still in tip top shape.
5,Very good quality clear visionglad i purchased this over the fixed focal length one. worked well in our yellowstone trip. My friend purchased same on my recommendation from Basspro as he needed to go on a same day trip. Amazon prices are the best.
5,Great binoculars. Not light not small but solidly built and excellent optics.
4,Nice optics for the price.  I read the reviews prior to purchase and I am not disappointed.  Gathers light very well for a clear view.  For long range visuals I'd suggest a tripod to limit shake factor.
5,Theyh work just fine
5,100% Perfect - Works Great!
5,I liked it very much well done great product
3,over all okay clear picture but shakes too much hard to adjust on nose and flicker lots of reflection if you pull head 1/8" backward and cover eye from both side it looks okay picture looks clear built quality not that impressive price looks little bit higher than other brand 1) hard to set on nose2) when zoom picture shakes
5,feels good in your hands. It adjusts to my old eyes. It spreads out far enough for each eye to see into each lens. The lens covers are very nice to have. It has a decent case. It was worth the extra money.
4,Very nice pair of binoculars. However the motion of the controls are not as smooth as you would expect.
5,Great value in binoculars for the $$.  Nice ergonomic design and a perfect balance of magnification & weight.  Eye cups twist in & out very easily and efficiently.  Diopter adjustment is a bit firm but then it retains your setting during frequent use.  (The diopter setting on my Bushnells is easier but too loose and changes just focusing the barrels.)  Nice case and strap as well.  Again a great pair of general use binocs!
1,I really like these binoculars in spite of their being quite heavy. The one-star review is about the case which I found to be complete junk and threw away. I found it offensive that Nikon would think that case is acceptable.Actually the one they sent was such complete junk that I had to buy another case.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVJF0G/Anyone who thinks that binoculars should come with a functional and reliable case that will help protect the binoculars should buy another brand besides Nikon because obviously Nikon has no commitment whatsoever to providing a functional case with their binoculars. I seriously doubt that I will ever buy any Nikon branded items again.
5,I got these for my husband for his birthday. He loves them!
4,Its worth what you pay for it.  Focus can be tricky.  Make very small adjustments.  Use a tripod for zoom and it is great.
5,I was supriesd at the clarity and low light  capability of these binocs. Some reviews said they were heavy but I found no problem using them for an extended period of time.seberal friends now want a set of their own.
5,At this price point the Nikon 852 ACULON A211 met all my expectations.  The optics are excellent and the zoom feature works well.  This is a binocular designed to be used at home camp site or transported in a vehicle.  I would not be willing to take it for long trips into the field because of its weight.
4,Very clear. Alittle bigger than I was thinking but very good optics.
5,I wear pretty thick glasses and can't really focus without them. These binoculars are perfect for me. I don't need corrective vision as they correct for me with a slight adjustment of the eye piece. I bought these for me and my son. He loves um too.
5,I think these are very good for the price.  I use them for astro observing and I can get great views of Andromeda and the Orion nebula. These and a star chart/wheel and you can find anything.  I great product for "binoculars for astronomy" uses and also great for terrestrial viewing.
4,I bought these for deer hunting and I believe they work really well my only issue is they are a little heavy for me to hold for a considerable amount of time. Other than that I do really like them.
5,Bought these to use at archery competitions to see the target while grandson is shooting.  The zoom works Great at the distance they shoot from.  Easy to focus and adjust.
5,Great set of Binoculars for the price! Able to see the moons of Jupiter with them!
4,Work well for the price. Clear image
5,I bought what I thought was the best I could for our three week vacation to Midwest and Yellowstone. Turned out they were. One of the four of us had them at all times.
5,Nikon makes good quality glass for not a lot of money. How do you improve on that?
5,Fantastic clarity and easy to use. Ordered with a tripod because the zoom does make it difficult to hold accurately. But that wasn't even a problem because this comes with a tripod mount adapter. Fantastic on the deck for watching airplanes!
5,My dad carries theses around in his truck all the time. Has a great picture and looks amazing when looking at the sun jk don't do that But the moon looks amazing.
5,Bought as a gift and were well received. Made our trip great looking at EVERYTHING!!
5,These are awsome binoculars. Clear vision over 300 feet away even in low light ( dusk). Exceptional celerity  another quality Nikon Product exceptional value.
5,Love these!  I have been shooting Nikon cameras forover 40 years and these do not disapoint.  Clear sharp easy to use!  10/10 would buy again!
5,Was pleasantly surprised how good these are for the money
5,I was surprised at the quality of these binoculars clear bright crystal clear images easy focus all in a rugged rubberized finish that's easy to grip.  Very satisfied with the binoculars and was reminded that you really can't go wrong with the Nikon name.
5,Muy contenta con la compra!
5,I use these for star gazing they are amazing I can see so much even with light pollution.
5,Absolutely awesome clear as a bell at 800 feet can see the bark on trees at 1200 feet easy to use...You get what you pay for!! This is one of the best things I have purchased in a long time!!  I am going to have so much fun with these!!
5,Excellent value excellent product.  Very happy with the purchase.  I look out over the entrance to Kewalo basin and Waikiki Yacht club and can see everything very clearly.
5,Gave this pair of Nikon binoculars to friends who have moved to a waterfront home in St. Thomas having had a pair myself for quite some time.  They use them every day to look at boat traffic as well as the beautiful scenery.  They are crystal clear and with an exit pupil of 5.0 they are super bright.  Highly recommended by all of us.
5,These are great. Everything is crisp and clear for what we use them for. Watching deer turkey birds etc. in the back 40 and beyond. We even used them to star gaze a few times.
3,I'm not 100% thrilled with this binocular.  It's a little heavy not easy to carry around on long walks takes some time to focus and the image isn't perfectly clear.  I wanted to see a little further so I'm a little disappointed.
3,Good quality and all as you'd expect from Nikon. However be aware that an adjustable magnification sounds good but has issues in practice. The problem is that even at low magnification the field of view is very small. So you always seem to be looking down a small tunnel at a very little area. I got these for the bush for bird watching but now I will need to get another standard x10 pair with a normal field of view as well.
4,Arrived as promised. However miss the tripod adapter that is supposed to come with this model.
4,Not bad can see really far but it seems to require a stand as your hand movements make it shake a lot.
5,Definitely a great pair of binoculars
5,I have owned Steiner Military binoculars $1000.00+ Canon... and many others and these Nikons are very nice sharp bright view!
4,Good solid binoculars. Arrived well collimated and the image is good. Used for astronomy and harbour watching.
5,They are heavy for prolonged use but if you're male 200lb+ 6ft+ you'll not find that an issue. Precise well constructed remains bright at high magnification. Used for security on hikes and star (mainly the moon) viewing.
5,I purchased these for my husband. With our new ocean view home he wanted to see both the sea and sky! He LOVES them. Added a tripod for stability. You won't be disappointed!
5,Beautiful optics. Gift for daughter who just moved into Chicago highrise. Arrived same day!!
5,El precio y la calidad.
5,Great glasses. We just bought a second pair we liked them so much. Nice to change the power without having to readjust the glasses.
5,Great for watching birds
5,Very good high power binoculars.  The rubberized grip covering is comfortable and practical.  The included tripod mount is great as well for keeping it steady at full zoom even on a monopod.
5,These are great binoculars. I'm not really an "expert" or anything - I just wanted a solid pair of binoculars and these work terrifically.
5,Bought these for bird watching and to use along the beach to look at wildlife.  Does a good job.  they are a little large but light.  I bought a harness that goes over my shoulder for when I walk.  It make carrying then real easy.  Glad I bought them. They do what I want.
5,cheep money for these great optics.wide field of view and crystal clear.highly recommended.
5,Worth all the money spent. Very clear and sharp.
4,Good quality but bigger than I had hoped to travel with
5,Too early to properly evaluate my use of this product.
4,Great pair of binoculars. They work great for our purpose of veiwing wildlife from our porch.
5,I bought these for a gift for my boyfriend. They have great clarity and amazing magnification. He loves them so much that we always take them whenever we take a beach trip. Highly recommend these!
5,These are great and perfect for whale watching. Just lightweight enough to hold but also sturdy. We mounted them on a tripod and they actually came WITH the mounting hardware.
3,re wrote my review after more testing. these seem ok after all. on a bright sunny day they work well. Dont expect good clarity at full zoom or when the sun starts going down. But they are ok. Just not great
5,Excellent binoculars.  Not heavy with a zoom button that permits you to focus in on your object.  Comes with a carry case and strap.  Purchased for my husband for whale watching and night star gazing.  Tried many types of binoculars but these are definitely the best!!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 For the price and as first time binoculars user these are hard to beat. Easy to use and adjust sturdy and very well built considering the price point. Would recommend!
5,Excellent acuity.  Used at the rifle range to view targets.  Easily shows detail at 50 - 300 yards.  The zoom feature is nice.  Great quality Great product.  When viewing targets it is nice to have them mounted on a tripod.
5,Very clear optics for the money. Really helps to have such a high light gathering capability.  The 10x50 seems so steady and bright.  Exactly what I was looking for.
5,Works good for looking at stuff a long ways away
4,great zoom.  Great clarity.  Only downside is that these are a bit heavy and you need to support them when in use.
4,My daughter uses these with her bird watching group.  Waiting to see how well the work when viewing owls at night.
4,This purchase was made as a gift for our son who has a home on the river.  We thought he'd enjoy using the binoculars to view boats and barges as they passed on the river.  He seemed to be very pleased with them
5,Had the 10x40s a d loved them. These will let you see extremely far and suprising how clear they still were.
1,They worked great and I was very happy with them until the 3 month mark.  Then suddenly they developed a bind in the focus travel that somehow puts the lenses out of sync so you end up with a double image.  If you play with running the focus travel all the way back in and then out to your focus distance they often will stay aligned.  But any additional back and forth on the focus...like looking around at other distances make it lose alignment again.  Basically unusable at the highest magnification as even messing with it doesn't bring it back to alignment.  Missed the return window so filing a claim with Nikon warranty.  Hope it goes well.
5,Can't say I know much about binoculars but I got these as a gift for my husband. I asked a friend who knows binoculars and he told me which brands were good in my price range. My husband loves them! Says it's the best pair he's used :)
5,I am happy that I bought these binoculars.  They have greatly expanded my ability to see objects both near and far.  I live on the 23rd floor of an apartment building and with these things I can see landmarks 30 + miles away and I can read billboards clearly right down the street.  I know I could have spent more and likely gotten better but I am very happy with these!
5,Purchased this set of binoculars for my husband for Father's Day and he and I both love them!
5,Very easy to focus. Crystal clear viewing.
3,They aren't very good but they work. Adjustable zoom is nice but for the price you can't expect quality glass. I returned mine and got something else for about 50 bucks more that didn't have adjustable zoom and I'm glad I did.
5,These binoculars have excellent clarity and ease of use. There's really nothing else to say. I bought them for my mom as a Christmas gift. If I didn't already have a nice pair of Steiner 12x40 weather-proof binoculars I'd definitely buy these for myself as mine aren't zoom.
5,Very nice.  Almost need a stabilizer!!
4,Love this product except that the rubber caps to protect the small (eye) lenses doesn't fit to well. Just slides on and doesn't grip like it should. I believe this problem is only w/my item. The binocs work great though.
5,These binoculars have been great! Works well clear and adjustable. Comes with lens covers and pouch. Works well!
5,Supera mis expectativas excelente equipo.
4,These binoculars are very reasonably priced and the quality is superior to others.
5,This is a very good binocular for the money.  I had a tasco binocular and it was very good but my apartment flooded and they got water soaked.  I could not find any just like them so I settled with this nikon.  Even though it does not quite measure up the tasco it is a close 2nd.
5,These binoculars are awesome. Very sharp image even on highest power. Highly recommended.
5,Great for any watching or spotting animals
5,Great acuity.  You really don't need the zoom... it is not that much difference in real practice but it is cool to have...
5,very good binoculars. very comfortable with soft rubber at the eye piece. very clear magnification without my glasses on. use them all the time to watch boats go by.
4,good binos but really heavy
5,Very clear good quality for the price.  May be a bit heavy to pack all day long on your neck but in a blind or pulling out of a back pack I had no issues with size or weight.  My hunting crew were all impressed and I expect to see several sets next year based on use of mine.
4,Excellent Binoculars for the price. Good optics. Only possible criticism would be they are a little on the heavy side but jus a little. Highly recommended for those who don't have $600 or more to drop on Birders!
5,We love the binoculars.  We were going to get the 10 x 42 Nikons but when we compared them the 10 x 50's made the subjects look so much more clear.  It was a no brainier on which ones to buy.  We are very happy with them and have had friends buy them after trying them.
5,Works great clear picture came with tripod mount and strap nothing to complain about so far.
4,Very good It's kinda heavy though
5,Great in low light and very comfortable to hold for long durations.  Adjustable eye relief work really good for me.
5,Best price and performance. The zoom is easy to adjust. You do need to lean on a object when power over 15X. Clear view. Come with lens cover but so-so.
5,pretty decent quality set for the price. We have used them as a family to look at different things on camping trips in the car etc.  They don't focus perfectly but for the price they are nice.  i know that there are nicer sets out there but are much more expensive.
5,I don't have a ton of experience with Binoculars. Bought these on a recommendation though and they've been absolutely fantastic for my basic needs. (Probably a bit overkill actually).
4,Nice binoculars. Crispy clear view at 10x - 15x magnification. However when magnification is increased to 22x focusing becomes harder. I guess it might be due to the reduction of the exit pupil diameter.
5,These Binoculars are very good. In order to use for night-sky watching you will need a stand and attachment. You will see much more of wildlife and celestial bodies with the binoculars than your naked eye!
5,Great for the price
3,Decent. Not great. Tough to focus at all levels.  I'll probably reach for my Monarch 8x42 over these and sacrifice the zoom capability for much much better clarity.
5,Good quality binoculars.  We use them almost daily to survey the fields behind our house-checking on the antelope cows and coyotes. when they are around.  Especially like the adjustable eye pads for use with or without glasses on.  Vision acuity is very good when compared to what we had been using.
5,This was a gift.  Good optics.  It came with a strap.  I ordered another strap which I returned.
5,These are a better pair of binoculars than I could find in a brick and mortar store. I like the rubber coating the item feels sturdy. I would recommend this to a friend...
4,works good. pretty clear image for the price
5,I bought the Nikon brand because I respect their experience and expertise.  I am not disappointed.  They feel good in the hands as well.  This is not a flaw but be sure to follow the instructions and focus at the highest power of magnification to minimize refocus issues as you Zoom.
5,I am very happy with this product. I have used it for 3 year now and the picture still clear. Compare with other brand binocular with this price range this is by far the best.
4,Price sold me on these binos The clarity and zoom are good on these binos. A good buy for someone starting out. They feel well contructed Would I buy them again yes I would
5,Very good binoculars for the price. Once I received these I immediately tried them out and was pleasantly surprised. Good range and clarity. I am taking them on a cruise to Alaska in June where I am sure they will get a workout. I would recommend these for beginners to intermediate use. Great for sky watching too.
3,Kind of disappointed with the field of vision. We have binoculars 10X42 that have a much larger and clearer field of vision. I would call the "Aculon 10-22 X 50" more of a 10-22 X 30 certainly not a "50".I probably will keep them but I would not recommend them to anyone.
5,I recently purchased these for a cruise I will soon be going on.  They are very comfortable to use and excellent clarity.  Once again Nikon did not let me down.
5,Very nice binocular! Crystal clear even when zoomed which from what I understand is fairly uncommon. Feels very solid with a nice durable exterior but doesn't feel too heavy. Comes with an easy to use tripod adapter lens caps neck strap and soft carrying case.
5,All as described. Great vision and adjustments. Tripod mount was included but not mentioned.
5,VERY CLEAR
5,Excellent binoculars very clear the variable zoom feature is fantastic.  These binoculars are solid and sturdy but very comfortable to hold not too heavy but not light weight either.  Well worth the price.  Glad I spent a little extra for the adjustable zoom thanks Amazon and Nikon.
5,Great binoculars. Well worth the extra $ spent. I was going to get the standard sizes without zoom but I'm happy I went this the zoom option
1,just received it in mail and was super excitedbut upon backyard tree top inspection thanks to nice sunny dayfound a freaking etched fly on the left lensi m very sad to see the demise of this brandhonestlyvery sad.if u zoom in u don't see the etched fly on the left lensbut when u zoomed out this etched fly will ruin ur view.
5,Just what son needs for hunting and very sharp detail. Amazon has everything I needed for presents and so easy to order and delivered quickly right to my door. This was fantastic due t knee surgery this year.
5,Does the job for me. I don't have a lot of experience in buying this kind of product but I am pleased with the purchase.
4,In the short time I nave had them they perform well and arrived quicker then expected. They may deserve one more star but I have not really tested them yet.
4,Focused well easy to handle weighed more than I thought they would. Overall a good buy.
5,I use these quite often when camping and hunting.  Love them but somewhat heavy
4,I got these for my husband.  He is very happy with them.  They are really huge so don't buy if you are looking for a small one.
5,I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He used themhunting and just raved how good you can see with these.He is very very pleased with them!!!!! Fast delivery too!!
5,Very nice powerful binoculars for the price.  We used during the Eclipse and worked great with handmade solar filters.
5,Quality product.  Would buy again buy with larger optics
5,Great  the go - to for viewing on the water for me !
5,Fantastic.  I bought these to replace my binoculars that I had for years until they broke.  The Nikon lenses are amazing.  The clarity is incredible.  I didn't realize how awful my other set was until I got these.  Worth the extra money.
5,It took me a while to decide what binoculars to buy because of the many different types I think this is the best binoculars due to the different options and looking through them Is really great
4,It is a good binocular.  A bit bulky to carry around but I managed.
5,Very good and very clear. I got these for my dad as a christmas present. Now he takes them out on the boat with him every weekend and he's really been enjoying them. I don't regret the purchase at all.
5,Worked great. Loved the views of Ak.
5,great quality. exactly what i was expecting and wanted
5,I liked that caps for the eyepieces a case and a strap were included.
5,Can't wait for summer to be back. The 10-22 zoom should make a tremendous difference in locating buoys and other navigational aids while on the water. They also come in handy around the house where we are located high on a hill overlooking the water on three sides
5,Product is great; however I wished I had waited until my bird feeding hobby had expanded before my purchase.  Once I learned what was really required to watch the birds I had attracted I probably would have invested in a different product.
4,Expensive
4,These are great for looking at the Vegas Strip from my home. A bit shaky but I put them in my tripod and much improved. Great value.
5,I purchased these for my husband and he says they do a great job.  He thought for the price they were right up there with his high priced binoculars.  They focus well and easily and very clear.  He says a great little binocular!!!!
4,Work great!
3,I like the try pod adapter. For the money  it meets all my expectations.
5,Very nice. Bright image. Not as light as other models but there's a lot of glass in there...
4,Crystal clear lenses great for the occasional (dry weather) wildlife watching we do on our property.  Also easy to use and store. Soft side case is well designed.
5,Good quality
5,High quality optical instrument like all Nikon products. I am so happy with it
5,An excellent purchase - better than I ever expected.  I use them to monitor wild life and am very pleased
5,I was hesitant to open as it came in a banged up box without any secondary box to cushion them. But to my joy they came out great!
5,I am using it everyday to watch the wild horses up the hill in my backyard. It works very well.
4,These binoculars have delivered exactly what I expected from them...very satisfied!  Well built and easy to use...I always try to keep them close at hand.
5,I just received and they are crystal clear. Granted the only other pair I had were a low end $30 pair.
5,Clean crisp optics you'd expect from more expensive binocs. Comes with a tripod adapter so you can set it on an object.
2,No matter how I tried could not get a clear focus.  Returned and bought a Celestron.
5,Excellent field of view. Easy to adjust. Would be nice to have a carry strap.
3,Good binocular but i dont think it worths the price listed. Lense cover wont stay on.
4,went to Glacier Bay Alaska worked well good field of vision optics not crystal clear but very good for the price
5,These binoculars are great the lever to zoom in is perfect and you can find what you want then easily zoom in for more clarity. I love Nikon and this is my 2nd pair of their Binoculars and I love the brand and this product more.
5,Nice  binoculars
5,Perfect for bird watching and sporting events.
5,We live at the lake and these are just awesome for looking across the lake and at the water. We love them!
1,They're advertised as having "Turn and slide eye cups" which I have on another pair of Nikon binoculars I own and really like but these had standard fold over rubber eye cups. Also as noted in another comment I saw they do have a very strong plastic smell to them.
5,By far the best binoculars I have used. Sharp images. Zoom works wonderful. Very happy with these.
4,good quality as expected.
5,These are definitely the best binoculars I've ever used... They are used primarily for work I'm a meter reader with the electric company and I use them a lot...
2,These binoculars were very disappointing. Because of the zoom I thought they would bring the focus in better than my current binoculars "Simmons 8 X  40 " however the zoom only caused the focus to get very fuzzy and blurry. I returned these and got the Nikon 8250  16 X 50 and these were perfect for observing my Eagle's nest as I'm with the Audubon Society.
5,I am a beginner in astronomy using a generic pair of binoculars to watch the night sky very frustrating. I just recieved the aculons and the first impression at looking the night sky was WOW really good quality. one hundred percent recomended.
4,The binocular performed very well in the 10-15x range.Beyond that it started having blind spots but it maybe incorrect handling as well.
5,Excellents binoculars perfect for nigth sky. Very good brightness even with zoom.The grip es perfect for hands but with time maybe a little dirty with dust.Very good finishes it heavy for long time use but it comes with tripod adapter.
5,These binoculars are perfect for my wife and I to view wild life etc. as we camp and fish as well as travel. They are steady as you try to hand hold and view images. The focus is easy and exact.
5,The product either met or exceeded expectations...very pleased
5,Este es un muy buen producto
1,Not you usually quality from Nikon very narrow a somewhat distorted view. Sent them back.
5,Excellent value and best quality in this price range. I've owned several other brands of binoculars (tasco others I can't remember) which were cheaply made and of similar price range. These are miles better and focus is excellent- bright and detailed.
4,They work fine. Just a little heavy to hold still. They are crystal clear. I am having fun viewing the wild birds and sailboats.
5,Love the binos couldn't wait to get them and try them out. Really clear and easy to focus. Brings things really up close.
4,a little heavy but good binoculars
1,Used briefly and variable power stopped working.  Not at all worth $ paid for them.  Nikon customer service requires a lot of work to have a product repaired and forget returning.
4,A good clear view
5,It's a really good binocular.  It's kind of heavy so it's probably not something I would go hiking with but I would definitely take it to go whale watching.
4,I'm very satisfied with it
4,Worked very well met my expectations with bright image sharp focus and easy focus handling. Nikon definitely produce great binoculars.
5,A gift to my grandson.  As an Eagle Scout and has become quite the outdoorsman he is really happy to have this gift.
5,Most of the others I've used lose acuity on higher settings. These stay sharp and are easy to focus. In my opinion Nikon offers the best dollar for dollar value in binocular optics. This is my 4th pair and the quality is just great.
5,Very nice binoculars good grip clear view. I almost bought a cheaper set but I am glad I spent a little more and got these!
5,The iteam was exactly as described. It was a birthday present for my dad and he was very happy with the product. It was perfect for him not too heavy clear vision easily adjustable. Good product. Would recommend.
5,Muy potentes
4,Bought these as a gift and they seem to work great for the price.
5,Really happy with these binoculars good quality and an excellent product. Have since ordered a second pair as a Christmas gift.
4,The neck strap and lens covers are not easy to use.
4,Good optics.  A little high in price compared to other binoculars with the same quality.
5,I own 2 pair of Aculon's LOVE the zoom feature!
4,I bought these to watch birds. Dayum!
5,For the price these are exceptional binoculars I was very pleased with them
2,I got these for deer hunting in the Eastern Sierra.  I was disappointed by the poor image quality  compared to my Nikon Monarch 7 10x42.  At the high magnifications I found it very difficult to look through the lenses for any length of time. Eventually I put these away and went back to using the Monarchs. I plan to return them.
5,Nice to have for bird watching on my porch.
5,Great binoculars! I use them for viewing birds and monarch butterflies. Really powerful and exceptionally clear. My only complaint is that they can become a little heavy around my neck when I wear them too long.
5,These are very high quality binoculars at a decent price.  I have been very pleased with my purchase.
5,These were purchased for my son as a gift.  He loves them. He says he can read the size on the tires on the car across the street.  I guess that means they are awesome!!!
5,Excellent product - Easy to use right out of the box.  the tri-pod accessory is excellent. Perfect for the shooting range.
5,Very nice item in extremely high quality I use it for game watching and animal watching it works very well.
5,love them clear vision and 50 X zoom really brings object close
5,Very nice for the price.  A little bigger than I would carry hiking but great for watching the neighbors through their windows.
3,Would have like the lens cover caps to be able to affix to the straps. The width adjustment should be able to go more narrow.
4,very nice
5,You can see pretty far with these. Love them.
5,My brother in law loved these. He said that the binoculars were top notch. Very pleased with them!!!!
5,We're not pros but these are the best binoculars that we've had (and we've had a few sets).  Excellent quality excellent zoom.  Couldn't be happier especially for the price
2,Surprised by the inferior image quality of this zoom.  Hazy flat image throughout the entire zoom range is strikingly different from fixed magnification Aculon binoculars eg. 10x42 and 16x50.  Hard focusing with the zoom lever encountering resistance half way was very unexpected.  Extremely disappointing product.
2,Worked ok the first year hunting. This year they were starting to fog and difficult to focus even at less than 200 yards. Will spend a little more $ next time and get a lifetime warranty from a different brand.
4,About the best glass for the money. Lightweight and crystal clear. recommend 100%
5,Binoculars arrived on time. Packaging was good no issues at all. The binoculars are awesome. First powerful ones I own. My gosh they are amazing. Look at the moon every chance I get.
1,The Binoculars magnify well and the picture is very clear however the focus ring for the right eye has no impact.  It will move however it will not adjust the focus. Returning for a replacement
5,Really enjoy and excited that i brought this binoculars can't wait for my next cruise in may to get a closer look at things.
5,Purchased these for myself and absolutely love them only have had the small ones without very much magnification and these are amazing!
5,Purchased these so the other half could birdwatch.  She says they are excellent with a wide field and great zoom feature. Good value for the money.
5,Have ordered this itewm on several occasions for my workers in the field they are very satified and happy with the way this camera operates would highly reccommend ecpecially the price well priced...
5,I gave these to my 95 year old cousin and the is thrilled with them.
3,What do you expect for that kid of money :)
5,took these on a trip to alaska on a one week cruise.  Love the zoom lever.  Glass is clear and the tripod mount that was included me in handy.
5,Nikon quality as usual.Amazing sharpness and unique 3D effect.
5,Perfect for my needs and the best part is that this a NIKON nothing more to add...
1,First of all when you select "one star" the tool-tip text comes up as "I hate it". Well I don't hate Nikon. I'm fairly disappointed however. The product came out of the box with diverged oculars (edit: gee I guess I'm not the only one). In other words "double vision". Serious double vision. But that is not the end of it. The glass has chromatic issues as well. I used to be a big fan of Nikon but these days my $$$ are going to V****x both in rifle scopes and binoculars. I am going with a pair that are 4x the cost of these Nikon's. I'm sick of junk made in China. Nikon... What happened???
5,These were a gift for my husband who loves them.  Any time I get a chance to use them for birding I have to agree.  They were a good choice.
5,Very nice binoculars. They exceeded my expectations.
5,Very nice binoculars for the money.  We spend part of the year in a critter rich environment.  These will held us enjoy the wildlife of the area.  I certainly do recommend them.
2,I purchased these binoculars for hunting. When I pulled them out of the package they were showing double vision. I had the guys I work with look through them to make sure it wasn't just me. They all agreed the binoculars were bad. I had no issue returning them that experience was ok! I'm sure the bino's are good I just got a bad pair!!
5,Excellent stable clear. Highly recommend. When you go bigger you lose stability.
5,Good product
5,Great pair of glasses. Protective casing really works against dropping.
5,Well built and very clear.
4,works great
2,Not clear. And on any zoom above normal impossible to hold still to be able to see
5,Very good!!
5,Nikkon is the best
4,My only complaint is the lens caps aren't that great.
5,These are a great bargain.
5,This NIKON ACULON Model 8252 10-22 x 50 It just Quality well made solid Made well protected rubber glass it clear no fog or distortion !!!!! A+
5,This binoculars are awesome! I like heavy and bulky stuff I hate  when something does not have a proper weight and or is kinda flimsy.
5,Excellent set of binoculars clear and gather plenty of light.  Would highly recommend.  Zoom feature is nice to locate object in field of view easier before zooming in.
4,Good
5,I purchased these for my dad. He loves watching  wild life. The quality is fantastic! Great for star gazing as well!
3,AsLong as you don't zoom past a about 14 it is ok. I'm not very impressed
4,Wish the zoom focused more. Blurry
5,Great for price
4,Excellent purchase and shipping help.
5,product arrived when predicted.  Good quality for the price paid.  I have used Bushnell and Pentaxand I would recommend these to anyone from birding to ocean viewing.
5,Good
4,only problem a little heavy
5,Works amazing you can seen the needles clearly on a pine at 150 yards
4,Great quality very easy to use.
5,I bought these for stargazing and they have absolutely delivered. Keep in mind that Location is a huge factor in how well any stargazing equipment/telescope will work. I use these when at a designated Dark Park or in the remote mountains of Colorado. They will reliably view the moons of Jupiter and I have even seen hints of the rings of Saturn. The lens covers are the only issue I have with these I have not been able to get them to stay on ever. They are very robust they have traveled in a shaking bouncing lurching vehicle going on multiple overlanding routes in extremely rough terrain and only showed any issues on the focus on the most recent trip. However one of the reasons I bought these is that they are easy to adjust and get back into focus. I would absolutely recommend these.
5,Great binoculars except they're so clear and powerful at higher magnification that you really need a tripod. Fortunately I have a tripod and the Aculon comes with an adapter.
5,Purchased for wife to look at birds.etc.. she loved them
5,Nice for the money.
5,I'm going to order another one of these for my hunting friend.  Best pair of Binos I have ever owned!
1,I HAVE OWNED AND USED A SIMILAR PAIR OF NIKON'S FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS.  FINALLY DECIDED TO GET A 2ND PAIR WITH ADJUSTABLE ZOOM.  THEY LASTED FOR 3 OUTINGS ON MY MONTHLY VOLUNTEER DUTY AS A RAPTOR MONITOR FOR CPW.  THE EYE ASSEMBLY COMPLETELY FELL FREE OF THE MAIN FOCUS SCREW.  ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT NIKON AND WENT THROUGH PHONE ROULETTE- NEVER CONNECTING TO ANYONE THAT COULD TROUBLE SHOOT (IS THERE A WAY TO FIX?).
5,Spectacular clarity even at full zoom.  Love the texture great fit and feel in your hands.
5,Excelente marca. Feliz con ellos
3,Came right on time just what i wanted. Wish the box wasn't as torn up. But other then that it was perfect!
5,Like the distance but have trouble keeping it steady.  Not sure if it's due to the weight or more power that I'm not used to.
5,Definitely worth the investment.
5,This is a good multifunction binocular. I use it cloud watching and target spotting. It is nice to have the extra power when needed.
5,It delivers what it promises. It's ergonomic comfortable and it has a good reach.
5,You can see really good and far
5,Increíble
4,Nice
5,They are well made and the ZOOM works like it should.  My wife uses them for birds in the back yard and at the beach.
5,Excellent quality.
5,Very good product but quite pricy
4,good
5,Great Product!
5,Very clear lenses reasonably lightweight and easy to handle.  These were purchased primarily for use on the gun range - great for the price!
4,Very satisfied
5,Good price for good quality zoom binos.
5,Love them.  Needed a good pair and Nikon delivered.
5,Pleased with this purchase.  Thank you
5,Bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband.  Great product and impressive for the value.  We are very pleased with them.
4,Good product
5,Clear and lightweight. Love em. Only draw is that are not waterproof.
5,Greet seller!! Good product!
5,Great binoculars and the zoom feature is outstanding!
5,Supercool.  Get it.  Great price.
4,👍
5,Excellent.  Love them.
5,Great product. Keeps the action in full and sharp view. I have other Nikon product and this doesn't disappoint. Wonderful. Thanks.
5,love the zoom feature.
5,Love it.  Good zoom function clear optics
5,These are excellent binoculars.  The distance and focus are great.
5,Nice binocular with good field of view
2,FAKE NIKON. Not Nikon at all. Heavy. Optics not Nikon. Buyer beware
5,Perfect for my hunting.
5,Great binoculars
5,Excellent optics.  Comes with tripod mount which would be needed for long term viewing; relatively heavy binocs.
5,Great.
5,great binoculars! Use them on an Alaskan trip.  Exactly what i was looking for!
3,these binocs provide good magnification and image quality for the price but the eyecups are like hard plastic really not comfortable to use.
5,perfect for watching Eagles in our back yard
5,Built like a tank. Recommended.
5,The best binoculars I've ever owned. So clear and the zoom is great. I just don't know why I need to add 7 more words?
1,I've always thought of Nikon was a top quality manufacturer but I guess even with Nikon you get what you pay for.  The complaint is with the optics and coatings since it doesn't gather light as well as a 50mm objective lens should and there seems to be hazing and distortion when using at higher magnification. I've gone back to my old Leupold 10x42s.  So I consider these a waste of money and will invest in something better when I have the simoleans.
3,nice
2,Just too big & heavy.
5,Excellent clarity in low light and zoom quality is good in maintaining focus everything I expected from a Nikon
5,Very good for the price.  These are excellent to look at birds and bobcats and coyotes and everything else in our back yard.
5,Great Binoculars crystal clear and really pulls the items close
5,If you want binoculars that do zoom and can do it all this is you pair.  Second pair and I love them.
5,These are great!
5,These work great!
3,Thought a Nikon would have great clarity of image..Very average and basically matches cheaper competitor models..Over-priced for name only..Not performance..
5,Work well zoom is handy. I would have preferred if they were waterproof or at least water resistant.
5,NIKON IS SIMPLY THE BEST IN ALL RESPECTS! FABULOUS PRODUCT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
5,Image quality is excellent rubber coating on the body is effective for most situations.  Overall very pleased with the quality for the price point.
5,Work great very clear! A bit bigger than anticipated but if you don't care about the size they're a good investment!
5,Excellent binoculars. I can see far goes perfectly with this product that is not too expensive. I am satisfied
5,Great binoculars
5,Lived up to my expectations!Great value $$$$
5,This is a nice set of binoculars. Very clear and good power; being used on a boat out in the bay recipient like them a lot.
5,they do what they claim and are well made; going to do something a little different than envisioned to keep up with lens caps
5,These are really nice easy to use.
5,Powerful with a zoom. Not too difficult to hold still.
5,Works well! Clear view. Solid construction.
5,Great binocular very clear. Very comfortable to look through. However it is fairly heavy (50mm lens afterall) so be warned.
5,These are powerful and easy to use. Just what I was wanting.
5,Wow...really awesome pair of binoculars!!! The zoom feature works fantastic.  The only criticism is the case it really sucks!!!
5,You won't beat these for the price.  I think they are as good as my buddy's $1500 pair.
5,Good price for a very nice piece of equipment.
5,Excellent product! Fine rubber finish. Very high quality. The zoom option is smooth and very easy to use. Totally recommended.
5,excellent!
5,Very good
1,It’s insanely difficult to adjust the focus for those unfortunate enough to wear glasses. Only one eye has adjustment and for the other you have to fiddle with other knobs. If you change the zoom level - you have to adjust everything all over again. Clearly whoever came up with this solution never has to use it :(
5,A Christmas gift for our son and he loves the binoculars. They are very clear and sharp. Great purchase and would definitely recommend.
5,great item
5,Sweet pair of glasses.  Use the. For rifle spoting. Come with tripod mounts.
5,Great binocs beats bushnell any day.
5,Love them
5,Two words....quality and powerful.
5,Great optics very clear.
5,Great product...crystal clear focus!!
5,very nice and clear love the way you can zoom in
5,Excelent focus and luminity. Very good value for money. After so many years sufferong the bad quality of cheap binoculars I deserved Nikon
5,These are the best binoculars I have ever bought!!
5,Super set of glasses you'll be able to see them coming to better protect your family and farm animals .
2,I returned these because the zoom knob wouldn't rotate all the way to the 10x magnification. Zooming always changed the focus. These are made in China not Japan and the overall mediocre quality reflects that. Not recommended.
5,Excellent product.
5,Fantastic Binoculars at a very good price. The Nikon lenses are excellent and give a super clear view.
5,Great product for the money.  If you are looking for a good pair of binoculars for a reasonable price these are it.
5,Just the best binocular I ever had. Even with the size there is not to much weight. Really comfortable to use.
2,It was deeply disappointing to receive these Nikon glasses and "see" the poor internal optics which seemed to haze every sharp edged object viewed with blue & red auras. I returned the glasses as I could get that poor optical performance in brands that cost 1/3 as much.
5,These were a gift for an 11 year old. Weight was spot on. Clarity is great.
5,Got it for a sea and land trip to Alaska and Canada ...I was not disappointed
5,Love these binoculars great quality and Nikon makes very nice products..
5,These are great binoculars.  Clear sharp image not mush else to comment on..They were a great price!
5,girlfriend is going to s Africa  this will make her trip enjoyable
5,these are a great size excellent clarity good zoom feature easy to use and a solid investment definitely satisfiedthanks Nikon
5,I bought these binoculars for 1 month and are very good quality and good price. I think arte verry good for hunting
5,these are terrific binoculars. Great zoom feature. Highly recommend
5,great binoculars! Very clear and you can see very far.. well worth it
5,I've had a lot of different binoculars and these are the best.
5,Excellent product!
1,I bought one pair and it had double image out of the box. returned immediately for another pair and came in working fine after about 3 months in the closet I brought them out and again with the double image and the zoom did not work (by this time the return policy had expired of course). I am a long time fan of Nikon but these were really disappointing product twice!
3,Just ok
5,Excellent product for price good feel good look does the job
5,These binoculars are a little heavier than I would like but they are truly fantastic!
5,What can I say Nikon. You get great quality at a great price crisp clear field of viewI just love them.
5,This product is an excellent!!! High quality binocular! Very good magnification!
2,they are not very clear when zoomed in. I expected more for the money
3,I like everything about the 7x50 Aculon binoculars except the narrow 6.4 degree (335 ft at 1000 yds) field of view.  For astronomy I need at least 7 degrees like the wide 7.1 degree Orion Scenix 10x50 binoculars.  So I decided to buy the Orions instead.  Sorry Nikon.
5,These are great. Used for hunting
3,Great optics very clear and zoom is assome
5,cool
3,ok xwb es
5,Very clear easy to adjust great range. Best I have seen in a long time.

1,Five minutes out of the box and the zoom stopped working.  Stupid of me to think that I could get decent high-powered binoculars at such a low price.  If it sounds too good to be true ...  Don't waste your time or money on these.

5,Good
5,Very nice Binoculars.
5,excellent price
5,good
1,We bought 10*50 but I got 10*42.That’s not right. Let me know pleaseThanksKetan shah
2,not a good zoom
5,Works great.
5,Perfect
5,good.
1,The worst product on the planet.  Poor optics poor balance Poor everything.  But this if you want to waste money.  It excels at that.
1,Again wanted a nice magnification of targets.  Not acceptable.  I sent it back.
5,I’ve  never had a pair of binos that had zoom. Now I’ll never be without. Excellent.
5,I purchased these Nikon zoom binoculars recently. I had a set of Rugged exposure zoom binoculars that broke down and malfunctioned and these Nikon's were bought to replace them. Rugged exposure was a former binocular brand sold by Big 5 sporting goods a while back. You open up the Nikon binocular box and everything reeks of high quality. Nikon really goes out of their way to provide the best buying experience around in binoculars. The weight and size of these Nikon's are about average for 50mm sized binoculars. Much more convenient to carry around than the larger heavier 60mm and 70mm binocular models.  The multi coated optics and BAK4 prisms provide excellent clarity and image sharpness which you would expect at this price level. They give you a nice padded case and the included neck strap looks very nice also. These binoculars have a 10 year warranty. Some of the Chinese manufacturers try to copy this Nikon zoom model and they offer the same 10 year warranty but who knows if they will still be around in 10 years? These binocular copies are sold on Amazon for about 50$ dollars less than the Nikon model.  If you're looking for an upgrade and improved optical performance these Nikon's offer over the lower priced zoom binoculars with BAK7 prisms being sold under that 100$ dollar mark then I would highly recommend these as a purchase choice. These binoculars would work well for bird watching or terrain sightseeing a very versatile compact sized binocular for all around use.
1,Small view
2,Had this for 2 years loved them. But yesterday they fell off my coffee table and the zoom didn't work no more. Thought they would be tougher then that.
4,If you want 10-22x50 power these are difficult to beat. I thought they would be substantially better than the Nikon Action model but you can't beat the stats. The brightness will always be determined by the 50mm focal limitation and it will always be lighter and smaller at 10x and a bit dimmer and larger at 22x. Both the Action and Aculon are going to be fairly the same. Both are comparable but the Aculon will be a bit sharper around the edges but both are about the same in the middle. I like the Action better because the tripod adapter is included. The Aculon may have a bit more contrast but if so it's difficult to see. Both are adequately sharp and the Action zoom no longer is made. I think they're so close that I'd go for an Action pair it I could find them as they'd be a bit cheaper. And the tripod adapter is nice. The optical difference is so slight I doubt you could tell the difference.
5,Here's the spec sheet link for the Nikon Aculon A211 -- 10 22 X 50mm.[...]A 10 power binocular is at the outer limits of what can be used without a tripod or some support/brace. 50mm objective gathers a lot of light and the extra weight helps hold the binocular steady. These are NOT a binocular for field use. Bird watchers would likely be better served with a 7 power 35mm binocular or similar. (I like the Nikon 8 X 25 waterproof I purchased more than a decade ago.)The Aculon A211 in 10-22 X 50 works well for observation from a fixed position. We use them for spotting Grey Whale migration where the whales are 4 miles or more off shore and the spotting position is in the realm of 1000' off the water. 10 power is useful for these working distances. More power requires a tripod in most situations.Because I wear glasses I was concerned about the 8.6 mm eye relief. Recommended eye relief with glasses is generally about 15mm. But this spec is the eye relief with the eye cups extended. With the eye cups retracted relief is sufficient for eyewear.Zoom control is on the right lens. Diopter control is on the left lens instead of the more standard right lens. This means adjusting the diopter for the left eye rather than the right eye. I know my adjustment for the right eye. I needed to run through the adjustment drill for the left eye. (Not a big deal. It's simple and anyone who owns binoculars should understand this adjustment. Articles/links are available online.)They're Nikon -- no corners cut quality optics. Rugged durable water and fog resistant. And a Nikon warranty.10 22 X 50 mm binoculars are pretty specialized. But if these are what you need Nikon is a great choice!
5,I bought these Aculon A211 10x50 Binoculars on sale from a retail sporting goods store. I was able to test them out in the store and also outside. I liked the brightsharp and contrasty view these Binoculars provided. Everything looked great at the store so I decided to buy a pair.They feel solid in the hand and all the adjustments are smooth and well dampened. The rubber coating is solid and provides both protection and grip. Nikon used a different texture on the thumb grips similar to what my Digital SLR has.The optics are very sharp compared to an older pair of Minolta 10-22x50 Binoculars that I was borrowing from my father. While this particular pair on Aculon A211 is fixed at 10 power I can actually see more detail in every type of lighting condition compared to my fathers Minolta's at 22 power! The images are free of distortion once you are focused on your subject. However I did notice that if something is out of focus the bottom of the image will have a sort of fisheye effect until the image is brought into focus. Once focused on something the distortion disappears.One more benefit to these A211's is the generous eye relief. So if you wear glasses like I do then you won't have any issues. The shoulder strap is the same size as the one on my Nikon D7000 DSLR so its plenty big for a pair of 10x50 binoculars like this. The Aculon 10x50's are not heavy at all.These Binoculars come with a nice sized case which has plenty of room to fit the Binoculars in. You don't have to fiddle with anything just slip the Binoculars right in and your on your way.The front and rear lens caps are good not great. The rear cap slips on easy but the front caps clip onto the inside rim on the rubber overhang on the objective lens. They have a secure fit but I think they might get lost easily if you don't pay attention to them.Overall I'd recommend these to anyone. They are sharp and well made Binoculars at a great price.
3,I bought a pair of these off of Amazon but the seller is no longer listed and my review is in limbo?AnywayThese are excellent binocs up until around 16x or so.14x-15-16x range they max out realistically.Then you can start seeing accelerated blurring on up until 22x.At 10x I could barely make out old nearly faded off print on the side of a tractor trailer trailer at probably 250yds."blah blah something Shipping".At 16x I could easily see the words.At 22x it was a blurred mess.At nearly the same distance I could make out (barely) the mortar lines on my neighbors brick home at 16x.At 22x it was just an orange/red house.At 1/4 mile at night on 22x I could easily see larger moths flying around a street light.Not with super clarity but good enough to see white and yellow dots moving around.The magnification adjuster seems a bit flimsy to me but I suppose that could just be me.To me the unadjustable grainey ness above around 16x makes these seem cheap.Having said that 10-15x is still a 50% increase.  15x is a LOT of mag for free standing.These would probably be a better set of glasses with a more robust mag ring and calibrated just for 10-15x.
4,I have been an optical designer for 20+ years and have had many binoculars.I have had these for over a year. They are very good in most respects. One problem is the alignment shifts from low to high Zoom. I was seeing double images at the top of Zoom. I noticed that if I used my thumb as I looked through the binoculars I could move the eyepieces up or down a little and the images merged nicely. I made a workaround with some plastic shims. They are put under the eyepiece focus slides on each side.  That kept the alignment even. You just need to figure out which way to move the eyepieces. All is good now and they are working well. Nice and sharp. If you need the work around go to youtube and search for - Harry Siebert Nikon Zoom repair - and watch the video.Harry Siebert
5,I have gotten more active with hunting and finally decided this past season that it was time for me to get a pair of "real" binoculars.  My first pair was a "cheapie"  set of 16x (no zoom range) that was a bit more convenient than looking through my rifle scope but my scope offered much better optics.  I did not see a single deer on this latest field trip so I had plenty of time/opportunity to work these binos.What was I thinking?!?  As soon as I looked through these binoculars in the field I was kicking myself because I should have put the $30 I spent on the other binoculars toward these.  Being from Nikon the optics are crystal clear.  The zoom (right lens) diopter (located on the left lens) and focus (located between the lenses) are conveniently located and easily manipulated.  These binoculars have good weight to them--they aren't the lightest things in the world but the weight helps to keep them steady at the higher range of the zoom.  They also come with a pretty nice case with a built-in belt loop (although I would not wear it on a belt).The only obvious short-cut are the lens covers.  For the objective lenses there are two removable caps that stay in just fine but come off completely so you have to worry about putting them somewhere safe when you are using the binoculars.  The eyepiece covers are a single piece of plastic--essentially two cups connected by a flexible bridge--that can come off pretty easily when the binoculars are folded up.  Had decent lens covers been included this set would have been perfect.Even so the binoculars are so good I can't drop a star because of the eyepieces.  Since getting them I've used them for wildlife observation in our backyard my son has used them to look at the moon for a school project and he loved it ("WOW Dad!!!! I can really see the moon now!) and I'm looking forward to taking them out with me hiking this spring and camping this summer.  An excellent set of binoculars that you won't regret purchasing.
5,A few years ago I bought my daughter a pair pair of $600 Leupold 10x50 roof prism binocs that wee exceptional. She's an avid birder! But recently I wanted to update my 7x26's so tried out a lot of binocs. For about $120 this pair of porro prism binocs performs exceptionally well. They are not water-proof fog-proof or light weight. There is some curvature of field and some chromatic aberration at the edges. But the view is fantastic!Seriously... I don't go bird watching in the rain and frankly the bird is always centered while trying to ID. So all those 'negative' aspects that raise the price to $1000 or more just don't offer true value for money at least for me. If you have been following binocular design for a while you will know that porro prism designs are much easier to optimize and that many early roof prism model were very dark and had similar negative properties. Some birding sites actually recommend similar Nikon porro prism models for quality of view. I also like the rubberized grip of this model they fit the hand well and have good eye clearance though I don't wear glasses.If you can visit a store that lets you try out a number of models... you'll be surprised at how much binocular $120 can buy!
4,Well pictures I posted clearly can't show what you actually see but there are a few things I disliked most of all is the tunnel effect that is very visible and it goes away at maximum zoom but as expected the max power can be used only with binocular on a tripod.The things I did like is the built quality and actually I did like the zoom option even if it isn't perfect. Unfortunately you can't expect much more than what you get for the price.I would buy it again since I did like the possibility to have a super powerful binocular that isn't too bulky.
4,I received these binoculars as a gift and in turn liked them well enough to purchase another set as a gift for a family member. Through a bit of  research we determined this 10x50 is the highest you can reasonably go without needing a tripod and my experience bears this out. They are on the heavy side but clear viewing and easy focusing capacity make them worth the weight.
5,Bought these spur of the moment from DSG to see the NEOWISE comet. Totally rocks for seeing the comet even when naked eye viewing is shut down with haze/some clouds. As a bonus (July 2020) you can see 4 moons around Jupiter. Had a telescope years ago but the viewing experience with these binoculars is way better. Definitely helps to have a tripod (whatever brand it was from BB used for a small video camera works great on the tripod) but the rubber grip/large size makes it pretty easy to hold steady enough without one. The 10x50 specs are frequently mentioned in stargazing/sky and telescope articles as being a good entry point equipment-wise. Totally happy with this purchase.
4,Nice and looks like a great quality but I had to return them because they strained my eyes after only few minutes of use.
4,Excellent product very easy to use an amazing zoom and outstanding clear images. the only thing I did not like is that the lens protector covers are very easy to get lost it would be great that Nikon would make that cover piece to get attached to the binocular body. Other than that they are a great product for the price  I do recommend it widely
4,Nice binoculars for a good price
4,Good. Clear. But 4 stars because it is not siting to ayes perfectly.
5,I bought this as a gift for my adult son. I read many reviews of various brands before deciding on this purchase. My son reports that they work great. He has an acre+ and wanted to be able to view the wildlife that comes through closer to house but also wanted to be able to look out a hills nearby. He is very happy with how these meet his needs.
4,I am not disappointed in the quality and functionality of these bino's but I am not sure that the price is warranted.  Sure these spectacles carry the Nikon name but I am not so convinced that the name includes better quality than competing vendors.  I recommend trying these out in a store alongside brand name competitors before purchasing on amazon.
5,I''ve had issues with binoculars but these fit the bill. My smaller ones were too jittery to help much. Not a huge fan of the case but I'll be looking for one and maybe a few accessories... Probably too big to bring to a Dodger game...
4,waterproof comes in handy when in the moist and damp weather hefre in Oregon especially along the coast.
5,Got them a few days ago for just about a bit more than 100 EURO  as an "Amazon Warehouses" deal. Someone must have purchased it by mistake and returned it unopened (as they were obviously never used).I was shocked by the quality of the optics both at 10X and up to 22X. The image stays sharp and very clear all the way. For example I can see someone`s individual hair strands from some massive distances. Printed patterns on clothing even if they are quite fine. etc etc.I never owned binoculars before but used some occasionally and I don`t remember being so surprised as by these.For the reference I have very good eyes myself and don`t require glasses.Anyway image quality alone i really doubt these can be beaten. Of course construction quality while being very solid and adequate does reflect the price. It doesn't look like a 1000 EUR binocular because it`s not one.
5,I use the 10x50 version as my go to for launches. The magnification is strong enough for pad exploration and in flight tracking. Having diopter'd in the lenses the picture is super clear. They are on the weighty side but by far the best value for under $100.
5,As good as any $300 Binocular. These sell for $125.00 at most stores. The most important feature to me is the short distance it will focus. Have you ever seen bird that is close to you and you want to look even closer with your binoculars ?  This model will focus as close as 22 Feet. Most binoculars will not do that. A very important feature. You will love these. They also have a tripod attachment. I use it on a small 12" tripod at the shooting range. Also look at the 10-22x50 Zoom Model. For a little more money it may be the best buy.
5,Get em!! Very nice optics crystal clear viewing! I had tried 2pairs of giant binos as I'm using for astronomy. Bad luck on both pairs poor collmination . And really didn't want to invest several hundred on a pair. Tried these and I'm very impressed!! Nice viewing of star clusters able to see Andromeda galaxy decently no this isn't a telescope you won't get a great view but did satisfy me also nice view of Orion Nebulae as well as good detail of the moon. These are a few objects in my night sky atm. I'm impressed!! Much more convenient to grab and go for the night sky!! I do suggest a tripod for extended periods of viewing they will get heavy.
5,I absolutely love these binoculars! I have very poor eyesight but these Nikon binoculars have allowed me to see absolutely razor sharp images of both birds and astronomical objects. The colors seen throught these binoculars is just wonderful as well as the abilty to show very fine detail such as a chickadee's individual breast feathers. The colors are sharp and bright and very natural. Even with poor seeing due to surrounding light pollution I can now see in the night sky what was formerly visible to me 30 or 40 years ago. Wracked my brain to find a negative but nothing came up. A pair of these will cost you about the same as two family dinners but will find constant use and enjoyment not to mention learning about the natural world that exists outside of ourselves.
4,love them!
5,Bang for the buck - EXCELLENT. Steady hands at 22x though !!!
5,These binos purchased 15 years ago had a screw fail so I sent them in for the minor repair and Nikon sent me a new pair! Outstanding customer support from Nikon that exceeded my expectations.
5,Excellent! I received these as a gift and find them to have excellent clarity with a 3d like effect. Easy to use without a tripod if you have steady hands.  I enjoy them so much I will pick up another pair for shorter distance .  I have also tried a pair of Simmons 10x50 for comparison and although they were sharp the Nikon excels in clarity. I have used these for stargazing also
5,I went hunting recently with a pair of Wal-mart Bushnells and my buddy had a pair of expensive Swarovski binoculars. I immediately felt like throwing the Bushnell's away and shelling out out $2K for a pair of those bad boys! I ended up buying these at a local small business store while buying ammunition. For $100 you cannot beat the value! The image is at least 90% what the Swarovski is when doing a side by side comparison. Even he was impressed with how good they were! Another great product for the money from Nikon.
3,I compared the aculon 10-22 x 50 and the fixed zoom 10 x 50 in the shop. I felt that the fixed 10x was much clearer than the adjustable zoom. At 22x it didn't seem much clearer than the fixed 10x. If you are only going to use it as handheld...I'd say go with the 10x.
5,These are the best binoculars I have ever owned. It seems like I have owned dozens of Bushnells and Tascos. Not only do these brands have inferior optics but they do not hold up either. They tend to come out of alignment over time and thus are rendered useless. The Nikons have a bold and bright image and are exceptionally clear. It is the first binocular I have ever owned without wanting to upgrade. The downside. They are a little clunky and heavy. If you are a pure fan of portability than these may not be for you.Ihowever am a happy camper.
5,Incredible optics from Nikon at an affordable price these will outperform those twice their price. Bak 4 prisms multicoated glass lenses and tough rubber housing.Forget Bushnells in this range and check these out.Pros- Aspheric multi coated lenses  - Bak 4 prisms  - Tough rubber housingCons- Not waterproof ( typical in this price range)Yes I highly recommend these binoculars!
5,Nikon are the best binoculars. I had a chance to use mine from aircraft as a scanner for enemy vehicle traffic in combat. I tried the government issue but they couldn't compare. The Nikon binoculars were even usable at night whereas the others were not.
5,Great binoculars.  Magnification pulled the sea lions sunning on the rocks a couple miles offshore wonderfully  into view.
2,I had my Aculon binoculars out in the rain this morning. Water leaked into one side and now they are pretty much useless (inside is fogged up). I have had the binoculars for about a year now and they have been very well taken care of never dropped. I'm pretty disappointed.
5,For the money... EXCELLENT!!
1,Extremely disappointed in Nikon. I bought these from B&H. I know they are cheap but I expected more. I wanted a binocular that I would not worry about damaging. The field of view is extremely small the optics no where near my most inexpensive Leica or Zeiss.
1,I received a Nikon Aculon A211 10X50 from Nikon in place of a Lookout III 10X50 which they chose not to repair under warranty. They sent me an email after two months saying they would replace my Lookout III with a Aculon A211 I thought that was more than fair because I have never used a Nikon Binocular that I didn't like or was not good quality. The Aculon A211 is the worse binocular I have ever used. You need to TRY BEFORE YOU BUY and spend a little time ajusting handling and comparing. Nikon only charged me $10 repair fee plus $12.85 shipping and I paid $12.35 shipping my binocular to them a total of about $36. There are better $29.95 binoculars everywhere.
3,tough to focus.  too big for carrying on trips
1,Took them hunting it was around 30 degrees out and could not keep them from fogging up. Then it started snowing and that ruined them. Now you can't see through them anymore due to condensation or moisture in the lens. The nocs are probably good for bird watching and that's about it
1,It can not adjust eyecup! Be aware dont be cheated by fake info.
1,They didn't meet my expectation. I thought you would be able to zoom in a lot closer but not the case.
5,We have had very good luck with these binoculars. Clarity is fantastic.
5,I love these binoculars. I got them for a trip to Alaska and loved being able to see landscape and wildfire up closer. I recommend using as tripod of as I did the ship’s rail to steady them when using the highest power. It tends to juggle with that magnification but they are really good.
5,buen equipo llego rapido y cumplio mis expectativas. gracias
4,Quality
5,high quality but also high price
5,All I expected from Nikon !
5,I've bought numerous binoculars ranging from Leopold to Vortex and a few more. For the money this is the best clarity and magnification for your dollar. I will be saling the rest of my hunting binoculars...
5,Great binoculars.
5,This is a nice pair of  binoculars Worth the price
5,I have owned cheaper binoculars and use them on a lake where I need to focus on longer distances for bird watching and wildlife.  If anything moved it was difficult to keep focus or magnification was poor.  These Nikon 8252 A211 10-22x50 are awesome!  Optics are super and it is like going from blurry to sharp focus.  Wish I would have made this investment many years ago!  I am finally enjoying looking through the binoculars.  I am already looking for a smart phone adaptor to show what I am view through the lens.  If your looking for a high quality magnification binoculars Nikon 10-22x50 are perfect!
5,Quite well indeed!
5,Does the job!
5,Bought these for my husband. He Loves them.
5,Excelente producto calidad precio
5,Gave as  gift to an outdoorsman and he loved them.
5,Got this for a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES it. We use it while fishing and hiking not so much bird watchers ourselves. It’s got a nice case which is compatible and easy to store. Can’t express how much we love using these
5,Glasses were like new as advertised.  Viewing quality is stunning.
5,It comes with a tripod adapter and neck strap and a padded case as well as lens caps. Very clear optics and the zoom is smooth. Would buy again.
5,Very nice easy to use.
5,Second pair I’ve owned. Good quality at fair price.
5,Bought this for my husband for Christmas and his eyes opened so big when he opened the box! This Nikon binocular model is not the highest end of Nikons but feels solid in your hand has a sharp image and delivers quality view! Just like you would expect.
5,iT IS a great product and bird watching
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             These are incredible! I read a ton of reviews before I chose these & I am so glad I did for the price I am very happy and they arrived right before the lunar eclipse.
5,Just make sure you focus these at high power before shortening using low power instead of the other way around or they will likely go out of focus.  They seem very clear and useful.
5,These are very nice. Lets in good light and as much magnification as you can get and still have a still image.
5,Bought these for stargazing. Have not been disappointed. First night I found the moons of Jupiter and gazed at the full moon in high detail. I can easily view stars invisible to my naked eye.I did buy a $10 tripod mount as well to make some objects easier to spot that was nice.The only negative is that my lens covers do seem to easily fall off the strap when they're dangling while in use. It's supposed to be an easy way to keep track of them but I'm more comfortable storing them in the carrying case.
5,Not too bad I love them
5,As promised these binoculars Nikon deliver. What a step up from my last pair. Being rural delivery took longer than ever before. That doesn’t take away from the product quality. For the money these make visible a segment of an aqua duct system traveling through the  mountains miles away.
4,Good set of binoculars...a bit of the heavy side though. The one i received did not have the adjustable eye cups..so had to return it. Overall a good piece.
2,I wanted to like these I really did. I even unboxed them after I had decided to return them for one more try...but to no avail. They just don't work for me. After much research and agonizing over whether to spend the extra money to buy Nikon over Bushnell it seems that I made the wrong choice.  The very first thing I noticed when I tried them was the very finicky eye relief (much more so than my other two pairs of Bushnells). It was hard to keep a picture at 10 power and I saw slight color fringes around the bare branches of a tree I was focused on (isn't that only supposed to happen around the edges of the image not in the middle?). Then I zoomed in and lost the picture *completely*. I tried again and again but there was literally no position I could hold these in that would show me the entire view; if I held them completely perfectly still and at exactly the right distance and angle from my eyes to the eye cups I could get maybe 85-90% of the full view but only for a second or two. So disappointed in these. I must have received a bad pair. :(  The reason for two stars instead of one is that other than the obvious failure to perform  these binoculars really do look and feel like quality instruments.
4,I bought it for bird watching at point pelee. Given the price I'm okay with the build quality and the image quality. I saw several shore birds and an owl. I didn't find the zoom functionality to be too useful as after 12X it's too shaky to be any use. You will definitely lose the lens caps. They don't stay on very well. Again these are very minor issues as I'm generally happy with the product. I can see however that if you are going to use it more than a few times a month you might want to consider a higher-tier binoculars.
3,Tried these for a couple of weeks. Decided to return them for the Bushnell for the following reasons. Covers were useless and never stayed on while in the case or in general. Image didn’t seem stable during the zoom aspect especially vs Bushnell. Overall felt slightly cheaper in material vs Bushnell.
4,Brightness Clarity Low light performance are very impressive.
5,Very good binoculars.  Very powerful.  Extremely clear optics as you'd expect from Nikon with no distortion or color shift looking through the glass.  They're a bit on the heavier side which is something to be aware of if you're trying to travel light.  My only complaint has to do with the lens covers.  They suuuuuuck.  Each objective lens has its own push-on cover which have trouble staying securely in place.  And the cover for the eyepieces fits so loosely that its pretty useless.  These binoculars deserve better protection for the optics than what Nikon provided.  Just my $0.02
1,Just received them and the box was damaged/ return product. There was no seal tape on it. The binos look like they might have been a returned product and they are poorly collimated they make you feel cross eyes.I was really excited to get these. I'll stick to my celestrons.
5,I’ll rate it high although I have just looked them over and tried them at home for now.For the money good quality as expected from a Nikon product. I know there are better quality optics but for a much higher costs. These will work just fine for the intended use in the back country for scanning alpine slopes. If I do drop or break them I can afford to replace them.
5,Sturdy and well-protected with rubber coat. Light enough for limited walking but would get heavy over time. Came with a tripod mounting bracket so didn't have to purchase that as an accessory. Easy to use with reasonable resolution at the highest zoom (22X). Zoom range makes it excellent for quick views of the night sky without having to set up the telescope. Great supplement to my telescope gear.
5,My best binos for astronomy it shows a lot. Sharp optics. a bit heavy to hold for a long time but for 15-30 seconds its fine.
4,Great binocular very sharp and clear at 10x but when it gets to high magnification color fringing is very obvious but acceptable. Very flexible with the zoom but definitely a little shaky hand held at 22x.Happy with the purchase.
5,This is a good bino for bird watching and exploring of surrounding as it is light strong finger friendly and having brighter image than other brands.Although it is made in China it is nonetheless a top grade product with no flaw.I was into photography and bird watching since 1970s and had been using bino scope and telephoto lens.  The is the best buy in 10 x 50 .
5,A great item at a great price . Ideal for birdwatching . Superior optics and a responsive zoom system. I expect nothing less from Nikon
5,J’avais regardé  en magasin et rien ne me convenait.  Le prix était plus élevé.Ce produit est parfait j’ai commandé un trépied avec mes jumelles pour moins cher. Er i
3,Images are not as crisp ( far) as I would have hoped. Diopter on left eye... creates issues for certain people. FYI.Otherwise it feels good in the hand ( a little “ sticky”on the handgrips).
3,It was good at 7 power but I found the quality toward 22 not good.I sent the unit back for a full refund
4,Good binocular. Not the best Nikon quality. The eye relief adjustment is kind of cheap. Great picture quality even in lower light. Too big to carry or pack for long treks. Good for the truck or at home.
2,Hurt my eye socket - plastic too hard - would be better a soft rubber - I returned it
5,I took for bird watching. really good for me. surprised how easy to change zoom from 10 to 22. just one minus the size
5,Bought these for game drives in Kenya. Image is great and big image for viewing. They  are large so not compact for travelling.
5,pour l' ornithologie  les couleurs de sujet tres  clair   suje facile a capturerun peu lourd
5,excellent rapport qualité prix
5,Cadeau pour mon père pour aller à la chasseSuper bon produit je suis très satisfait et pense m’en acheter une paire pour moi aussi

5,I finally got myself some nice hunting glass !
5,This is my first binocular so it was not easy for me to find the right product. I was extremely well surprised from its quality and amazing optical properties. It is a really good product. Delivery perfectly timed.

5,Glad I bought for my husband he really like it! Recommend to everyone!
5,Quick shipping!Very good optics on these... not amazing but very good.
5,Very good product. Good for sky watching. It is a little bit heavy though. You may need a tripod if you intend to spend a lot of time stargazing
5,Dandy
5,Measures up exactly to my expectations.Perfect!
5,Used them hunting worked great

5,Very happy with these binoculars!Very clear and easy to adjustI would highly recommend them.
5,Good
5,You can see moon crystal clear from this magic gadget!!!
5,Product as described
5,Feels heavy definitely needs tripod for above 10x zoom . Decent picture quality
4,I like the zoom quality but price too high as compare to its clarity. It is best to use only within 1 km as per my observation.No cleaning clothes have been provided.
5,After purchasing this Nikon Aculon 10-22 xBinocular I understood that why Nikon became leader in Binocular manufacturing.100% value for money. if I need to buy a Binocular again I choose only Nikon and especially this 10- 22x varient only.
5,great clarity for distant objects... not so great for astronomy... don't expect anything other than  than the moon  in a city like Delhi
5,ultimate product. Beautiful and good quality. 🙏💐
5,Its from Nikon. So nothing is ordinary. From built quality to lens and vision comfort everything is top class.
4,Well made easy to use. Ideal for bird watching as it is pretty portable and the adjustable zoom enables a real close up view. Can manage without a tripod.Image quality is slightly less bright than binoculars which are 4 times as expensive.
5,(Writing review after 15 days of use. )This binocular has excellent optics. I hardly notice any sort of color fringing even on a bright sunny day. The nighttime performance is flawless as well. This is just perfect for terrestrial viewing. I also looked the moon using these binoculars and the moon just looked amazing. I could spot the craters and all and the clarity was amazing too. Even in the heavily light polluted skies of mumbai i was able to identify the constellations using these binoculars and a skymap. You can see stars that are not visible to the naked eye due to light pollution. e.g. I was able atleast identify identify two star clusters. I was also able to see jupiter. The image did not reveal any detail ofc  just a bright circular object with 4 moons visible as stars around it. It was an amazing experience. Far Beyond what i was expecting while purchasing these. The apparent size of jupiter was say a quarter of the size of the moon as seen with your naked eye.Do purchase a tripod to use with these binos. Adaptor for the tripod is supplied with the binocular. (Amazon Basic tripod worked well for me.) The binoculars provide very good resolution and not getting a tripod would really be a waste of the full potential of the high quality optics inside these.Tested features:Field of View 66 meters at 1 km. FOUND TRUEGud eye relief : upto 1 cm it seemsMost extreme usage: Reading the board at  of a high rise building at  8 km distance. Positively Identifying (but barely due to pollution) features on mountain range ridgeline at 18-19 km distance.What it cannot be used for easily: The field of view does not have graduated markings so you have to eyeball the size of features visible in your view at a distance. You'll have to take a picture and then measure.2. Getting a picuture via a mobile phone camera is very difficult at 22x zoom without using a mounting adapter. I used "Smiledrive Universal Mobile Phone Binocular Telescope Adapter Mount". It gives okayish performance. Gets the job done atleast. You may go for something more expensive maybe for better performance. Or get the adaptor at a shop by actually testing it on the binocular.FYI: (10-22 x 50) means the binocular has a lever which can be turned to change the optical zoom from 10x to 22x and the aperture of the objective is 50mm.
5,Good
4,These binoculars are not very practical and are in fact too cumbersome for regular use. Definitely better to buy a less bulky pair at a lower price
5,The fact that it has a zoom from 10-22. It's crystal clear at any point. You need steady hands at 22 though. Night low light is not all that impressive.
3,Very shaking not concentrating the image also very heavy to hold
4,What's not to like I mean. You get to see things that you can seldom see through your naked eye. The moon and it's craters the planets the stars that are invisible the flights the bats that fly in the dawn.. It's a joy to watch those sparrows.If you have some spare cash maybe buy one and watch stuff. Life's good.
5,Very good quality of binoculars. It's a 10X50 .. fixed magnification. Image quality is superb. Sharpness is great. I purchased these binoculars for my stargazing hobby. But it's an all rounder.  Light gathering is very good. I have seen 4 moons of Jupiter through these. Jupiter looks like a bright dot and its moons look like tiny light points. Saturn looks like an oblong dot. Our moon looks magnificent. You can see craters of moon very clearly. Pleiades pop out of night sky. You will definitely enjoy the view. Orion constellation looks very nice. You can see Orion Nebula but it looks like a smoky dot of light.Essential equipment for beginners.However if you wish to see moon stars and planets you must buy a tripod and binoculars adapter. 10X zoom is too powerful to hold steady.My advice to all beginner stargazers do not go for a telescope directly. Buy binoculars first. 10x50 is best configuration. You can do birdwatching landscapes observation basic stargazing with these. Use it of one year. If your interest keeps up then think about getting a telescope.I also do traget practice with my air rifle. These binocs are good for seeing distant targets also.
4,A fine pair of binoculars. You can see detail on the Moon that you never imagined was there many more stars become visible that are just not visible in light polluted areas like cities. I've seen at most 5 moons of Jupiter. They appear as points of light next to the small circle of light that is Jupiter how many you will see depends on how light polluted your viewing area is and just how many moons are not behind Jupiter.Stargazing is a delight even though your hands will probably shake a lot and you will struggle to keep a good view of anything as small as a star.The collimation was off on my binoculars and when I took them to the Nikon service center they said nothing was wrong and couldn't offer a fix.Please please please take care not to touch the lenses the front lenses are hard to touch anyway being set so deep inside the binoculars that you'd have to bend your fingers to touch them but if you do be prepared to spend Rs. 621 yes that much to have them cleaned.Water should never be used to clean these as unless you're using distilled water which I have not tried the water itself will leave marks that you cannot clean yourself and will drastically reduce the optical quality of the binoculars.The warranty only covers malfunctioning of the mechanical focus knob and nothing else so it's pretty much as good as useless. Cleaning is not covered under warranty.When I received this the seller had not filled out the warranty form inside so I was nervous about even getting any warranty at all but it turns out the only part that is under warranty is one that will almost never break anyway.I may have just gotten a telescope like the Celestron FirstScope which is both cheaper and gives better quality views of deeper space objects but then I would not have been able to track objects like comets and the many artificial satellites including the International Space Station. I could see the solar panels of the ISS with these.Overall a good purchase that I'm happy with. I'd keep these and also get a telescope for those objects that are not fast moving.
5,Suparb quality.... Bit heavy
5,I loved the product. I clicked these pics from mobile with this binocular. The objects were nearly 2 km away. Pics are not that much clear but you get clear view if used directly.
4,Overall good product
4,The product is ok but the glass caps are of no use. The bag should have its sling. And on top of that it's very costly. Zoom upto 15x is ok but beyond that it's a bit blurry.
5,Really happy with the 10x zoom and the light coming through lense to make the image quality great
4,Good quality
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It's been 3 days since I got it. I am still learning to make the best use of it. Image is sharper compared to other brands so you can look longer without getting an eye strain or headache. Zoom feature is good to hanve but you definitely need a tripod.
5,Fantastic product great optics with clarity & zoom both.Compared olympus 10x50 nikon 8x42 & nikon 10x50 physically in a store. Olympus is not worth the hype around & both nikon are near perfect with their low light performance & perfect image clarity. Had picked nikon 10x50 from this bunch but it lacked variable zoom which was my priority.finalised Nikon 10-22x50 since I was impressed by clarity & sharpness of nikon optics.this is a worth buy if you dont mind spending a little more.variable zoom makes it worth every rupee spent. When compared to fixed 10x50 @10x of this product it is slightly poor since field of view narrows but through the range of zoom it outperforms any of the products mentioned above.things I could see as crystal clear images: moon's craters (hand held - little shaky at 22x but with tripod fantastic effect.)IpL cricket match: could see faces of all the people on the ground in relatively low light even across the field the clarity & stability of image was surprisingly mind blowing (hand held) all the action on n off field was clear.birds: clear view of parakeets  ducks serpant eagles (low light) was as if the birds were right in front.Could see clear view of objects even as far as 3.5 km way(to a great extent of details)all the experiences are with binocs being hand held which is just amazing at a zoom level of 22x.in my opinion a great quality product for a lifetime & worth putting in every extra rupee.gives a fantastic variable zoom so you can further zoom objects to see the details.Big thums up for on time delivery by amazon in a day. Weight of the product absolutely not an issue & this cab used for extensive hours.Eye relief could have been better.
4,Like it
5,I've been using this for a week now and amazed by the clarity and sharpness of the optics. Though not super friendly for star gazing one can clearly identify the constellations with the max zoom. A piece of advice for such activities is to get a good tripod which will greatly enhance the experience since with max zoom your slightest hand movements can cause major shift in the outcome. Once piece of advice for cleaning: use a good lint free cloth preferably one that's used for spectacles cleaning.Yet to test the capability in rainy/foggy days and will update later.Overall a very good value for money product
4,If you are really into binoculars and are planning for ultra long term would recommend you buy the one with the zoom feature in it . This doesnt have Zoom but is worth the price at this range
5,It is a very valuable for money product neat and clean no word for errors for product and the vision for long distance is very sharp and clear
4,Good
4,Initial review. The image is clear and bright. Image Quality is what u would expect from 5k rupees to 20k rupees binoculars.There is some chromatic aberration but not terrible.( High end users won't like it) Low light performance is good. Obviously more brighter than naked eye.Cons.Viewing angle is smallWeight is on the heavier side (1.3 kilograms). You won't want to carry this around whole day or for trekking/hiking.Little over priced.Since viewing angle is small and the bino is heavy u need extra steady hands even at 10x.Tripod is a must have if u want to enjoy the zoom.U need to refocus after changing magnification.Don't buy this blindly because of the magnification. For practical/normal/all occasion use 8x40/42 is the best.U get what u pay for is true.
4,Very good quality.
4,This is an amazing binoculars. Perfect for bird watching trails viewing long distance detailing. You can even read a sign board a few hundred meters away.Only thing is do not view for too long as it causes lot of strain on eyes. Constant adjusting and viewing can lead to dizziness and strain.Great product. Go for it.
1,Front Lens get Scratches.. In description Country of origin is Japan.. But Manufacturing in China... Quality to be Improved..
4,This a great product at starting zoom level picture quality is really sharp however sharpness get little blurry after zoom level 18  onwards also requires a tripod to avoid shaky view. Although can see long range mountains with a good clarity. Overall a great product for beginners. Cost is little on higher side.
4,Excellent
5,Very good binoculars. I won't say that they are for beginners because they are on heavier side.But if you have a stable hand or you are using some kind of tripod(adapter included) they are very good.Clarity is perfect zoom is very good but at max zoom you need a tripod.Carrying them may be an issue as they are big. If you are traveling by car you are good but on bike if you have a less space for everything they need some adjustments in your luggage.It is easy to use but again you need to keep weight in mind.
4,I am a beginner do not have any good optical devices. This is the first one.  I am able to spot objects very far off it really helps during out door trips. But price seems to be on the higher side..
4,Excellent quality..... Thank you Amazon...& Cam zone for providing brand new product... After 3 day use......Disappointments.. about made in china product.....not impoted from USA...Back dust covers are not perfectly fitted minner issues are there...Not suitable for kids...due to havy weight..Tripod must fr perfect view ....
3,Product is amazing but the original nikon package was not sealed and looked like it was opened
5,These work great. High quality and easy to use.
4,I received Nikon Aculon 10×50 binoculars yesterday and was able to use it today and found it just the thing I wanted. Initially I thought the lense caps were cracked but on close inspection and reading the operating manual I realised that these gaps are intended  to allow the shoulder straps in for securing them. I have SuperZenith for amateur birding but this Nikon pair allows me to study small objects in greater details. I am yet to try astronomical observation but distant terrestrial objects are clearly defined. It is not too heavy at one kilo weight for normal tracking but for prolonged operation a tripod is necessary. On the flip side the carry bag could have been of better quality and with a shoulder strap.I am overall quite happy with the instrument.
5,Nikon delivers excellent clarity and good reach in Aculon 10x50 binoculars.Pros:1. 10x magnification provided a very good reach of distant wildlife2. 10x is a good starting point for star gazing. The objective of 50 makes it better for night sky watching though it makes the views a little brighter during daytime.3. The field of view is wide enough. I chose this over Aculon 10-22x as 10x50 had higher field of view than 10-22x at 10x.4. Beyond 10x it gets quite shaky for very distant objects like moon. The 10x is used by my 8 year old kids who enjoy them.5. Focusing is easy and smooth.Cons:1. A little brighter views during sunny days due to higher objective.2. Nikon provided strap for the binocular but not for the bag which would have been helpful.
5,Wonderful product. The quality is amazing. You can see far away objects that too in 3D. The field of view is wide enough. 10x is appropriate to track moving objects like planes. Adjustments are easy strap and bag do their job quite well. Build and finish is top notch except for there was a transparent spot on the eyepiece lens (doesn't affect the viewing at all).  Can see plenty stars in night in Pune city light pollution (which I found impressive). You'll definitely need a tripod if you want to view stars and moons. Planets look like large bright stars not much magnification there.Overall very happy with my decision to buy it. Total value for money in the first few days. Pretty sure it'll give me much more than I expected. Buy it!
5,I am an experienced astronomer and  bought these to complement my telescope as i find it hard to lug around every night.With the main objective of star gazing in mindthese binoculars are just "splendid" and "wonderful".I bought these on suggestion from fellow astronomers and having used an Olympus DPS I 10X50 beforethis is worth every penny.The fully multi-coated optics are sharp and chromatic aberration is greatly controlled though i observed hints of it in day-time usemind you its better than any binocular under 15k Rupees especially when compared to larger Celestrons.What impressed me most was the user comfort and the design of the instrument.The eye and lens caps can be supported with the provided strap and it means no more lost caps.The whole Binocular has a nice rubberized coating ensuring good grip and hints of leather gives a great classic and rich feelCollimation was spot onand well packed.Double thumbs for the instrument and its qualityand Amazon was excellent in packaging and timely delivery.If the price sets you offanother great choice would be the Pentax XCF or the Olympus 10x50.
5,A solid package for the given price. This is the first time I bought a pair and can definitely say that it is impressive! The magnification is crisp but you will need a tripod for higher values since it gets really shaky. You can see Jupiter's moons through these even at lowest magnification. Overall a neat package for terrestrial and astronomical viewing.
4,I received a product which was not in sealed condition. That means a newed product at full price. The binocular works well for the purpose. Optics are good
3,See the black spot at 11 o'clock in right lens. Nikon finally replaced the binoculars after multiple emails twitter escalation and national consumer helpline escalation.
5,Using it for the past one week. The zoom is amazing when used for terrestrial purposes. I bought it primarily for my hobby of amateur astronomy. I could distinctly see Jupiter as a globe with a few Galilean moons. Craters on he moon could be seen superbly. But the real cream was Saturn. I could recognize the distinct elongated shape and could even discern the ring structure a bit. Found a very faint star like object right beside it which was apparently Titan. But bear in mind that this requires the zoom to be at max (22X) and you would need a tripod to get stable clear images at this zoom level. So I had bought a relatively cheap tripod from Amazon for the purpose. To wrap it up this bino is worth every penny you pay for it. Wish Nikon had binos for astronomy with even greater zoom levels !
4,This review is for Nikon Aculon 10x50 binoculars.Build1. Overall build quality is good.2. The eye relief is loose.Optics1. There is some chromatic aberration if you look at a high contrast object in day light for e.g. Eagle in the sky. You will see blue outline on the edges.2. The lens are very clear and things will look bright even in low light.3. Moon looks very clear through these. You will even notice the craters near the shadow part of the moon.
3,The bins I got had collimation issues and produced double vision. Despite that the picture quality is amazing; very crisp sharp images but a tripod is definitely needed for longer time with the bins.Had to return the bins as I got headache and vomitting sensation everytime I use them.
5,It's really good !! Before had a basic binoculars  so bought this  it isn't worth 11 k but the view of the moon was soo beautiful  a cherishable moment ! U can easily see upto 2-3 km . Except the price  its really good 🙂
4,Very Stable upto 15x  22x unstable will put pressure on eye.
4,It's very nice product.You can use focus easily.Did not easily see a small object of 1 kmFor example you cannot read lowercase letters.Can not see the face of human easilySo i returned it
4,I was using Olympus 8-16x40 binoculars before and paid only less than half of the amount which actually paid for Nikon aculon a211 10-22 x 50 zoom binos.I am not actually unsatisfied but a bit disappointed as the thing which i noticed is there is not much difference  when compared to Olympus previous mentioned model.I will say its a good binoc but not the best and please don't go for it if you are purpose seems only astronomy.In other context Its a binoc jus like a 18-200mm camera lens which fulfils all your basic needsI would like to recommend it...:)
4,Great product for beginners.
4,These are good pair of binoculars with excellent optical quality when in low light. These are heavy and need stable hands to clearly see without shaking. People who want to have one can go in for a lighter one with 40mm one. At the Tele end @22x these are literally unusable in handheld mode. Good thing is that these have tripod attachments. Haven't tried on a tripod yet. Adjustable interpupillary distance is really helpful. Haven't used for celestial viewing with a tripod but otherwise it is a good pair.
3,Hey guys i would have given 4 stars if i havnt read reviews before buying this bions. Coz wen i read all yhe reviews i expected more. Im nit saying that this 10*50 are bad. Objects are close but not close enough as i expected.if u are buying this for casual bird watching you might satisfied from this product. But if u r planning for watching far distant objects like stars planets or some terrestrial objects that's couple if miles away there's a chance for little disappointed. As my primary purpose was star gazing n wen i read reviews someone says that this product is suitable fir star gazing so i expected bit more powerful glasses. This binos are bice  for watching terrestrial objects which are within one or two km range. But for star gazing its only gud for watching moon. Anyway this product is very handy. Weighs 900 grms. Gud quality built. A gud travelling companion. I recommend u to buy this if ur primary purpose is bird watching or traveling purpose. If ur r interested in astronomy go for celestrone sky master binos.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 A fantastic piece from Nikon. Very sturdy with good grip not so heavy very light in hands. unbelievably clear on objects quite far away.value for money.easy and smooth focussing.Good viewing range. I paid Rs.7000/- but worth  the price considering the view distance and sharpness. A very good piece for bird watching terrestrial view.
5,Good quality good zoom clear vision at night.
4,It's good quality binocularIt don't have zoom lever tho so it's hard for beginners to use it.
5,These are fantastic binoculars..bright sharp and crisp picture..the low light performance is great..best bins for the money..nothing to dislike..the more I use it the more I like it and one more important aspect I dont get any headaches or nausea with this binos..best in their class..I find myself spending a lot of time watching trees birds..yeah im glassing..im glassing..thanks to amazon for their right on time delivery and giving me opportunity to have this wonderful product..im glassing happy
5,Very very excellent..... Cristal clear view just go to buy.....
4,One star less is because of its size as you cannot take it while travelling due to its big size.Its full potential can be measured with tripod but you have to order adapter seperately otherwise this binocular is as good as its cost
3,Main thing of a bino is images quality it is good but but but cost is extremely high compare to it quality. I have check 5 unbranded bino which have not more than 2k. I also checked celestron 15x70 having bk7 prism. There is not much difference in nikon and celestron bk4 and bk7 image quality.
5,It's a waoo product
5,Brilliant Product ! Totally worth the money!
4,These are great set of binoculars but 22X is virtually unusable. At best you could go from 10X to 15X. If you want it for casual viewing you could buy one with lower specs but with this you can see really far. You will fall in love especially with the view of the moon.
5,I Like Nikon brand they give very much quality and in this binoculars  10x50 is simply aswesome thank you Nikon. I like this quality very much. I am using for birds watching it's really superb quality. Value for money
5,Good
5,A good product for the beginners though a bit too costly.
5,1. Descent for low light with 50mm lense.2. 10x zoom works perfectly after proper adjustments.3. Good if you are going for trekking or Safari but also will be suitable for the most of the occasion.4. At night when you look at moon through binocular you make out the spherical shape of moon but don't expect wonder.5. Keeping it still while viewing is not easy.
5,All round binocular for beginners good quality and easy to use happy with the product
4,I have had them for two years now. This pair of binoculars work perfectly fine for me. The only problem I have is they are a little bulky while traveling and feel heavy around the neck if you are going to be out all day or hiking with them. Other than that no complaints. Olympus in the same range would also do its slightly on the lighter side.
4,Very  good  picture quality and brightness is superb
4,great product for its value
5,Good binocular. Came in a nice packing and on time. I used it to view the moon on a full moon day and the view was fantastic. I was also able to view 3 of Jupiter's moons as small dots with some difficulty. I have not tried with other Messiers objects and not sure as I live in a light polluted Metro city. Overall it is good for a beginner in astronomy though the magnification is moderate.
5,Very good service original product no issue
5,Fully multicoated lens with 50mm objective lens are good in low light in day it's crisp and clear at par with some really expensive HD Bino's  Worth every penny..
1,
5,Amazing product for beginners.If u r looking for a binocular for a jungle safarithen don't look for any other than Nikon.The price is somewhat of a higher side but u have to spend a little more for a good product.Make sureu have done all the necessary adjustments before viewing an object or otherwise u will not be able to see a clear view.
5,The product is excellent with great clarity.
5,Very good light gathering binocular and good optics
5,I ordered earlier the same set of binoculars from Amazon but set was not collimated properly. But this time I had no issues.Great pair of binos really satisfied with it
4,On Amazon it is said that this product is imported from USA.But the product says it's origin is in China.No other problems.It is good and helpful for viewing almost all near and far objects clearly. I'm 75% satisfied with the price.
5,Totally worth it  its like DSLR and also buy a amazon brand tripod costs around 800 it will give you stable footage for far objects.
5,This is what I needed. I am an ameture in this field and being a person from a very different profession I don't need more than this.Pros1.very clear view till the 22x zoom2. Easy and reachable control.3.firm rubber grip and being about 1 kg in weight it helps me for a handheld view even at 22x..although not for a long time4.large objective lens helps me having a nice view even at night.Cons.1. It is not water or fog proof.Overall a nice buy for an ameture..at this price point.don't expect astronomy with it..yes moon crater can be seen.
5,Woah what a buy . Must have for explorers.
4,Everything is good .i like it
5,It has the excellent quality
5,Easy to use and zooming capacity excellent.
5,Nice item.
4,I bought this binocular for birding. It is exactly as per my expectations. Nikon optics has reassured me about its quality. Only thing I am missing is tripod adopter. At 10x magnification it needs great amount of hand control to avoid the shaking . I would suggest go for tripod adopter as well. 50 mm objective lens dia insures more light coming in and insures bright and clear picture even in low light environment.Overall a great product.
5,Best quality
5,Amazing product.... Good sharpness
5,I fell in love with this as soon as I held it in my hands and used it. The vision is very crisp and fine. A must have.
5,Amazing Binacular and worth for money.
1,I recieved damaged product and when I was trying to return it was only showing replacement option  very disappointing.
4,Does the job. No image distortion or colour fringes seen. Feels sturdy.
5,Probably the best
5,Very good quality optics for it's price. Does have slight chromatic aberration visible near moon edge though. Still 5 stars.
5,All pic with 10x along with distance from my location and last one is Vaishno Devi Darbar at nt around 117 miles
2,This product is Made in China.. The details on the product page says The product imported from USA.. I wonder why would one import from USA when it's made in China.. also no where on the box it says imported from USA.. on the whole the product is China made.. over all the product is a kind of ok ok however when zoomed at 18 to 22x the clarity is very bad.
5,Very good
4,Magnification is very good although bit heavy to hold. Haven't used in low light so can't comment on that. Good value for money enjoying the buy.
4,Everything is ok till I discover that both the eye piece are unable to focus simultaneously even withRight side fine adjustment facility. It is a mfg. defect.
5,Very sharp hd quality  view
3,zooming is very bad..zooming was not workingiam not happy for made in china
5,I am a beginner and liking it. Love to watch moon even could read distant sign boards at night. Nice to carry for trips. It was mesmerizing to watch a shining water body in the sun at a distance. Not for star gazing though.
5,I love it very clear photo
5,It nice and quality is good
4,Binoculars are good for wildlife and landscapes although one must have tripod as its is difficult to hold them steady with hands coz of the high magnification number
3,Poor packing Made in china products images at higher magnification are blurred 10x is good
4,The picture quality was very good. .. this is the pic of Asian Koel male... and its little bit heavier... bt the Price was sm high...
4,It’s easy to use  simple and a good buy for beginners. In good light it works well!
5,excellent
5,Super Quality.
4,This is wanted product -likeHeavy -dislike

5,Good
5,I really reallylike this .This is amazing.🥰
4,Awesome just go for it. Absolute clear vision best in night use. 3d type image of moon.
4,Ok
3,Expected a little more on the magnification capabilities.
4,The product is bigger than expected and seen in the picture. The weight is also heavy than expected.
5,Exilent
5,I like this product ... easy to use and easily fit in hand and not much heavy  easy to Cary (carrying bag is also aviable with this) I use lot of binoculars In life but this one is so good binoculars in all of them..
4,Best for beginners and amateurs. Value for money. Great buy.
5,Though i felt little bit heavier but i can see long distance object very easily.. i suggest everyone not to forget take cleaning kit with it.. beacuse after you use it there will be dust on the lens.. so personally i liked a lot..
3,Its made in chinaat 18 to 22 x pic is slight fade doubble vision is an issue with it.and price is slight high according to its quality of zooming and visionmost imp thing is right eye piece is not as clear left eye.
3,Good
5,Awesome binoculars for beginners...crisp n clear viewing...Worth for long distance....
4,Excellent product
4,clear vision binoculars quality is good but glass cleaning pad is missing
5,Its just awesome.. I had confusion to choose from Nikon or Olympus but decided to buy Nikon and product quality is very good.View is crystal clear and has enough viewing angle for bird and wildlife watching. Worth it!!
5,Best for beginners just buy it..
3,Nice products but high price
4,The product quantity is good. It's heavy. Clarity is good. Some more zooming is required in this range.
4,It is very good. But slightly heavy.
5,Nikon bino is far better than Olympus and others. Perfect product
5,Clear object nice  good performance
4,Excellent long distance view. Adjustments are simple and easy. Little bulky in size. I will give 4.5 out of 5.
5,Friends just go for it if you are looking for a Class Quality Binocular. None other than NIKON can produce such a super clear & crispy lens like this.Just remember it's little heavy and a tripod preferable for 22x Zoom.Don't get confused with others brands just buy this from NIKON .
5,It's solves the purpose zoom is a great add-on Olympus is more bright then this and less on cost but has no zoom on 50x..Go for Nikon if zoom required
5,The product handled as advertised and is easy to use - slightly heavy for long use but very good visuals!
4,Grt product for beginners
3,Good for beginners .
5,What do you expect from Nikon? Sheer magic.. at that price band I’m yet to see a good pair. Don’t hesitate.. go for it
5,Received and used this bino. Brilliant and amazing product. Excellent image and worth every penny. Excellent delivery and very well packed. Worth buying
5,Excellent stuff no doubt. However it is an overkill for a casual bird watcher for whom any good 8x40 binocular would suffice. It is also weighty and I would definitely recommend using a tripod for greater magnification. Not suitable for very short distance (few feet) macro viewing. Overall a great binocular to have if you are okay with its need for a tripod at higher magnification and its price which I feel it is every penny worth it.
5,After going through a lot of research about binocularsI finally got this one and it's just what I needed class product very sharp & clear image easy to handle. Highly recommend
4,Good but higher on price
5,Very good product. Glad i bought it.
5,The nikon binocular arrived in good condition.looks brand new.tested it  and found it good.since its my first binocular i havnt tested any other cant say if this is the best.varying zoom works till 16 after that its blurry while handheld.the view is cear dont know if its crystal clear since looking through glass is a different than from eye.amazon didnt put bill inside thats another issue.
4,Heavy and worthy.
4,Very good. Value for money
5,awesome binocular. Best in class for use of wildlife / bird watching. Can also be used for beginner astronomy(Use of tripod is recommended.) Serves both purposes.

5,Très bonne qualité
5,Extremely impress with it as we can have a nice clear view of the moon! I can even see details! Easy to use.
5,These binoculars made my Bushnell's look like a toy.
5,The diopter adjustment ring is somewhat stiff ...probably cold weather and the lubicrant used will do this.Something to get used to.
5,Good price. Very very clear. Easy to focus. So much sharper view then my old ones. Highly recommended
5,There was nothing negative to review regarding these Nikon binoculars.  They are not too heavy and they came in a case for protection.  We like them very much and would recommend them for the price! Thankyou!
5,They are not cheap but they work really well. The zoom option is very useful. Picture is clear and they have a really nice rubber grip. The next level will probably have to have optical or electronic stabilization to make them better.
5,I'm an amateur using binoculars but they work great nice sturdy case good lense protection. comes with a strap. very happy
5,AAAAAAAA +++++++
5,This was perfect and great quality !!! Love them !!
5,Great for watching wildlife from afar
5,Great for watching wildlife from afar
5,comfortable easy to use great quality
5,A bit heavier than many but the addition of the zoom makes these a good buy. Image quality is worthy of the Nikon name.
1,Seller should have inspected before sending the item to customer. It's a waste of time and shipping costs. Shipped in original box with the flap flimsily attached by a short tape with the letters "Prime". Box seems to have been opened numerous times worn out in places. Shoulder strap is missing. Left side cannot be focused partially covered with a large fuzzy dark spot. The diopter is very difficult to turn. Very disappointed.
5,Quality is great
4,The zoom option makes them more versatile than the standard binocular.  When zoomed in I found I was too shaky and added a tripod for stability.  This is exactly what I wanted for long distance viewing on the lake from the cottage.  They come with a tripod adapter.  When zoomed out they are still a very powerful binocular.  This is my third set and I wish I had spent the extra on this the first time.
5,as described
5,Observation de la lune et randonnée pédestre
5,Très satisfait du produit.  Facile à utiliser très confortable.Livraison rapide.  Je recommandes ce produit.
5,When you compare this set to other binocs you quickly realize and appreciate the quality and clarity of the optics.
4,O binóculo é excelente estou gostando muito. O ponto negativo da compra é que tive que pagar mais O equivalente a 25% de taxa para o correio brasileiro / fiscalização. Se soubesse disso não teria comprado . Com isso demorou muito para chegar minha compra
4,Used on a tripod great results.
3,First the eyepiece covers aren't even remotely close to being able to fit the eyepieces.  They're RIDICULOUSLY oversized and extremely cheap!  The lens covers are ALSO thin cheap pieces of plastic.  I've been buying Nikon equipment for 15 years and I've NEVER been more disappointed in being persuaded by the brand name.These are decent binoculars but they didn't even include attachment lanyards for the cheap plastic covers.I'm disappointed to say that I DO NOT recommend these.3/10
2,Very poor focal qualit not recommended
5,A very reasonably priced 20x50 binocular with an excellent surface finish.  Excellent performance and a high-quality binocular with excellent clarity.  Would recommend the strap suggested for stable watching.
5,Loisir
3,Great view but a bit heavy to control the shakes.
