3,Okay you say what was I hoping for after all they're just thumb drives! We'll I've always thought that way but after this purchase I've had to change my thinking. These are USB 32Gb thumb drives and they work fine for storage. But and for me right now that's a big "But!" Why? Well I've been moving a number of my laptops and PCs from Windows to Linux because Microsoft has signed their death warrants with Windows 11 being designed to not work on most existing PCs (Google it!). You need a "new" PC to run it. I didn't care much for Win 10 and I absolutely hated Win 8 and 8.1. Win 7 is still my favorite but I'm warming up to Win 10 as I find ways to do end-runs on it. Getting back to these thumb drives; unless your laptops etc. are older you can't install Linux distros without using a USB drive. (If they have a CD/DVD drive you can use that.) You don't need large ones. 8 to 16Gb is enough. I've used lots of Sandisk drives over the years and so these were priced right and I thought at 32Gb once I'd done all of my installs I could use them for small storage items. Here's my beef with these drives (and now that I know many others):  You can't "boot" from them! What am I saying? In order to install Linux from a USB drive (or Windows as well) when you start the PC it has to look for start up instructions (booting) and so if you want to install a new operating system (like one of the Linux distributions) the PC has to "see" the USB drive first before it goes to its hard drive and loads what it's been using all along. These drives are not being"SEEN" by the boot process! And I know this for a fact because I've gone in to the PCs and set them to boot from the USB drives first yet it never happens; even when I stop the boot process and manually tell the machine to use the USB drive with the new OS on it. I couldn't figure out what was going on until I remembered that I'd had this exact same problem when I first began updating my PCs with Win 10 and they didn't "see" "certain" USB drives. I had one (small-brand name) drive that did allow booting and I used that to do all of my Windows installs. I found that drive and used it to install one of my Linux distros and it worked the first time! So I wanted a little bit bigger thumb drive and ordered these Sandisks thinking:  New modern name-brand drives; what could go wrong! WRONG! They don't work. After lots of forum-crawling I found out that a lot of these new thumb drives are being formated to not include the ability to use it as a boot drive. I even tried software that allowed me to go in and re-set the "flags" so they should have been boot-able but no luck. The consensus seems to be that if you get a thumb drive that isn't boot-able take it back (good luck on that one) or just keep it for storage and buy a different brand until you find one that will allow the machine to boot from it. I have two different USB thumb drives that both allow booting and they are both from the same "small-name brand" company. They're different sizes from each other and were made at different times yet they both allow a PC to boot from them. Who made them? I don't know if the name will make it online but they are both made by Patriot. If the name gets removed try this:  The name starts with a "P" and ends with a "t." Hope some of this helps somebody. I sure could have used it!
5,I wanted a very small/short USB to use for music and audio books in the car but would fit without sticking out too much. This is the one for that. I like that it doesn't get in the way and that with a 64gb I can put all the music and books on it I want. Then by using a removable drive like this it's easy to take out update on the computer and put it back in. Beats trying to copy lots of media to the car itself.As always Sandisk drives are recommended and this one is perfect for the car!
4,For the price it is an excellent buy.  My only issue I've had with it in the time I have used it is that I cannot copy a single file larger than 4 gigabytes to it.  For example I attempted to copy over a 7 gigabyte MP4 file from a streaming session and my system told me it was unable to move the file because it was "too large".  Keep in mind that I have only used 20% of the space on this 500Gb drive at this time.With that said the times I need to use this drive for a file of that size are very rare so that is not a deal breaker for me.  I mostly use this as a backup drive for my files after all.All in all great buy.  But if you need to use this for very large files you might instead need an external drive rather than this.
5,Just received and inserted to a USB 3.2 port to speed tested with CrystalDiskMark8.04b. In all tested sizes it has met/passed product description: Read speeds up to 130MB/s Write to drive up to 15X faster than standard USB 2.0 drives (4MB/s). This drive is so small that needed me a little effort to pull out with my bare fingers but not a big deal. Will wait to see durability.
5,Its so small but its so big. Its good for a USB that stays in your port for along time but have to remove later I used it for a project I was preparing for and I placed it in my front IO of my PC and it was not annoying and unpleasant like other USB drives that poke from the front IO.
4,Has plenty of storage space for me the read writing speeds are acceptable is working great no problems so far the only downside is that it is 100% flimsy plastic feels like it will break at any moment.If you are not disconnecting it from your PC all the time the plastic shouldn't be an issue.Overall 4 stars.
5,nice usb drive use for my dashcam and it does what i need and the size is great since it has to go in my glove compartment it doesn't take up much space.  Price is surprisingly good for such a compact drive.
5,I got the 256GB thumb drive for attached USB storage on a TP-Link Archer A7 Router works great shows up as 232GB on the admin page. Sandisk is a well known excellent quality storage maker I know I can trust these not to lose my data. The device is super small doesnt stick way out to back just asking to get broken off. I’m super happy!Comes pre-formatted as FAT32 I formatted to NTFS to get past the 2.1GB file size limit.
4,ScanDish is a brand name that I have come to trust while some off-brands of these storage devices can be undependable.  The tiny size of this makes it excellent to plug into a laptop and leave there without it getting in the way when moving the laptop around or when in use.  The size is also great for use in a car for the same reasongs.  But the tiny size will make it easier to misplace if you are constantly removing this drive you had better have a good plan as to how to keep it from getting lost due to its small size.
5,I bought this to expand the storage of my netbook. It works great it's portable and ot's well priced for the ammount of space you get.
5,These are tiny. Bought it for emulation on my series s. Works great. No lag from the drive. Don't notice it's there because it's so small. This is my second of these drives. My go to now for usb flash drives.
5,Bought to play my music library on my car radio works like a charm. Low profile compared to most flash drives and with 128GB plenty of space for my music.
5,This a very compact reliable drive. I am currently using one of them to store 3 operating system to install. Quality of product is as expected from SanDisk. Wish it had a status light. Otherwise it has been working without issues.
5,This is an incredible Flash drive. Not only does it hold 128 GB but it's the size of a dime. It works fast and it works easy: simply plug it in to your USB port and use it.
5,Installed 2 Blink wireless cameras outside. Already have a Ring doorbell these cover the other areas. After initial trial realized I couldn’t retrieve any movement captured unless I signed up for storage. Already pay that with Ring. Small print says you just need a flash drive…. Plugs into main module. So simple!! Ordered and received within 24 hours.Love the cameras love Amazon!!!
5,I bought a couple of these for my wife and I to store our movies documentaries and videos on and continue to be fascinated by how much they can hold. About the only thing is you might want to put some kind of lanyard or tag on it as it would be easy to lose since it is so small! The price was pretty good too. I've been happy with Sandisk products in the past and this one continues to impress too.
5,Works great and takes up such a tiny little space that I just might end up losing it somewhere.
5,if you don’t have a lot of storage on your laptop this is a must have. my laptop’s only compromise was that it had bad storage space but this was an easy solution. barely notice it’s there. came fast (2 days) and for free. no complaints
4,Compared to the Samsung USB 3.1 Fit flash drive this Sandisk Ultra Fit USB 3.1 drive is only 50% of the speed of the Samsung's and it runs HOT!!!
5,I had to get a specific size thumb drive to update the navigation & menu's in our SUV. Apparently this update would not work or find the drive if it wasn't 64GB. Purchased product loaded the update and away the update went. All good happy with purchase and will come in handy a number of times. It is TINY. Great to carry & use got to be careful in not losing it.
5,I absolutely love these drives. Sometimes they need to be formatted but the process is so quick and easy! They're great for holding all my files whether it's school work personal files movies shows etc. Just make sure you put it in a safe spot and don't forget it. Also if your device is overheating its important to take the drive out otherwise it can damage it.
5,I purchased the USB in February 2019 and it failed in Nov 2019 ten months hmmm. From new it required far more pressure to insert then my other USB drives and the housing became noticeably warm when in use. At that point I should have sent it back but instead dismissed it as the consequence of its small architecture and poor manufacturing tolerances. After less than fifty applications the housing broke but more annoying the stored data became unrecoverable. I have several full size SanDisk and other maker USB drives and none have exhibited the above noted concerns or failures. Unfortunately four days ago my wife purchased the SanDisk 256 model and it also requires more insertion force than should be required foreshadowing dear reader.  Would I recommend this product? Absolutely not. Will I continue future Sandisk purchases? Probably but not their miniature series. SanDisk if you wish to offer me recompense I will gladly include your response as an appendix to my review.Cheers EUpdate: Nov 25 2019The day after submitting my Amazon review I contacted the SanDisk warranty department by email requesting recompense as the USB was less than 5 years old. I provided them a copy of my Amazon purchase order and the next day I received a follow-up email from SanDisk® Global Customer Care stating SanDisk did not have a 128gb replacement in stock (in the warehouse) but would I settle for two 64gb instead to which I replied yes. Within a day or two I received another SanDisk email this time different in tone. It referenced my Amazon.com review and included the following highlighted in blue "Note: Refurbished physically damaged or non-authentic products are not covered by SanDisk warranty". The email also included an RMA (Return to Merchant Authorization) but no mention of the previous replacement offer.So what happened a SanDisk employee armed with my Amazon purchase receipt trolled the Amazon.com website and located my review. Upon reading it they identified I had mentioned the USB casing had broken and presto SanDisk feels the warranty claim is disqualified hence the blue highlighted script. To appear as a good corporate citizen they now offer me an RMA (Return to Manufacturer Authorization) so we can go through the process. Okay I will with the clear understanding that I intend publish every SanDisk response regardless of the outcome.Other critical Amazon reviews about this product identify similar concerns it runs hotter than a full sized USB it is a tight fit especially in USB 3.0 ports the housing cracks and this device prematurely ends in software/hardware failure. See a similar Amazon.com posted review provided by Gennaro M. on March 15 2018. It is one of the many provided by dissatisfied consumers. My complaint like those generated before me does not originate from consumer misuse abuse or accident but by product failure and warranty issues.Stay tuned for SanDisks response which I intend to publish when I receive it.Cheers EOn 2019.11.27 I received the following email from James P.. a SanDisk® Global Customer Care rep "Thank you for writing back to us. Please be informed that the statement which was sent in the e-mail is a standard statement which we use in all automated RMA approval e-mail for letting customers know that Refurbished physically damaged or non-authentic products are not covered by SanDisk warranty. Also we understand that you are not very satisfied with the model of flash drive which you were using earlier i.e. SanDisk® Ultra Fit USB 3.1. Therefore we would like to offer you an alternative product i.e. SanDisk® Cruzer Glide USB 3.0 128GB (SDCZ600-128G) in replacement. Please suggest if you are agreed for the alternative model".I agreed to accept their offer and on 2019.12.10 I received without cost to me a full size USB SanDisk® Cruzer Glide USB 3.0 128GB (SDCZ600-128G) delivered to my door.  In the end SanDisk® or the parent company Western Digital Technologies Inc honored the warranty. I will continue to use SanDisk® as long as the honor they warranty. However I would not again purchase or recommend this specific product the SanDisk® Ultra Fit USB 3.1.cheers e.
5,This USB is ideal for any scenario that you have limited space. This is a great solution for portability devices.
4,These USB drives work fine. They just get hot if you leave in a running device.
5,Always got to be careful of SanDisk fakes. This one is legit. I put it in a Ubuquiti UNVR after the OEM one died hard. Got my NVR back up and running in about 15 mins with this. Edge case scenario I know but might help someone who has the same problem...
5,This  256 USB was cheapest out there. Worked perfectly. The fact that it is so small was a little scary but did not matter.
5,Works as it should All I use it for is my own music to play on a car stereo it does the job!
4,Used for extended memory on fire-stick 4k.
4,Useful if you need additional storage on the go. I keep it connected to my laptop so I have somewhere to save my school assignments. It does have a habit of disconnecting on its own over time. It also overheats so take it out to rest every now and then.Size of a quarter
4,Perfect size to not snag something. gets a little warm. I use it on my router.
5,Like I can leave them in my computer for quick use without being concerned the external drive with get bumped and ruined. Also fits on my key ring so can easily take it with me without fear of it getting lost because it's so small. Definately a 5 star for me.
5,Good Value great price
4,Great product
5,Muy practico buena capacidad y buenas caracteristicas.
5,Great product
5,These are the best tiny thumb drives I've ever purchased. They work great in car stereos laptops or anything else you will need.
4,When i plugged it wasnt full 256gb their had some file's on here like warrnt and so onScandisk still trust company and i havnt lost date on amy there flash drive(enless user error drop or water)
5,My Samsung drives of this form factor get so hot you almost can touch them. These only get a little warm while in use. If they are slower it's not noticable to me. I like them.
5,Keeps my files right where I always need them.
4,I made these into bootable drives for various linux OS's and notice they get quite warm when in use... Not something I have experienced before
4,Used on my car stereo. Has a very low profile so it can't get knocked around.
5,This thing is great for cars. It's so small you don't even notice it and that also keeps things from snagging on it or bumping into it and breaking it.
4,Love it. I use it for my music
5,No dislikes
5,I bought this for my android box. It's awesome and very fast to transfer stuff into. 10/10 would purchase again
4,It works but is kind of bulky compared to a previous one.
5,Works as predicted and holds FAT32 files unlike those other fatter thumb drives.
5,Setting up the PW protection is not easy.
5,Bought this to hold retro games on my Xbox Series X. Works as expected.
4,It does what I bought it for which is store games inside a Wii U and it hasn't corrupted any of the data. I don't want to return it.
4,Nice little USB flash drives. Really small tho and hard to put on a key chain. I ended up using bread twist ties for makeshift holders. By default they come formatted in Fat32 - so if your trying to drop very large files on them they will need to be reformatted.
5,Great for my car stereo.
4,I like these drives and use them for customers when we do data pulls from old HDD's. They work well and are pretty durable. Be aware that these (SanDisk 64GB 5-Pack Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive (5x64GB)) come as five individual drives wrapped in bubble wrap and packaged in a cardboard box. It is NOT a retail package of five or five individual retail packages; just bare drives in non-ESD safe bubble pockets. I purchased these with the intent to use them for re-sale; though I cannot do that they are still perfectly usable.
5,Our Explorer has a usb input for music so I ripped our CD collection to this flash drive. With just over 2500 songs on the drive there's still a ton of room for more. The low profile of the drive makes it perfect for using in the car. No more bumping that long thumb drive when getting in the console. I'm absolutely satisfied with this product.
5,This small thumb drive maybe tiny but it handles a lot of information.  Thank you.
5,Works as expected. Large capacity small size. Hardly sticks out of my laptop. Happy with this.
5,great small  compact product
5,This was twice the storage as blinks branded usb drive offered for the modules local storage. It was also the same price.
5,A bit lower profile it would be a gift from the gods. Fast. No problems. Using as drive in laptop. The Elite line must be all that and Stromboli
5,Use for MP3 music with mobile radio with newer car radio's where the CD slot is eliminated music can be accessed through the USB port in MP3 format. These tiny Flash Drives fit the bill with 16GB storage; hundred of tunes. I leave this item plugged into my vehicle's USB port it's been over a year through summer & winter and this thing has not failed.
5,Great and easy to use used for my blink backup
4,Se calienta mucho aveces al ser fabricada en material de plástico eso da un como que se pudiera derretir fácilmente todo lo demás está perfecto
5,Very tiny and doesn’t stick out too much at the USB port. It’s very light too. Some reviewers complain about the plastic body. I am guessing if you carry it with keys etc it might not be as strong as a metal case but if it stays plugged into a USB port most of the time it shouldn’t be an issue. Using it without any problems at all and loving it.
4,SanDisk 512GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive - SDCZ430-512G-G46|Black| OK you get what you pay for. I have *NEVER* had an issue with a SanDisk product. But this one seems very cheaply made plastic perhaps I should have ordered the more expensive version? Windows 10 reports 460GB not 512GB. GUI Format 32 indicate 494GB with 16384 Cluster Size. That's a lot of wasted space if you have a lot of small files.
5,Sus caracteristicas
5,as I said in the title
5,I used this product to store my ROMs save files and BIOS files to play on my XBOX Series S. And with it being so small it's not sticking out like a sore thumb that could cause someone to tap it. It's convenient and works very well. I highly recommend this for anyone.
5,Many 3.1 drives do not work on the Wii U. This one is perfect with no issues at all. It’s also perfect to avoid the Y cable or wall powered drive. With as much stuff the Wii U requires to be plugged in it’s nice to eliminate something else that takes up a space on the power strip.
5,Good affordable tiny storage
5,This works perfect for storing my music that I use to DJ with. Much better than having to use an external with a cord.
5,Excellent purchase.
5,This is actually a replacement for a defective USB drive. Amazon handled the replacement very efficiently.I have another of this exact item and have been very happy with it.
4,Perfect fit storage was lessGets warm over timeNot bad for the price .
4,This USB 3.1 is not accepted by my 3.2 Gen 2 port on my Dell 15 3511. I thought they were interchangeable.
4,I have over 400GB of videos. I would normally steam them to TV but the TV's Wifi broke. So I decided to put them on a 512 GB USB flash drive and plug it into the TV's USB. Here's what I found...1. A 500GB SSD shows actual available space of 465GB after formatting. This 512GB USB flash drive only has 460. That's a shortage of 17GB.2. After copying about 410 GB of videos the SSD shows about 56 GB available. That adds up to 466 and matches its capacity. After copying the same videos to this 512 GB flash drive it shows about 13GB remaining. That adds up to 423GB and very inefficient. I formatted both in Windows 10 as NTFS with recommended allocation unit size.3. The copy speed/performance is terrible. It took 2:25 hours overnight to copy the 410GB. In comparison I copied about 61GB to my 2TB Samsung SSD over the same USB port in about 4:35 minutes! That would be about 31 minutes for 410GB (not 12 hours).Bottom line... if you need convenience and small size this is good. It is also easy to lose! If you want speed and efficiency look for external portable USB-C SSD.
5,We love our flash drives. Have used many brands but keep coming back to this brand. Since using these back in 2000 only had one finally stop working. Love the portability and the storage size. Highly recommend. We use these items to keep maintain docs on our pc's without using up the HDD on our PC's.
5,It works the way it was designed.  The device is small. I have big hands.  It was a little difficult to handle
5,These are great! Came in the mail quickly and safely. Perfect!
4,... to work flawlessly
3,I bought this in 2021.  I didn't use it much except to copy music from my older windows 10 pc.  As I need to use it now for copying files to update my new cars infotainment system and also to use on my new AV receiver (AVR).  I kept having problems with it on my windows 11 surface pc in that when I plugged it in the pc would beep but not display the drive.  On my older windows 10 pc it seemed to work fine.  I copied an update from my car manufacturers site onto this usb drive and inserted it into the car and got a message that it couldn't read the files.  After going back to the car manufacturers I read where it doesn't support usb drives with plastic plugs.  This unit is all plastic.  After buying another sandisk with the metal plug that worked fine with the update.  Then I copied music to the all plastic  drive for my new AVR and when I went to the menu for usb it told me there was nothing on the drive.  Using another metal plug USB with music the AVR read it fine.  So it appears these all plastic USB drives do not work with all usb ports.
5,Good and reliable product
5,i was scared at first but it worked just fine. i got rid of an old 500gb passport. this is great.
4,Good job.
5,Added this to my tp-link router for DLNA storage. It works great for streaming music and movies.
5,Always good
4,Very small inexpensive and lightweight USB flash drives.These little guys are very basic (no LEDs) very lightweight (they feel actually "empty") and perfectly fine for typical small flash drive tasks. In my case that might mean moving a few files between computers or more likely creating boot/test media for various systems.Here is how the drives are detected by FreeBSD:<USB SanDisk 3.2Gen1 1.00> Removable Direct Access SPC-4 SCSI device29340MB (60088320 512 byte sectors)As I'd expect at the "basic" end of the product spectrum write speeds are on the low side about 13-15MB/sec (1MB blocks) on a USB3 port. That's pretty slow for backup purposes but you weren't going to back much up to a 32GB drive regardless.Other thoughts: The tiny drives may be hard to get in/out of non-laptop USB ports.For many use cases you'll want larger faster flash drives with activity LEDs.But for simple "throwaway" tasks like boot media this 3-pack does the job cheaply and well-enough.
5,Perfect size lots of storage fast read/right speeds
5,Work great
5,I think the best part about this flash drive is the size.  Since it doesn't stick out I can leave it in place in my laptop.  When moving to another laptop I just remove it from one and insert it in the other.  Easy.  Holds lots of data.  So glad I bought it.
5,This drive gets a little warm when transferring large amounts of data but other than that no issues so far. It's not the fastest flash drive out there but I think these drives were made more for storage and transfer of large files purposes..hence the 512gb size. Thanks Sandisk and Amazon for their prompt shipping and delivery.
5,Nice and compact. I use these for installing Esxi on. There's the endurance issue but usually last a year or so as long as scratch and swap are located on an actual datastore
5,Like that it is small and doesn’t get in the way when you put laptop in bag.Great so far.
4,Works great and fast. Have a place for your thumb drives or you will loose this tiny thing. Bought 2 and have already lost 1.
5,Worked great... until I lost it in my home. This thing is seriously small. Had it a couple months and loaded 10 seasons of my favorite TV show on it with plenty of room for for entire seasons of some of my other shows. I was moving my box sets onto this along with survival guides and field manuals in case of a situation where I would be out off the grid with no internet with my 19 inch TV and portable power station or simply on a long road trip where my mobile data would be ate up quickly trying to stream something entertaining. Problem is it's so small I lost it after about a month and a half or 2 months. Next time I'll just stick to the bigger ones that are easier to find and see. This thing is literally smaller than a thimble so it's not hard to lose.
4,Only 460 GB usable out of 512 GB
4,Very small and compact for the size storage capasity
5,I've used Sandisk for many years - and this latest flash thumb drive is yet another example of fast cheap easy to use devices I have come to rely on.While 128 megabytes isn't the biggest out there it is more than enough for almost any general usage. You can always buy a bigger capacity one later if you need it - at which time the price of the larger capacity ones will have fallen dramatically.This device has USB 3.1 - means it is going to be about as fast as can be expected from an external port.This device is also super small - it is more like a thumbnail drive. Might be too small in fact for some people as it is also much easier to lose given that it is the size of a pistachio nut.
5,I purchased this storage drive to load media for my disabled friend to view pictures videos and listen to music. My friend was severely injured in a traffic accident in 2007. She is in a nursing home and sadly not many people visit. With consent from family and friends I was able to make a picture slide show of so many people she hasn't seen in a long time loaded hours of music we loved to listen and dance to and even spiritual and comedic videos videos. I couldn't believe that the days of work I spent loading and categorizing media only took 8GB of storage! My friend has difficulty using touch screen smart devices and typing due to the loss of a finger and shaking hands due to neurological damage. But she is easily able to scroll through all the media I loaded on this drive. It has brought her so much joy and warms my heart!
5,I had previously purchased 3 cheap drives on Amazon that failed. Thank fully Amazon has a great return policy. I was worried about this one. Read some posts that said it was slow and fails with heavy files another said the plastic breaks another said it was tight in their USB port. All of these did not apply for me. I have a 13.3 Asus computer with 3.0 USB ports and the write speed varies but 1 could write a 1gb video file to this drive in 15 seconds read is super fast. Large files? I transferred all my VCR digital converted home movies and pictures and computer files to this drive in one evening with out stopping. How large are these files? 281gb with out missing 1 file. Glad I came back to Sandisk!!
5,Almost great in every aspect except it is so small it is easily misplaced. Would be perfect product in world of espionage. I would purchase again but recommend to manufacturer to produce in a "can't loose it color" like bright safety yellow or hot pink to help us old folks that loose things easily.
5,Using as a boot disk for a RaspberryPi 4.  Much faster than using the SD card.  Used for a few months with no issues.
4,The product works great. I was hoping to use for storing media on and plugging into a PlayStation 5 discretely. Which it does but for some reason certain folders and media wouldn’t appear. Would appear fine on MacOS and Windows systems. Unfortunately it didn’t pan out exactly how I had hoped.
5,I loaded this up with MP3s and it works great in my car.
5,Did a lot of research and decided to take a chance with this as a USB drive on my WiiU.  Formatted just fine passed quality checks on my PC and has been in use for a few months now with zero issues after I filled it completely full of games.  Tiny size means you can barely tell it's there even.
5,Put my entire music collection on this and plugged it into vehicle. Easy!
5,This item is perfect.  Loaded my whole MP3 collection on it and plugged it into my 2021 Ram 1500 USB.  Can barely see it and it plays every song perfect.  No issues.  I don't need radio or Sirius anymore.  Now I can listen to all my music that I like.  No commercials no skipping no outage works everytime.
1,Purchased 9 months ago.  Pulled from USB port on laptop today and discovered part of the plastic connector had broken off and is currently stuck inside the laptop making the port inoperable.  Did nothing to stress or create the failure.  It just broke because of the cheap plastic construction that SanDisk used for this product.I have been buying SanDisk USB drives for many many years.  This UltraFit was the first that had all plastic construction including the connector which is typically metal.  I was concerned but assumed SanDisk knew what they were doing.  Wrong.  As I prepared to write this review glanced at customer photos and see that my problem is not unique.  There are multiple users who have had the same problem.  SanDisk should recall this product.  This product is a mistake.Good news / bad news - Contacted SanDisk and they responded promptly providing an RMA and prepaid label to return the USB drive.  Bad news - they will be replacing with another plastic USB drive so wonder how long it will last.  This product should be recalled.Funny thing I usually do not post images or clips with reviews but had one in order to complete the RMA request process for SanDisk.  I was going to post the image but Amazon is not allowing any attachments within reviews for the product???UPDATE 5/12/20Rec'd replacement 256GB from SanDisk support about a 3 week cycle after starting RMA process.  Replacement is same all plastic construction as original.  Expected that but now scrutinizing closely and realize what a bad product this is.Began reloading backup files and noticed file transfer seemed exceedingly slow.  I was loading a 25GB folder of large media files averaging 600 - 800MB each.  Watching Windows Explorer real time performance graph there developed a cycle of rapid writes lasting 10 - 15 sec perhaps 700-800MB which was then followed by a complete halt for perhaps a minute or more.  Believe this is the result of protective circuitry within the drive that monitors heat perhaps a safeguard required by the cheap plastic construction.  The continuous writes of these long files heats up the SanDisk drive (which does get hot) the SanDisk drive shuts itself down for a minute or so to cool.  After cooling off the SanDisk starts writing again for 10-15 seconds and then shuts down again repeating the cycle until finally completed.  Wondering how much of the heat retention is due to the solid plastic construction and perhaps needed to prevent a meltdown.Out of curiosity performed the same file transfer to a Samsung "Fit Plus" 256GB USB drive (Samsung's offering for compact USB drive).  The Samsung completed the same task in a relatively brisk 8.5 minutes.  I repeated the same test again with the SanDisk using same files and USB port as the Samsung.  The SanDisk required almost 37 minutes to complete the same task...4 times longer / slower.  The Samsung costs a few dollars more and clearly worth it.In conclusion stand by my earlier recommendation that SanDisk should recall this product.  See that they have just released a 512GB version same all plastic construction which I feel is an outrage.  Combine the cheap construction and miserable performance these Ultra Fit drives are JUNK an accident waiting to happen.  I am so disappointed in SanDisk that they would offer such a bad and unreliable product.UPDATE 5/13/20More I fool around with this drive the more angry that I get.  Angry for the inconvenience but probably more disappointed with SanDisk felt they were a better company than this.  Aside from the flimsy construction which may save them a few penny's in manufacturing the drives are completely unsuitable for any reasonable use.If all you want to do is transfer some small files and light use it may be OK.  But if that is the expected use then why get a large capacity drive?  The whole point of owning 256GB of storage is to move around large amounts of data but these drives do not appear able to operate for even minimal periods of sustained activity without overheating.  And then there is the issue of the cheap construction.Reading thru some of the other reviews there are several commenting about how the drives lock up and unable use after that.  I am guessing that the user sees no activity thinks the computer is locked up and removes the drive.  Believe the removal leads to corruption of the files.  My experience says be patient allow the drive to limp its way thru.  What is likely happening is that the drive has shut itself down momentarily due to heat.  As stated above mine started out seemingly great but after about 2 or 3 minutes of continuous writing it started a cycle of randomly stopping and eventually resuming the copy task.  After several more minutes of this it settled into a pattern of writing data for 12-15 seconds around 700-800MB and then pausing for 60-80 seconds before resuming again writing 700-800MB in 12-15 seconds before stopping for another 60-80 seconds.  The drive was hot so it appears the drives have heat monitoring and suspend operation until the drive cools down some.  Making the drive useless for moving large amounts of data.Simple Truth - SANDISK IS SELLING JUNK NOW.UPDATE 6/21/20 - Rec'd the "replacement" of the "replacement".  Took about 3 weeks again to get replaced.  Same lame performance documented above so must be part of the SanDisk design.  Regret buying the 256GB Ultra Fit drive.  If you have the option buy the Samsung version and avoid this like the plague.  A truly bad product.
4,I bought this SanDisk 128GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive to replace my Lexar Jump Drive which conked out after 5 years.So far this SanDisk 128GB performs as expected.All the flash other drives I have one was made with at least part metal however this SanDisk is made entirely from plastic  It looks and feels very flimsy and not very sturdy.I hope that it does not fall apart with use.Time will tell about its durability
5,I loaded 500 of my favorite songs onto a pair of 32mb drives (could have gotten by with way smaller drive but wanted extra space for possible future songs) plugged them into USB port in vehicles (one in 2018 Challenger other in 2022 Ram) VERY small protrusion so minimal chance of bumping into and dislodging them. Works great! A bit snug and hard to push into the Ram USB port will make it a bit difficult to remove/add/reinstall if I ever need to.
4,pretty nice to have so much storage in a tiny thing. it's very plastic which makes tight fitting usb slots feel a bit risky and it's kinda difficult for meat fingered folk to pry it in and out but you can slap a wrist strap on the little loop and it's less nerve racking to use. i wouldn't put it on a key ring the weight of keys might damage the plastic. if you're not great with your fingers you might consider a traditional thumb drive.
5,I used this to fill it with music and plugged it into my car. Works like a charm and provided plenty to listen to on the roadtrip. Bought a second one for family! I love that it doesn't stick out of the usb port.
5,This was the easiest way to move all my music and  photos from one laptop to a new laptop. Fast and easy.
4,I get about a year's use out of one before the constant read/write of a Blink Sync module trashes the hardware. Cheap enough to keep reordering though! I'll probably buy another one when my newest one dies.VERY SMALL super easy to lose.
5,I originally had a 64GB drive from the days of past employment. However I am also running out of storage so often that before driving on my Tesla I had to delete previous clips to make room. And I was not about to pay $40+ on the Tesla shop when I can get something with the same capacity or more for half the price. Thus this item came in handy. Small compact and enough storage. I do have to format the drive on my computer instead of formatting via the USB port on the Tesla. I also attached a keychain figure to it as a per caution when I am in an incident I can rip it out the console pretty quick.
3,Boy was I surprised when this was delivered to me. This thing is TINY. It is literally about the size of an adult's thumbnail. And it works reasonably well. Faster than one I bought six years ago. However it didn't work out for two of the things I really wanted.First I actually searched for "metal" jump drives because I have one on my keyring and it works really really well. The old one is silver in color (easy to see) a little shorter than your average key very slim and tough! This one isn't. It's black and way smaller which means it's easy to lose. And although it looks like black metal in the pictures it's actually brittle soft plastic which means you have to be careful not to break it. You could step on it and totally destroy it. You could probably even break it in half with your fingers. If you put it on your keyring you are definitely taking your chances. Between two metal keys it will probably break.Second it doesn't fit on a regular keychain! The hole at the top is really small. I had to hunt for a very small wire circle to put through the hole and then I could attach the wire circle to a keyring. But it will not directly fit on to the average keyring. You might think so from the pictures on amazon but again when you realize just how small the entire drive is it becomes obvious that the hole is barely big enough to fit a piece of fishing line or thin twine.For the capacity and speed it's a pretty good deal. But if you're looking for something rugged to put on your keyring I'd get something else.
4,I purchased this for my Roku TV which can instant replay up to 90 minutes of a program. The Roku can only use 16GB storage so this was more than adequate for what I needed. It is so tiny that it fits well behind a TV without interfering in the wall mount or any other cables back there. If you're looking for a large amount of storage a better value would be to purchase a larger capacity storage stick; I noticed that larger capacities were cheaper per GB of storage. But you can't beat the size of this and if you need to store it on the side of a computer it sits there indiscreetly.
5,The price capacity and size of this disc is great!
5,Plug this into your laptop and leave it there.  Its low profile means it does not interfere with packing the laptop into a case or backpack. Instant portable/extra storage.
4,The quality is not that assured since its made of plastic. But overall it does the job.
3,I bought these to listen to songs I like in my truck had a 32 gb jump drive already but it stuck out so far I was afraid it would get broke off in the USB slot in the dash so I sent for these as they are really short and fit great against the dash and my fear almost happened as I went to the car wash and when I guess they were vacuuming the truck they hit it and bent it up .... Still worked but was something that I feared... Got these the next day and they work flawlessly ... Thankyou
4,works good but not as fast as expected to write to.
5,excellent
5,I use it for music in vehicle
4,Great
3,I purchased this SanDisk ultra fit 250gb USB flash drive to expand the storage space on my Nvida Shield TV Pro. The installation and formatting was easy a great little drive with fantastic storage. This drive was only used the store app no games or movies. Purchased in 2020 it is now 2022 and the drive is dead it gets very hot and stops my Nvida Shield Pro from booting up. The drive has a 5 year warranty. I will reach out to SanDisk to see they will replace it.
5,Tiny portable exactly what I needed
4,It really is small difficult to handle has a good metric of storage And is hot all the time when inserted (even with the device turned off)....Thanks....!...
5,These work great for the usb in my car stereo since they do not stick out very far so they dont get bumped
5,Great I'm happy!
5,Price -I bought this SanDisk flash drive for just under $7 bucks to play my mix tunes in my vehicle.Caveats -It arrived on March 24 where I live in Houston. Houston being paradise is generally hot and humid.What I Put It Through -When I'm not in my Ford Escape it can get Houston hot though the SanDisk was kept in the dark out of direct sunlight and covered by my console lid.Still pretty hot and muggy as well.I removed it around once a week to update my playlist.Result -So with all of those things considered? The SanDisk lasted less than 6 months before case break. The actual memory drive remains in good condition and it works great when the vehicle is still. It also works just fine in my laptop though it gets hot when transferring simple wav files.However that missing piece of plastic means the SanDisk shifts just slightly enough when I drive over bumps or potholes that I lose the connection. A disc in my player skips less and recovers quick and without fuss.If you won't be taking this flash drive on the road your use may be longer.Summary -Actually this SanDisk is probably more of a desktop drive. Plug it in once and leave it as it doesn't seem to be built for what a flash drive is made for: portability and mobility.On the other hand the price reflects the build quality of the housing yet the quality of the actual SanDisk chipset is great: Good to know for DIY projects where the housing is unnecessary.If you're looking for a portable drive for your mix tunes in your vehicle you may want to look elsewhere.Final Suggestion -My Elsewhere is trying a metal container flash drive with the Samsung MUF-32AB/AM FIT USB 3.1 next.Sure 200MB a second is overkill for music but it only costs a few bucks more and if it lasts at least a year then it's worth it.
5,I use it for MP3 songs and yo can hardly see it it blends in perfect.
4,Have it for couple of months  with no problem
5,I received my drive in a pristine state and as described. The device is actually very small and you could easily misplace it if you are not very careful.This is the second drive I own from the same company. I think they make great reliable and fast drives. These drives are secure and reliable as long as they don't reach failure at which point the drives partially lockup and work only in read mode. Still I think this secure feature is a great idea since you don't actually lose any data. My last drive failed due to overuse but my data is still secure and it is for this reason that I bought this second one. This drive is therefore NOT FOR HEAVY USE but for SECURE STORAGE.About the read and write speeds I think some of those claims are a bit exaggerated. Although its stated that it depends on the device and other factors I still find the actual speeds to be far off from the stated ideals. All things considered I think it still possesses decent read and write speeds on my Usb 3.0 port (about Write :15MB/s and Read :30MB/s). The drive really feels fast and you may not even notice its off from purported R/W speeds.Overall I highly recommend this drive. Provides excellent value for the money.
3,Capacity is great. Small profile is great. That claimed 130MB is read speed. Please note... write speeds state UP TO 15X over USB 2 speeds. Key words here are UP TO.I use this device to store flac music files for playback in my car. I have plugged this drive into USB 2 3 & 3.1 ports for writing purposes. I have seen extremely marginal performance differences between USB 3 & 3.1 (fluctuates between 35 - 55 MB when writing anywhere from 200MB - 2GB at a time). On a USB 2 port I get speeds around 20 MB on average. I will post test results and adjust figures as needed later as I am going from memory at this point.On another point the frame of this no longer appears to be made of metal. I would say it is made of some type of composite material. I believe this was done with a purpose on the manufacturer to alleviate the heat issues with the previous model (which I also own) While it still gets warm while writing it no longer gets hot to the touch like the previous model did. The heat dissipates much quicker. Given that I do worry about the longevity and duability of this device should it have to be used and plugged in frequently in many devices.Overall it serves my purposes. Write speeds could be better and durability could be an issue. Hence my reason for three stars.**********Edit**********I have included Crystalmark tests (1 @ 500MB in size for USB 2 & 3). I did 5 tests while having it plugged into a USB 3.1 gen 2 port (1 of each @ 500MB 1GB 2GB 4GB & 8GB). Speeds start dropping down the larger the test file was.Speed breakdown for the images is as follows for those that were wondering:USB 2.0 image is the read speed of 40.22 & write speed of 17.01USB 3.0 image is the read speed of 126.2 & write speed of 50.41USB 3.1 gen 2 images are the remaining 5 images as well as the windows copying imagesJust for a test I copied over an approximately 4GB video file to the drive via the USB 3.1 gen 2 port (see the windows copying images). At the halfway point of the file the speed starts to drop off and never recovers. Looks like the video file maintained a good 64 MB until the halfway mark.
4,It's slow and cheap and easily misplaced.

5,LOVE the small size.  Use it as an external Hard Drive for my laptop..
5,If you want a really small USB Drive - this is for you.  Works great and is incredibly small.
4,Cheap and fast work's fine with steam games on handheld pc.
5,So far I have two of these flash drives. Both are currently connected to my laptop via a USB 3.0 hub. One is older than the other. Both have been functioning well. I have the 256 gb version on both. Nice amount of space for not a lot of money helping me keep my hard drive cleaner.At one point I did have the older one directly connected to the computer. I've not noticed any difference in the transfer rate since I swapped it to the hub which was something I worried over. Both have nice transfer speeds more than geared to my needs.*Edit August 2021*Since I originally wrote this review sometime in 2020 I have invested in several more of these drives. I now have somewhere around 12 to 15 or so ranging in size between 64 gb all the way up to the 512 gb version. They are used in multiple applications. Three are "TV" drives attached to the three smart TV's in the house (unless I'm adding to them in which case they spend some time in one of the two USB hubs I have.) One is about to be geared towards my Wii and the rest are computer storage for my desktop and laptop. Those "computer storage" ones are the ones that live in the hubs full time.I use them for everything. I've a massive music collection and that is now split between about 4 of the 512 gb's. My movies are on another one is for "computer file storage" (which is my catch-all drive for program files pictures and documents.) I could keep going with the uses I have for these but the long story short is I no longer have to worry about losing everything if my hard drive fails me. Because even if one or two of these lock up loss will be minimal.Speed is still not an issue at all And to date none have locked up on me and they see quite a bit of use.
5,Works like any other flash drive but it’s compactness and storage size makes it a must have.  You don’t have to worry about inadvertently hitting it because it sticks out too far.
5,Love how little it is the Flash drive I had before whenever I wanted to turn up or down the volume my hand would hit the flash drive and disconnect it but with this one it's so out of the way people don't even realize its a flash drive so awesome 😁😁😁😁
5,Works great
4,Small. Tie something to it so you don’t lose it🤣
4,Full transparency I did not read any reviews before I bought this class drive. So it's possible  this has already been stated.  With that said the only negative I have for this drive is that it is completely plastic.  This includes the port connector that would usually be metal.This isn't much of a problem for me because it stays in it's port in my RPi Little Backup Box as the backup location.  However I question the durability of this tiny drive if it were regularly removed and inserted.Other than that 1 potential problem it's a SanDisk flash drive. It just works.
3,So I guess I should've seen this coming as the Photon-series of Resin Printers are notorious for being finnicky with even in-OEM-spec flash drives and because this is USB3.1 it TECHNICALLY doesn't match the 2.0 drives that Anycubic recommends (even though all USB3.X's are backwards compatible... but that's a whole other conversation). But I'm not sure that's the issue - it might just be on a chip-level but these Sandisk drives are constantly causing issues with these printers. Yes I made sure it's formatted correctly: re-formatted TWICE as FAT32 with MBR still didn't work. Even when loading it with ONLY the stock Anycubic Photon Mono calibration files. I've seen endless posts saying not to go above 16gigs so I didn't.Either way all I know is; as SOON as I plug it into my Photon Mono it instantly freezes up. Doesn't matter if I plug it in before-or-after booting it up or if the printers' touchscreen is working before plugging it in. Wherever I am in the menu if I plug the drive in it WILL freeze...  This is the same issue that the infamous Anycubic Drive Incompatibility causes in seemingly EVERY other case. Only solution seems to be checking the internal USB-run (which shouldn't be the problem since the stock drive still works fine) re-formatting and getting lucky (not so far...) or updating the printer firmware (I'm on the most-recent).-----------  It's unfortunate as its a quality drive with modern specs & for the best price. The SIZE can't be beat either which is what drew me to it in the first place! I dont want a 1-foot long wobbly-behemoth of a drive for just 16Gb sticking outta the side of my printer!Bummer just gotta return it and go for a cheap generi. i suppose... :(
5,I’ve had this for a couple weeks now and downloaded over 100gb onto it it does get really hot but that should be expected due to its size it’s really great for everyday use.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Great for the fact that it is already FAT32 formatted and ready to use for audio files in my Honda Accord audio system. It is extremely slim profile which is great for my application. Only thing I do not like is that it is made of plastic and I'm concerned it may melt or warp in extreme heat in the car.
3,The drive works fine haven't really tested the speeds because it's my music stick so once the data is there I don't expect to move it much. The beauty of this one (and that was what I'd been looking for) is that the profile is very small.What is abysmal however is the construction. It's pathetically flimsy using what appears to be thin and brittle plastic. Mine goes into the car's USB port hidden away and will stay there untouched for all eternity so I'm not too concerned. But if you need this low profile drive to be handled daily (or at least frequently) in your laptop or such consider something else cause this one does not look like it will take it well.3 stars because that is nowhere near the build quality I expected from SanDisk.
4,I ordered this as a back-up drive that I can use to transport files from my laptop to my desktop computer. Other than being a little hard to pull out at times it does the job well.
4,I needed 500 gig of USB storage.  I have multiple PC images that I was using 3 128gig sticks to tote around.  This condenses into 1.  I also keep them on my badge and they are clanging around.  This will make it easier on me.Pros:SmallCons:Only 460 gig after formatting.-SLOW.  I have a Lexar 128 that I bought when 3.0 came out.  This drive is 1 Gig per minute slower.  My PC images are around 30 gig.  I'm using Clonezilla so Windows Drivers are not used but still.-Cheap plastic housing.  Not sure how long it will last on my lanyard.-No "rope" (string) like connector to put on my lanyard.  If I buy separately I have to purchase 10.  I just need 1; preferably with a quick connector.  The metal clip I have prevents me from inserting the drive completely into USB.-Size; Due to its size I can easily forget it's there and walk away.So all in all it's not bad.  Not the fastest but if you are looking for pure size this fits the bill.--UPDATE--If you use this in Windows it's fast.  The workstations I have (100+) are HP Z440.  The transfer speeds are faster on my newer Z2G4 or Z4G4 in Clonezilla (no Windows drivers) and of course this stick is really fast in Windows.  I added a star because the Z440's seem to be slower in Clonezilla than the Z2's.  Maybe architecturally there's something in the Bios or whatever but it's faster on modern hardware non-Windows.  Still annoys me that there is no lanyard connector as described above.  I used one I had from another drive for this since this is now my primary stick.
5,First it is a SanDisk. I have used SanDisk for years. I know that I can trust them. I don't know the quality of brands that I have never heard of. Will they loses all of my data? Second 256 GB for this price?! Amazing. Then this flash drive has San Disk Secure Access for Windows. Here you can Back up or restore 2GB of your data in your Private Access vault. Also it uses 128 bit AES encryption to create a password-protected folder—San Disk Secure Access Vault—on the flash drive. Any locked files are moved into the SanDisk Secure Access Vault and can be accessed only with a password. This is value added software that the no name manufacturers don't offer.One additional feature is that it has a non-metal body. I am a geek. I study everything to do with computers. Metal body flash drives heat up more and retain the heat. This can damage your flash drive. The larger the data storage the worse this becomes. So this body type is better. I will tell you that even this one can heat up if you keep it plugged into your computer or paste a lot of data in a short period of time. I doubt that this will hurt this flash drive since I have done both but just use caution since you are dealing with a lot of storage.
4,The SanDisk 128GB USB drive is compact quick and transfers data efficiently. I'm not a fan of the accompanying software. It's too quirky and needs work. Still I'd recommend the drive.
5,This is a cheap flash drive that can hold 128GB...For the price this item is definitely 5 stars. I'm not saying there aren't any flaws but if you just need something to store/transfer a bunch of files once in a while this is good enough for the job. A bunch of other reviews have posted about read/write speeds but the fact is this is good enough for an average person just trying to use a flash drive once in a while.Flaws: Again for my purposes of just using it occasionally these flaws are not enough to dock the rating.Plastic: The head that you insert into the USB port is made out of a plastic so it does not feel as solid or secure as the typical ones that are usually made of metal. I would be afraid of throwing this into a bag with other objects because it will break for sure. If you need a flash drive that can survive rough conditions this is NOT for you.Size: Now this is why I bought the drive but the handle that is meant to pull the drive out sits really close to the computer. Not an issue for me as I bought it to just use occasionally so it's not too much of a hassle but a few times it was actually hard to pull out of the computer because of the plastic casing and how tiny and smooth that handle it. If you have smaller fingers maybe it will be less of a problem. Again didn't dock any stars off for this because it isn't much of an issue for me just something to consider.Bottom line: This is a great bang for buck flash drive with a large amount of storage from a trustworthy brand. It would be hard to find another at this price if you are just an average person who needs a flash drive sometimes.
4,Pretty impressed by the size of the device does what it needs to and did not have any issues with it so far. Only complaint is that the item is made out of plastic for the most part and feels pretty cheap. It also gets hot after a while of use.
5,Like that its small the only thing is that it heats up quick when transferring files.
4,I really like the size and convenience of these drives. They are very portable and the are very unobtrusive in the ports on my computers. Transfer speeds are good. Sometimes I can even forget I have them in. I really don't have any real negatives on these except they do get really warm with use and the usual getting 28GB of the full 32GB they all advertise.
4,Its a little slow nothing crazy. I expected this for the size. Really you buy this to put stuff on it infrequently and use it more as a read drive. If you need to do constant transfers you should look at a faster and more expensive model. Great for its purpose though use it a ton to store and playback videos and images.
4,I use the SanDisk 512G "Plug and Stay" in my MacBook Pro. Bought via Amazon.  It abruptly failed completely--unreadable unrecognizable total loss. It was < 2 years old. The sandisk website is impossibly complex and designed to make people give up before getting a replacement. This is disappointing.
3,Don't like that it does have capacity label you have to put it in your computer to know the size.
5,Perfect for storing data one does not want erased by a computer glitch.
4,Great little drive. My only complaint is there is no protective end cap. In my opinion this detracts from the portability. I had an extra cap so all's good.
4,Pros:+++ Very small so it’s easy to store and fairly hard to break by bending it.+++ Cheap for a version 3 USB.+++ Seems to last forever.Cons:-- Not as fast as other higher cost version 3 USB’s.-- Get’s uncomfortably hot when writing more than a gigabyte.- It’s plastic so it’s easier to break if get’s stuck in the computer according to others but in my experiences it doesn’t get stuck.-it being so small makes it super easy to lose.Overall: Great little USB for doing basic school work or just backing up game save files.
3,Drive died less than two years after purchase under moderate usage.  However the drive is small portable and fast.
5,Works great to back up my data folder in my laptop
5,The drive allows for plenty of storage for video for information that is needed out on the road.
4,Using with a blink camera system and it's working great no problems small and nice
4,All in all a great drive but really deceptive write speeds.  Notice they never actually state the write speed only 15X 2.0 (at 4 Mb/s) implying 60 Mb/s.  Well it only does 55 Mb/s for a couple of minutes then it settles in at a constant 21.4 Mb/s: see pictures of actual write tests versus short term benchmarks.
5,just what I wanted
4,Great price and low profile.  I bought it for a gadget used in my car.  It’s port cracked after 2.5 years use without much putting in or pulling out.  Its port is plastic so not durable
5,I use these to put MP3 music on for listening in the car and RV. 32GB holds a ton of music. Love these!
4,They still do the lying about byte size thing that harddisk manufactures do. Which is comical at this point but it works. Runs at up to 31 m bits per second. usually at 16.
5,I love the very small size and large storage capacity of this usb “thumbnail” drive.  Very unobtrusive when plugged into my laptop’s USB port and it’s almost unbelievable how much data can be stored on such a teeny-tiny device.  The transfer rates have in my opinion been acceptable and though I’ve only been using it a few weeks it has performed reliably.  The incredibly low cost is almost unbelievable!  Remember how expensive digital storage was just a few years ago?The only possible problem with a device this small is the increased chance of losing or misplacing it so you have got to be careful.  This device comes with software installed on it that will help safeguard your data if lost or stolen Which I think is very thoughtful.One last thing if you don’t already know it digital storage devices always list a storage capacity (16gb 32gb 64gb etc) but the actual storage capacity is always a bit less.  Now there is a very complicated technical explanation for why this is and you can easily search the Internet for the whys and wherefores but don’t freak out because your device is a few gigabytes short of what you thought you were purchasing.  It is what it is and all the bitching and moaning that some people do over this matter isn’t going to change it.  So now you know.I highly recommend this tiny high capacity digital storage device sold at a fantastic price.  I wasn’t disappointed you probably won’t be either.  On the rare chance that the one you receive is defective Amazon makes returns smooth and easy just exchange it for another one or get your money back.  Not too much of a hassle all things considered.
5,I purchased this for use in my Blink camera system. I was immediately recognized passed a virus scan without issue and was easily formatted. The very small profile is perfect for the Blink Sync Module 2.About the only potential downside I can see is the small size. It could be rather easy to lose if you're not careful.At the current price of $15.87 for a 128 gb USB flash drive it is a good value.
5,I use thumb drives to play music on my not so smart car stereos.  The storage capacity allows me to put a lot of music on the drive and the low profile keeps it from getting damaged like the longer ones.
5,Ordered these for their small inconspicuous size and a name (Sandisk) that I have trusted before. No problems with these work good and are fairly fast. My use is for music storage and playback.
5,Works great the smaller form factor helps a lot when in a server as it's not sticking up with the potential to hit something.
4,The part of this USB drive that slides into the USB port is made of plastic and although I was concerned about the life of this thumb drive when I bought it (Aug 5 2019) I purchased it anyway. During the two years that I had this thumb drive I used it approximately 350 times overall. But a few days ago I noticed the plastic housing began to split open and I could no longer slide it into the USB port. I regret buying the thumb drive because I should have known the plastic housing would not last long. (Most thumb drive makers use metal.) I called Sandisk for warranty coverage (it should have been covered for 5 years) but it is now a week later and still no return call has been received.I revised this review from a 1-star to a 4-star on Aug 7 2021 because SanDisk eventually did respond to my warranty claim and provided a replacement thumb drive for the one that failed.
4,Very small size but write is slower than expected.
5,The name of the SanDisk 256GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive or SDCZ430-256G-G46 for short or flash-drive for shorter nearly fits its personality: it is even smaller on the outside while being larger on the inside. This little guy currently resides in a USB 3.0 (Type A) port without a hiccup. It will not fit a USB Type C port. Yes USB 3.0 is compatible with this USB 3.1 device (or USB 2.0): just use your amazing Google-foo if you want more details. It is pictured in a 15” laptop with a chicklet keyboard for size comparison. The flash-drive’s rounded edges mitigate it catching on anything and it does not interfere with opening/closing the laptop or with storing/removing the laptop from its protective travel sleeve.The pictured laptop it graces has a small M.2 drive of the 128GB variety. Rather than cloning the drive to a larger replacement I decided to save some $$ time and probable headache by adding the flash-drive as additional storage. I’m cheap lazy and don’t like headaches. I now point all downloads file storage etc. to this little guy. The USB 3 transfer speeds are fast enough for my purposes including a Steam gaming library for smaller titles. While I have not noticed an appreciable performance hit while doing productivity tasks including graphic design I would not recommend using it for handling large files (such as editing audio or video). However while gaming I did notice a slight drop in FPS but not enough to make any of my installed titles unplayable: I am also too lazy to determine how much performance loss is attributable to the flash-drive and how much to the non-gaming-laptop in which it resides.Oh did I mention the flash-drive has a loop for attaching it to a lanyard?I purchased this flash-drive fair-and-square and did not participate in the dubious activity of a paid promotion.
5,used the 128GB drive for booting unraid had to prep with rufus per the wiki
5,The flash drive works as advertised. It is very small which is what I wanted to use in my car to play music. It doesn't stick out of the usb slot so I don't bump it reaching into my console.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Muy Práctica y portable
4,This small storage device really packs a punch when it comes to storage.  This 512GB thumb disk is really portable as well.
5,Fastest most compact data boost!  Used with OTG adapter for both my FireSticks.  Trusted brand!
5,I don't know why you guys are having problems. My laptop like many nowdays came with 512Gb SSD. As an amateur photographer that is NOT enough room!! I was using 2 of the SanDisk 256Gb Ultra Fit flash drives as my primary data drives. I keep them in along with a 256 SD card ALL THE TIME!! I've had and used them for over 9 months and have had no problem with them. YES they get hot BUT I have never had one of the fail or stop reading/writing.NOW I've taken out my 512Gb SSD and replaced it with a 2TB SSD. I transfered about 230Gb of files/folders from each USB flash drive and YES..... they got hot but they kept reading and writing to my 2Tb SSD. My "A" Flash drive I deleted most everything and I primarily use that now as a "transfer drive" to go between my laptop and desktop. My "B" Flash drive I still have 221Gb of files/folders on it. I will delete those IF I need it.THESE SanDisk 256Gb Ultra Fit USB drives have worked perfectly and NEVER have failed on me. They are a FULL FIVE STARS in my book!!!My system is a Dell Inspiron 7573 15 inch 2in1 with UHD display. Along with the Intel UHD Graphics 620 it also has the Nvdia MX130 GPUI now have 2Tb PCIe SSD and 32Gb RAM. I still keep my 2-256Gb Ultra Fit USB flash drives in all the time and now have a 512Gb SD card in it too.I am VERY happy with my 256Gb Ultra Fit USB Flash Drives!!I hope this helps some..... There is nothing wrong with this Flash Drive.
4,The device is still working fine after about a year but part of the plastic case has fallen off.  We don't move it between devices very often maybe once a month at most.  Transfer speed is not that great. our external Seagate HDD out performs but it's acceptable.
5,Wanted an small usb storage that wouldn't look like a memory stick.  This looks like a receiver for a keyboard or mouse.
3,bought this to replace a faulty SD card reader on my Linux laptop.  Works fine but gets very hot when I am using the laptop which is for short periods thankfully.  I suspect it will have a short life.
5,The price is awesome and it is extremely portable and easy to carry around but sometimes like in the printer I have to use a tool to pry it out because of how the eyelet is bent up a little (by design).
3,Pretty decent little flash drive if it didn't generate enough heat to attract stray cats through a double-insulated exterior wall.That's exaggeration obviously but the thing DOES get super hot.I checked it with a thermometer gun and it was showing between 109F to 142F (43C to 61C) depending on how much of a load it was under.The thin little plastic cowling is remarkably fragile (something I doubt the heat helps with over time).----TBH they could have solved both problems just by making the external housing out of Aluminum rather than plastic.I'd have paid an extra $10 just for that as it'd also serve as a passive heat sink which would extend the product's lifetime as well as durability.---I just got it today but I'll keep everyone updated on how long it lasts though I plan to use it infrequently.Here's hoping this isn't just a disappointing way to light a $50 bill on fire.Edit 1 - 2021.08.01Okay so I've only had this flashdrive for less than 12 hours at this point and I've learned something interesting.I bought a USB 3.2 PCIe x4 card for my computer with the flash drive as my motherboard only has two integrated USB 3.0 ports and an additional two USB 2.0 ports.When the flash drive is in a 3.0 port it gets hot enough that handling it with bare skin is more than a little bit painful (generally staying around 120F while running default settings on CrystalDiskMark).When using it in one of my new card's USB 3.2 slots it generated SIGNIFICANTLY less heat. (Staying around 85F under identical software and external conditions.)So if you're going to use one use it in a USB 3.2 port.Please note I don't have a USB 3.1 port to test it on so it's unknown whether or not 3.1 is sufficient enough to significantly lessen the heat.
3,Purchased for Unraid based on a report it worked for someone else. Turns out the product has changed or is a knock off. Without a GUID it is incompatible with Unraid. Still I can use for other things but I noticed already with short use that this thing gets very hot.
5,I bought this primarily to use as a multiple OS bootable USB drive.  I like that it is small it can attach to a keychain and forget that it is even there.  I installed Ventoy on this USB drive then added around a dozen different live Linux distribution ISOs and latest Windows ISO.  With this USB drive I am able to carry multiple operating systems and boot to any of them using Ventoy.  In terms of speed it is very fast booting on this USB that I couldn't even tell if it is because of a fast computer or fast USB drive.  This drive has enough space that aside from the ISOs I am able to put in other application installers.  Since this is tiny often times when I use it on a laptop I forget to unplug it since it is hardly noticeable.  So far I am happy with this purchase I won't hesitate to buy another one if needed.
5,I like these shorty memory sticks for use in locations where the USB port may get damaged.  My wife would put her heavy purse on top of the console and also on top of larger memory sticks that hold her favorite MP3s.  They also work great in my boat where I don't want the long memory sticks protruding out and getting bumped.
5,Worked perfect for our storage needs.  Ultra compact and lots of storage.
5,This thing is TINY. I have two "standard" thumb drives that I've had for years. They're 32 and 64GB and cumbersome. Granted they each screw into a matched cylinder to make them nearly indestructible but they're huge. When I looked at adding a second SSD to a laptop I just received this drive popped up in my search. It's perfect. Tiny easy to use relatively fast and big enough to be used as my data drive instead of cracking the laptop case for a new internal. I just leave it plugged in even when transporting the computer.
5,I love SanDisk. Great company. I am very satisfied with the performance of this product. It is so teeny tiny I wish it came with some sort of housing pouch container to store it in.
5,Great Storage Capacity in small device Great for Automobile. Store kids movies for daily commutes and use it also to store and share photos. Easy and cheap to send in the mail.
5,slim feature for on the go with a laptop
5,So small to fit any surrounding areas. No performance issues. Read and write speed is stable enough to copy big size files.
5,Works perfectly with The Blink system for local video storage. I was concerned that it wouldn’t have enough capacity but it holds  all my clips with no danger of running out of space during the 30 day period I have it set for.
5,The small size makes it less noticeable when attached. Easy to remove when needed.
5,it does what you need it to do
3,Thumbdrives are thumbdrives in terms of USB storage.  Aside from speed rating they are all about the same for storage.  The real difference is their physical design.  This drive is tiny.  Only about 1/4 inch extends out of the USB connector slot.  There is no light to indicate activity and no way to attach a keyring or item to it so it doesn't get lost.  I guess I should have noticed all of this from the pictures but physical functionality didn't come to me until I tried to use one.First thing I noticed is that once inserted no LED of activity indicator at all.  It could be dead or it could be working.  Who knows from the outside.  Second was the size.  After I copied files to it I just didn't know where to put it.  In my pocket meant certain laundry day damage.  On a desk or in a drawer meant certainly losing track of it.  Point is buy a larger drive or at least one with a small opening to attach a keychain or something to so you can find it ever again.
5,I put this in a USB drive on my computer you can barely tell it's there and I backed it up to this drive so if it ever goes down I've got this to try to boot from the fact that it's looks like part of the computer it's almost flush as a matter of fact it's a nice compliment it's a good product I think you'll like it.
4,Works well never had issues with PNY. The plastic housing is weak. At time I feel as if I'm about to break it.
3,Tiny and fit my ShieldTVit help it got more space to AppBut maybe it was so small then hot too often...Finally after 2 yrs used . its totally dead !!!
5,Perfect for use in the car  don't stick out very far
5,Easy to use
4,I bought this to supplement the limited internal storage of a Chromebook. One caveat is the USB housing gets hot when in use.
4,Its to small. I lose it sometimes.
5,I bought this for playing music in my car. It definitely has more than enough space for the audio files i put on it. I've been using it for about 2 and half months now and so far haven't had any issues with it
5,👍
5,Fast on my usb 3.0
3,I've always considered this manufacturer reliable and this item seemed to have good reviews so I bought several.  In use and in certain equipment they run particularly hot which leads to early failure.  Only about 2/3 of the ones I bought are still in service.  I would not purchase again.
5,So i make emulators for friends and family i decieded that i wanted to make a tiny portable game consel for my brother he broke his ds. So the usb boots fast and has enough storage for my retro game libary and my kid brother loves it.
4,for backup of my mac
5,Good product
5,This drive is everything I could have hoped for. Transfer speed are excellent whether you're doing small or large files.I filled it up immediately with all my digital shows that aren't streaming on the services I pay for and plugged it into my tv. Now I still have all my shows available at the push of a button.It is so tiny you could easily lose it. For me that's a pro as it hides easily on my tv or laptop. If you're carrying it around you'll likely want a lanyard or something similar to keep it secure.Capacity is good. By now we all know that the bigger the drive the further it gets from the advertised capacity. This drive has an acceptable deviation for me and more importantly it is really a high capacity drive. Be wary of cheap drives claiming to be high capacity. Those tend to have their microcontroller reprogrammed to display higher than actual capacity leading to data corruption when you exceed actual capacity.Sandisk is the real deal though and I've never had a problem with them.
3,I bought a 64 gig flash drive.. Yes I know it is measured by bits and not by the computer version that reads slightly lower.. But this drive is missing gigs of space.. My computer reads my 64 gig drive as 57.2 gigs.. But if you read the actual bit amount it is actually about 61.5 gigs.. This drive is about 2.5 gigs smaller then advertised.So far the only thing i did was copy just a little over 5 gigs of music files onto it to test it out.. It got slightly warm but that is about it. I could then read and play the music files with no problem.One bad thing about this drive.. If you have 2 USB ports and want to use them both.. You have to make sure that this is on the top slot.. The little flange that is there to make it easy to grab on the top of it makes it impossible to use this in the bottom slot and still put something in the top slot.. It sticks up too much.The write speed that I got using it was right around 10 gigs.. Just a little under on my USB2 slot on my laptop.. I have not tested it on any USB3 slot. No read tests were done.Overall it was not very expensive.. Not the fastest USB around but not too bad all considering. I just do not like them advertising this as a 64 gig when it clearly is not.. Since I mainly wanted something to hook up to my media box and something that would not stick out too much this will work fine for my needs.. Since it is only about 10 dollars I am not going to complain too much about it being shorted in size.. They should just be more truthful about it.
5,Changes laptops and saved everything  and I do mean E V E R Y T H I N G with no problem!
5,Purchased for a ubuntu os full install works great the read and write speeds dont slow os down. I dont run any big programs and this works great the chip warms up but nothing alarming. the removal of device needs to be careful as it is plastic turns out for laptops the removal edge for the nails works great otherwise need to grip both sides and slowly wiggle out.
5,This was plug and play for my Blink surveillance camera sync module. That's also a very small light device and a larger usb drive would tip it. This drive is super compact and light perfect for my needs and I marvel at how small a footprint you can now get in these higher capacities.
5,This flash drive (256 GB) does exactly what it says it does.  I had confidence in using it comparing it to another cheaper flash drive touting 1T that I purchased which arrived in a small zip lock bag no identification on either the drive or the bag and no identification once I installed it.  Made me very uneasy not sure what I was installing and chose not to download to it.  I decided to buy only from a reputable company based in the USA from that point forth. Sure the cost is higher I downsized to 256 GB but I needed to trust exactly what I was downloading to.  The ScanDisk flash drive came sealed with ample validation of its authenticity on the back of the package.  The only down side is the drive itself is small and when removing it can easily be lost.  There are lots of containers i.e. small pill boxes canisters that can be used to avoid it being lost.  I'll overlook this problem just wanted something I could trust and that works as advertised.  Will buy another one if I need more space.
5,Great usb stick for storage in hubs and other IoT things.
4,Maybe the problem is with my computer?
5,good price for lots of space. reliable brand
5,Very small thumb drive that has a decent amount of storage. Super portable and easily transferred between devices.
5,I'm happy with the product and the seller.Fast and reliable delivery.Bought it to preapre multiboot for few Linux distros with persistent storage. It's an awesome fit for such a purpose.
4,This product is a pretty nice product for the price. I transfers at pretty decent speed from PC to USB but when it comes to USB to USB it can take some time but that also depends on the other drive. The product comes standard with just the USB thumb drive no lanyard/string to hold it but if you have a key ring and string this would go great on your keys. It can store exactly all the stuff you need being 128 gb and it is very light weight and small. This made it ideal for me to have for my keys. I will say encrypting the USB drive is a must just to protect the data from being stolen or you lose your keys. It was very simple for me to put a key string on this USB compared to other usb thumb drive as it has a pretty big hole for the string to go through. The minor complaint I have which is going to be a given since the size of the thumb drive is really small is that the USB can get really hot over a short amount of time. It is too hot to the touch but you can notice it so I do not recommend keeping it plugged in for extended period of time. After you transfer I would recommend unplugging it if it is not in use. Great product overall!
4,No issues exporting music files from a nano SD card connected to my laptop. It did however take a super loooooooooong time to transfer over 13k songs...I'm unsure if it was due to the speed of the disk or if that's the usual time for that amount of data. Overall it served my purpose.
2,I was trying to decide what 32GB USB3 drive to get. It need to be reliable reasonably quick and sleek enough to not block neighboring ports even on something like a Raspberry PI. I narrowed down my choices to these:SanDisk 32GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 (ASIN B077VXV323)Samsung MUF-32AB/AM FIT Plus 32GB  (ASIN B07D7SX9NS)SanDisk - SDCZ73-032G-G46 32GB Ultra Flair USB 3.0 (ASIN B015CH1JIW)Price on all 3 is about $8. I ended buying one of each to test.The "Ultra FIT" and "Fit+" are both very small basically little more than a stub on top of the USB connector. The "Ultra Flair" protrudes about 1inch out from the connector. The physical ruggedness of any these did not really impress - unlike the original "Ultra Fit" that had a solid largely metal exterior all of these are primarily plastic. On all 3 when copying a large 6GB file the first 10 seconds or so was very fast then the speed would drop 50% or so and then stabilize at the benchmark speeds. The 6GB copy took less than 4min on all devices. Speeds on all 3 were close to claimed ratings and in the same league. None were "SSD" replacements but that's really not expected in this size and price.See the benchmark tests attached for all 3.Sandisk Ultra Fit:+ Smallest - could leave this in a laptop all the time~ Slowest Read but unlikely to be an issue for most applications- Slowest Write- All plastic shell including connector!- Gets VERY hot during extended writing - actually slightly painful to hold my finger in continuous contactSamsung Fit+:+ Small but does protrude more than the Ultra Fit. Also a bit wider but still fits the RPi.+ Fastest read speed of all 3+ Fastest write speed of al 3~ Plastic cap but metal connector shell~ Warm with extended use but not hot- Very tight fit in socket afraid it could cause damage (is that what Fit+ means?)Sandisk Ultra Flair:+ Very narrow profile can fit the tightest packed USB sockets~ 2nd best read speed~ 2nd best write speed~ Half metal half plastic shell with metal connector~ Produces as much heat as the Ultra Fit but metal back cools better- Projects out of socket considerably more (1 inch)If small size is the most important and you don't plan to unplug/plug it often I would go with the Samsung Fit+.For applications where some length is OK I prefer the Sandisk Ultra Flair.I can't really recommend the "Ultra Fit" due to heat issues.None of these tests involved prolonged usage so the endurance of the flash is TBD.
4,I've been using SanDisk for several years buying dozens of their products (A multitude of flash drives including their 1TB Flashdrive & more) and I trust them a lot more than other brands (PNY and Kingston). I have never been let down by one of their products and this is no exception to that. While it has decent read and writing speeds (Does help to have better computer hardware and software) it has plenty of storage to store a substantial amount of storage. The only drawback to this and probably for a lot of people is this flash drive's physical size. The flash drive is designed to be a sort of 'stay in' design in terms of it being an ultra-low profile (though that's not what most people are going to be doing with the flash drive) which can for some people be a pain to try and take out. Aside from this the size can make it pretty easy to lose track of if you are not careful. If this really is too much of a concern then don't go for this flash drive (SanDisk has normal 'stick drives' like the "Cruzer Glider" for the same capacity (and often cheaper price).
5,Put this in my 2020 Dodge Challenger for music when I get tired of listening to the radio.  Tucked into the console USB with a very small profile.  That's what I wanted and why I purchased this one.
2,No problem loading my music (3500+ songs) on the USB and put one in my car and one in the truck.  I have a 2019 RAV4 and the radio was able to read the USB but every time I shut the car off I had to load the USB and the music would start from the beginning.  I took the USB back into the house and thought I would delete the music and reload but when I put it in the computer you could no longer access the USB. I tried it on both my laptop and computer with the same results.  I had to throw away both of the USB's because the result was the same with the one I had loaded in the truck.
5,I needed a very small thumb drive for my keyboard and this is perfect.  Decent transfer speeds super compact.  I'm happy with the purchase.
5,Used as storage on a 512 GB laptop. I had an SD card before but the adapter stuck out to far from the card slot. I thought a low profile thumb drive would be better without catching on anything. This drive is almost invisible on the side of my laptop and doesn't stick out as far as the tabs of some of the other peripherals. Only caveat was that even with NTFS the drive only shows 460 GB. My laptop goes to 475 GB. I know it's the math of computer storage but that's 30+GB's off the table. Would have been nicer to see it closer to the 512. Still it met all of my expectations short the amount of storage.
3,Review for the SDCZ430-016G-G46 SanDisk.This FlashDrive's specification is deceptive through omission. The READ speeds are good about 300MB/s. HOWEVER  Write speed is glacial at about 10MB/s - 17MB/s on average with occasional peak of 50MB/s. I ran tests on all 3 of the drives with similar results.Could not copy an 8GB file onto a 16Gig drive. The file is a RANDOM text file and is not compressible.I suspect that the 16Gig is specified only if the data is compressible. Was able to copy about 14Gig of TIF/JPG files.  Can't explain the discrepancy.The body of the drive is PLASTIC and tends to overheat.I have a whole bunch of older SanDisk drives as well as other like Corsair all of them are much faster Writes.Disappointed. Good enough for ISO installs and write once-read many type of uses. Would NOT recommend this specific model.
2,I previously bought a PNY that was 100% garbage.  I used it one time and then an hour later it quit working on me.  So then I tried this SanDisk.  It never broke on me so I thought that it was a good USB drive.  But I was wrong.  I installed a portable browser on the SanDisk and websites were always lagging and taking forever to load.  Also the entire USB drive would crash every once in a while forcing me to unplug and replug the USB drive in.  Some other reviewers said that it was because it overheats.  This week I finally decided that I had enough of it and I bought a 128 GB Samsung.  It's been great.  No laggy websites.  I feel like my portable browser is running from my desktop.  If you buy the Samsung Fit the 32 GB and 64 GB only has 300 MB/s.  But both the 128 GB and 256 GB has up to 400 MB/s (the Amazon description is wrong it's 400 MB/s for both).  400 MB/s is far faster than this SanDisk's 130 MB/s.  If you only plan to copy the occasional file to the SanDisk then go ahead and get it.  But if you need performance for heavier tasks don't get the SanDisk or the PNY.  Get the Samsung.  Even though I suffered for almost two years with this bad SanDisk USB drive I won't give it one star.  I will give it two stars because at least it functions.
4,This little thumb nail holds/ stores a lot for what I needed it to do.
4,I have no functionality issues with this usb stick. It is actually quite nice and speedy. My only complaint would be the materials used - plastic. My previous Sandisk Ultra fits were metal and didn't feel so cheap.
4,Just handling this makes it clear you don't want to stress the plastic part of the insertion section. I have it in my Haxchi Wii U and is stuffed with games. It would frequently disconnect in rest mode in the PS4.UPDATE 12/14/2021: Drive is still in the Wii U and I have not had to remove it more than 6 or 7 times while loading more games to it. IT has not given me any trouble and still seems fast even tho it has less than 5% left of free space. But the Wii U only has a USB2 but it helps being a USB3 so I am able to load games to it nice and quick.
5,Working on a DIY smart TV project using a Raspberry Pi4. The SanDisk holds 1000's pictures that can be displayed on the screen based on commands. This was the perfect way to add the space I needed for the project. The best part is I can easily remove it and manage pictures from my desktop the re-insert the flash drive to see the new pictures.
5,decent usb drive with good speed that does its job for daily needs.  only problem is too small which may get lost easily which is a little difficult to detach at times it's better to hook it with something like a key string.  the ring also seems a bit fragile that may break when too much force is exerted.
4,The fit of this drive is very tight in my USB slot. Apart from that it's a great portable drive with great capacity and reliable storage especially for the price. Don't lose it!
3,CUando es conectado a un puerto usb3 sufre demasiado recalentamiento. Esto ha conducido a daños en algunos sectores. No trae un sistema eficiente de didipación de calor
5,Nothing to dislike very handy device.
4,I have used other tiny thumb drives from SanDisk and like them a lot. I was less than happy when this one got here because there wasn't a plastic dust cover included. These things live in my shirt pocket when they are not being used. Lint from your pocket can work itself into the drive opening and then be driven into the drive further when you plug it into your computer. Or the lint is driven into your computer. A dust cover should have been included.
5,Sandisk is DEF the best brand of portable storage devices and this is no exception. Most other tiny thumb drives will not stay put on your keyring for long if your keys are moved and used much….. This is the first one that has made it longer than 2 weeks (2 months now) without breaking off at its connection point. 256 gigs in such a tiny package and an amazing price….Technology is amazing!
5,I used this Flash drive to add memory to my Ouya.  For those who don't know Ouya was a video game console in the previous "Console War" alongside the Wii U as the 4th and losing member of the console war.  The Ouya was best for downloading old-school Emulators available from the Ouya store.  As of June 2019 the Ouya servers are no more. It is impossible to download games buy games download programs buy programs  Look at expanded images of your icons or look at written descriptions of your icons.  There's nothingness darkness nobody on the other side.  I think you get the point.  For now for right now WYSIWYG.This flash drive was for one last hurrah at the Ouya - upgrading my 128GB memory stick that sticks out the side like a sore thumb to something sleek and several times smaller than the usual flash drive.  It's beautiful.  It still works months later.  It can approximately hold the entire contents of every PlayStation 1 game or every console before the PlayStation 1 twice over.  Now emulators are legal but copyrighted video games are not.  This is a moral gray area and I won't write for you to do something illegal it's just an idea.Copying files for me was about 20 megabytes per second your mileage will vary.
5,Very small and functional.  Good product.  Just as advertised.
5,Almost to small
4,Item passed h2testw test which writes 1 GB files to fill the drive and reads them back.  No errors.  Data capacity is 232 GB.  Comes formatted in FAT32 but I reformatted to NTFS without issues.  Write speed during the test was in the range 41.8 - 60 MBps with faster speed at the start of test.  Read speed was around 109 MBps at the end of test.  This item writes faster but reads slower than the lower-capacity PNY 128 GB device.  It's a reasonable value for the money and is competitive with other vendors.  The keychain hole is thin and narrow so it would require a thin ribbon or thin wire to attach to most key rings.  It is very compact and designed for "plug and stay."  The keychain hole is set on a curved tab at the end of the item at right angles to the USB part.
5,Flawless.  You can actually store 256GB of data in it without fail.  Unlike the fraudulent 2 TB USB drives being sold here in Amazon.I bought a new and a refurbished one.  The new one works just fine as expected.The used one cannot complete a full format and I am planning to return it.That refurbished one does complete a quick format which does not check all memory cells but just creates a master and partition record and a FAT or NTFS table depending on your choice.
3,The tip keep breaking everything elase work good
5,There is no surprise and I am good with it per product description.
5,I own a lot of flash drives and most of them are SanDisk brand.  My experience has been good and I never hesitate to buy this brand.
5,It's working fine!
5,Love love it! Small size quick transfer! This is perfect to use for my laptop I don't have to remove it every time I put my laptop away.
5,Looks like its all there.
5,Bought this for my wife's car. She likes to listen to her recorded music. The 1st USB flash drive we tried was too long and I was afraid it could be broken since it protruded too far from the dash. This one is small enough so it can barely be seen.
3,Slow transfer average <15M/s.The plastic frame is too hot during loading.No cover not too good.
3,At first the usb stick worked great but after using to store photos and some files the plastic housing cracked and became unusable. (lost all photos and files.) Not pleased at all. Maybe the heat??
5,Because of scoliosis that makes sitting straight up in a chair painful I do all of my small press work kicked back in a recliner with a wooden lap desk straddling the arms of the chair. I've got redundant cloud-based backups set up for my most important data but I wanted to have a Time Machine backup as well. My Seagate 2TB portable was taking up valuable lap desk real estate (I have to have a graphics tablet handy for design work) so when it crapped out on me I started looking for something else that might work better.This little Ultra Fit is working just fine. I had to reformat it for my MacBook Pro but after I did that setting up Time Machine was easy. I excluded superfluous non-work items (movies photos backing up to Google Drive and my archival book files backing up to pCloud and the SDHC drive) so I can actually get a decent number of backups before Time Machine starts knocking off the older ones. And there's room for me to work on my graphics tablet.Another reviewer said it's flimsy so best for leaving in place which is exactly what I'm doing. I haven't had any problems with it so far and it was a small price to pay for the extra insurance and peace of mind.
5,So far this has exceeded my expectations. Both data transfer and retrieval is superfast. And it is so small. The unit gets quite hot while in operation but so far that has not caused any problems.
5,For my blink.
5,Use this in my car stereo because it fits so flush and doesn’t jut out from the dash which could get snapped off. I’ve bought several of these SanDisk drives before and never had any problems.
5,Bought this to use with an in dash media player with a front USB port.  The size and color of this drive blend right in to the front of the unit.  If you aren't looking for it you don't even know it is there.
4,Funciona sin problemas.
5,I was slightly concerned that they don't appear physically labeled with the capacity (especially since I ordered a multipack - was imagining having multiple of different capacities) but it actually *does* appear in the tiny/faint/mandatory labeling in the model# on the back ("...-032G").So... neat. Also it formatted fine and flipped the advertised number of bits and all that.
4,Once Flash Drive is inserted  It is hard to remove drive if you have fat fingers like mine
5,Got this to use for a usb music drive in my car.  The size makes it perfect so as to not be noticeable.  Holds plenty of music and runs flawlessly.
4,Compact little unit that works as described but (1) it gets HOT (2) the end that sticks out has a curl to it that may interfere with your use. The radio I plugged this into has a little door that covers the USB port when not in use. The grippable curl on the end of this wedges up against that door so it’s forced into place rather than how it might have more space in a wide open laptop port.
4,Not that fast for the price. Went with something else instead.
5,Like the 8 track and cassette gone are the CD players in a lot of newer vehicles.  The modern day storage medium for audio is the flash drive.  After my new car purchase I was looking for a low profile flash drive that I could keep installed but it wouldn't be in the way.  I brought this one and it works perfectly.  Plenty of storage space and it fits neatly out of the way in the vehicle's USB port.  Just load the songs on my home PC and enjoy them on the road.
5,Perfect for storing my videos and pictures to make room on my phone. Good price. Good quality.
3,While these do work as a storage device and report the general capacity advertised they do not have a device ID.  As such these will not work with anything that requires that ID.  unRAID for example.
5,Love the very small size of this drive.  It worked immediately and fully as expected.
5,Use to store all my favorite music to use in my My Honda CR-V
5,I needed to expand my laptop memory and this works great. Fast 3.1 access and works just as fast as my hard drive. (Maybe faster)
5,It is the tiny size of the USB memory stick that is my only gripe which is really being minor. I actually put a small lanyard on it so it is hard to lose. Otherwise more than happy with the device!
5,Ya tengo tres de estos y todos los tengo llenos de musica me encantan para tenerlos en el auto
5,They are so small that you can put music files on them and plug them in the car without worrying if they will get damaged by someone accidentally brushing over them.  I love them!
5,Worked as expected
4,Not the smallest but pretty low profile. Works as advertised. Overall I’m satisfied with this purchase.
5,I like it  using for my car radio music player works fine
5,Works great great value for the money.  Almost invisible when plugged in.
3,One of two purchased failed to uplift from SecureAccess to PrivateAccess on initial use on Windows 11Pro. during the copying of the update to the drive.  Accessing the User's directory even if you have Administrative privileges doesn't work for their uplift process.To get the uplift to work:1. Delete the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\PrivateAccess directory2. Delete all files from the SanDisk drive3. Download the 'new' PrivateAccess application from SanDisk and copy to the Drive.4. Execute the PrivateAccess on the drive to get it installed. What do you expect from a Hardware Vendor...
5,Very small!  Fast transmission speed and large capacity!  The price is not expensive!
5,I use it as a permanent second hard drive because I don't have any other spaces on my laptop.
5,I used this as a boot drive to try out chrome flex.  It worked well. No heat issues.  It was a tight fit in all the USB ports.
4,Price is ok for this stick. Fast and tiny. Its nice product
5,Bought to add some storage to my Wifi router and this is perfect since it only sticks out 1/4 of an inch vs several inches for regular USB "sticks" (router is in tight quarters). Besides that it's fully USB3 and kicks the butt of other non-USB3 thumb drives in performance.
5,Que es pequeñito  y muy comodo  facil de usar
4,Plastic Lip cracked making it difficult to use.
5,I was running out of hard drive space on my xbox and this is a good extension. if you are looking for a usb storage drive this is a good option. (WARNING any usb flash drive that claims to have 1 or 2 terabytes is lying 512gb is the maximum.) when you plug in a 2 terabyte flash drive it will says it has 2 terabytes but it can't actually store that amount.
5,The laptop only has 128GB ssd.  I plugged it 8n and it stays there.  Quick and easy.  Could be faster but for the price and use it works fine.
5,Solid streamlined fit and quick performance for under $50. What's not to like?
5,Cumplía con la descripción
5,I've had it for a month so far with no problems.All the reviews about it melting or breaking or whatever had me worried but nothing bad has happened yet. Previously I had a 64 GB mini USB for a long time but I outgrew it when I got a bunch of movies/tv shows on my computer. Right now I got 8 seasons and about 5000 pictures on this little guy and it's only half full (it's literally holding more stuff than my actual laptop). That's cool. I'd say the only downside is it juts out more than the 64 GB one I had.
5,Exactly what I needed. I'm using it for camera recording on Tesla model 3. It's tiny so it doesn't hinder anything in the storage area. Plus it's a name I can trust.
5,I bought this to store MP3 files for my car.  128GB is way more than what I need but I can use it to store other things in emergency.
4,Like most Sandisk products this one works excellent. My only beef with it if there is one is that the way the ergonomics of the very short handle makes it difficult to pull the USB out straight. Most people may not care but I always feel like I'm about to jack up the USB port on my computer. With this being said particularly if your intent is to set it and forget it the low profile thing works great and easily stays out of the way of most bumps where a standard USB would just break off.
3,I took 2 stars off 1 being that the shipping was supposed to be delivered next day & unfortunately that wasn’t the case. 2nd every time I transfer data and keeps saying not connected to server I don’t know what that’s about Will see
5,I cannot believe how small this is!  I have an adapter that allows me to attach usb drives to my iPad.  Even with the large capacity of this Sandisk Ultra Fit when it is attached to the adapter it is still smaller than most of my other flash drives.512 GB actually has usable space of 460 - 480 GB.  This is a standard issue with every portable drive I have used.  ALL of them do this.  Therefore I cannot knock off any points for this one.  Even if I am not happy about the loss of 50 GB of storage space.I have had no problems with accessing anything I have put on the drive.  And the physical size makes it SUPER PORTABLE.***For those who think the reviews on this site may be rigged....Please note:  I Do Not receive any discounts for my reviews.  Everything I review has been purchased at the listed price.***
5,Good
5,Flash storage is based. What else are you going to put your Call of Duty Black Ops Zombies maps on?
5,I really am impressed how easy it was to just plug and play with the storage devices.  they are small but hold a huge amount... that being said the ONLY issue is they are so small they are hard to get out of my PC when done.. lol  but I manage.  I keep it in my glasses case as it is very portable!
4,Excellent for general use and take up very little space. Unfortunately the drive does overheat quickly and malfunction during constant reads.
4,Not sure if this is a defect but it gets really really hot when plugged in.
5,Completely portable and has plenty of storage
5,I use this as a media drive in my car for movies that the kids can watch. Since this is plugged in my glove box I don't want a USB drive sticking out the side that could get broken. This fits relatively flush to the surface so there's no danger of something bumping into it and breaking the USB port or the drive itself.
5,I have several of these and they are great. I never have had any problem with them.I also give these to my clients for the photo shoots I do for them.
5,The cost is a bit high but its a great product I have been using this brand for some time and it has never disappoint me.
5,This is a Great product it gave me more room in my computer for storage
5,Small yet huge storage - I run a quick xcopy batch file to backup my changed data every day and this did an excellent job
5,I had purchased this to download music LP's into MP3's for my brother in law. The reason I chose this particular one was because of its size. I noticed in his new vehicle that his USB port in his vehicle was located where if you had placed a regular size thumbdrive it could very well easily break just by getting into the vehicle to fast and not realize what happened until it was too late. I have two friends who both have done this exact same thing and one of them had to scrap his entire stereo because the thumbdrive that was still inside had caused a short.So by having only one half of an inch sticking out it will be very unlikely for this to occur for my brother-in-law.Not to mention the fact that I purchased enough for all of his vehicle's as well as his Karaoke machine in his garage. For someone who has a voice like a chainsaw he sure enjoys Karaoke. However this is my personal problem 🤣.
5,This USB memory stick has it all. Extremely low form factor great performance and large storage capacity.
5,It gets extremely hot almost immediately so im a little worried about its longevity but i have all my files backed up incase of failure.If you want to store large files like dvds or blurays on this you will need to format it --  go to your disk utility or disk management on your pc and you will see it under volumes -- right click and choose format -- then choose exfat or ntfs -- you can leave the allocation size to default or change it  -- the larger the size the faster it will be -- great if you only have big dvd files -- if you only store small files -- use a small size -- this way they will take up less space.You can also choose whether you need to perform an "eject drive" when you want to remove it from your computer or just pull it out without having to eject it -- the best way to do this on a pc is go into your device manager while plugged in - find it under usb or disk drives the right click and click properties  then choose the policies tab-- here you should see an option to choose between quick removal or optimized performance.
5,I like it.  I use it as a backup to selected items on my hard drive.  It is physically small enough that I can just leave it plugged in and its capacity is large enough that I can store a lot of photos and documents by just dragging them on board.  If some day my computer crashes I will still have my important docs. Peace of mind.
5,I love the ease of this flash drive it is small and very portable. Fits well in my stereo or laptop or phone
5,Good price and very portable memory card.
5,Five 64G flash drives at the offered price seemed like a good deal--and they are.  They are as light as feathers are 3rd generation and fast and it's very easy to carry one in your pocket.  They all look alike so I put different colors of acrylic paint on them to distinguish them from one another.  Great product!
4,Great!
4,Update:Reading from the drive is fast (100+mps).  Writing on the drive however is slow (about 20 mps).  I was hoping for 50+mps).I was very happy with the form factor (tiny) and storage capacity (256GB is really nice).  However the experience with using this item is less than satisfactory.  A sustained throughput of 10mps with a USB 3 connection is horrible.  I know it is not a problem with the port on the computer because when it is connected to a portable harddrive (2TB and over) and copy similarly large amount (10GB+) the computer can sustain 80mps.  20 mps feels like it is a glorified USB 2.0 with a tiny buffer that can handle 100mps for 5 seconds.  Does it has the capacity yes!  Is it really as fast as advertised not really!  They should advertise READ speed 100+mps WRITE speed 20 mps.
5,Fast shipping. No cap but I didn't need one. Very small but easy to handle.
5,Great product and I am able to store all of my data. Super fast transfer rate
2,It worked great although it was slow putting my files on it.  It kept working right up until it started losing files.  I'd go looking for a certain file and it wouldn't be there anymore.  Reinstall the file and another would go missing.  Eventually it got where it lost 25% of the files I had stored on it.  Guess it was because I was using 90% of it's capacity or something.  Would have been nice if it had worked correctly though.  I'm just going to use it now for minor things and not much of it's capacity and buy a portable SSD hard drive to keep instead.  If you use it for the capacity it has you'll lose your files. We shall see if it will still work for a partial storage device and less than 1/2 of what it is listed for and see if that works.
5,Very happy with the purchase. Arrived just after a week of purchase. Cannot complain about the product and service. Worked as advertised.
5,Very compact works well for automotive music. I broke my last one because it stuck out too far.This one fits nice and close.
5,BienN
5,Perfect for adding a lot of info onto and quality product. One thing to keep in mind is due to its size it is easy to lose or slip out of your hand or pocket. should come with some sort of carrying clip for easier portability and peace of mind
5,I bought this for my PC laptop that shipped with 256gb NVMe drive so I could double the storage space. It does exactly what I need it for but my favorite part is that it’s small enough to ALWAYS keep it in the machine. I can still use my standard laptop bag without issue so my storage travels with me everywhere and is ready to go once my machine boots. Great fix for data storage limitations.
5,Se cumplió con todo lo prometido (tiempos de entrega embalaje y características del producto).
5,Very good item
5,Using this to add storage for my photos data/doc and personal info. When I don't need the store info I can remove for my protection. Easy to take and share photos with other. Love there secure locking program to secure personal files that is password protected also (just in case you lose it or someone steel it). Will be ordering more.
5,The plastic housing for this USB has given me no problems with taking it out of computers and plugging them in elsewhere. The quality of the construction and material are both very good.I've ordered a few of these and all have been durable and consistent with its performance which is also great. Constant reading/writing will generate some heat but the plastic has not shown any signs of melting or softening for me.
2,TL;DR The read and write speeds are good and as advertised it's about 10GB short of the advertised capacity (typical) but the "write protection" bug seems to have hit and I think I found a way to fix it. Maybe. With data loss. But don't take my word for it. Try it with yours and see if it works.***I bought this as a throw away drive (and a keeper should it work out I wasn't sure) to use in my attempts to install Android-x86 on my Win10 tablet (and no it didn't work) because I didn't want to end up inadvertently frying one of my more expensive Samsung thumb drives.After 8 hrs of flashing and reflashing multiple ISOs several times a piece in a futile attempt to get Android-x86 working on my X1 Tablet (no fault of the thumb drive) this drive just suddenly vanished from Windows. Explorer couldn't see it but Disk Management and Paragon could see it. Disk Management couldn't access partition or format the drive and no mater how many times I re-partitioned and formatted this drive in Paragon removed rebooted and reinserted Windows wasn't having anything to do with it.Then I got an idea. I loaded up Rufus and an ISO fiddled with the partition slider and let Rufus have at it (it took a few hours). When done Windows saw it liked it and would reformat it. A full test in h2testw came back clean (that was another 4+ hrs). She seems to be working again. I flashed Win10 on it and used it for an upgrade on an old Win7 laptop earlier tonight and it worked like a charm.All these disappearing drive shenanigans seem to fall in line with what others are saying about the drive "write protecting at a hardware level" after extensive/too much use. Which seems like a dirty trick on the part of SanDisk.While I don't like the plastic construction and despite the shenanigans at the moment the drive works. Will I be buying more of these inexpensive drives in the future or recommend them to others? No. It's not worth the hastle especially if the misbehavior happens after your return period is up and the Rufus trick doesn't work. And while the Rufus trick might get the drive back in a usable state (for me) any data is going to be lost in the process making it absolutely unreliable for data retention or transfer because it may just randomly decide to lock itself down and vanish from Windows again.Save yourself the hastle spend a little more and get a Samsung thumb drive. I've not had any of these problems with my Samsung drives so they're a safe bet in my opinion.
4,Works fine however it gets significantly hotter than all my other USB drives. I have 2 different ones in my Chromebook and even with no use and no matter what port I use this one gets noticably hotter. They are so similarly priced I would go with a different one next time.
5,I've had a 128GB version of this product for a couple of years and just grabbed a 256GB. I really love this product. It's super low profile so you never notice it's there but the lip on top makes it easy to grab and remove when needed. There's also a hole for a small lanyard/keychain if you need to keep it on you. It's a typically USB so it's plug and play no setup required. Read/Write speeds are good. Nothing special but not noticeably slower than average. The bloatware is fairly minimal so you've got most of the space you're paying for. I really do love this product and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a USB. I plan on having at least one of these products for as long as I own a laptop/computer with USB access.
5,I was looking for a flash drive to save my documents and pictures that was not that big to carry around.  This tiny drive is the size of a dime.  This was perfect.  Just the size I was looking for and the capacity to store information.  I was able to download about over 500 pictures in less than 3 minutes. I strongly recommend if you are looking for a drive that is not that big.EDIT:  after having it for a while now the plastic part where it goes into the computer is becoming to be warped.  I don't think the plastic is sturdy enough to tolerate heat especially if it's in the computer all day.  I"ll see how much long it will last.
5,This flash drive made me nervous at first. It didn't fit well into the USB ports on my PC or my laptop. It took some real effort to jam it in. I don't think this has anything to do with it being 3.1 but it's a tight fit and has signs of wear on all sides and it's only been in one computer and then to another four times at the most. It is very fast. I copied 10+ Gigs of pictures and files in mere minutes. It's become an additional storage source on my laptop that only has a 256GB SSD and it has been very fast when transferring or pulling out files. I was not expecting this to be of poor quality for the price but it's been so long since I had a flash drive I didn't even thing about how much things have advanced. The drive itself is very small which was my biggest purchasing reasoning. But I could see this getting lost if not stored in a computer/laptop USB port at all times. It doesn't come with any case or lanyard so if you plan on carrying from place to place I suggest getting something to more easily locate/protect it.Great product as always from SanDisk. Definitely buying more.
5,Works as stated
5,Does what i need it to do
5,Tiniest usb ever seen but has giant capacity.
3,This may be OK for use as a backup flash-drive or for occasional data transfer needs - I intended to use it continuously plugged as overflow space for my computer - it is too slow and becomes too hot for medium-large file sizes.
2,I like the drive due to the size and capacity.  But it keeps stopping working after a month.  I use it in a car for dashcam recording.  When it stopped working I have to either reformate it or pull it out and put back several times.  Now it is not working even I did that.  One time I had to restart my car computer to make that work.  I believe it may not be able to handle the speed for hd video.  Do not buy it if you want to use it for video recording. Update: I was trying to use this to just backup my photos and it gets so hot it can burn my finger.  Again do not buy this thing.  Seriously no more Sandisk product because the sd card they make does not have the speed they specified.
5,Work as described.  Very happy with the flash drive.
4,If you are using it it can get warm fast but does what I want and can easily remain plugged into my laptop without much overhang
5,Format these as FAT32 and add MP3s. Then they will play from your car's USB port. I use a mini USB hub to have 2 available.
5,Tiny Flash Drive and easy to set up secure access vault.
3,512GB storage? No thats bs its 460.
4,Works great but runs hot. Very hot.
5,This drive was purchased to store my 201G FLAC music files on for use in my new car. It's size is so small and compact it fits perfectly into the USB hub port in my center console. Haven't had any issues with it playing my music files yet but with over 200G it will take some time to find any possible faults. So far every song it has played has had no issues. As an example I had San disk 200G micro sd cards for my DAPs and once in a while I would get a song that wouldn't play correctly or just be missing a complete part of it and I would have to pull the card and retransfer the file. Haven't had that happen yet on this usb drive.
4,You won’t get 3.0 speeds if you’re transferring more than a few megabytes. This thing heats up and throttles the data rate. It will be burning hot when you transfer gigabytes of data. Of course that’s a trade off for not having a heat sink and keeping it compact and cheap.
5,Purchased this flash drive to use as portable storage for my music collection. Works great for that - and I have pretty much all my music at my fingertips when I need it. I like the low profile where the drive doesn't stick too far out from the side of my laptop - which makes it easy to slide the computer into and out of the sleeve I keep it in when not in use. Plus when I record new material - I don't have to take up room on my laptop hard drive.I've got the flash drive plugged into a 3.0 USB port - so the response time is more than adequate for playing music directly off the flash drive.I'm more than happy with my purchase.
5,Nothing more to say but perfect if your looking for a small drive
5,Small compact 3.1 fast. Quality flash drive.
5,Speedy and reliable USB flash drive
5,Easy to use very small size impressive storage capacity.  Almost too small about the size of a quarter.
5,I wanted a drive that was distinctly different from my other drives and this certainly is. Only slightly bigger than a micro SD card this drive would be easy to lose but at least it won't be easily damaged sticking out of a laptop port. It seems fast and has held up so far.
5,Totally happy with this purchase. Great delivery and outstanding ease of use. Completely satisfied with my choice.
5,Just a perfect size for my needs to my Tesla Dashcam
5,I use it for my keyboard instrument.  Very little chance of accidentally banging into it and breaking it.
4,I love the size of the product and the fact that it's USB 3.1 with 130MB/S read-speed is great! Very fast! Unfortunately like many USB drives the actual capacity is far below the advertised capacity. Generally maybe 10GBs less than advertised is acceptable. With this device there is a 52GB difference between advertised and actual capacity. That's A LOT. Be prepared to only have 460GBs MAX on this device.
5,You've been warned do not use this type of memory for repeated delete/write/rewrite! flash memory comes in SLC MLC TLC and I think this may be QLC though I'm no expert. What that means is Single Layer Cell Multi Tripple Quad. Basically each bit is a cell in SLC so its fast and lasts a long time but in TLC its 3 bits per cell so its slower and does not last as long. Specifically the life cycle of each cell deteriorates with each write read does not damage the cell.Technical speak aside I am very happy with my purchase. I need it for read speed and capacity not write speed or life. I also need it to be physically small and stay plugged in. I'll write once which I'm doing right now and then it stays plugged into my Xbox 360 and won't get written to after being loaded down. That's right I'm using it on a usb2 device so as long as it can maintain read at the max usb2 speed i'll be happy.Update: ordering 2 more for my xbox 360. they're just so tiny perfect for storage of game data (not game saves ever).
4,It's certainly compact I'll give it that.  I have actually seen smaller but I will say that this one is sometimes hard to remove from the USB port.  But it is pretty awesome and has a decent storage for the size.
3,When I copied files from a fast SSD hard drive to this USB thumb drive on a USB 3.0 port the transfer rate was only about 20 MB/S which is much lower than the claimed specifications.The part of this thumb drive that plugs into the USB port is plastic which doesn't seem very durable.
3,Overall it solves the problem I bought it for: my MacBook Pro 256GB SSD running out of space. It doubles my storage space of my MacBook Pro at a low cost with a near zero footprint. Neither the read nor the write speed was anything like what's been reported on other sites even for the USB 3.0 product (details below). The overheating problem of the previous model has apparently been solved as it barely became warm at all in my copy operations..System specs:MacBook Pro 13" Retina Early 2013 2.7 GHz Core I5 8GB RAMTwo USB 3.0 ports Host Controller Driver AppleUSBXHCIWPTMacOS 10.13.3 (High Sierra)I reformatted the Ultra FIt to a single partition of HFS+ with Apple Partition Map using Disk Utility. (Be sure to have Disk Utility show devices as well as volumes since you need to select the whole device to do this.) After backing up the SSD to an external drive I copied the space hogging items to the Ultra Fit. No other applications were open/running during the copies. The sizes and times for these copies were:Photos (including iPhoto Library): 26.1 GB write took 26:34 for an average of 16.8 MB/seciTunes library: 19.4 GB write 18:50 17.6 MB/secOther misc files/folders: 764 MB write 0:52 14.7 MB/sec / 5.84 GB write 3:59 25.0 MB/sec / 8.55 GB write 8:05 18.4 MB/secTo test read speed I copied the last 8.55 GB chunk back to the SSD which took 1:36 for 91.2 MB/sec.In all of these operations the copying slowed down as it progressed based on the estimated completion times and the reported amount copied at different points in the process.All of these are significantly below the theoretical USB 2.0 limit so they're obviously mediocre by USB 3.x standards. However for my purposes getting the photos videos music and other large files off the SSD was accomplished. The read speed is more than adequate for playback of music and videos slide shows of photos etc.
5,Gran capacidad y funcionalidad en pequeño tamaño
5,These are great for portable electronics and auto players - I put colored lanyards on all of mine for easy identification and make them harder to loose. You can attach lanyards to car keys or wallet for additional security - Sometimes I put the lanyard around my pants belt but actually set off the metal detector at LAX which I couldn't believe so if you're flying attached to keys is better. Perfect for music and video. As far as I know I've never had a corrupted file.
5,I like that this thumb drive is so small but that it has such a large storage capacity. It is easy to use and it does not stick out from the side of my laptop far enough to annoy me like a regular size one does.
3,heat is destroying the plastic housing around the input causing it to crumble.  stick with metal.
3,Great usb but gets hot to the touch even after a 2 min use
5,It works. I use it to record live audio to a stereo WAV audio file.
5,Small and slim so it’s looks fine with smaller laptops
5,This is exactly what I wanted. I really know little to nothing about flash drives but we needed one for our AtGames Gamer for the pinball games. I needed a drive to format and download the games. This worked great for it. It is very low profile once plugged in (half inch or so) so that it isn’t very noticeable and makes transferring of the hard drive with the flash drive still plugged in a nonissue which is what I wanted. I did not want to risk breaking off the flash drive when transporting the hard drive. Great value for the capacity and easy to use - worked well.
5,I have many Sandisk flash drives from 4 GB to 32 GB from USB2 to USB3. I like the small form factor about the size of a thumb nail. Due to technical advancement the storage capacity keeps on doubling. You can get twice the capacity at the same old price. Right now the sweet spot of price vs capacity is 32 GB. To me 32 GB is plenty. But if you wait long enough you can get a 64 GB flash drive at the same price.
5,The capacity and yet small size of this device fits my needs perfectly. I can and fo leave it plugged into my laptop and can still place my laptop in its snug secure padded travel case. This would be impossible with any other drive.
5,I love the lightweight low profile design of these. Especially in my car stereo so it doesn't get bumped into and fits without adding a lot of bulk to my dash. These aren't particularly fast as far as USB drives go but they seem to be quite reliable for me and are priced well.
5,I use a 200gb sandisk card with this adapter in my car.  Great product.
4,I don't delete and re-copy to it. All I got it for was storage of home movies which I leave plugged into the USB port on my TV. For that it has been great. Some people say it fails if constantly copied to and deleted from. I don't know about that.
2,They were right. These drives do fail over time. I used these to boot raspberry pi 4's. One ran PiHole another ran a static web page another an MQTT server another Home Assistant. Nothing crazy. They were solid for 7 months. Then over the period of two weeks one by one - KERNEL PANIC.I thought no problem I'll wipe them and restore from backup.. Well little did I know SanDisk thought they were being helpful by locking the disk so as to "protect" it. You can't change anything on the disk. The clean command in diskpart can't touch it. Not even a dd command in linux can touch the drive. The only way to unlock it is to ship it to SanDisk and pay $50 for them to unlock it.. But wait.. isn't there a name for that? Oh yeah.. ransomware.While their SD cards are awesome and I'll still buy them.. These mini USB drives 4 out of 6 have failed and there is no way to bring them back. Can't say I recommend them to anyone.
5,Tiene buen tamaño para que no moleste queda muy bien en los radios para vehículos. Buena capacidad!
5,Been using as a mirrored device on a boot-pool on TrueNAS Core. No issues so far.
4,Sits as flush as a drive can at this point in technology. Definitely a great and affordable alternative to carrying around an external drive or replacing the internal drive with a larger one. So with this staying in my laptop I now have around 500gb of storage.
5,It's just a tiny little dingle but the storage capacity is more than I need. I keep it in my computer and use it as an external hard drive. I wouldn't want to be taking it out and putting it in as it's so small I think it could be easily lost but it's perfect for what I wanted it for.
5,This is great. I can leave it in the laptop all the timeeven putting it in the travel case and not have to worry about hitting or breaking it. No forgetting to grab a memory stick out of my desk if I have to work offsite.
5,I bought this flash drive to be used almost exclusively for World of Warcraft and other big games because my laptop doesn’t have enough space and to have them a little more portable if I ever get a new laptop.I especially liked the fact that it’s impossible to accidentally bump or jostle this flash drive because it’s so stubby. That’s a huge selling point!
3,For small files this will be a good flash drive but if you plan on moving large files the drive will quickly slow down after transferring a hundred megabytes or so to cheap USB 2.0 flash drive speeds.
4,For the price you get a pretty good product that has been very reliable for me for the past year. If you frequently insert and remove your flash drive I would recommend getting a USB with a metal jack instead of this plastic one. I'm curious as to the durability of this design. It may however have better thermal transfer properties. Check out the Samsung version of this flash drive. For just a couple dollars more you can have an almost identical product with the tried and true metal USB jack. I would recommend this to  friend.
5,SanDisk is a brand I prefer after using many other brands with disappointing results.  I run a Linux operating system on this SanDisk 256GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive with plenty of room for storage. I am using a USB hub rather than plugging flash drive directly into computer USB port I do this to reduce heat.  This flash drive satisfies my needs but for others I would recommend a regular sized 256GB USB rather than the mini size. I don't handle mine much. Not sure how it would hold up with constant handling also because of it's size it would be very easy to lose.
5,This thing is tiny yet high capacity. It’s so small it’s easy to forget it’s connected to your laptop.I’ve had it for a few weeks and it’s been great. I copied around 200gb to it and then from there to Google drive.  No issues at all.
4,The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the drive tends to get a little warm when my Chromebook is on.  Not for but warm.  I always rely on Sandisk for my storage needs.  Haven't had a failure on a Jump drive SD or Micro SD yet.
5,As expected. Great value
5,They get very warm (hot) but work well as a secondary drive in laptops with little capacity.  I make it my data drive.
5,great product for the price. bigger (in Gb) than my previous drive but smaller (in Inch) than my previous one.
5,I use this to add a few of my favorite movies to my tv.  I love it as there is no large thumb drive  on the back of the tv or wires for the portable hard drive.
5,SanDisk desired to cheapen the quality of their product and it shows. The usually stainless steel sleeve is now made of razer thin plastic that starts to break just after a couple uses. I have purchased 3 of these. The durability is important upon inserting into the port to insure the pins don't cross which permanently destroys the memory. There is no reason to take pictures as there are many other reviews here with the same problem. Due to the poor quality I have switched to Samsung which has been working perfectly. SanDisk used to be a great product. Not anymore.
4,I bought the 256GB version. It shows up in windows as having only 229GB of free space. I had read complaints of this drive getting very hot but even filling the entire 229GB drive did not seem to make the drive uncomfortably warm in my experience. The temperature was elevated but I did not find it uncomfortable or problematic. The write speeds aren't fantastic. It started out in the 20MB/s range and slowly drop into the upper teens continuing to eventually slow to about 16MB/s after a total of 10 or 15 minutes where it remained until the end. Read speeds held rock solid at 122MB/s while verifying all 229GB of data.
3,This drive worked in my usb 2 ports but not usb 3.  I have another drive from a different manufacturer that works fine in my usb 3 port so it is not the port that is the problem.  Debating on whether to return or not.  It is usable but not at higher speeds which is disappointing.
5,This lives in my center console for a 2021 CX-30 Turbo.  I formatted it using guiformat.exe.  Most car stereos are very fussy about what format can be read.  I run 90% .FLAC files and the thumb drive never has any difficulties reading large files.  It has never lagged or hung.  Nice device that clings so close to the side of my console that I have not snagged anything on it.
4,I was expecting 512GBs but only got 494.21! That's 17.97GBs of storage that I got ripped off for. I was expecting a reputable vender like SanDisk to advertized the truth about there merchandise. But they to will say one thing and give you an other.
5,Perfect size
5,This works fine and I like that it's micro sized and doesn't stick out so far. I leave it in my laptop all the time to store it though Because it is so small it can easily be lost. It's the size of a nano wifi or wireless mouse dongle.Only issue is interference with my wireless keyboard /mouse dongle when they are plugged in side by side on any pc or laptop I hsve. But I researched and found out that's a very common problem with many USB 3.0 devices. If they're separated by a few inches ie:connect on other side of laptop keyboard (my lappies all have ports on both sides of keyboard or front and back ports of desktop) and the problem is solved.So highly recommend except consider how tiny this thing really is. Put a cord on it in the hole on it to make it bigger or opt for a larger thumb sized drive.
5,Tiny fast and reliable
5,I plug these SanDisk Ultra Fit usb drives to my laptop and forget about it. I use it to back up files I have on my hard drive. The encryption/security app that came with it is very easy to use.
5,Does everything I needed.
5,All good so far one month later all loaded good but with all the thumb drives they never last very long. So if I can I will get back with another report in a year or two.
5,For my blink. Simple install
5,It's very small so it can fit pretty much anywhere. It gets a bit hot when on use but I guess that's the trade of for being so thin.
4,These USB drives are now plastic.  These tiny little drives won't survive being in a pocket or backpack without being inside a small container that will protect them from being damaged.  The plastic shroud for the USB insert is very thin plastic and WILL crack even under modest pressure.You've been forewarned!However I already have a tiny little case I put my small USB drives in.  So these fit my needs quite nicely as I use them only occasionally (OS installs or media backups).  As long as they are used in a minimal capacity like that or you are very careful with them they work fine.
5,So far over 3500 songs for my bike!
3,If you want something small enough to lose in a moment… This is perfect for you. It does it’s job well but I lose it way too often. I need a full size thumb drive
4,I ordered this Sandisk 32GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 flash drive to store mp3's.  It worked fine on most things but the one thing I got it for...my gm vehicle.  My car would not recognize the drive at all.  I reformatted it as FAT32 and tried NTFS also with no luck.  I was able to use my Sandisk Cruzer usb flash drive without problem in the same car.  Not sure what the difference between the Ultra Fit and the Cruzer is.  If you are wanting to use this to store music on and want to use it in a gm car you may want to go with the Cruzer instead if the Ultra Fit.  The Ultra Fit worked fine in my Marantz receiver.
5,Is very good the quality is very good and the size of it is the most relevant. Is almost invisible when you use in a device like car radio or stereo it make that it won't disturb you while you are moving.It is almost invisible very good. If you are going to use to move too much attach to a keychain or rope.
5,Mine worked perfectly. Very small and useful.
5,I got this in place of a portable hard drive for a couple digital photography classes and it works well. What really made me pleased with this drive is that I accidentally left it in a pants pocket and ran it through the washer (a couple times since I didn’t realize it was gone for a couple days) and all the files were still in tact and usable! It’s size is nice if it’s staying in the same computer all the time but I would add a charm or keychain to it if you are on the move so it doesn’t get misplaced as easily.
5,Not a thing to dislike Its very good
5,If buying for a device requiring FAT32 format (which Model 3 does) do yourself a favor and do not get the 256 GB get a smaller drive it will already be FAT32 format. If for a Tesla all you need to do is add the TeslaCam folder and be all set for the Model 3.  Sandisk  default format for 256GB is not FAT32 and there's no easy way to reformat as they do not have a program they can provide you are stuck trying to find a third party sketchy program to do the reformat . According to Sandisk's website only Flash drives 128GB or less are defaulted to FAT32 format. I switched to the 64GB and it was already in FAT32 format. In reality 8GB would be sufficient for a Tesla as they only keep a rolling 60 minutes (aka less than 2GB) (NOTE: if you save videos using the Tesla's record function those 10 minute clips are written to new files named with a timestamp so in theory you could use more than 2GB but in reality no normal person will)
5,I bought it to replace a similar one with only 32GB. I like that it is small a i use it for my car radio that support MP3.
5,When I buy memory I like to stick to good quality brands and this doesn't disappoint. It is not even notable in my laptop and I don't think I've removed it since the first day I Plugged it in. It has become a valuable asset to the storage on my computer and acts as a 2nd hard drive. It has the same amount of storage that came with the PC when I bought it. I use it for image and video files. It is not as fast as my internal SSD drive but it does the job.
5,Perfect
3,I've had to revise my review for this device due to something before unnoticed.  This product has a very low grade plastic housing that is very flimsy and over time cracked/split.  It eventually got stuck in an external USB hub and would not come out of the slot.  The way the plastic housing tore some broke off and stuck inside the USB hub.  It took some time to work out the broken plastic but eventually was removed.  The plastic had to be cut away to prevent anymore splitting.  The flash drive seems to still work but no longer has the plastic housing protecting.  Usually I give high ratings to Sandisk products after many years of use and this is the first instance of this happening but is a result of cheap plastic surrounding the electronics of the flash drive.  Hopefully other Sandisk products do implement the same materials as this particular device but will be a little more cognizant to this on future purchases of SandiskThis was purchased for the USB 3.0 and higher capacity replacing an older USB 2.0 model.  This device is much faster than a USB 2.0 storage device.  This used for playing music from in a vehicle so the low profile size keeps it from getting damaged or possibly broken off in a USB as older longer flash storage devices could.  The size amount of space for the price were the attractive features of this drive.  I've had many positive experiences with SanDisk products and so far this adds to the collection.
4,Flash drive has very good transfer rates.  Only issue is the flash drive felt a little fragile.
5,I bought these to essentially reside permanently in my synthesizers for storing samples user performances and other things associated with the synth.  They are very low profile - barely stick out of the back and work perfectly and quickly for storing my entire show 100 times over....
5,Nothing fancy. Does the job it's supposed to. Speed is acceptable. Love how compact it is.
4,Works as intended plenty of storage for pc backup
5,Works great - very small which can be a bit tricky for bigger hands but no complaints
5,Nice
5,excellent
5,I have a USB port in my vehicle through which I can play music. Unfortunately none of the USB flash drives I have works without flaws. It might be that those vehicle USB ports have a limit how much storage they can handle or my older flash drives just don't do it. This one is small enough not to stick out too much and it works just fine. I have 1500 songs on it and it starts playing the moment I turn the ignition while my older flash drives kept stuttering or turning back and forth to radio. I am happy.
3,I purchased this flash drive (128gb) to expand the memory of my Raspberry Pi 3 git server since I place a lot of code on it. I mounted it to the raspberry pi so it will be a drive that runs continuously. The actual capacity I got was about 115gb according to the system.  Right now I am a little hesitant because it does seem warm to the touch which I noticed in other reviews for this item. I'll update the review if I have any problems with it down the road but seems like it'll do the job for now.*******Update 2/27/2020************So this flash drive is gone after a year and a half. It is now Read-Only. I had the Raspberry Pi set up so I would commit the code to a repository on this drive and then a backup of the repository would be stored on a hard drive. I was working on a project the other day and once I was done with my changes I committed my code to the repository stored on the drive. During the "push" process the repository became corrupted on the drive. I then SSH into the Pi and tried making a new directory on the drive. The directory would disappear. Linux then said that the drive was "read-only". I modified the permissions to have full access on the drive but it would default to "read-only" for the drive.I was able to get the files off of the drive using my windows machine but I am unable to create any new files or folders on the drive using either Linux or Windows. I didn't make that many read/writes (committing changes a couple times a week) but it served it's purpose even though these drives aren't made for continuous use.
2,This was a replacement for my first Sandisk 256GB USB thumb drive. 3 months later and it has failed. I'm going to have to try and work with another brand.
4,Relatively easy to use...seeming great storage capacity.  Originally purchased because new Honda CR-V has no CD player which was a shock to my wife.  With the USB flash drive we were able to load any music from CDs and that purchased through Apple.  We are not too techy and realize that many may use iPhones for music storage and play; we do not happen to be among those using phones for music.  I would have rated the drive a 5 except its small size make it difficult for old arthritic hands to use. One odd thing about the  drive is it makes two copies of every track (song)..only one of which is  usable...kind of annoying.
5,I bought this to use on my Elegoo Saturn since the one that came with it died. This one works great at 16GB since the default format for this size is FAT32
3,Pay the extra and get the metal version. Flimsy plastic is easy to crack inserting into usb ports
5,It does what I need it to do.
5,This is a very high-quality product that is super easy to use. Reliable and very tiny. I keep mine plugged into my computer and save files to it that I may want to take with me. I like the bigger USB sticks to take from computer to computer. This is so small that it's easy to lose if you use it to take from computer to computer. One thing that I really like about it is that it has a solid connection to my computer. I have a 128gb USB memory stick that's about 2 inches long. It's great for portable use however over time the USB connection is becoming loose. I don't have a reliable connection with it. However with dime-sized 128gb Ultra Fit the connection is very solid and reliable.
4,So far it is doing what it is supposed to be doing. I leave it plugged into my usb slot on my laptop as my backup drive for documents and such things after my previous hard drive died on me during a trip. Yes yes backup everything all the time. It is tiny and not very obtrusive. If I take it out I know I will lose it somewhere. It will disappear into the bag and never been seen again. At least not by me. Nothing special or fancy. What more do you need to know? Vastly larger than the old floppy drives and you could save or destroy the world with one of those so there is no telling with what you could do with this.
4,I bought this drive for use with a camera system.  It's fully compatible with the Blink system and I look forward to many years of service from it and the solid state system.
5,I love these little drives as a backup or for when moving files from one computer to another. Each is small enough that I can leave it plugged in and pretty much forget it is there.Read/Write speeds will tank as this drive heats up. Large files will end up at about 1/3 the original speed of transfer unless used on USB 2.0 (which stays about the same). This is probably due to thermals and running out of cache for large writes.I will update if I have any reliability issues with it given the other reviews I've read but so far it has been performing as expected.
4,Great product has the exact amount of storage as stated however it lost 1 star due to not being able to view pictures in succession. I have to click each individual photo to view rather than cycle and easily view.Also cool that it comes with built in password protection. Overall very pleased for the amount of $$$ spent.
5,Works perfectly on pioneer car head units.
5,For my use case this is working out fine. But I'm using this in my Tesla for the Teslacam dashcam and Sentry Mode recordings from the cameras. Being a USB port in a vehicle I imagine that this won't be exposed to the same kind thermal stresses as a laptop or small desktop machine.Add to that the fact that I hardly drive thanks to the pandemic and I can only say that it is durable enough to withstand whatever heat is output by the Tesla embedded computers. It is also an ideal size for the location of the USB ports in the car as well.
4,front portion easily breaks the plastic is too fragile.but it works fast.although I like this item
5,Great flash drive with high storage capacity and tiny footprint.  I can keep it connected at all times to my computer without worrying about damaging it.  The only issue is when I do want to remove it to connect to another USB device I worry about it getting lost.
4,Like the size and storage capacity But it tends to get stuck in port when trying to remove.
5,Good product reasonable price.  My only issue is that on my order page it says"Delivered August 1Your package was delivered. It was handed directly to a resident."I have Ring doorbell footage of the delivery guy throwing the package onto my porch.  He did not hand it to anyone or even ring the doorbell.  I would happily send the footage to Amazon but I can't seem to find an email address.
5,Very small with lots of storage. I back up my MacBook Pro with this device.  Really quick to store and retrieve data.
2,These are a nice small size but are housed in very lightweight thin plastic. I suspect that they won't hold up to frequent use and that the plastic "loop" portion will fall off and the leading edges of the thin plastic housing will begin chipping off inside my device's USB slot after a few insertions. Cheap enough to keep around for infrequent file transfers or give-aways but I will look for something else more durable (metal) for daily carry and frequent use. These get alarmingly hot and are so paper-thin I've stopped using them already. The form factor is great but you gain nothing here by buying this drive over a same-sized metal version. This is an example of an item that was cheapened below the point of acceptability. Much more durable metal drives out there for the price. Avoid this.
3,Unlike the larger one I bought earlier these get so hot that I fear they are not dependable.  I had one kept getting errors transferring a lot of files at one time.  I would not buy again
5,I purchased this USB device to allow me to save videos from my blink cameras.  This device is very small and works perfectly for my setup.  I may install these in other devices soon.
5,Hard to beat the size & price of this drive. I bought it to leave in a gaming desktop (AMD Ryzen 7 5800X) and use to install operating systems (primarily WIn10) flash BIOS and take screenshots from the BIOS. I'm writing this review on day one using this drive. I've had some flash drives stop allowing writes in the past. I'll update this review if I run into any issues. While I'd love a faster write speed this is better than I was expecting for the price and physical size of this drive. Included iPhone lightning cable in one photo for scale.
5,I love this little thing! I have another SanDisk USB of the same capacity but it sticks out and I bumped it too often. I got worried that I would eventually break it. So I bought this one too used as a backup in case I do break my other one. The only issue I have found is that it appears this little one has 5gigs less capacity despite being the same in capacity as my other one. It's odd. I copied over the same exact files from my old SanDisk onto this new one and this new one shows that it had 5 less. Not a deal breaker for me though. I just love that it is so portable and I don't feel that I'm going to break it.
5,This drive is so small you can hardly see it when installed on the car usb. Great storage and so discreet. Very happy with purchase!
5,Great package of 3 and a low profile.
5,Súper smaller guao!!!
5,Fast enough for most uses and enough capacity too. Almost too small. Good thing it has a lanyard hole. Most folks will want to attach something to this tiny device to help keep track of it.
2,El usb se recalienta en usos prolongados y deja de funcionar...... es muy pequeño y es rápido pero no te va a servir para almacenamientos que necesiten un uso continuo y prolongado
4,I specifically bought this so that I can transfer all of my music to one device. I previously had a 16 gig and plenty more music to transfer. It transferred the music  pretty fast. I am no expert on reading and writing but I thought it did what it is made to do. There was 57 GB free of the 64 that I bought. I expected a bit more (at least 60) but I guess that's ok.  This flash drive is sooooooo tiny. I lost it a few times so make sure you out it in a safe place. It would be nice to have a top or cap to go over it but that may be asking too much.
4,There are numerous most cost-effective solutions for internal storage but I keep this connected to my USB hub so I can easily move files between my system and an isolated VM which has no access to the host system otherwise. I just move the files I want from the host system on the drive then insert the USB into the VM via the hypervisor console. Easy to to and largely maintains the isolation between the systems. It has been continuously connected for a couple months now and has no issues with capacity speed or detection.
5,Having lost a ton of content on a few occasions I am now paranoid about backing up my data.  This is so handy.  It's already plugged into my computer and it takes only a few keystrokes to back up all the data on my computer.  Now it is a bit slow because it's only a flash drive instead of an external hard drive but that's not really a problem.  I can decide what to back up start the back-up process and then continue to use my computer while the back-up process is working.
5,I love music – I purchased this to be used as a plug-and-stay flash drive in my vehicle for car audio. I needed a very portable (i.e. very small footprint) flash drive with a decent amount of storage capacity. This perfectly fit for those requirements!Being so small you wouldn’t notice that you have a flash drive always plugged in. I had my personal music library stored here (mostly of lossless audio files).I am using this on a 2020 Mazda3 hatchback (i.e. the one with a 12-speaker premium Bose sound system). If your car is unable to detect the USB audio you may need to format the card as FAT32; by default this is of the exFAT format because of its capacity. exFAT did not work on my vehicle’s infotainment system. You may need to use a different software to do this change of formatting type.
5,it provided me with the additional processing space I needed
5,This is the best storage and has a whole 128GB.  I never have to remove from the computer because is is flast like a usb mouse.  I can update and back up every day.
5,It actually does reduce noise. I've tested this scientifically with a microphone.
5,Works perfectly for my Blink Sync 2 Module
5,I know 32GB doesn't seem like a whole lot these days but it is perfect for storing music to take along in my vehicles plug into my entertainment center or home network.
5,I expected a fairly small thumb drive but this thing is the size of my thumbnail (no pun intended) ... and that's the drive and USB interface. The memory chip itself is about the size of my pinky's fingernail.I am impressed. Let's see how it holds up storing video from my dashcam.The previous drive I used lasted about a year before it began to fail. It worked great in blistering summer heat (topping (112°F) but problems started when the temp dropped down to sub-teens (as low as 9°F) ... that drive was the "SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive 128GB Black/Silver (SDIX30C-128G-GN6NE)."
5,Best ever .
5,pretty good flash drive I really liked the encryption to it incase the usb got lost and nobody can have access to your important data
5,The fact that I'm able to carry this around on my keyring and have enough capacity to use for recovery tools makes this one of the best drives I've found in awhile.  I will definitely be buying more in the future.
5,This is good for my recently-bought Chromebook that has little internal storage. No need to format the drive and both my PC and the Chromebook recognized it instantly. I bought another one from eBay but it was unusable and I had to throw it away.
5,Does a good job!
5,I use this to hold music for my car.  I like the package size as it doesn't take up any space.  Quite pleased.
5,Working on Blink Sync Module
5,Smaller than I expected.  More the size of a Bluetooth receiver.  I'm OK with that!Using it as a shared storage device on my DD-WRT flashed home router.  Non-journaling EXT2 filesystem should help with the life of the unit.  Considering getting a few more to use elsewhere.Would definitely recommend.
5,Finally a USB flash drive from Amazon that WORKS!!
2,The product stopped working after a few months
1,I've bought 14 of these drives over the last eight months. As of today FIVE of the fourteen have failed. But when I say failed they haven't lost the data on them; they are simply locked and won't mount. A phone call to Sandisk and I'm told that this is a "safety feature" so my data won't be lost. How is it a "safety feature" when I can't access my data? The only solution Sandisk has offered is to replace the drive and I can send the "failed" drive to a third party and pay $50 to have the data recovered. That's NOT a solution!After paying close attention to when and how this happens it appears to be caused by moving large blocks of files from one of the Sandisk drives to another location. At some point during the copy an error message pops up that the USB drive can no longer be read and it will vanish from my desktop. No amount of moving it or trying to mount it using the computer's disk utilities or trying to read it in another USB port will help. It's locked and nothing will unlock it!Do NOT buy these if you're planning to move files around. I believe they heat up too much which then triggers this "safety feature" and causes you to be unable to access your data. I'm extremely unhappy with this "safety feature" and with Sandisk's response to the issue. Will NEVER buy anything Sandisk ever again!
3,Can't be used in a laptop that has 2.4ghz wifi without causing heavy interference. The drive has to be removed if you want to connect to a wifi router that is more than a couple feet from the laptop. The lack of metal in it's construction along with no attempt to add any other sort of shielding makes it unusable for my laptop compared to other USB drives.
4,This is a storage device made for storing a large amount of data 256Gi to be exact. Its compact design makes it best for use as expandable storage for laptops. The device is made of plastic and I have no issue with this as I always keep the device connected to my laptops but for those who need to connect the pen drive to different devices might have to be careful. I am using this storage to expand storage my 128GB MacBook Air. But I notice that since the drive is always connected it remains hot for most of the time even when I am not accessing any file or application on the drive. For those who might be connecting the drive for some time this might not be an issue. Overall I am satisfied with this product and for the price tag I would suggest this purchase. Also Sandisk devices come with their SanDiskSecureAccess Vault using which you can store your data in encrypted form.
4,It does the job well and pretty fast though it might overheat during high-usage. The usb part is plastic for some reason so it might not last too long if it overheats for awhile. Be weary with these small flashdrives they are known to get very hot if used heavily.It surprises me how fast the flashdrive market improves in prices and storage capacity this is a great example. A 1tb flashdrive was ~1000$ a few years back but now you can get 256GB for 60$ in a TINY package or a normal-size 1tb flashdrive for ~100$ (10 TIMES CHEAPER). It amazes me how all that data can fit in such a small device the largest thing is the USB part.
5,Todo muy bien pero tener cuidado como es muy pequeño es fácil de perder
4,So comes preloaded with some bloatware that is decent if you need to secure data on this thing...though if you need to secure data (maybe for your work) I am betting your IT department has their own software they want you to use.Even after formatting this it still reads as only 233GB.Sure sure it needs to use some of the memory for something else (file location data probably it literally didn't even bother me enough to look up what "excuse" storage device manufacturers use any more).But consider the size.  At that size the fact that it stores 233GB is just beautiful.
5,Pandora was driving me crazy - constantly adding playlists that I needed to bypass to get to the music I wanted to play on my long drives.  Studies show that listening to music you are familiar with is less likely to distract you while driving so I had created a few playlists especially for long drives.  Got tired of Pandora's lists and social agendas created my own music lists from my music files.  Added benefit - if there is a song I want to repeat very easy to do vs Pandora (must back it up before next song starts).
4,Had mine for over a year with moderate use. Running it as a rescue OS with Puppy Linux and Debian Like OS's on a multiple OS GRUB boot. This is the USB I plug I resurrect failed WIndows computers with. No problems. SanDisk has always been Linux friendly. I would give this unit a 5x5 if it was made of metal or another material that dissipated heat better than the plastic. I am sure that over time the plastic will get brittle and precipitate a break but for now (over a year) its running FAST RELIABLE and HOT.I am not sure that HOT is bad yet....
3,Bought this to use in my car it was basically connected 24-7 to the usb port inside the armrest pocket in sunny Puerto Rico (avg. temp 80s probably hotter in the car); lasted almost 3 years before finally dying. Originally purchased around May 2018 and worked fine for about the first year. About one year in it started taking longer to load when the car is turned on so I thought maybe it was the car/radio but turning radio off/on didn't work nor did turning the car off/on. Eventually this became an almost daily occurrence where I'd get in the car and it would be loading or reading for about 1-3 minutes before music started automatically (and the USB port would recognize nothing during those minutes). After almost 3 years in it finally died. I tried connecting to PC to add more music and it's not working.And yes it gets REALLY HOT even though it's plastic so be careful when removing.
5,I have owned the previous version 128GB similar device and this item works about the same. Does it get warm? Yes. Does it get uncomfortably warm? Not in my opinion. I keep mine in the USB port and use it as external storage. I don't play movies from it but I do use it for quite a large amount of data. I would estimate I write or read 10 files per day to this always-connected device.I have gotten read speeds above 100 MB per second and the worst I have gotten is about 50 MB per second sustained. This unit is faster than an older USB HD I have. Speed for me is important so I cannot recommend this enough in that regard. It is not as fast as an internal SSD drive but it is faster than an external USB mechanical drive.I am still using my 128GB Ultrafit as a backup. I see no reason not to expect this unit to last me as long - over a year without a problem on the previous unit and several months with this new one.
4,Works great but was disappointed that the part that plugs into the computer is now plastic.
5,Fast
2,Worked great
5,We run a monero crypto farm these are great for use as "hard drives" machines boot super fast sandisk drives have always worked great for me over the years.I use these because of the size you put them in and barely know they are there.They are small and can be hard to pull out so if your using them to swap data around be warned they are a little hard to pull out.
4,I  use this as a secondary drive to run virtual machines on a laptop. Virtual machines can quickly fill a drive and so offloading them to an external drive is helpful. The speed is sufficient that I do not notice any lag. I would not want to carry this one in my pocket because it is so small that you could easily lose it. However the size is ideal for leaving it plugged in all the time. I can put my laptop in a case without damaging the flash drive.
5,I have bought a few of these. They are greeat for backing up your music CDs and playing them in your vehicle with a USB plug.
5,When CDs first came out en masse I started a collection. I digitized them for my PC when able over 80 GB of data. It was a massive collection at the time I thought. With this SanDisk 128 GB flash drive I can now transfer my entire collection to my new SUV and directly plug it into the audio system. Technology is great.
5,We used this to backup Iphone 12 64Gb photos & videos only using Apple's usb 3 adapter with power lightning connection.
5,I bought this for storing my art business files and it works great.
5,I love it. Works for exactly what I got it for. Got it for school but didn't want a big usb drive always sticking out and this one is barely noticeable with a lot of space!
5,If you have to get a flashdrive - get a 3.0 or better with as much memory as you can get. These are so convenient for a laptop or when you want music to go that takes up minimal space. I would however recommend putting a key chain charm on it. It tends to hide and you have a hard time finding it because it is so small.
5,I've had this device for the last couple of months with no issues.  I was in search for an easy way to keep personal data through my work computer without having to carry an external drive or storing personal data in our office servers.  This Ultra Fit drive is perfect!  The plug and stay feature is exactly what I was looking for the small profile makes it convenient to stow away the laptop in a backpack without it latching on to everything or protruding to far out like a typical USB flash drive.  Since it is a USB drive I can easily eject it and quickly use on other devices.  128GB is plenty for personal data that I keep and need quick access to.  Bought it during deal of the day for $15 and have been very happy with the purchase. Definitely a win/win.
5,Works perfectly as expected from SanDisk.
3,Drive broke in the USB port.  Plastic piece stuck in the drive.  Unable to remove and the port is now not useable.  Will have to replace the entire port-not going to be fun!!
5,So I needed a nice USB tumbdrive to install linux mint  as a dual boot.  This driver worked perfect for that.  I like that it is small/compact.
5,This flash drive has fast read/write speeds is compact and easy to use. Very dependable in moving up to 4gb files at a time. Size is small enough to fit in a wallet. Heats up during extensive and idle use though so let it cool down per sessions. Overall great value purchase.
5,Good but PLEASE DEBUGthe LOCAL STORAGE DELETION CODE SO MULTIPLE CLIPS CAN BE SELECTED AND DELETED AT ONCE.  I BOUGHT YOUR PRODUCT AMAZON NOW MAKE IT A QUALITY ONE EVEN IF I DECIDE NOT TO PURCHASE YOUR CLOUD STORAGE.  DON'T BE THAT COMPANY THAT PLAYS DIRTY POOL WITH ITS CUSTOMERS.  IT WILL BACKFIRE ON YOU IN THE END.  TRUST ME!
4,Bought a SanDisk flash drive that was made in February 2016 this SanDisk flash drive was made in January 2018. This one is suppose to be the newer version of the older one I bought. I also have one from 2015 different brand.According to Crystal Disk: in MB/s2015 one Read 40.24 Write 38.142016 one Read 139.9 Write 71.932018 (this one) Read 113.4 Write 44.88Now I see why the price drops the performance drops too. Just don't understand why a 2 year old flash driver is significantly faster than the 2018 "newer" version.In the end it's working fine just a slower than it's older model.
2,I've used a lot of different USB storage devices over the years this is one of the few that worries me about the possibility of breaking.  I had ordered two of these and was pleased with the cost and fast arrival. Packaging was typical Amazon half-assed packaging; just thrown in an envelope with a 5-pack of larger USB sticks.  The first one I removed from the vendor packaging was crushed on the end that goes into the USB slot. The return was simple and easy Amazon has lots of experience with returns probably due to the lackadaisical way that they do packaging. The second one was fine but I very carefully inserted it into the USB slot I had seen how thin and fragile the plastic is that gets inserted.  It works just fine but I wouldn't want to use it anywhere that you might need to move it between machines frequently I doubt that the plastic would hold up.
3,This tiny thumb stick does not have as much storage space as it is advertised to have. Mine was advertised at 128 GiB. I only got 114.56 GiB however see attached screenshot/photo.I gave it 3 overall stars because the packaging was a severe pain to open; they really put too much packaging around it. The outside "paper" was entirely too thick and then they had plastic inside of that. Another reviewer damaged their product just trying to get it out of the packaging. Really SanDisk? So much packaging that it's easily possible to damage the product trying to get it out? That seems excessive to me. Luckily I did not damage mine retrieving it from the packaging but I did note how difficult it was to get it out however.Once I did get it out I plugged it into my computer and it works sorta. The size displayed in GParted is not what's advertised. I tried a couple of different file systems just to be sure something wasn't taking invisible space. That being said I can still use this just not for the purpose I originally intended. I'll be looking for a different brand for my next thumb stick.I really should have read the reviews first but i didn't because I trusted SanDisk to give me a quality product. I now know that their quality has gone down hill and I'll have to search for another manufacturer that makes a product that fits my needs.
4,Thats thing is easy to loose would love to get it with a small string as a key chain.
4,the only reason this item didn't get a 5 star. is because it says that it is a 512GB. but when you go to use it it is only 460GB. i know that they are always a little less than they say. But I think 52G differents is ridiculous.
2,The plastic housing breaks where the holes on a normal USB drive would be located. The piece that breaks off gets logged behind the retaining arms used to keep devices in place and could render the USB port unusable if you don’t have the necessary tools to safely depress the arms and extract the broken piece without damaging the port in the process
3,Its all plastic.
5,Works perfectly for what I bought it for
5,Ha llenado mis expectativas
4,Very small easy to use. I like how it doesn't protrude out the side of my device. I've damaged multiply out storage devices because they do. Yes it sticks out but not like the other kinds. However I don't know if it's just mine but it gets very hot if you leave it plugged into your device over an extended time. Other than that it does what it's supposed to do.
1,I'm changing my two star rating to a one star. It drive feel apart and I lost it. Thankfully the data on it didn't matter but yiu get what you pay for and it is well worth your money to but a better flash drive.I'll fully explain why I gave it two starts in just a second. I wanted to say that I bought this was a backup EDC drive that lives on my key chain. It's a cheap drive so I don't expect it to do anything amazing but I just wanted to have a  flash drive that I don't mind carrying that can be used in a pinch. For the most part it works for that but I took away three stars for three reasons.One star because the loop is so small it won't rest on a key ring. I can jam a then key ring through the loop but it's still tight to the point that it sticks out like a tangent line. This causes it to stab at my leg when walking so I'll need to find some other way to carry it around.Another star because the nomenclature both on the amazon page and the packing states that it will transfer a 1.2 GB movie file in 30 seconds (with some variance of course) so that works about to 2.4 GB per minute. I tested this but transferring a 1.95 GB movie file from an internal SSD and through a USB 3.0 port and it took just about two minutes. Some variance is fine and to be expected but the disparity is too large to not take a star off.The last star is similar to the second the write speeds are horribly low. My guess is that the internals heat up or something because when transferring several GB of data it flies for the first 30 seconds writing at about 55-65 MBps (which is perfectly acceptable for a such a cheap drive) but then it drops down to about 8-15 MBps which is not acceptable. This is using the same set up as before so there is no bottleneck but the flash drive itself. Even when writing large sequential files it still slows to a crawl.This drive would be fine for anyone wanting to transfer any small documents or someone who wants to keep some useful PC utilities on their person or things like that. Reading the drive is very fast easily over 100 MBps so really this drive is practical for anyone who wants to keep large files that need to be read or read and write small files things like that. If I could go back I would either spend a bit more or get a smaller but more quality drive but that being said I won't be sad if I lose this one which is a useful quality for an EDC object. Though if you do want this as an edc I'd highly recommend ordering this that the same time: https://www.amazon.com/Beadaholique-10-Piece-Phone-Strap-Silver/dp/B009LIOED6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1532651363&sr=8-3&keywords=flash+drive+loop
4,I like these tiny USB drives. Unfortunately they are not THE BEST. When my SanDisk 256GB USB arrived it was formatted under FAT32 which I prefer. I was able to load my music and play it in my Sony car stereo. When I formatted the drive FAT32 was not an option. I had to use a program to format a drive larger than 32GB (technical issue that is common with all drives over 32GB). Now back in FAT32 my car stereo no longer reads the USB. I can still use the drive as storage but it can no longer be used as a music drive. Another technical flaw it does not come with a cover like smaller capacity SanDisk USB drives. I can't just toss it my pocket. If you need the portable storage this drive is okay. If you get the smaller capacity drive with a plastic cap it would be a better investment.
5,No problems worked as advertised.  Will buy again when needed.
5,Perfect for expanding storage on laptops.
5,There is two things I like about this drive the most the small size allows you to not have to worry so much about the flash drive breaking from some calamity that hits brushing up against it and breaking it and possibly the USB port of whatever it was in. The Storage size is twice what I had before and is not currently big enough to move major backups of Programs or games from one computer to another when needed. The Sandisk brand is one I have never had trouble with so I can rest assured It wont mess up so easily unless you pull it out from the PC before it is ready (Reformatted a drive lately from Windows 10 going nuts?)
5,I use this to play music in my SUV it plugs into my console flash drive socket and protrudes very little so not to get snagged by other stuff in the tray that is just below the aux inputs on a Durango. Transfers MP3's quickly and is read accurately by my UConnect system
5,Works great fits anywhere
5,This flash-drive works great but it is made of cheap-feeling plastic. With that in mind I recommend plugging it in and never removing it. I've seen other people's reviews mention that they've had the flash-drive fall apart when they tried to remove it and they had to dig out all of the little pieces from their usb port. This product has a very low profile and adds almost no bulk to your usb port so you can insert it and forget it. Alternatively if you need to move it from computer to computer use a usb hub that way you don't risk damaging your computers usb port.
5,Not much to say really. Capacity is as advertised. Very small and portable so it's easy to just leave it plugged into my Chromebook. It does get hot though during file transfers. It starts off transferring quickly but as it heats up the transfer rate drops quite a bit. But if you transfer in small chunks at a time it is better. I use it to watch movies and anime that I have ripped to my PC on my Chromebook.
5,I have purchased from 4gb(discontinued) to 512gb. They are excellent for laptops. You do not have to worry about them snagging if you leave them in and ruining the device and the port. I use them from backup drives to catch all to ready boost you name it. I highly highly recommend them. From 2.0-3.1 SanDisk is a leader in memory items. You also can use their protection software for encryption if you need too. Love them.
5,It’s Sandisk so what else can I say. Perfectly fit in our TV almost unnoticeable. Now we can enjoy our movies if the internet goes out.
5,Always happy with SanDisk products.
5,Not a problem and met needs for small form with adequate capacity.  No functional problems with insertion.
4,This is a really good price for this drive. I paid $12 for it. Years ago I paid $30 for a 32gb of similar form factor. That one has served me well for years. This one appears to be functioning similarly well.But a few things. This one feels cheaper in construction. As is expected. The USB part is made out of plastic and not metal. It is also slightly longer though this may be a function of the extra capacity.These drives are for USB music on my car so I do not remove them very often. So the plastic build is fine for now. But the plastic could break or even get stuck in the USB drive itself.
5,Tesla vehicles can record dashcam and security alerts from the built-in cameras but you have to provide the storage. To do that I wanted large capacity in the smallest form factor so it doesn't stick out and interfere with other items in the storage area.This Sandisk unit has been perfect for this. It can handle the data speeds Tesla requires while also being small enough not to get in the way.My only complaint is that they advertise it as 512gb and the actual formatted capacity is 460gb. I understand that you lose some space during the formatting process but I'm not sure this device should have been marketed as 512gb.
3,The model has 0 heat vents so this drive tends to be hot when under use. Would look for other drives over this even considering the size.
5,A little hard to grab one too since it’s so small but a good value for the price. Works well.
5,works
5,I am the family genealogist. I have thousands of photos and documents and live in a small house. This lovely little thing stores all my info with room to spare and it’s portable so when I visit other family and scan documents I can pop this in to move the info right where it belongs.
4,So I love this drive i the sense that it has the capacity of a hard drive.  That said it is tiny easy to lose (ask me how I know) and because it is so small there are two limiting factors: speed and heat dissipation.  This is not the fastest drive (I didn't expect it to be for the price) and it gets HOT.  This latter issue is caused by the fact that it is so tiny it barely extends past the USB port itself.  I have been borderline alarmed a few times after writing data and then taking it out of the drive.  When I say hot I mean it.  Not harm yourself but definitely makes me wonder how long the drive will last hence I docked it 1 star.
5,I utilize one of these SanDisk 256GB flash drives in each of my vehicles. I store all of my audio and numerous video files on these drives with plenty of storage space still available as my media library grows.My media player in both vehicles playback the media files without an issue (no buffering).
4,This thumb drive is used as external storage for a 2019 Nvidia Shield TV. I had to first run it through File Explorer before the Shield would recognize and format it for NSTV transfer of games and cloud data but it finally worked well. Granted the Shield with its super fast processor is the Porsche of all the streaming devices but the SanDisk usb drive is fast enough to keep pace with those speeds and for use with Kodi Netflix game streaming.
4,I love this because the drive barely sticks out of the side of my MacBook Pro. I just leave it there unless I want to copy something to my other Mac without using my network. I travel for my photography and sometimes shoot very large sports events. There are tons of photos I download each time and instead of copying to my laptop and taking up space I use this small high capacity drive. Works great!What I do NOT like is the drive is not as well made as older ones that I have. I have 3 other smaller capacity drives like this and they are metal on the connector. This one is plastic which makes it not quite as sturdy in my opinion.
4,After having a few days to try this out transferring over 100 Gbs of files onto it I can honestly say that this is a solid product. Much better than the older Fit version. This one does not get scorching hot like the last version and transfer speed are mostly fast with timely use. This could have been a 5 stars but for one reason I have to give it 4 stars. It's understandable why the entire body is made from a plastic like material because the last model tend to overheat and literally burned you. The plastic doesn't absorb as much heat so temperatures stay mild. However because its plastic I worry about its durability. I've taken it off and on from my laptop to my desktop and I can already see some ridges forming from scratches from taking it in and out the USB port. I few more of this and the scratches could get deep enough that it could crack the Flash Drive. It's probably unlikely but it still a cause of future concern.
5,Works great plus great price and fast shipping
5,Small and fast enough. Great music and file transport. I would like to see these made exactly the same except with a USB C connector. I bought a pack of these: 7-Inch Colorful Hand Wrist Strap Lanyard for USB Flash Drive. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00W8W8BNQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_detailsIt would be nice if they came with any kind of lanyard which helps prevent loss.
5,I bought this to run ESXi on a server for home use / learning. It works perfectly for that use case. No problems imaging it plugging into my server etc. file transfer was quite fast. I’d recommend it to anyone just looking for a low profile USB stick with a decent storage this is perfect.
3,I bought this flash drive since it was recommended on some random blog to record dashcam footage for Tesla's. We have a Model S and this does not do the job.You can format the drive with FAT32 and it will start recording once you plug it into your car. BUT  we often get error messages saying that this device is not fast enough to record footage. Because of that reason we will get intermittent dashcam footage saved. The issue is with the write to speeds for this device not so much the read speeds.You get what you pay for pretty much. For $10 for a 64gb this shouldn't be a surprise. You are better off spending $50-80 for a drive that can actually meet the write demands.  The downside is that many of those are not the mini portable size thus will stick out. Which is less than desirable but its a trade off for working footage vs convenience.
2,These things feel so fragile. It does not feel like it is meant to be plugged in again and again it is definitely designed to be plugged in and left in. It has a loop on it and I tried to put it on a key ring but any size ring I tried was too big to work right and almost snapped the plastic in the process.
5,Great place to stash all them dank memeos. I only got 114 gb of storage which is to be expected with digital storage. Just a tad disappointed that I can't stash as much product to satisfy my addiction. It has a lanyard holder which is also a bit disappointing cause it takes up a little more space that is needed for my needs cause I just leave it in 24/7/365. The plastic body doesn't bother me its probably for the best because the metal bodied flash drives tend to heat up more than my mixtape which bothers me a lot. It does get a little warm like sticking your hand on an active Xbox One or PC kind of warm but not as much as the metal bodies ones. The drive fits snuggly with minimal wiggling and shaking. The packaging is the kind that Satan would make but you can solve anything with a knife and scissors. All in all its a working convenient and compact meme stash/flash drive. Nothing more nothing less
5,only question is the size - hope I will not misplace it - so time will tell -
5,Bought 2 of these to use in our cars.  Loaded them with music (it holds A LOT of music) and plugged them into the USB port designated for such use.  A standard USB drive would stick out considerably and be constantly bumped because the port is located directly above a storage tray for items such as loose change sunglasses gloves sanitizer and covid masks. These tiny devices solve that problem.I'm old enough to have been very familiar with floppy disc drives and I am continually amazed by the evolution of data storage and the convenience they provide today.
5,This is great small and fast!
5,If you have a 4 GB DDR Memory on a laptop these are excellent for using for ReadyBoost. They can be left in your laptop an not interfere when you carry it around. If you use for other purposes and remove it when you don't need it you should get a wrist lanyard for it. They are sometimes difficult to find on a messy desk or if you drop it. It is very convenient for carrying files that want use on other PCs and Laptops but do not want to leave them on those units. It is priced right for a gift or stocking stuffer.
4,Easy way to add additional storage to my Atari VCS.
3,I am so sick of digital storage companies lying to their customers about everything they can get away with. It used to be just transfer speeds but now its drive size as well. Most of the negative reviews on this product show that the drive is only 475GB but mine showed up with 460gb... This is after proper formatting and everything.This trend of forcing customers to do an enormous amount of research on a product to figure out what is a lie is going to keep getting worse until these companies are punished.
5,Fits and works great in my Tesla model Y for sentry.
5,I like the 512GB storage on this small drive. I do keep it on a chain because the size could easily be lost without something attached. I sometimes use a cute key chain to hold 2 or 3 of these small drives. I can carry my music on one or all my documents on another. Easy to travel with me taking up only a small amount of space. If you like small you will love this.
5,Very fast and small.. I use it for retro gaming
5,I have several of these. It is small and easy to carry to work school or on the go work.Has the ability to lock so anything on it is protected where if anyone picks it up they can not get to your files.It is small and compact. No cords or power supply needed.I also use mine as storage drives. You can save all of your pictures documents etc. They do not corrupt as easy as the larger hard drives. You can have your whole life saved on these and safe in you own safe.
5,I am happy to buy this flash drive. Due to the size I can leave it plugged in all the times on my laptop. There should have been few color options though.
5,Extremely tiny usb packs a punch! Works great with my Xbox Series X absolutely NOT an eyesore when plugged upfront. i use for Retroarch & personal videos recommend using with a usb splitter if plugging into the back ports as the back of the XSX can run hot at times.
5,I used this on an Android TV box I installed a few apps onto it including Disney+ everything loads instantly!
5,Love these little things.  I use these in applications where size really counts - the smaller the better.  I can transfer multiple entire operating system images (often 64 or 128 gig) on one single drive not much bigger than my thumbnail.  Never have to worry about filling the space when these are used as long term storage on edge systems.  Love these.
3,Pros:Works fine.Great price.Cons:Scary thin and soft 100% plastic housing.Cheap feel and questionable durability.Do you dare entrusting your data to this cheap gizmo?
5,I have a MacBook Air with a 128 GB SSD drive.  That's not much storage these days.  I use iCloud and Google Drive and I had to stop using the Google Drive client (Google Backup and Sync) because I had over 60 GB in Google Drive.  When it syncs with my MacBook Air it fills up the hard drive.  So I slapped this puppy into my MacBook formatted it and created a 128 GB drive just for Google Drive storage.  Now I just point Google Backup and Sync to this volume and I don't have to worry about my MacBook's main hard drive filling up. It's been working great for this so far.
5,Loved this little device.  Holds plenty of data and takes up very little space in the USB ports of my laptop.  No trouble fitting other devices in next to it.
3,I was using this USB drive every so often. I got it so that I can carry large content wherever (which is my home because of Covid-19). It was easy to use and transfer weren't an issue. Then one day it just stopped working. I've had it for almost 2 months now.I'm very aware of ejection procedures and of course static. I made sure none of those were a factor whenever I used it. It showed up again once last night (9/20/20) and I thought it was just some fluke. But now it's not working yet again.Fortunately the things I have on it I have back-ups too. But I would be in a bad position if I had to do a presentation or take data elsewhere. I'm hoping it'll work again so I can reformat it and see if that will help.Otherwise I have to lower my score of the product. No way should it be doing this.
5,I needed something fast enough to be compatible with my ps5 and this fit the bill. Wish I had gotten the 1TB variant as games are so large now - but this is a great price for what you get. Works exactly as expected and can be hidden in the back USB port
3,Keyring hole is too small for most keyrings to fit well.  Had to find extra small ring to make it work.
4,The plastic port is fragile. It would be nice to add some protection.
3,Slower data transfer speeds that m USB3.0. Webpage states this is a USB3.1 however it shows up as USB 3.2 when plugged into computer. Manufacturer support pages of little help. Product page show refund or replaceable but I cannot obtain either from Amazon.
2,I liked the size of this drive. Very compact. I purchased it to use in the audio systems of my two cars a 2016 Equinox and a 2018 Equinox. Tested it on the 2016 Equinox and it worked. Tried it on the 2018 and the audio system would not even recognize there was anything in the USB port at all...even though it was FAT32 and it's a newer audio system!! Tried alternate formats and nothing changed. I had an older SanDisk Ultra drive (also FAT32) that works perfectly in both vehicles. Seems maybe SanDisk has made a physical manufacturing change impacting the usability of this particular drive between systems. Tried to work with SanDisk support over the course of two weeks to solve the issue and they failed to follow-up when promised. Apparently they don't care. Very disappointed with the drive and SanDisk support. Returned to Amazon for a refund. Amazon is great for supporting "their" customers!!
3,It’s super easy to use and good storage but it gets hot real quick so I returned it.
2,I picked this drive for the TeslaCam feature because the Model 3 cubby has the USB ports sticking out in the middle and standard thumb drives stand out like a diving board waiting to be broken when you reach for your sunglasses or something else in that cubbyhole. I purchased this drive specifically for this use as it was large enough to not need emptying everyday. I loved both the physical and volume size.All was fine until I rebooted after receiving the 2019.24.4 update. Like many others I was met with a red exclamation point in the status bar. A tap now brings a dialogue "Dashcam: USB drive is too slow to save" and now the little camera doesn't show the red recording indicator. This drive is now effectively useless to Tesla owners for TeslaCam. It's probably fine to hold a music collection for those times you drive out of range as music is mostly bound by read speeds and music just plain takes less than streaming multiple cameras to the device.Read the product listing carefully and notice how it talks about a very specific number ("up to 130MB/s") for read speeds and uses weasel words ("up to 15x faster than USB2" - of course USB3 is faster than USB2) and it never actually lists a given write speed.  We don't really know how fast it is supposed to be but apparently it's not fast enough for even the USB2 that's in these cars.I usually don't write reviews when a product already has thousands of reviews but thought this specific problem was worth calling out to Tesla owners. ***This drive simply no longer works for TeslaCam.***
5,It's ridiculously feather weight for a 512GB device and tried it on my Xbox Series S hoping it'll read and extend the storage count. Thank God it does so now I can download more games to enjoy. Definitely recommend for its price and convenience. Probably gonna buy another eventually to extend my Xbox storage one more time. 👍
5,Hubby uses it for his work laptop it fits perfectly in the sleeve so he won't lose it and it performs perfectly
2,Will NOT work with most USB 3 hubs.  Requires a powered hub.  I have two Sabrent "switching" hubs and one Amazon Basic USB 3 hub.  These drives do not work with those hubs.  You must use a powered USB port or hub.  I've never before had a flash drive that required a powered port.  Even my three previous purchases of this same brand of flash drives (SanDisk 64GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive Low Profile (SDCZ430-064G-G46)) worked with un-powered ports but not these.  (I've purchased them three times over the last three years.)  I'm disappointed.
5,This flash drive is a good value.  Works fine.
5,3 words.. Nice Nifty and Nice 😃😃😃
1,I purchased this while it was on sale for just under $10 to backup all of my wedding photos. I started the transfer and 8% in I started getting an error saying the drive was not mounted. I took it out and put it back in and it wasn't recognized. Tried it in another computer and nothing. Surprising from a company as well known as Sandisk. Wouldn't recommend for any files you care about
5,Worked great with everything I needed it for!!SIDE NOTE: I accidentally left this in my pants pocket so it took a trip both through the washer and dryer!! I waited a day because I forgot but when I plugged it in again it worked just fine. "QC check complete." Seriously though I do not know if the internals are coated with anything but it survived my accident. Would definitely buy again and recommend.
5,Lots of reliable storage in the smallest space possible. Absolutely perfect for use in a USB plug-in environment in a car. Takes practically no space and yet holds anything you ever wanted.I think it's best use is in the car
5,Generally buy SanDisk or other major name to get reliably memory.I bought this one for an application where I did not want a long USB stick protruding and getting hit.This one has a very low profile and it is very secure.
5,It is very versatile while it is only one of several rotating backups they are very fast to transfer the large amount of data and reasonable priced so you can have several scattered at multiple locations. The form also makes them useful to view the contents directly on most modern TV sets.
4,Honestly does its job fine - it's just you pull it out after using it & think: "Plastic shouldn't be this hot."Laying it in front of a fan after use cools it down quick enough & as far as I can tell the heat doesn't affect performance. Wouldn't return it but next time I'll definitely look for metal housing.
5,The only thing to note about this is it really depends on the format of the of the file system and the size of the file being transferred. Also of course that you have a USB 3.1 port that supports the speeds of this drive. I am getting around 135 m/s when doing large file transfers in NTFS from an ssd. But when using fatx or fat 32 with smaller files its considerable slower due to the format/file system. I do wish it was metal due to the size and use but understand this would affect the cost. Again its very small and the only way to keep up with it is on a key ring or lanyard. I am worried that it will bang around and break as other have shown. But overall its cost and speed make this a good value.
4,No Plastic Cover...What HappenedI know its to Cut The Costs and I missed The Print that mentioned itNo Metal USB... Its All PlasticSay it Ain't So
1,I have used the old SanDisk fit mini USB drives in my laptops as a supplemental backup HD. I do this because if a SSD fails recovery is often impossible in way it was with older SSDs. When I bought the old Sandisk fit I think the largest is 64GB they were hands down the best super-small form USB drive though far from perfect. I had several fail to recognize consistently though never lost data.I am upgrading to larger drives for same basic use. Larger storage capacity but still small form factor. Three main options PNY Samsung Sandisk in 256GB ultra-small form factor. PNY appears to have suspect reliability. I got the Sandisk because was $10 cheaper almost 20% cheaper not a trifling difference. Sandisk was newer ultra fit not old fit. It was cheap plastic that certainly won't last not opposed to plastic but plastic on this SUPER thin probably to facilitate heat transfer. That failed. Plugged Sandisk in hot enough to fry an egg on within minutes stayed that way worried might ruin or harm my $3K thinkpad. Write speeds were under 10MBS on a large transfer and dropped below 1MBS as the drive got hot. In Windows name changes to drive did not seem to propagate other weird errors. I am no longer a Sandisk customer EVER after buying the UltraFit (and thankfully returning under Amazon's sterling return policy). It unconscionable to release such an overt POS product for data critical applications. Using the Sandisk 25GB of files copied took well over an hour. This for a drive that bills itself USB3.1 granted my laptop a bit older. My USB mouse also cut out intermittently whenever Sandisk plugged in even after updating all firmware drivers etc. on anything possibly related.I got the Samsung it works perfect I purchased both products and am not a paid reviewer or shill I would strongly recommend the Samsung. This Sandisk drive after but minutes in the computer is hot enough to cause a very mild burn if held against the skin. Totally unacceptable.
3,The overall size of this little guy is great but it's also the downside of it because you could easily lose it if you're not careful. I recommend tying something to the end of it to make it easier to pull out because I plug it into my PS4 and its nearly impossible to pull it out easily another issue I have with this is the overall build of this guy the piece that plugs in which is all of it at this point needs to be reinforced because it's just a light plastic material and I'm afraid it will break at some point but I will see what happens since I just recently got it but I do love that it has 256gigs of data so that is just amazing for the price. If you tend to lose things or break things easily this is not for you but if you want to give it a shot and are pretty good about keeping things good then this is for you
4,I would give this a 5/5 stars but here is my only problem. With any USB it has to be portable and this one is But this is small very small like to plug it in to the back of your computer it maybe impossible to unplug it I had to wrap some string or a zip tie to the back so that I can pull it out. It o most always gets confused with one of the wireless keyboard or mouse USBs.
5,I like the size & capacity of this device! I don't have too have extra flash drives laying around when this item is well sufficient for my storage needs.
5,Exactly what I needed for my truck to play music. I have a Durango that has adaptive CarPlay SD and Bluetooth. And my phone doesn’t hold all of my music. So I bought this. This is what you need. Depending on where you get your music it reads just fine.But make sure you don’t use sub folders and that all of your songs are mp3. Otherwise you will get an error.Be careful. This product is fragile!
5,I loved how small it is.  You can leave it in the USB port and not even notice it.  So tiny and large capacity.  The downside is that this thing was so inconspicuous that I lost it!  lol
4,Great storage capacity for the price and being a sandisk product there is the great option to have access to their encryption system. I personally dont like the fact that it's so small. I feel if I did not have it locked to my work lanyard it would most definitely be lost for sure. Overall great product.
5,I leave this plugged into my macbook at all times to increase its storage.  I use it for storing ROM files for my various emulators thus turning my macbook into a computer/gaming console.
1,Do not trust this USB.  It's made out of a plastic that is brittle and breaks easily.  Also it gets too hot to touch at times.  So that too is concerning.I really wanted to ignore the negative reviews due to the small form factor and historical quality of SanDisk.  Unfortunately the bad reviews are all true.  This drive is terrible and a piece of it's housing broke off and got embedded in the PC case USB port.  It's a very tight fitting item and due to its small size and how deep it is embedded I cannot get it out rendering the port useless until I can figure it out.Be warned.  Not sure why they continue to make these out of that cheep plastic.
5,La MAC lo detectó inmediatamente respalda la información importante de manera segura
4,It gets too hot when i use it on my laptop but when I put it in my wii u it’s perfect fine and chill
2,I know the Sandisk drives are usually really good but I guess the small size of this one forced to compromise on speed.Copying files (both small and big) to the drive can become realllly slow (down to 10MB-20MB a lot)and it can be really frustrating.The fact that it's compact is good but it's not worth the impact in performance.
5,I have two of these.  I have two Nvidia Shields that I use for streaming.  I configured these for adopted storage in other words to use for additional storage for the system and apps not for data storage.  So it is permanently mounted for this purpose.  Works great for me.  No problems what so ever.  It will use one of the USB slots.  I use a powered USB extender in the other USB slot in order to utilize other multiple USB devices.
4,I bought this to plug into my truck for music. I wanted to have something that I could plug in and not stuck out too far to get broke off if brushing past it. Good storage space for some of my music. I will be buying more for the different types of music I listen to. Hard to grasp at first but easier to handle once you get used to the size of the dongle.
5,Amazing little drive but mine came formatted as FAT32 weird connecting it to the USB 3.0 port would not even recognize it but when I plugged it into the USB 2.0 It did once I formatted the drive to NTFS the USB 3.0 port immediately recognized it.This drives are not very fast at writing but pretty fast at reading no big deal since all I would need them for is large storage capacity and that it has 460GB after formatting and all that sticks out of your computer is half the size of your thumbnail Wow!
4,Best storage on a USB stick ever made.Besides it not being Wi-Fi compatible or GPS locatable I would say that if you were looking for a decent amount of hard drive space on a back up device then choose this one;  for your surface Pro especially - it fits into the AC adapter on the charge cord! (Erganomicially) And so automatically your machine backs itself up to it every time you charge your surface or plug the charger into the magnetic charge port.
5,Purchased 3 different FIT USB3 drives to test speed for Windows on Raspberry Pi project.  This was the fastest between SanDisk PNY and Samsung.  Plastic housing feels flimsier than the other two units.
5,Way more storage than you'll ever need in a perfect little tiny package
4,This little dude is so small that you need small wiry fingers long nails or some soft pliers to get it out! Also be careful not to lose it - it is not much larger than your thumbnail. But it works like a charm. I bought the 32 GB capacity and it came available with 28.5 after deleting the SanDisk encryption program you can enable on it. I bought mine for a front-loading USB on a car stereo to be able to leave it in all the time. It is perfect for that - load a 32 GB tiny flashdrive with 3500 songs and let it go for 2 weeks 24 hours a day with no repeats. Awesome!
5,It’s good
5,I purchased these to be used for Windows 10 recovery disk.  To that extent 8 gb space was needed and these weigh in at 16 gb so are quite adequate given the price.  My only ding on these is that if one has really "fat fingers" that they are really small and therefore can be a little more challenging as to getting into and removing from the USB slot.  But all in all I only need them in case of a catastrophic failure so it is not a big deal or at least if i need them the size is the least of my problems
2,One of the two I bought started disconnecting and reconnecting as I transferred files to it and suddenly-- POP! It became so hot that the housing popped off and flew behind my desk leaving a hot cap and circuit board in the USB port!I let it cool down with a fan after shutting down the computer and then removed it with a grounded "helping hands" tweezers. The chip/board was separated from the housing cap and unusable.This purchase didn't allow for an easy replacement; in order to obtain a replacement (item was only one month old) for this one it requires going to the manufacturer's website and filling out a horridly extensive and invasive form that asks for more time and info than filling out a census!Anything bought within 90 days that fails should be an auto-replacement using Amazon not an external site.The low-profile design is otherwise ideal for laptops since it is much less likely to be stressed at the connector or broken off. It's too bad poor warranty coverage taints one's ability to appreciate the design and convenience.NOTE: The overheating was not caused by a faulty connection and I used the same method to transfer the SAME files/amount to the other (same type) drive without incident and two other flash drives from other brands.
4,Really good drive and really good speed for 16 gb version. especially write speed first 200-250 mb is verry fast at around 40mb and then comes down to 11-12. in transfers under 200mb the popup window does not even show up.read speed is sustained 100mb+(this will dramatically increase with higher capacity versions).overall my new primary flash drive for small things. switched from Samsung BAR which was verry nice in metal form but the USB port completely sheered off on plastic(blue) one. this one seems to have more sturdy plastic but still would have preferred the metal construction(the only reason I did not go for high capacity version 128 or 256).overall really nice would go for 5 stars absolutely and get more higher capacity ones if it had all metal body.for small cheap and reasonably fast drive its nearly as good as it gets
5,I used this 'memory-stick' (more like a button) to load 7000 songs from my Audio Library to plug into my Ford F150 SYNC Audio System. Other memory sticks stuck out to long and were always in danger of being broken off or bumped out of the socket. This unit is so compact that it barely sticks out from the dash mount. Fast reading and low power consumption. Great storage barely dented the capacity with 7000 songs loaded on it.Highly recommended great value for the money-vs-storage capacity. SanDisk always has high quality USB Memory.
5,I just purchased a Lenovo laptop with a 128gb SSD drive which is a little small side.  I wanted a low profile USB that I could leave plugged in all the time and this fits the bill.  It is an easy way to add some storage.  Works fantastic.  It is not the fastest at read/write but good enough for my use.  My laptop still fits in a case without having to unplug and with  its low profile I don't worry it was get broken which is exactly what I was looking for.
3,The device functions well only in well ventilated (preferably air conditioned) areas.I'm aware that's a weird start to a USB drive review but hear me out..This flash drive packs a lot of tech into a tiny footprint and it's shell is all plastic with no cutouts for airflow.The effect of this is that heat does not get dissipated quickly or efficiently enough to keep the drive within its recommended operation temperatures. The drives gets hot to the point where the plastic is notably pliable with light pressure sometimes even sticking to the USB port it's plugged into.While copying a 40gb virtual machine image I experienced thermal throttling of write speeds from +100mbps to around 15mbps. Also the device disconnected multiple times during the copy process and the whole operation had to be restarted.This IS NOT an isolated case.I've checked the SanDisk support forums and it is a common issue for the ultra fit range.I use the drive as a data recovery USB so this isn't a deal breaker for my (yet) but if your goal is to quickly and reliably transfer large amounts of data with a compact high capacity device; my advice is to look for a drive that has a better design.
5,Great product!
5,After purchasing two other USB storage devices I was pleased that this one worked.  Save and read speeds are quick I've had no problems with corrupt or missing files and it never overheats or feels warm when saving larger files.  It is small which I wanted but have made it a point to always store it in the same place on my desk so I don't lose it.  Sometimes I'll start looking for it and realize it's already plugged into my computer so it nicely un-noticeable.
5,Perfect size price and storage for what I needed. Use them for my blink system.
5,Es de un tamaño muy pequeño recomendado para estéreo de carro
5,Really nice drive be careful not to lose it its tiny.
2,Stopped working after 3-4 cycle using MBP. Fortunately I always keep second copy so I didn’t lose any data.
5,A little difficult to lift up
1,This was a very popular drive this the reason I went with it.  After about a month of use my Tesla wouldn't recognize the drive.  I took it out then put it back in and it did come up.  Tried formatting and it was successful.  But then it failed again like drive wasn't recognized immediately.  Took it to my PC and Windows found the device and oddly it showed the TeslaCam folder and all the video clips.  However I was not able to access the files.  When. Trying to play a video clip it just locked up and drive would not show up in Windows until you take it out and put it back in.  I tried Windows to format the drive and it was successful.  Again it stilled showed the TeslaCam folder and shows the file but can't view the clips again.  Junk.  After reading others reviews it seems to be the same issue where moving large files or constantly writing large blocks of data kills the drive. The Tesla cam clips are large and lots of data is written at the same time to different areas of the drive from all the cameras.  I'm sure this is what kills it.
5,I needed this to load music files for my wife for a car trip.  Like the small physical size for inserting into the car USB connection and of course SanDisk is always reliable from a quality point of view.
3,This was $15 for 3.1 at 128gb so I am not disappointed with the purchase. It is very slow atleast on files under 50 mb. I have plenty of front bus speed using an X570 motherboard with ryzen 3700 processor and files coming from a new m.2 4th gen Samsung main drive. So it is clearly this drive that moves slow and with only 9 GB of space used on this flash drive since all drives slow with amount of space used hence writing purposes. All and all this is very small so portability is 3 stars since they didnt include a string they call a lanyard. This will get lost very easily. Besides those I use it for a pioneer dvd drive on my car and it runs very smooth in there. I am happy since after 2 hours to fill this up with mp3s  music videos and some movies I will not have to wait for writing speeds.On larger files it does 30 to 50 mb consistently
5,Fits perfect (unnoticeable) in Auto for extra music source.
5,Bought this for digital downloads on my kid's Wii U. It doesn't the job nicely. One has to worry about power consumption with the Wii U many USB drives over 32GB or 64GB use too much power for the Wii U to function properly but this one works very well. The all black looks great with the black Wii U as well. You'd never really notice it's there on the back ports. I'd be temped to buy a 2nd one but don't want to push my luck.
5,Love the low profile of this USB drive which provides the local storage for a security camera system that doesn’t have the normal microSD port. Because the security hub has to be located in a place where a protruding USB stick would probably get banged around over time this is just the right size. Still 1% full after a month this capacity should last a long time.
5,When the hard drive on my old laptop died i installed peppermint linux on one of these and booted to it so that now I have a solid state memory module as my principal computer memory.  It works fast and efficiently as well or better than the original hard drive !  I have been using it for two months without any problems.  Can't say enough.
4,Free space shown is 123 Gb.Included and can install the Security Access.For the lower price I got a plastic instead of a metal shell. Have to handle with more care.
5,Using this for Blink Sync Module. OK so far no issues.
4,Using to record broadcast tv kind of like a VCR.  Works.  Doesn't stick far out of the unit.
4,I haven't seen any issues with the data rate or responsiveness but when removing it I've found that it gets noticably hot. Used in a laptop desktop and with a USB3 external hub. Hot when removed from each after transferring files (less than 1gb of transfer each time). Unsure if this will shorten the life of the drive.
2,I learned something quite valuable with this product. Admittedly I should have realized this before. The new USB generations are well-known for being incredibly speedy and giving consumers great performance when transferring files. HOWEVER a product that adheres to the USB 3/3.1 standards only has the potential for those speeds. The devices connection can obtain that... but the hardware behind it can be extremely poor. This device is one of those 'great connection but horrible hardware inside.'The way NAND (the technology used to make flash/SSD drives) works so quickly is by utilizing multiple chips simultaneously. The lower end devices will have very few chips while the higher ends will have more... and better 'controllers' and such. It is obvious by its performance and write speeds that it has very few... if not only one... chip.Flash drives has such an appeal due to their on-the-go form. It's why I got it. I go to class with my programming files and I bring home new assignments or stuff I had worked on in class (since the university does not always grant access to cloud storage for some reason). My last class I spent 10 minutes afterwards just to move over 6GB of data! That's not exactly what I would consider 'on-the-go.'Outside of that I feel like this device will not last very long. One enormous factor in the slow degradation of electronics is how hot the components get and this device gets VERY hot.My personal recommendation and what I am going to do next week is just get full-blown SSD drive with an external case. They will be able to utilize the great performance of the new USB standards will still work for 'on-the-go' reasons and will typically have MANY more NAND chips inside.
5,How great to get a product that is as advertised!!  Buy the brand name.  SanDisk never has problems in my experience.  If you try one of the cheaper companies you may lose your data... no joke!  Those cheap flash drives often are garbage.  If you don't want to take a chance then spend the few extra bucks on a SanDisk and have peace of mind.  Perfect backup!  I may buy the 1tb version next.
5,This needs to come with a easily removable lanyard. I like how it fits so close to the laptop making breaking it nearly impossible but as soon as you remove it from the laptop it's very easy to lose. To be honest I didn't actually lose it since it was in the very tip of my pocket and I just *thought* I lost it but I'd be willing to bet that I'm going to lose it rather than break it by sitting on it... as the typical fate of my drives tends to be.It's very fast even compared to other 3.1 drives and the price-per-Gigabyte would look like a scam if it were from an unknown brand.
5,Both work flawlessly; they are used as back-ups for my 2 computers Microsoft Surface Notebook 4 and a Surface Pro 4. FAST...FAST..FAST. I note the one for my Surface Notebook does heat up a little at the insertion point for the drive but only when transfering very large files like 200 Gigs or more which is almost the entire available on the flash drive. I use both daily and have had no issues.their compact size and low enough silouet given the size of Gigs make these a great choice versus a large standard flash drive which sticks way out or a very large and cumbersome portable hard drive. I recently traveled with one on my Surface Pro 4 and had no issues. I was overseas and there was no AC never got hot or had any issues. Highly recommend. The seller had them to me a day earlier than expected too!
5,Product is very small and easy to just leave in the computer if you want. Transfers are fast and so far it's working above expectations.
5,I have owned classic cars for the past 15 years so imagine my surprise when my super fancy modern car did not have a cd player! Seriously?! Did they save $3 by not including one?!So now I am going through the pain-in-the-neck process of converting my CDs to digital this drive has a great capacity and it is low profile so I can leave it plugged into the aux USB port on my car. I live in Arizona and so far it has handled the 110 degree days just fine.
5,I bought this to use for my Roku TV's live TV rewind feature. I've been using it for around a month and haven't had any issues yet. I really like the small profile how it fits securely in the USB port and isn't at risk of getting snapped off/snagged by cables if I need to move things around. I can just plug it in and forget it's there.Good buy. Much like. Do recommend.
5,My review is upon receiving my usb and putting it in my computer. I recently purchased a Samsung usb that is comparable in size. Let’s just say I really liked my Samsung usb until I got this one. This Sandisk USB is really discreet and fits so snug you don’t have to worry about it breaking or falling out because of a bump. I love that since I don’t plan on taking it in and out frequently. Anyways thanks for this one!
5,What can I say - it's a USB flash drive and works great - transfer rates seem fine and the price was definitely right!  Note that this is an all plastic design (including the socket) so might wear a bit over time.
3,These are very tiny Flash drives - that is why I bought them.  They have good capacity and good speed and they are very small.  That is both a plus and minus - it means they fit where I need them (in my car) and it means they are incredibly easy to lose.  You would think I would give this a better rating based on what I just said but I have not yet gotten to the good part.  They are useless except inside an air conditioned home or office.  I suspect the majority of you have no problem with this restriction but I do.  I wanted them to work inside a car in Florida.  I know what you are saying - this guy is being unreasonable - just let me give you one fact - the sandisk website lists the operational max temperature of these as 95F. (I did not know this before I purchased)  So if you hold one in your armpit for a time there is a chance it won't work until it cools down.
5,vg
5,Used it for my media files and worked just fine formatted FAT32.
4,Before buying these I had to return some no-name thumb drives I previously bought on amazon because they couldn't store data and be read back without errors.  I was planning on using them as an encryption unlock key which that kind of flakiness was just not going to work.The SanDisk sticks work great for storage.  The design is okay aside from the hole I use to attach it to my key chain.  It has a very awkward shape that I have concerns about snapping off later.
3,Plastic damage but everything working good.
4,They do the job and they're compact as expected what I didn't expect and the reason for the 4 star is that the plug is actually made out of plastic vs metal. I can't think of a time when I've purchased a USB drive where the plug was plastic. I got one one time that was literally meant to be used and thrown away however I wasn't expecting this from a purchased product especially from someone like SanDisk.
5,Small size allows for convenience
5,Out of the way
5,Works well but you only get 114gb of storage space.
3,I own a different model of this flash drive although it's USB 2.0 The connector is metal. This one although USB 3.0 The entire casing and the tab is plastic. This seems like a reliability issue for me. I really only bought it for a Lenovo laptop that only has 32GB storage so I can run Portable apps right off the flash drive and plan on keeping it in the laptop. I only hope that if I decide to remove it out that the tab does not fall out and that I have a USB object stuck in my port which I'd have to pay a computer repair shop to fix.
2,I bought 512 GB size. Writing speed is not stable. If file size is under 500 MBs the writing speed is stable. (around 60 MB/sec).If file size is over 500 MBs the writing speed is between 55 MBs and 8 MBs.I tested the same file to write on Samsung USB 3.1 256 GB and it was stable. ( around 60 MB/ sec).
5,My only question is when they will put 1TB into one of these because I deeply love this usb product I even recommended it to my mother and she brought one. After having many drives stick out get bumped into and the like it's refreshing that all i have to do is plug in this drive and leave it alone. I took advantage of the encryption feature and shove all my sensitive inside the vault while leaving the basis stuff out.
5,My car map update required a 16 GB memory stick. It would not work with anything larger. I grabbed this one from Amazon and it was flawless. It was quite fast as the literature warned me it could take up to 5 hours! Well this was less than an hour and no issues. I have no issues with this SanDisk. I now have it labeled for map updates.
5,Bought this for my Blink my module works great.
5,I use this for music for my Marantz and car works great.
5,Lots of space for my files. Need another one!
5,I use USB sticks in my car to listen to recorded music through the cars audio system. Previously I was using full size USB sticks but they always hung out quite a bit and were an easy target for bumping and possibly breaking either/or the stick and the car usb connector. With this one the stick in 80%-90% secure protected and out of site when fully seated into the plug. Impossible to accidentally bump and damage itself or the connector. Lots of storage with 64Gb and inexpensive when I caught it on sale. It absolutely did exactly what I intended for it when I made the purchase. 110% happy.  Also incorporates a nice easy to grab thumb tab for very easy removal. I am very happy with mine and would recommend to anyone needing one.
4,This is a great little flash drive with fast speeds and a good price. I love the design and it works great for backing up my important files. Only reason it's 4 stars is because my first unit was defective. SanDisk did replace it however. So hopefully it was just bad luck and not anything too common. I just recommend testing it as soon as you get just in case there is an issue so it can be replaced right away by Amazon.
4,Purchased for its compact frame.  Placed music MP3 files on here and the small form factor is needed.  My main concern is that the plug shell is all plastic.  It feels fragile.
4,Worked as advertised AND the lanyard loop is very handy. I use it to store movies and music for traveling and it does this perfectly. When inserted it fits very close to the computer and dash of my truck.
5,Es tal cual lo que promete
3,Dislike that is not the 128gb that it supposed to be.
5,Good stuff. Used 2 of them to expand storage on a FireStick (via OTG hub) and an Android TV. Can’t beat SanDisk. Always reliable and competitive on price per GB. They are very small so I would suggest you use them somewhere that they won’t be removed often if ever at all. They’re a little hard to remove and probably extremely easy to misplace. Also the entire thing seems to be plastic so it’s probably just a little fragile. This will be my go-to expansion device.
2,If you are moving large files you will want to reformat this drive to NTFS BEFORE you start moving files.  Apparently FAT32 can't handle large files.  I discovered this too late...after I had spent hours moving files only to have the drive start to choke when it was only about 1/3 full. The only way I'll be able to make this drive fulfill it's full potential will be to move all the files back off the drive and to reformat it.  There should be a large warning on the front of the packaging but there isn't.
2,This drive got instantly very hot then slowed down to less than 28MB/s transfer rate.  For a drive that is this large it would take over 2 hours to fill.  I am sure it is a thermal issue with the slow speed but please advertise the speed the drive can actually achieve.
4,Very thin plastic. I bought 2 and already one is cracked. Still works though.Update: gone beyond cracked now. Even with the upmost care I've still managed to break off the piece that was cracked and it got lodged inside the USB port on my laptop. So take extreme caution in handling these.
5,Nice small usb drive and works in Model Y for sentry cam
5,Very nice flash drive for the price!I've never had issues with Sandisk products and bought this to assist me through my day as an IT Technician.Great transfer speeds and capacity for the price.It does get warm to the touch but most flash drives do and shouldn't be a cause for concern.I do wish the USB connector were metal and not plastic.
5,I recommend this USB storage to support your laptop storage capacity
5,Who knew you could get mini USB drives with this much storage capacity? This thing is fantastic! I use it with the XR16 Digital Mixer from Behringer to record mix downs of live events and I haven't even scratched the surface on the capacity. I think I have something like 96 days of recording time or something ludacris like that?Works great never have an issue 100% would recommend!
5,thank you!
5,Good on storage  highly recommended
3,I know what it says in the fine print and I know it's pretty common knowledge that manufacturers play these games with their numbers. It still doesn't make it acceptable or end up with a good customer experience.Just label it accurately as 460GB instead of marketing it as 512GB in a way that is useful to no one. You know you're only technically not lying.
5,Great drive. No issues. Knocked off some stars for portability. Yes it’s a tiny drive and you know that when you get it but I’ve lost this thing twice when carrying it around. It’s just too small. It’d be good for something you don’t need to carry around and need a small flush drive - like a Wifi camera.
5,I've been needing a USB drive to use in my car's stereo for my music library. The plan was to keep it in forever until I needed to update the library. I have more USB drives than I can count but I don't have any this small and compact. And for the cheap price I got it for I couldn't recommend a better tiny USB drive.
5,This USB drive works perfectly and is extremely small.  I love it.
5,muy bueno muy compacto
5,Had never used a  flash drive before and discovered it was very easy to learn to backup my files and pictures that had been on my computer for years . Wish I'd done it sooner.
5,I've been working on converting and adding our substantial music collection (lps & cds) to our PC and also wanted access to our music in our automobiles and other areas where we can listen.  Each flash drive has held all of our music (in excess of 1000 lps/cds and over 11200 songs which equals ≈ 750 hours of music) with room left over.  Doing the job and the playbacks have not missed a beat.  Excellent product.
5,The provided photos from the manufacturer are pitiful. Hardly enough to make an educated buying decision. I know I floundered for may days before deciding to purchase it. You can't tell anything about its size or usability from the provided photo. So I've added some perspective photos.It is the size of a single M & M candy. 3/4" x 1/2" It can easily become lost. It should come with a lanyard. It does have an opening in the plastic head for a small cord to attach a lanyard.USB 3.1 is fast. Holds a lot of data.I was miniaturizing my everyday carry items and this was one item that freed up space. PS. I also got a split pea peanut lighter from countycomm.com to go with my Maratac AAA flashlight and my Uncle Henry pocket knife
5,I have records for my organization that I belong to that I want to put on a couple flash drives so that multiple people have access to it.  I've tried a number of flash drives but they say they have copied the files over and then you look at the details and realize that it copied folders but  not the contents of the folders so you then have to check each folder to make sure it has the files.  NOT SO on this flash drive!  I'm super happy to have successfully copied all the files over with no issues.
5,The small size of this drive is it's crowning achievement. It's so small that it's hard to lable - one has to hang a lable off of the loop to avoid confusion among a set of like-sized thumb drives. Price was excellent - so good that I bought a batch set to have some to set aside for future use. Oh: they are USB-3 fast too. LINUX: I used a 32 GB version to resurrect a sadly under provisioned small Window$ laptop - installed Mint Linux and it runs fine from the thumb drive.  Small size is a real plus: one can leave the drive in a USB port without worry - it's nearly flush with the side of a laptop.
5,I got this so I could bring my documents ebooks audiobooks and school work with me everywhere. I immediately filled up 80% of the capacity and I am constantly moving it from one computer to another. It has not given me any trouble so far. It loads up quickly.The space is not large enough for a key ring. I still need to find a way to put it with my keys or something.
5,I got the 256gb capacity and use it to load movies and shows for our two little boys. I just plug it in the back of our TV and it's just plug and play! I have an old Mac Pro 2009 and haven't upgraded it to USB 3 so I'm using USB 2 and the speeds are fine for me.It is very tiny so be sure not to lose it!It's also black which can make it easy to lose as well.Otherwise it is a great product and I got a great deal on it as well.
5,Muy bonita y de gran capacidad
5,This was purchased to play music in my 2021 Durango. The short profile is perfect for car use along with the storage space. Copying the music was quick and the pc recognized the drive with no problem. Not really much to write or complain about.
5,Very good storage capacity and easy to use. ❤️
5,I'm using this to do incremental backups on my Linux laptop and it's doing great. The write speeds are fast and the low profile makes it great for laptop use.
3,I bought this in part because a recent reviewer claimed it had a write speed of 50MB/s.  NO WAY!  I should have read more reviews before I ordered.  The top write speed I observed was 19.0 MB/s with an average around 14.5 MB/s.  The price per gig is great but be prepared to do a lot of waiting.
5,Works as expected. It is solid.
5,Sandisk is a reliable memory company. I bought the 256GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 to use as extended storage in my PS5.  The PS5 had no issue formatting it and it works great. The PNY Elite-X Fit 256GB on the other hand is not compatible and the PS5 cannot format it. So if you're wondering which one to get for your PS5  go with Sandisk!
5,Extremely small firm factor and very easy to use. Have placed about 200gigs of days on it and no issues.
3,It only worked a short time I don't think it's good for teslacam
3,This thing was acting funny or differently than my other (more traditional) San Disk USB drives.  First it didn't appear in Windows Explorer the way the others had.  Figured it out and began moving files to this flash drive anyway took more than an hour.  Got to the last file which is 4GB+ and error message . . . file too big for operating system!  Say what?  Drive properties said FAT32!  Say what?  So I began moving files off the drive another hour + formatted to NTFS like it is supposed to be and moved the files back again.  Yup another hour +.  Another thing I wasn't able to right click on the drive and select "format" it wasn't there!!  Took some clicking to find the format function.  I have also noticed the drive gets or got hot while the files were moving back and forth.  That seems to have worked it's way out.  For the person with no technical knowledge or back ground this drive might be challenging!  Might want to think twice until San Disk gets this or these issues fixed.
5,Small size but powerful.
5,SanDisk has always been a great brand for storage and is definitely holding true today!
5,As expected product fast delivery.
4,I know you don't always get close to the actual amount of gigs that it advertises but 28gb but it will do for now.
5,I'm really happy with this as the external drive for my Legends Ultimate arcade cabinet.  I needed something with enough capacity to hold a ton of games and art/video files but I needed something low profile as I was worried about a hand slipping and snapping a typical sized USB.  This works great the speed is good and I have had no issues after a few months of near constant use.
4,I am a little worried about the material I am somewhat simple it is a plastic coating which for my taste gives me some mistrust I prefer the metal covers   otherwise speed is great storage capacity depends on which capacity you choose I recommend 128gb up compatible with different operating systems good but not perfect.
5,We bought this to plug into our Blink camera sync module after Amazon change the Blink camera  free srorage agreement.  It's worked flawlessly and just needed to be plugged in no setup required.
2,It seems to work as expected on all fronts except write speed.  I use this to backup large project files and it takes forever to copy them over.  I generally average less than 1 Mbps.  If you aren't planning on using it to store large files I'm sure it would work fine.  I haven't experienced the overheating issue others have complained about.
5,Easily do the job you expect I like that they're small so they won't easily break or break your computer as they don't protrude very much.
5,Bought for local storage for a wi-fi camera security system.  It's working perfectly and love the small form factor especially considering that it will just sit in the device indefinitely.  I'd actually be worried I'd lose it if I was carrying it around often due to it's small size.
4,I have the original ultra fit and I don't know if I would call this an improvement. The flash drive still offers slow transfer speeds of around 15-25mb for write read is much higher and still gets very hot when transferring files. This drive is also harder to pull out of the USB port on my Nvidia Shield TV than my other drive. I'm guessing that this one will have less heat issues though I have not used is extensively and I'm only assuming that because it is the newest iteration but I have seen this happen. My original is still running fine after over a year so I expect the same from this. Sandisk doesn't always make the fastest (affordable) drives but they do make the most reliable.
5,File & music/vidro
5,I always choose SanDisk because of its stable performance and look great. This is my second USB flash drive with 256GB memory. I stored my photos and projects in there. There is software included in the flash drive so you can encrypt sensitive information if you want and it is super easy to setup. I also had a USB transformer to USB-C so I can plug it into my phone too. It's super convenient.
5,Title says it all. 64GB of inexpensive compact storage.
5,The case is as small as a wireless mouse transceiver.  Great capacity.  Can be formatted ExFat (default) or NTFS for larger files (>4 GB).  It is a great way to add some storage to a laptop.  Read / Write speeds are as good as the other 'Ultra' Class SanDisk drives and it is USB 3.1 (plus backwards compatible if needed).  Update:  Have purchased 3 addtional for other laptops.  All working well.
5,It's a slightly tight fit so be careful with how much force you use. I love the low profile of it so that I don't have to take it out when I pack my laptop away. I have another one for my raspberry pi. I had 2 in at once on the pi so the short profile and the curved edge made it a little tricky to pull it out but this is not a deal breaker. I haven't tested the speed on it in anyway but I haven't had any noticeable issues with file saving or lag. I would definitely buy this again. Actually I think I've bought 3 for 3 different devices....2 laptops and the pi.
4,I use this for my Tesla Model 3 as a sentry mode hard drive and I am not impressed. The disk fails a few times and require formatting/ unplugging and plugging several time for it to start working again. Worth the money for storage but debatable reliability
3,Some quirks about this drive*it gets really hot when connected to some USB ports even though it's not in use (other stuff plugged to those ports don't have same issue)*when plugged into a USB port it is hard to get out it's a really tight fit and takes 2 hands and a good amount of effort to pull out*comes as just the drive no cover for the connector end (not really something I want to just carry around with exposed circuit making contact with whatever is my pocket) would have liked a plastic cap at least.It's a decent amount of storage space for the money speed wise didn't notice much difference between this and other drives I have.
5,I have a USB port in my car that can play music so what I've done is put a bunch of discographies on the drive so I have music in case I'm driving somewhere with no data or my music isn't downloaded for some reason on my phone. I like how small it is. Definitely worrisome with the plastic housing but considering I don't move it around much I'm not worried about longevity.
5,Excellent little USB drive. Fits well at the back of my VM box. Using it as my boot for ESXi 7.0. Boots fairly quickly into ESXi roughly 1-3 mins. No compatibility issues as a boot USB drive. Not sure if it operates at USB 3.0+ speeds during start up.The unit does get hot however. During ESXi install the drive got very hot this is not something I would want to do USB 3.0+ transfer speeds for hours.
5,Very nice slim design
5,Exactly as Advertised - Fast Shipping
5,Handels daily use with no issue
5,I really love the idea that you do not have to remove it and even better that if a criminal gets it they will not be able to access the files.  I did not read that in the description but in the description inside the scan disk after you plugged into laptop.  I recommend this purchase for everyone but especially students.
4,Purchased this to save my music onto the flash drive and use with my 4Runner's audio system.  Works great!
4,it's really a good stick high performance but it's not durable the cover made from poor plastic quality it will be damaged after a few months of usage . but it still work perfectly after 2 years purchase. please check the picture.
3,This is really tiny. Amazing technology but easily misplaced. Withing you'd have trouble finding it even in your pocket.
5,Great but definitely small try not to lose it!
5,Their small fast and so far very reliable. I will probably get more
5,Backed up hard disk setup partition in 20 minutes. I ordered two of them for me and my wife. Checked the partition when I had some time worked great. It's a brand name with more than enough room for our needs at a great price. Small thumb drive so it don't stick out others that stick out can get broken easier. I'm going to buy another one soon.  Give it a try and good luck !
5,The item is small and just the right size to plug in to the side of my laptop and forget that it is there.
5,Good and compact
4,I love the micro size and key ring slot but the plastic construction is questionable and they do get hot when tasking it.  The fit is tight and I'm afraid one day I'll try to pull it out and the back piece will just pop off leaving the other part inside the computer.  Use care!  Or I tend to use a short USB extension or hub to prevent damaging my computer.
4,The shell of drive is kinda easy to broke. Other than that it works fine
5,This USB drive fits snugly into the port and allows me to move the laptop freely about without fear of damaging the device. The drive has been working flawlessly for both file transfer and regular backups.
5,I work between my desktop and laptop on many projects and need mobility as I travel.  This device is both efficient conveniently fast and portable and allows me the option of quick and easy data storage.  I had purchased an gold USB drive from a non-reputable sight and got burned so trust this product to do the trick
4,It works very well and the 3.0 it's pretty fast for downloading and uploading.  The item is a little too small which makes it very hard to eject. One thing that disappointed me was is that; it doesn't come with a cover. However; it's not a big deal.  The price is very good for 64gb.  The quality is ok. I can't say much about durability because I just got it and the material quality is fair not the greatest. I do think it's great for saving all your pictures and all your regular size files. I'm very happy with it. I do recommend it.
3,I've been waiting for a 256 GB low profile flash drive for some time. My computer has a 256 GB internal SS memory which can get eaten up quick with files. So I've been using a 128 GB low profile thumb drive for a while to store all my files and only put applications and operating system on the computer's internal flash memory.This new 256 GB drive finally came out and in terms of size (the physical size of the drive) and the capacity it delivers as promised. However the drive itself is made of plastic instead of metal like the 128GB version I own. As a result the plastic part that protrudes from the computer's USB port often gets very hot so much so that it can feel hot to the touch. It doesn't burn but feels like it is almost hot enough to burn.It seems to me that the older model sinked the heat from the drive more efficiently than this model. Other than that I have not complaints. I'm giving it 3 stars because of this heat issue and because the plastic casing does not seem as durable as the previous model.
5,I liked the size of it.
5,Exactly what I ordered in 2 days.  Very satisfied
5,Works very well.
5,So far works good for me I've had it for over a month and it still works like new. It's not the fastest but i was expecting that anyway. I was a little concerned with the durability concerns from other reviews but its been fine for me although i have been babying it along the way. We'll see how long it lasts for.
5,Works great
2,Advertised speed was met when benchmarked with crystaldiskmark. I also copied 23gb of files without issue. However I can’t recommended these drives. The end that inserts into the port is made out of extremely cheap and flimsy plastic. My drive will remain mostly stationary in my car stereo so it should be fine for that and similar applications where the drive is not removed often. I would not trust this drive for applications that required you to remove/install the drive on a regular basis. I would not buy these again.
5,Ok OK OK
4,I bought two of these and set them aside. When I started to use them. one worked after loading driver the second is not functional. It is after the return period but this has been my experience.I tried this again to be sure before the garbage can.  It still didn't work. One last try on new win10 computer.  IT WORKS doesn't like win 7 ?
5,Like product works great
3,I purchased this Flash Drive to provide additional storage space on a router. I was able to repartition and format with a journalling filesystem. The low profile of this drive was perfect. The 5 year warranty was alluring.It does get a little warm (even with only reads) but nothing too alarming. As noted by others it is a little difficult to remove from unworn USB ports but for my use that was a bonus.Everything was working for a charm until recently (just under 6 months of use). Now I receiving the dreaded "Write Protect is On" message and am unable to continue using the flash drive. For a product with a 5 year warranty... Alarming to say the least.The filesystems on the drive are corrupt (consistent with a failing drive). However I do appreciate the firmware detecting failure conditions and disabling write access. I was able to use low level tools to: create backup images of the partitions repair the filesystem on each partition image mount the partition images and recover the data.
5,ok
4,I bought this product kind of on a lark.  I mean 256 GB in something the size of your thumbnail.  In any case I got it to augment the minimal SSD storage on my Mac Air.  I do a lot of video editing there when I travel and I have to say that this little drive is impressive!  The transfer speeds are as advertised (at a minimum) and the convenience of moving this little thing between the laptop and my desktop iMac makes this an ideal solution for my needs.  For the price during this holiday sale season you can't go wrong with this drive!
4,I have been using this drive for only a couple of days so far and the read speed is great at more than 100 Mbps but the write speed is pretty poor (14 to 20 Mbps) and the composite USB plug is already noticeably worn after about a dozen uses. As others have stated the fact that the plug is not metal does fix the fact that the old style could get the plug too hot to touch but it makes me worry about how long the drive will last with a more fragile connector and less ability to remove heat.
5,amazing product - good quilaty
3,I've used this with a machine running Windows 10 and it seems fine on it; I'll defer to the other reviewers and their thoughts.  Unfortunately I bought this intending to use it with Ubuntu (running on the same hardware as the Windows 10 box) and it just does not cooperate; "fdisk -l" sees the drive but doesn't seem to report the correct size or partition info.I was kind of able to get it working as USB storage on a wireless router but it caused issues as the external storage on a PS4.  I haven't tried it on any other devices.Anyway it seemed like a good value and probably still is for a lot of uses but this model (SDCZ430-256G) hasn't been especially flexible in my experience.
5,This flash drive is very small but holds so much. Love it.
4,I bought it so I can attach it to my printer so I can scan to USB w/o having to look for it all the time.I did some speed test w/ gnome-disk which shows 45 MB read/s.Access time varies between 1 ms and 4 ms averaging at 2.8 ms.
4,I am rating this 4 stars because it's a well made product but does have some flaws. It works and I noticed transfer rate seem fast. Being so small makes it easy to carry but also easy to lose. I wish SanDisk had included some kind of plastic storage or carry case like they do with their other storage devices. The other thing is that it gets really hot very quickly. This causes me some concern. Compared to other USB drives I have owned this one feels almost uncomfortable to touch after use.
4,A little bit larger than a typical USB charger for a mouse.  128GB actual showing to be 114 on my PC.  Formatted and ready to use as an external storage for my new laptop since it only has a 256GB SSD.  This is what I am currently storing some of my games on that i play extensively like SMITE on steam.
4,Overall exactly what I wanted. Almost too small and the key ring slot thing is too small to actually attach it to much. Because of that this is very easy to lose. Luckily I have multiple flash drives that I use to store different things and I keep them all in the same place. If that is not something you do you should expect to lose this at some point.On a positive note it does read/write very fast for how much this costs.
5,I used this to store games on my wii for usb loader gx. The usb drive came formatted in fat32 and worked perfectly with usb loader gx. I like this over using an external usb harddrive because of how tiny this is. Its not noticeable and makes the wii more portable
5,Used this flash drive for a Blink sync module. This works as a good alternative to Blink cloud storage.
4,This drive performs well enough if far short of being mindblowing. CrystalMark shows read speeds of around 120MB/s  writes around 30-50 for sequential transfers good enough for bulk storage use or quick throwing of files around. Random reads are passable at 8ish (random writes are abysmal). My use is pretty mundane mostly occasionally throwing images/documents/videos onto and for this it does the job acceptably quickly.Where it's nicer than past drives of mine is that it's barely noticeable on the key ring. It goes everywhere as unobtrusively as possible packing enough capacity for anything I might need it for. It may not be fun or exciting but its utilitarian virtues are hard to deny.
4,This thing gets hot! Seriously I have never felt a thumb drive get this hot before. But even when getting hot it does the job and does so quickly. No complaints really and the capacity for cost was very enticing. Would buy again.
5,Great little drive. Perfect as a Windows Recovery Disk
4,It's a basic flash drive. It's very low profile and very sleek. I did take away a star for poor build quality. It is unbelievably lightweight very thin plastic construction. I'm a big guy and I feel like I'm going to break it every time I touch it.
5,Bought 3 of these for 3 computers and after 6 months they been working fine. I use them every day so I think these are durable memory products
3,It’s a nice drive but I have an older one that comes with a nice cap to keep dust out. I feel they could have thrown that in here.
5,This is great for the blink system because it is slim and doesn’t stick out too much.
2,I was looking for "normal" flash/thumb drives - the kind that are about the size of your thumb. I obviously missed reading the specifications for these drives and the picture on the web page makes them look like thumb drive sized devices. I was shocked when they arrived and discovered they are smaller than my little finger nail - just the fingernail not the finger.That means these are very difficult to grasp and get into or out of the USB port if you have larger or arthritic fingers because there is nothing to hold onto. I'm guessing these were designed for use in backing up stuff from little mobile devices like phones and tablets. But as small as these are I can't imagine it would be any easier to get them into and out of the USB ports on those devices either.But worst of all these will be TERRIBLY EASY TO LOSE. If you set it down almost anywhere it will get lost or have something even modestly heavy set on it and crushed. Heaven forbid that you drop it on a dark floor and have trouble spotting it before you step on it. There is no room for a hole or strap or any way to put it on a keyring insert a string/twist-tie to hang it on so you can keep it out of harm's way when not in use and find it again when needed.You definitely won't want to depend on these for archive backup of your only copies of any important or treasured files because they can be too easily lost being this tiny.
5,My tabtop (tablet/laptop hybrid) needed some more storage.  I didn't want to spend a lot on an internal SSD so i'm using this as a second mini hard drive.  I leave this plugged in nearly all the time and since it's so small it stays out of the way and I forget it's there a lot of the time.  I don't have to worry about it getting snagged and breaking my USB port.  USB 3.1 has super fast transfer so it feels like this USB storage unit is integral to my system.  And if my main SSD does fail most of my files will be easy to transfer to another computer.  This was well worth it in my opinion.
5,Enjoy having this product to securely store confidential personal and business information. It's compact and easy to carry. I have the 128GB capacity right now and have filled it to about 2/3.  Very happy to find there is a 512GB capacity available. I plan to purchase it soon. Additionally the price of these portable drives slowly decrease over time.
4,Works as advertised but it runs hot when in use. Perhaps this is the price to be paid for the small size. Will not be using for applications with a lot of IO due to concern that it will get too hot for the host machine.
3,The transfer speed drops terrifically after more than a minute of file transfer. It starts at over 100mb/s but drops to around 60~70mb/s within 1 minute. After 2 minutes it is around 10~15mb/s and stays there. I think it is because it gets so hot in use. Apparently Scandisk's official recommendation is to wait 30 seconds after transfer before removing the drive with your bare fingers.  This happens on all 3 laptops I have (2 Windows 10 and 1 Linux) and every USB port I plug it into. I don't have the same issues with the Samsung 128Gb flash drives I have they maintain a constant 60-80mbp throughout long transfers - don't know about their 256Gb drives
5,Super good when you need resources on hand without carrying an external HD.
5,I use several USB drives for work and it continues to amaze me how much the technology-per-price continues to evolve.This drive is very portable works out of the box and has enough storage capacity to hold several of your old movies photos and personal files. Delivery came right in time. Would definitely recommend to buy these on Amazon as they are much cheaper than you would find via retail stores.
4,It will take a long time to fill this with data because the write speeds are pretty poor. It does read pretty fast though. I don't  remember the specific speeds but it was definitely more than any USB 2.0 device could ever muster. I use this in my car stereo because it has a front USB port and I wanted something that wouldn't protrude very far. This is the perfect thumb drive for that job.
4,They function great and are very convenient to have around. The only thing I noticed was that they get very warm very quickly .. after just copying half a dozen files or so they are warm to the touch. Other than that they work great.
5,I use ReadyBoost to speed up my older computer with spindle drives and the drive I've been using for a few years died.  (The excessive activity using the drive as a cache means you're getting very high write cycles so the drives wear out faster than normal use.)  I was looking for a flash drive small enough to tuck into the back of the computer without touching the wall.  This one fits perfectly and is speedy enough to boos my computer.  I highly recommend this inexpensive drive!
4,it works so far. won't transfer files over 4 gb. also the lip for attaching to keyrihgts is on the wrong side makes it a gift fit for bluray players.
5,I got this for my phone so I dont have to load up my sd card or onboard storage and the USB c to USB 3.1 adapter is bigger than the drive if only slightly. It seems like one of those "china scams" where it seems kinda unlikely but this is really 256 GB thumbdrive thats its usb plug is bigger than the actual module. I have not had any way of testing the speeds of the drive but in use its been just fine without any issues
5,I bought this product to put music on that I want to play on my truck stereo. It is small so it fits into the usb slot on my stereo without protuding where it could be hit and break off. This does the trick for me.
4,The product is still working but I've replaced it with a 512GB...same product brand/type.I used it as a daily backup tool (differential backup) for my laptop and even though it worked okay it would get very hot at times due to the large amount of backup data that required it to run 45 minutes + during each backup.  NOTE...it wasn't a consistent problem but there were many times it would lockup (stop responding) and had to be removed/reinserted during and/or after long run backup sessions.Overall...I would recommend it and feel it's a good product but you need to understand how hard and far you will be pushing it concerning run times.
5,These flash drives are small enough to be left all the time on my travel laptop. While their plastic connectors may appear fragile it just means that you should not step on them.  You cannot go wrong with SanDisk flash drives as they are both fast and reliable.
5,I have a radio in a street rod with a USB port in the front and I wanted specific music to play. This is the smallest jump drive I have ever seen and it works PERFECTLY as far as size and clarity. I did not want a jump drive sticking out the front of my radio bouncing around as I go over rough roads. This is so small you have to look close to even tell it is in the radio at all.  I ordered 2 and am very happy with my choice.  It is smaller than my thumb nail. I will order more in the near future. I got the 16gb.
5,I have bought a number of these for use as accessory bootable Linux drives using persistence. This allows you to move them from computer to computer with files and settings intact. It works great for that. The speed is adequate which is important for running an OS from it. The size is perfect for staying in the laptop side USB port without being obstructive. And the price can't be beaten. I am very pleased and would continue to buy more if needed.
1,Two out of 5 failed within the first day with the dreaded write-protected failure. I was planning on using these as boot drives for raspberry pis. Now I guess I will go back to full size thumb drives.
5,It's SanDisk! It's important to use a good brand. I've had some of the cheap off brands go bad after awhile. I use flash drives for music and I always recommend using a good name brand. Sandisk isn't the only good brand but it's among the best. This particular flash drive is so tiny I was afraid I would lose it so I actually put a plastic tie through the hole.
4,I enjoy the compact size of it and it is fast. I would caution that it is a little cheaply made and feels like you need to slide it in and our carefully or it could break.
4,Es un dispositivo muy bueno la lectura y subida de archivos ha estado dentro de los parámetros de fábrica y tiene muy buena capacidad de almacenamiento con un bajo precio siento yo. Los únicos defectos que le noté fueron que este al cabo de unos 20 min de uso se calentó bastante y además que la coraza del puerto padre del USB luce bastante frágil o débil; cosas que me preocupan puedan llegar a dañar al aparato.
5,The first time I ordered it it came to me bent so I had to send it back to get new one. The new one works great. It is small and easy to carry around. I always have mine plugged into the computer so I never lose it. Would highly recommend :D
5,Needed to find high-capacity USB storage to add to an older Android 4 TV box with only 8GB onboard and this fit the bill when nothing else worked - the box itself had an SD card slot but it wasn't reliable.  By contrast this USB drive mounted perfectly allowed for timed recording of shows from my IPTV provider and has not let me down yet despite the Android TV box itself being a bit quirky.  These would also work well for a mini PC or storage server where your configuration and setup can reside on minimal storage with little read/write hits.  I would highly recommend.
3,REAL quick.
5,Ok wait this is the smallest and fastest USB flash drive i have used. im always doing something like to send huge files from pc to pc in my office. yes i can do it with usb cable or using interent but this thing doing 3x faster than any other option. Thanks realy great product. Recommending to everyone it can be used too many ways. quality speed and low price what u need more?
3,I purchased two of these: a 16GB and a 64GB size.I guess you buy this drive for its form factor and not really for its speed. Read speed is OK but any flash drive these days will have pretty good read speeds. The write speed is what separates a good drive from a mediocre one. The write speeds of this SanDisk Ultra Fit are underwhelming. And while CrystalDiskMark reports around 20 MB/s write speeds the actual observed write speeds in Windows (when copying large files) are only about 8-10 MB/s. If you have a lot of data to write to the drive you'll be waiting a long time. Not a deal breaker for me but it is somewhat disappointing.Also in a typical SanDisk fashion the drive has less usable space than competitors' drives of the same marketed size. The 64GB SanDisk drive shows as 57.2GB in Windows. By comparison another brand name 64GB drive shows as 59.7GB in Windows.The attached CDM tests were performed on a USB 3.0 port. From what I've read the performance of this drive is no different in a USB 3.1 port which begs the question: what is the point of stating this drive is USB 3.1?
4,It's too small. Never thought I'd say that but it is easily misplaced. My older 32 GB had a cover to protect connect USB plug. This doesn't. Other than that it is fast and easy to use.
1,I am using this product for installing portable Linux operating systems. I have another USB drive for which I do the same thing with. The other one works flawlessly. This one sends the computer into boot loops sometimes and other times it works. I have a feeling that it is emulated storage of 123 GB but I don't feel like testing for this and wasting more of my time. It can be tested easily for by using tools that will fill up the flash drive and see if it does a type of buffer overflow but again I don't feel like wasting more of my time since I've already wasted enough of my time reinstalling Linux on the drive only for it to send the computer into boot loops. This is junk. DO NOT BUY!
5,These thumb drives are tiny barely larger than the USB connector itself.  But they hold a whole lot of data and they work straight out of the package.If you transfer a very large amount of data to the drive--which is likely why you purchased a large drive--can take some time.  And it is small enough that I have some concern about physically losing the drive.  But the size is one of the features of this so you do need to be prepared to keep track of it.
5,I needed some high speed extra storage on my Nvidia shield and this sandisk USB flash drive worked perfectly on it !!  I was able to move a lot of my apps to this flashdrive and free up space on the internal hard drive .
4,Super convenient and small. I frequently forget that its even on my keychain. I wasn't impressed with the performance of the encryption software so I docked a star. Otherwise it meets all other expectations
5,Storage: 32GBSize: > 1 Inch | 1/3 size of AA BatteryWorks like any other USB has some default files on it but they don't take up a lot of space. My only complaint is the excessive packaging it's just a USB and normally they can take a beating this is just ridiculous.
5,My new laptop is SSD and I run out of storage a lot. This device fits nicely on the side of my laptop and holds my music files and video files without hogging up the SSD. It works good.
5,I purchased to fit a small space and did not want the drive to protrude out of the USB port but very little. Most USB flash drives are long. I needed something which would not be bumped constantly while it was inserted. This worked very well.
5,Most USB thumb drives are much larger; this is the best value in one of the ones with a smaller footprint.  It inserts very firmly and takes some effort to remove which is good for me since normally I leave it in the USB slot of my portable computer for an extra 256gb of storage (not to mention bootable Linux).
5,Was looking to add a thumb drive to my laptop to use for Readyboost.  Yes that is still a thing in Windows.  But what I didn't want is the usual 2 1/2 inch dongle sticking out the side getting bumped all the time.  This is perfect for that purpose.  Plus since Windows only needs 4GBytes I have a little 10GByte cache to keep a few things out of the way.
4,I have only had the drive for a short time but it has worked well. Windows originally only saw it as a 32GB but I was able to use DiskPart in the command window to change the formatting to make the full 64GB available pretty easily (there are many good tutorials online.) I don’t consider that detail to have anything to do with SanDisk and believe it to be related to how windows 10 does things. The drive does run warm though and the bottom wall feels fragile but did not fail in a dozen or so uses. Otherwise it is wonderful to have such a tiny drive with big capacity.
3,I first got this SanDisk drive for transferring files to my car. I wanted something that was small and didn't stick out too far on the dash. But when it comes to transferring files it was soooo slow that I bought the Samsung Fit just to see how it does. It's a totally noticeable difference with the Samsung finishing in a fraction of the time. Both are 3.1 but I guess Samsung just uses faster memory. I'll be buying the Samsung from now one.Attached is what I was seeing in Windows for the transfer speed.
5,Sandisk hasAlways been aGood product for me.Shows full capacity when loadedLoaded movies videos and musicto 3/4 fullworks GREAT!
5,The size is really small its about the size of a dime.  Plugged it into an open port on my Windows 10 desktop and there it was ready to go.I plan to load it with music and plug it into my car and it won't be in the way at all.I have had it a few weeks now and it has performed flawlessly.  Highly recommended.
5,I bought one  about  two years ago it still works great so I got another one about two month ago.  I like the small factor and the speed for recording videos on it.  The only thing is that it can get a little hot may be it's normal because I keep it plugged in all the time.
5,Awesome
5,Perfect in my car does not stick out where it can be hit by things sitting in the cubby hole. I actually was looking for a 4-8 GB but this was the lowest capacity available. For the price I am very satisfied. It's just for music so 16 GB is just a little overkill.
1,I purchased this to store medical records. I had it delivered to my dr.s office and only used it to review the 20MB of data his staff transferred to it. a couple of weeks later I uploaded these files to the cloud and decided to repurpose the drive and reformatted the drive. Since this was a new drive I decided to do a full reformat which took and inexorable amount of time of over an hour giving me the impression that its read write rate was very bad. When I tried to transfer files to it from my PC it after a few files it stopped transferring. I tried to transfer to the same files from my PC to another drive and there were no issues. I checked it later and it came up as an unformatted drive. It seems I missed the window to return but this drive was evidently a dude from right after I transferred my medical records to the cloud drive after one data write and one reformat action.
5,I chose this item specifically to put my music library in my car. It has enough capacity to hold the entire library--no more updating my travelling collection--it all goes wherever I go. It's physical size allows me to leave it in the usb port AND use the storage compartment below it. The standard-sized flash drives always got in the way. Also if it matters it is barely visible to anyone looking for something to steal.
5,I picked up a 64GB version of one of these to store a good number of songs from my library for playback over my car's USB connection.  It's been a great little drive so far with no issues on the read or write end- and definitely no issues as far as space occupied!  Couldn't be happier with my purchase and would gladly buy another of the same drive if I had to do it all over again :).
5,Awesome USB drive size and performance.-
5,Used this in my ps5 to install ps4 games.  It works perfectly and PS4 games still load super fast even from the flash drive.  This is a perfect solution so you can save your internal hdd for ps5 games.
4,My OS picked up on it right off the bat. Great for taking pic's and files with you. Small so put it so you do not lose. Also go dust cover on computer end watch for dust.
4,Failed after 8 months of being left plugged in (you know how the product was marketed to be used). Runs way too hot and burns itself out. Don’t waste your money.
2,For a "portable" solution this drive is far too fragile... if you leave the drive in the laptop it can easily break.  And if you try to remove it regularly it breaks.  SanDisk needed to stick with it's previous design and use metal or like some other micro-drives use ALL metal.  I have had the 256GB model for less than 6 months before it developed a fracture in the plastic just between the shaft and nub.  At this price point and amount of data it is a scary venture to trust your data with.  About the only recommended use I could possibly conceive of is a once or twice use to back-up/transfer data and leave it in a secure place.  The only way I would suggest the SanDisk is if you need the larger 512GB drive and are desperate for space savings.  Otherwise if your needs are 256GB and lower go with one of the metal drives... or just pony up for an external SSD.
3,I rarely use it and when I do it's for about half an hour to an hour transferring files. So far it's worked well and hasn't died.My complaints would be heating issues and the fact it's made out of plastic. I can easily see this failing like others have mentioned. Something to consider though all of the small ones will have obvious heating issues and basically every flash drive has heating issues and will build heat even if just left in the USB drive. Every flash drive I ever had has this issue to try not to leave them in for long periods of time and if extensively using them it causes them to heat up faster.I recall reading a complaint that there were scratch marks on their drive after insertion into the port. This is to be expected even on metal jump drives as the port itself basically pinches and scraps the drives inserted. This is normal. You can even notice this on the older bulkier models of basically any brand.
5,We got this for my dad to leave in his new car stereo.  He kept hitting the one that he had and we were afraid he was going to damage the USB on the stereo so we got this one.  It is perfect it nuzzles right up to the stereo and stays way out of my dads way so no worries about the USB on it.  It is big enough to put all his music and podcasts and whatever else he wants on it.  It is what it is a Flash Drive so it does what it is supposed to do it being a SanDisk the name should speak for its quality.  Great purchase!
4,Tested okay before first use no errors... used as a storage device without a lot of interaction so far and seems to be fine.
5,We're good here.
3,I have a major brand 16 GB thumb drive it shows (14.71 GB) which is close to 15 GB and is expected for a 16 GB drive (there is always less space than expected.)  I bought this low profile drive to replace it.  However it is undersized and is not capable of holding the same data as the other drive.  Amazon was quick to rectify however as a potential buyer please do know that the user available space for this drive in my experience is lower than other 16 GB drives.  If you're not copying an existing drive this likely will not be a concern for you.  It really is low profile and attractive.
5,This is by far the best usb flashdrive for the price currently on amazon product tested. Catch the sales on high capacity.
3,Only using this to transfer files from PS4 to PC for editing and stuff.Like that it's small but it is all plastic and gets hot very quick.Takes about 20 mins for 2GB to transfer from Playstation to USB
5,Great deal for such a high capacity flash drive! SanDisk is a great brand so it isn't a surprise that this was such a high quality flash drive. The flash drive is super small (around an inch tall) so it's portable but might be easy to lose. It's best to use this if you need to keep the drive in for a long period of time like if your USB is always in your laptop. This would be a great USB due to its small size and high capacity to use for Tesla's Sentry Mode.
5,I was debating whether to get an external hard drive large capacity SD card or this. I chose this one as I'm not necessarily transferring high volume files but if I did the USB 3 speed would make it bearable. My laptop's SSD only has 128 GB to start so adding 256 more to that was very much welcomed and I can leave it in my computer and put it in my case wherever I go because it is a slim fit and does not affect the profile. Also besides just being storage you can use if for whatever you would use a usb drive for. Very versatile I would consider buying more. (but don't loose it!)
2,The device works fine and I have not had any troubles with it; however I do not like how hot the device becomes (even with minimal use).  As I recall this was relatively priced low and that was a primary consideration for me.  So I am not disappointed with the purchase but also cannot give this a high rating.
5,They definitely have the drive space along with the locking vault feature making it much sweeter. I also like that these are more "streamlined" than the other more bulkier flash drives. Not easily knocked out of ports and small enough to fit anywhere. . .which is where the other problem lies. They can be easily lost as well defeating the purpose of security. But of course they have an eyelet made onto outer end so you can insert a stringed lanyard for a better grip when carrying or "wrapping" in a secure location. I will always be a supporter of this product.
5,This is the absolute best flash drive ever! It doesn't stick out too far. I've tried a dozen and ruined a usb port due to bumping sideways. This is very low profile and stays put. I won't use any other kind.
5,Good price and quality
5,I bought this shortened thumb drive because the regular ones kept catching on things every time I moved my laptop. This one doesn't catch on things.
4,I use it as extra storage for my Nvidia Shield to store my recorded shows.
4,Overall a good USB. However if you intend to use this for a homebrew Wii look elsewhere. Even when the Wii is properly formatted and compatible with other USB drivers this one loads games very inconsistently (3/4's of a time to a black screen).
5,Delivered early and protected. I really love this device. I wish they made larger capacity drives: 1TB+ . It is best product made by a reputable company. Although it is perfect I wish the company would include the durable small chord that easily thread through the opening at the end of the drive to facilitate storage when not in use. I know it exists on the market but it would be great if it was included with the purchase. Love this device. It is so small that I often forget that it is there but it is so small that you can store it away in the laptop with creating problems or damaging the device or the laptop.
5,Its a quick transfer flashdrive that will not get in your way and will not empty your wallet whats not to like? Be warned though it gets extremely hot so make sure you do not abuse it or keep it plugged in as it will naturally heat up.
3,It's simply too small and too delicate.  If you plug it in and out over time the thin plastic walls will almost certainly crack.  This drive is far far better suited as a plug and leave in order to extend a device's existing storage capacity.  It's small and dependable which makes it great for extending a small laptop drive tablet router or firestick type device.  It certainly has it's place but not as a mobile drive for mobile go with the SAMSUNG BAR Plus same inside armor plated outside.
5,This is my first 3.1 USB it worked great! I recently moved from a work laptop to a work station and I was able to transfer all my files to a great speed over 58GB.I was used to the 2.0 speed you can imagine the filling.My eyes almost pop out when I saw the bar going to an awesome speed to me do this purchase it's definitely worth it.  YES I RECOMMEND IT TO YOU!
4,It was too small. Very hard to handle putting it in some devices.
2,El articulo devueltopor segunda ves el lunes27 de junio.
5,Great SanDisk product work perfect from zero no need to format. In the USB 3.1 of my laptop the transfer rate is fast as expected. The small design is great too maybe for some people too small (my wife is looking for a cable or something like it to avoid losing it).
5,Very nice small footprint fast data transfer and good size for the priceThese are wonderful compared to the Big sticksFor anyone who uses flash drives to transfer files or install operating systems these are really greatthe best thing aside from the fast data transfer is how small they are and how wonderful it is to have something that only sticks out a tiny bit past the USB portAwesome for using in the car audio systemI'm not constantly hitting the USB stick and damaging it or the port like I used to when the stick stuck out 5 inchesWay to go Sandisk
5,Purchased to replace a smaller flashdrive.Works very well and I feel it was worth the purchase.
5,Size is the best feature and it’s as good as it can get. Only complain is it gets hot super fast and very snug fit and I have to force it to fit in the standard USB port.
5,I saw all the bad reviews and pictures but this was the the size (dimensions wise) that I wanted so I thought I would give it a try I’m glad I did it has not  failed me or fell apart.
5,I bought this to allow for storage and backups of my new laptop. Having this much storage in such a small form factor allows me to keep the thumb drive plugged into my laptop without it getting caught on things or banged around. I was able to set my backup client to backup to a chosen folder on the drive and auto backup each day. Works great I changed the default folder locations for my pictures documents and downloads to the thumb drive and all works perfectly. I am even installing some applications to it to save resources for higher priority applications.If you need extra space in a small package this is the best way to go.
2,I'm not understanding how this 16GB stick is allowed to be called a USB 3.1 device. I've tried multiple times now copying over files the speed keeps fluctuating between 4.5 and 16 MBp/s every second. If I pop in a cheap Microcenter stick of the exact same capacity in the same port and copy the exact same files it's still fluctuating but flying at 18 and 34 MBp/s.I know that it's cheap it's ridiculously small it's plastic and it was $7 but it is NOT USB 3.1. Maybe I got a faulty maybe it's just fail-safing to the slower designation who who knows what. But I'm exchanging it and if the next one is better I'll update this.Update 2020-06-28New drive arrived same USB 3 port as before same 13.1 GB folder of files same flakey write speeds if not slightly slower. This is exactly why I usually don't bother with SanDisk: I'm simply paying for the name their domination of store shelves and a flashy presentation. However their offerings for the compact form factor is nice. I'm leaving the review at two stars for misleading presentation of speeds.
3,I really like it's small and compact and don't have to worry about knocking the thing off your laptop by accident or even worse breaking off. But the only gripe I have with this tiny thing is that it gets incredibly hot after just a few minutes. I haven't even used 1 gig of it and when I took it out I couldn't hold it between my fingers for longer than 2 seconds!If they would have constructed this out of metal it might have fared better as far as heat dissipation I'm just hoping the plastic won't melt gradually over time or something keeping my fingers crossed on this one.
4,Picked up this drive for sentry mode/dashcam recording in a Model 3 but the drive continously fails with the car stating that it does not meet the required writing speeds of 4 MB/s. Some footage would be recorded some footage would be corrupt and other times it would fail entirely.May work great as a standard USB drive but it falls-flat for sentry mode.
5,It is perfect for me. I use it in my car for music storage. I have thousands of songs on it and only use a tiny percentage of its capacity. And it’s so small that I don’t worry about it getting knocked around.
5,nice
5,This is the first one of these I've had that has a housing that's all plastic so we'll see if there are any longevity problems.  I'm using it to hold my music collection and some videos for use with a Micca player.  Works great and if there are any longevity problems I'll amend my review.
5,This USB flash drive is very small (physically) and performs very well especially for read access.Write access can be reasonable but once you go to re-writing the performance does drop compared to the best USB 3.0 drives I have.  However it is clearly far better than most USB flash drives.The 256GB model was a welcome addition since I needed a physically small drive of this capacity.I had to add my own small strap to the drive in order to make it easier to pull out of where it plugs in due to it being hard to get access to that location.  (Not the flash drive's fault - just other obstructions in the way)
5,So small. If you small storage this is it.
4,Good price and a very convenient device.128 Gb is a good size.If I need more storage I will buy more.
5,I bought a few of these to add as storage to the various routers I have around the house.  I tend to run a chroot'd version of Debian Linux on all my routers (as well as DD-WRT and entware).I bought these as storage as again I run Debian on my routers.  128GB in a low factor USB stick is great and plenty for running any Debian.I haven't had any issues with these to date.  I need to purchase a few more tbh :)
5,I have been using it for 6 months on dashcam and despite other products that my car gives an error after a while this one works like magic
5,Some are saying it’s hard to connect this drive to an OTG Adapter. It can sometimes be a very tight fit. You’re Probably not using enough force to insert the flash drive. Also make sure you’re inserting the contacts in the right orientation.
5,All USB 3.0 flash drives this size have disappointed me. My new tiny Lexar 128GB was dead on arrival full of bad sectors. I bought 1 SanDisk 128GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive and WOW!!! Holly Molly! This thing is super-fast in writing not just reading and it is CHEAP. I can not say how many MB/sec it can write but a full 2GB movie gets transferred in less than a minute if your pc has a USB 3.0 port as well. I'm getting a dozen of them
5,Thanks to Amazon customer service -Samsung never answered any of my questions or requests- I was able to get this little thumb USB memory.  It works for what it is: Extra memory for my brand new Dell notebook.  Speed is good but not great.  For storage so far it has been very reliable.
1,I bought it for my Tesla Sentry mode and camera storage as it was recommended.  Less than a year it started to get "slow" and then it completely died and would no longer mount in the Tesla my Mac or a PC.  Even had my IT guy try to reformat and save it and he came back and said it was toast.
5,Great form factor for my router. Super fast. Did notice it got warm.
5,Bought to use as a windows system backup. Almost too small.
4,It fits and works as it should but I only wish it laid flatter against my computer.  I am worried it will mess up the port if it is plugged in all the time since it sticks out farther then planned.  However I love how it can go on a key chain because of the extra lop...it just needs a dust cover then.
5,I am a university student who wanted to add a bit more secure storage to my computer and this is perfect! It fits really well in my Mac book Pro Retina 13inch. Mine doesn't have a light (or I haven't noticed it) and that doesn't bother me. It stores the files well and I love that when you first plug it in it comes with directions for how to password protect files you save to it in case you ever need to do that. Overall it is fantastic so far it's only been a couple days since I bought it but seems like it will hold up as well as all my other SanDisk purchases. Love the brand.
4,It gets way too hot as others have mentioned. Be sure to plug it into a USB 3.1 Gen 2 port - only then does it perform the 30 seconds 1-2 GB write magic. If whatever you are copying is bigger than that (be it multiple small files) let's say 2-31GB then it performs as good as a USB 2.0 drive. I would recommend splitting up the files in smaller chunks and copying them one by one otherwise it's not going to be very fast. For something with a higher sustained write speed you better look elsewhere.
5,I wanted a USB flash drive for my laptop but all I had were ones with the body of the drive extends out from the connector.  This one is perfect for a laptop.  It does not extend out from the USB connector hardly at all.  No bigger than the transmitters used for a cordless mouse.  Now I don't have to worry about moving the laptop and accidentally hitting the flash drive against a solid object and damaging the port on the laptop.  A great removable storage option for any laptop.
2,The portion that goes in the USB port is thin plastic.  It is definitely not made for the type of handling I would expect a USB drive to typically receive during transport.  If I had realized it was plastic before I opened it I would have sent it back.
5,I was looking for a small flash drive for my laptop that didn't stick out like most do...I tend to bump and bend them!This is perfect! Fits snugly into the slot never in the way lots of memory in this little flash drive!
5,The memory is great the price and the amount of storage the only little issue I have is that it can get a little heated after using it  for a certain period of time (No where near as previous version does but still a little bit) but is not a big of an issue. I've test this drive with almost everything from transferring files big and small to playing games and running a Full Windows from it (At this time I'm writing this using Google Chrome on Windows 10 running from this USB drive) and this would've been perfect if it had a metal built but still this is a good buy
5,Just a quick review. I searched between a few different drives before I settled on this one. I have had no issues and I have used this drive for about 4-5 months. I use it in a USB 3.0 slot and the speeds are hit or miss sometimes but that doesn't bother me so much. I use it heavily for music movies and tv shows. It's been durable for me. I currently own and use 2 of these and both have been perfect. As I said before I use them heavily and they have stood up to the challenge. Great drive here!
5,Bought this as an extra. So far so good.
5,Just received the micro thumb drive and it is amazingly small. Literally as long as a US penny is wide.  Holds an amazing amount of information put 16 short training dvd videos on it and still have 226 gb free. I'll have to attach it to something like keychain or such so as to not to lose it as it is soo tiny which is awesome!
5,After purchasing the 128Gbyte stick I was so pleased I invested in another four 512Gbyte sticks.  Great product.  Fast...Plug N'play...Comes formated and ready to use.  I have stored everything from videos to personal music and have not had any loss of data over heating or issues 'locking up'.
5,When I saw this model thumb drive I had to get one to try.  I'll use this to store music files on the I can play back in my car.  This size configuration will be less prone to damage where it has to be plugged into the USB port in my car.  Typical thumb drives stick out and are exposed which makes them easy to hit and break.  This new one is so compact it should not suffer a breakage as the others can.
5,The SanDisk 128GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive is a very convenient storage solution for my laptop.  It's low profile and relatively fast speed are a good combination to give a portable device extra storage.
5,compactness in every aspect of the device
5,I bought this thumb drive to store music files on to listen to in my car stereo.  It works perfectly for this and I have never noticed any lag or delays in navigating from album to album or song to song.  A great value.I do have one quibble however - this drive is so tiny that it is very easy to misplace or lose entirely.  Keep your eye on it!
5,I bought this as music storage for use in my car. Perfect low profile method.
5,Work with blink module 2. Easy just plug and play.
4,Haven't put any files on their drive yet but I'm a bit surprised at the actual useable capacity. I realize hard drives and other storage devices are never capable of the full capacity that is stated but...a 128gb drive with 114gb useable? Really? That's quite a difference. Id understand a gig or two but 14? Hmm.Edit: I have this drive full and it's working well so far.
5,I thought it was a mistake when I received it it was so small I didn't think it would fit the port. I can't believe how so much data can go on something this small. Highly recommend!
5,It's a thumb drive. It works great!Lower profile is nicer for my laptop. I can keep it connected or at least not be as worried about it if on the move with my laptop.
5,buen almacenamiento
4,This flash drive is fantastic. It does get hot pretty quickly but it gets the job done. One concern is that it is way small. You need to make sure you have a safe place to keep it or you would lose it immediately. I was looking for a flash drive with a ton of storage similar to a hard drive without paying the price of a hard drive. If that is what you are looking for this is the perfect thing for you!
4,This is basically a good price for some good USB flash memory with one great advantage — its size. I just bought a new car and it doesn't have a CD/DVD player. The way one is supposed to listen to music is to plug a flash drive into a USB socket in the bin in the center console. Presuming other stuff is slopping around in that bin that leaves the flash drive vulnerable to collisions with other stuff. This memory is so small that competition for space is a non-problem.
3,While I do like the miniature size that can be used in my car radio copying music files to it went extremely slow.  The speed does not come close to any of my other "regular" sized USB 3.0 devices.  It ranged between 377KB/s - 13MB/s that's it.  The only reason I am keeping it for now is because of its size.  This device should not be used for frequent transfers.
5,Buen producto en general
4,Speed of recording and transfer is good for this mini flash drive but do yourself a favor make sure you attach something to it so you don't loose it so easily.  I find that most zip ties work well and are strong enough to handle just being in you pocket.  Just a little tip for all the college students out there.
4,At a first glance in the package after receiving it it looked very fragile.  I was affraid I'd break it or damaged it while opening the package.  The performance is good enough for my Nvidia shield.  The 4 stars is because of how hot this thing gets just being plugged in even when it's not being used!  I really don't understand why it gets so hot just being plugged in.  It seems like a defect of some type.  I'm glad I bought the 2-year insurance protection in case something happens to it!
4,Great product
5,My Jaguar XF has a very limited space in which to insert an USB for music and most sticks are either too long or seem to be bent when inserting. This works like a charm. Almost invisible too and leaves more room in the small console for other "stuff".
4,I purchased this SanDisk 256GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive for a raspberry pi project. I knew it wasn't metal but I didn't expect it to be so flimsy. I feel like I could literally smash this between my fingers. After reading reviews I knew what to expect but I was still surprised. It shouldn't be moved once the project is done so it shouldn't be a huge issue for me but still not 5 star worthy.
5,I run linux a lot mainly arch as my installed linux. I also use tails and kali for handling sensitive client data as well as legal penetration testing respectively as one of my jobs and have each installed on one of these.Some tiny USB devices like this have broke in my laptops in the past. These however are rather solid. The storage is more than enough for what I need and the speeds are very good in the proper USB ports.
5,I needed a flash drive for the sentry mode (security cameras surrounding my Tesla) and this was recommended on a forum I follow.  It is compact and does the job well! I'm happy with my purchase.
5,Heard a lot about this little gadget but all was wrong. It holds my music very well and the play ▶️ back is excellent when it comes to the skipping like on some flash drive this one has yet to skip.
4,It is working okay... It is fast as expected. However i am a bit worried about the build because before I thought the insertion part is powder coated metal but it is actually plastic which can be less durable for long term use. I have used the previous model as well (usb 3.0) it was working well for about 4 years until one day it became read-only (could not cut-copy-paste in the drive). May be there is a life cycle of these usb drive... Which is a bit frustrating. But I will see for this one.
5,After "unformatting" (deleting the partitions) the drive with the "Computer Management" program on Windows 10 the Xbox recognized the drive for game storage and was able to format it as such. You might need to unplug the drive and re-plug it in after the console "formats" it for game use.
5,Es buenisimaaaa
3,I didn't catch this when ordering but as someone has noted this drive is plastic! It's very light very flimsy and gets very hot in use. I would only recommend it for use in a location that will see more or less permanent placement - i.e. a car. I have an older version that is metal and much sturdier. However the newer plastic version is about half the price of the metal one.
3,Meh $80 for there's no cover cap so careful to store it in a bag when it's not in use to prevent lint and dust from entering.  Instead of using a metal connector which would conduct heat away from the flash memory and also provide shielding SanDisk in their "wisdom" went with a black carbon fiber or plastic cover which deforms if you press on it!  Yes that's right the connector is somewhat soft.  Imagine not being careful when inserting it in a USB slot without looking and breaking it.I can understand trying to save a few cents here and there but this is supposed to be their top of the line 256G USB 3 thumbdrive why did SanDisk cheap out is beyond me.I still have the older 128G model and that came with a cover and the connector wasn't plastic.Also the USB connector is made of PLASTIC and it's squishy.  If you're not careful when inserting it you'll damage it.Pros: it's relatively fast not very but ok.  And yes it's 256G.
1,Initially I was happy with the product. When I first got it I transferred a couple of very small files over to the flash drive and it worked fine. A couple months later I went to back up some import documents of mine before performing a fresh install of my operating system. I wanted to move about 5 GB of personal files onto the flash drive. This is a very small amount compared to the overall storage capacity of the device.Several minutes in to transferring these files and it had slowed down to a ridiculous halt. At one point it was bouncing back and forth between 4 and 5 KB/s. You read that correct. That is not a typo. 4 and 5 Kb/s through a USB 3.0 port or about 10% of the speed of the dial up internet your parents had in the 90's. I felt the device and it was incredibly hot to the touch.I stopped the transfer and removed it and let it cool down for several hours before trying again this time a smaller amount of files at a time. This time it moved at around 50-70 KB/s as you'll see in my attached screenshot about the same speed as dial up internet. The device was still way too hot to the touch. I tried it in different ports and different computers same result. I remember reading about an overheating issue before I purchased it and I wish I would have. I know have a $20 USB port plug as I won't be using it any more. I will find a replacement.I am a Software Developer for the State of Missouri and have worked with computers all my life. I wouldn't ever purchase this product again or recommend anyone else to do so.
5,This is the largest  USB drive that I have purchased to date. It's amazing how much stuff you can fit on such a tiny device these days. I use it for all kinds of movie transfers and sharing things with family members. It's easy to transport common for at least 30. My only complaint would be that it doesn't come with some sort of a carrying case like most of the ones this size do so it makes it super easy to lose if you don't tie a string to it or something
5,I use this for my Tesla model Y to store the sentry mode and camera video footage. Followed the directions from the Tesla user manual to format it beforehand. It is so small and does not protrude out that much at all works great so far.
5,I got several of these drives to use as backups for my backup drive.  You can put a lot of stuff on one of these drives.  If I were to complain I'd mention there is no dust cover.  I suppose technology will get better and these small drives will have more capacity.  I'll be happy when they do.
5,It is small enough to put in the
1,So many of the reviews say that this thing is plastic and that it will break. I thought not. It's brand-name hardware after all. Well not so. After precisely five weeks of use -- and by use i mean: it was plugged into my laptop and left there for the duration sort of functioning as a secondary hard drive -- I pulled it out to plug in a printer and boink! It broke. The plastic case just sort of flaked apart. That sucks. I understand that this model used to be made out of steel. Well switching to plastic seems like it was a bad move by Sandisk. And it is a shame that this broke just days after the return window at Amazon closed. I will say this kind of sums it all up: Grrrrrrrr. Be forewarned! Buy something else!
5,Plugged it in and had 128 gig of space.  No setup it just worked.My SSD drive has plenty of space but wanted a large capacity thumb drive for storing video content and playing on TV.Will buy again may get a 256 next time.
5,It's as small as it looks which can be a positive or a negative depending on your needs. But it is plug and play and holds a ton of information. Came right away as expected.
4,I've been using this to store the data from my Tesla cam. It works like a USB drive should and its small so its not sticking out of the USB port and getting in the way of whatever else you have in the center console.--Update--After less than a year of use the thumb drive randomly disappears from the Tesla.
5,The easy way to add additional storage to my 65 inch Android TV.
5,It met my needs to down load a few videos to travel with.
5,Small and compact - great storage
5,Great price for a USB3.1 drive. This is a cheap and easy way to increase the storage capacity of your laptop. My father-in-law bought this for his laptop and I might get another one for myself. It works well. The small size allow s you to just leave it attached to your laptop all the time without fear of accidentally knocking it out.
2,This drive worked great for the whole year it lasted. I did use the drive a lot and I think the heat is probably what killed it. The drive would get very hot when in use and I used it heavily.One day in the middle of a file transfer it just stopped working. I tried to chkdsk it but it just kept freezing up the computer.The speeds were great and the form factor was nice and small probably too small it was a pain to pull out from behind the computer at times
2,Made with plastic. Broken easily...
2,I like that the item is small and very easy to use what I do not like is if you have it plugged in after 5 mintues it heats up to such a high temperature that I really cant touch it
4,Nice small size only sticks out of the laptop a bit.  Very good price for the size: about $60 for 256 Gbyte.The test program I used can read at about 110 Mbyte/sec which is pretty good.  However when writing the speed is disappointing.  It starts at 57 Mbyte/sec but after a minute it goes down to below 20 Mbyte/sec eventually averaging at 15 Mbyte/sec.  Filling the whole drive takes four hours. And that's with large files copying pictures (5 Mbyte each) the write speed goes down to 10 Mbyte/sec.
5,This is the fastest biggest flashdrive I have owned yet.  The USB 4.0 is a great improvement over 2.0 and 3.0.  The price of this flashdrive is the best for the size!  I also love how compact it is.  I recommend getting a keychain for it so you don't lose it.  I do not recommend putting it on a heavy key ring because the weight can damage your USB port over time.
1,The drive overheats. It failed after about 7 month of almost no use. It got locked in the "read only" mode. I'd recommend to pass on it.
5,You'll only get about 235 gigabytes out of it but it really is small. Ideal for hiding valuable files offline.
4,This is a great drive overall. One thing to watch out for is accidentally dismounting it while transferring files - it’ll crash the drive and you’ll need to run recovery software to get access. In general it’s amazing for its size just be careful with it and be sure you eject properly.
2,Product description states this is a USB 3.1 device.  Transfering 200GB of files from my Laptop to this drive was very slow taking several hours.  I also tested this device on another laptop with a solid state hard drive with only a small increase in the transfer rate.  This does not operate at USB 3.0 speeds using a USB SS port!
5,Great low profile 128 GB USB 3.1 flash drive.  Fast speed in an extremely small package that measures 0.75 x 0.63 x 0.35 inches and weighs only .05 ounces.  It is so small I usually just leave it in my computer vs. carrying it separatelyI bought this high quality product for under $20 and feel like it was a good deal.If you have found my review helpful please click the button below to let me know! Thanks!
4,I thought it was cool but I ordered a 3.1 instead of a 2.0 and I'm disappointed that they had to alter the size of 3.0 USB devices like seriously is that nessacary. Although I did get a very quick refund for this within 3 days so I was happy. But cool little device for those that need it.Go a 2.0 32gb for 8 dollars free shipping and literally was marked express air shipping so it works nicely
5,I dont know how they fit so much onto such a small decice but it holds everything it says it does and is super fast. Only problem is that it gets lost in the usb door to my xbox 360. Being so small i put a key ring on it to help keep from losing it. Bu it works great on my laptop and for moving data. Definatly worth it if you need a good drive that holds a quarter of a terabyte.
1,Like the title says this was a wonderful little device. Loads of space small form factor.Until that is the cheap flimsy plastic casing split off in my computer.I can't recommend enough that you AVOID this drive and get one with a metal port.
4,I've added this to my PC for Ready Boost purposes (whole drive).It's a nice "add and forget about later on" item it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb like most "thumb drives" do (giant rectangle shape ones).Recommend purchasing one of these for Ready Boost /html bookmarks backup/software license(s) storage  (numbers) use.Getting a couple more of these for those very purposes. Good investment.
5,I use this to store and play music in my vehicle. It's plugged into the usb port of a bluetooth device that allows music to be played via an FM station. It works great!
5,These are so small you can install them and forget about them.  Then just use them as an extra hard drive.  Heck at 1/2 and TB they are WAY more than  just a spare jump drive.
5,As a non-technical person I have been impressed with the latest technology. The price seemed to be fair. The only downside I have had so far is portability and storage as it could easily be lost unless one puts a tag on it.
2,The insert part is made of non durable plastic and not metal and can easily break with repeated usage.
5,Looks like a dongle but with a ton of storage. I don't move this from device to device so I am unsure how "portable" it is but I can plug it into a USB port on the laptop and it's nigh-unnoticeable
4,These earbuds are great especially for someone with small ears. They fit snug. I am not concerned about them fall out of my ears. The sound is also good.
5,Perfect size and very fast.  I had to partition it into 128gb sections so radio can handle it.
3,This drive has a great design and works great but it is made of cheap and fragile plastic. Mine broke into pieces after I left it in the MacBook and carried it in my bag once.
5,Bought this to expand my storage on my firestick 4k worked like a charm. Plus the price was right.👍
4,Lo compré para escuchar música en mi auto lamentablemente no podía leer la música tal vez por ser demasiada mi estéreo.Pero funciona muy bien con otro aparato para música y debido a su tamaño pequeño ni se ve.Lo recomiendo aunque aún no tengo mucho tiempo con el tal vez después actualice mi reseña.
4,A leave in drive convenience. Very useful
1,I purchases this a few months ago but recently is has gone into a read-only mode. And per SanDisk this can't be fixed but rather processed for return under warranty. I have some sensitive documents that are still on here and do to the read-only I cannot wipe it before sending it in for replacement. Once I hear back from support in regards to how they plan to fix this I will update this review.
5,Good price good delivery excellent performance.I had bought a SanDisk Cruzer Fit SDCZ33 64GB but my Tesla Model 3 webcam complaint the speed is too slow.  Do I bought this Ultra Fit 3.1 64GB and it is happy now.  I tried to copy a 1.1GB file to SDCZ33 and it took almost 8 mintes while Ultra Fit took merely 20 seconds.  I even could not clock the copying process for a 26MB file with Ultra Fit drive.
5,It's fast. It works well. Exactly what i was looking for.
5,It makes a perfect back up source.
5,I purchased this for $15.19 I like how small it is I bought it so I could easily put music in it and plug it in to my SUV without being inconvenient my tray. Right now I use it for my Mac book Pro and it doesn't protrude unnoticeable and easy to put in bag and travel with.
4,Fair warning if you're playing even 1080P video from these on a Raspberry Pi to your TV they get H-O-T. As a Storage device they work great.
5,Easy to use multiple uses I bought TWO for my BLINK diy camera system for backup in the included module.  Already tested and they are better than the cloud.  I always have my videos stored in case of emergency yeah
3,These are great for small storage needs not as a boot drive for TrueNAS. I originally had two of these as a mirrored boot for TrueNAS. I've had two fail in the course of 6 months. I've now moved that task to SSDs.I can't speak to their use as a common USB storage device. But I'm giving these a 3 for the use case that I had.
3,Bought this to use for my Tesla dash cam and sentry mode footage. Worked great until it permanently locked up. It’s now write protected and I can’t get it out of that state so it’s useless now.
5,Very small size easy to install large amount of storage
2,I purchased two of these and after about 2 months one has already failed.  They are cheap (and should be) but still they should last longer than 2 mos.  Thing seems to be a totally dead and it's not worth the effort to return.  I bought a Samsung as a replacement.
5,Amazingly small........more so than anticipated
2,The plastic on both my thumb drives broke. On one of them the plastic is cracked making it difficult to insert into the computer. The other on broke leaving it's broken piece in the computer USB slot and I've not been able to insert any other USB into the socket. I have been unable to get the plastic out of the USB slot and hopeful a repair shop can get it out.One of the two drives was no problem but the other would randomly remount which caused problems if I were running Lightroom or other programs from it.
5,Big storage in a small space...I love the physical size of this drive.  I have a MateBook X and a Thule Gauntlet 13 case... the MateBook fits perfectly in that case with this SanDisk drive attacked. Being a 3.1 drive it is fast especially if you have 3.1 port... even a 3.0 port is snappy with this little drive.  So the quick version is this... speedy low profile driveOne thing I have noticed is that this drive has a tendency to get hot.
5,flawless. perfect right price do NOT buy external drives they corrupt so easily and your data is GONE for good these are great. Ive tried external 1-3TB drives ALL failed within months.. and I have lost 20 years of graphics and programming work. these are perfect i bought 5 so far.
5,I really like these little drives. I have them in several devices full of music pictures & videos. I like how small they are & the fact they don't have a light in them. You really don't see them hanging out of the car's stereo or the Blu-ray player. I also use them as a backup of important documents that I have on my personal & work computers. I have several different sizes and have had zero issues.
5,Quality item fast shipping.
5,Exactly what was needed.
5,Meets the disk requirements for 2019 Honda navigation updates.  I bought and tried 2 other USB drives before I found one that worked.  The others met the specs that Honda listed but this was the only one that actually worked.  It's great to be able to update maps at home and sure beats paying the dealer!
5,It’s usb memory. It’s tiny. The description was accurate. It actually shipped a day early. Thanks.
5,Inexpensive and functional. "It just works." No it's not the fastest kid on the block or the one with the most capacity. It's just serviceable storage at a bargain price and great for small backups portability of small to medium file sets and so on. The only downside is that there's really no way to physically label it other than with a permanent marker but that's the tradeoff for its small physical size. Also no way to put it on a chain so it doesn't get lost. But I still give it 5 stars for excellent value.
5,We needed this for photo storage and it is perfect.  So easy to use!
5,It's very small durable and has a very large memory capacity - what fits my needs. I like SanDisk because I like flash drives that are durable and this one meets the mark.
5,Very satisfied. The 256GB model is a pretty high capacity for a good price and it’s about the size of a thumbnail. The low profile and relatively high storage make a good combo.
5,Love it; broke my last drive when my dog knocked my computer off the couch. This one barely sticks out so if the dog gets wild again my drive won’t break!
2,No longer metal.  Thin cheap plastic.  No longer has a mini case/cover.  Wish I had never bought it.Just leaving this more as a reminder to myself to not buy this one again.
5,I love this drive very small and portable packs a punch
5,Size and capacity are very satisfactory for my need. I rip a lot of CD's and bring them in my car to listen to. Plus I have a few extra  USB 128 ggb's  for backup and spares.
4,Works great but I dislike the thin plastic USB port. I plan to leave it in my laptop but I feel that the plastic may break if I take the drive out to many times it even if I hit the drive while it's inserted. That said the speed is great and I love the small size. It sicks out about 1/4 inch.
4,Esta pequeña trabaja perfectamente lo unico que recomendaria es colocarla en un llavero o amarrarle algo porque se puede perder facilmente por su tamaño tan diminuto. Recomendado.
3,I'm glad that I made this purchase because I needed to have a fairly decent amount of space to move and transport my music and video files without extending too far out from my device increasing the break risk. The downside to this product is that it's made of plastic cheap plastic. It doesn't withstand any pressure from me lightly pressing it down when I grip it. While this may been seen as a good thing to some it just feels cheap and I almost feel like my files have a higher potential of being lost since it's not made of a heavier material.
4,Small drive works very well. Does get a bit warm. Purchased two. Currently using one in a static storage capacity for a raspberry pi. It has worked well thus far!Wife is using the other to store photos and some artwork on for backup purposes. Works well for this too. Transfer speeds are great.
5,Good product by SanDisk still works. no issues.
5,The first one I received did not work. Neither my Mac or PC would recognize the stupid thing. I literally spent 2 hours researching and resetting my smc making sure in utilities the usb drives were there and then finally I gave up. Contacted amazon and got the new one today and works like a charm. Plug and play didn't even have to format for Mac. Love the secure access vault (Kids are nosey you know)! At this point it's getting 5 stars because Amazon rocked in replacing it and I'm just happy the the darn thing works. If it decides to not play nice I'll update my review.
4,Purchased to use as a storage device for my Tesla Model X sentrycam footage. It worked for a few days but the car then repeatedly alerted that out was too slow.  I replaced with a higher performance micro SD card made for video and a rocketek reader
5,I wanted a USB drive to use specially for my photos and important documents. In case heaven forbid there's ever a fire I can just grab it and go. I know you can upload files to "the cloud" but that takes time. It's so much easier to simply save the pictures to the USB drive. It's small enough that it doesn't get in the way while I'm using my laptop which is the main reason I purchased this one. It sticks out no further than the USB plug for my wireless mouse. I'm actually planning on purchasing one for my husband.
5,I had TWO defective Samsung's and a PNY that was terrible slow before I bought this. Bought the others base on specs and form factor. Mistakes and I should have known. Only thing that caused me to pause was the form factor and fact the insertion "barrel??" is plastic. I really preferred the other designs but design mean nothing without performance and reliability. This has both.
5,These work well. They do include the SanDisk security software to protect & lock the data on the drive.
5,This SanDisk is small for the amount of storage. It has a pretty big space to attach a key chain or charm on it so that you don't lose it.
5,This isn't the fastest flash drive in the world and does get a little warm when you are writing to it but it doubled the space on my SSD laptop by simply plugging it in.  Now I can free up disk space for important stuff while keeping my media (mostly music and movies) on this thing.  And down the road when the laptop inevitably dies switching the media over to the new laptop will take me 10 seconds.  Definitely a must have if you have a solid state laptop and still like to have media stored instead of streaming everything.
5,I have an older computer so I purchased a FedSmart USB C PCIe board. I plugged in this SanDisk and it was recognized right away. Here are my speed disk results. They compare favorable to other results posted here so I am pleased. This is a big improvement over my old USB 2 speed. Where did the other 14 gig go? Who knows and who cares at this price. It still a great purchase with lots of bang for your buck. You can't beat SanDisk for reliability.
1,Didn't really have any need to try it until way past the return period. I mean what can go bad with a little SanDisk flash drive right? Wrong. I tried it in a couple of different computers and it was never recognized. It got hotter than a firecracker but never worked.
3,The speed is wonderful for this flash drive. Videos transfer really fast. My only complaint is brand new the drive only shows 460GB capacity? I'm a little sad as I bought the 512GB?
3,This drive has been in a word ok. It is fast enough for file transfer duty but I do not feel comfortable moving it frequently because the plastic is so flimsy. it is already badly scratched from moving it to and from a couple usb ports for file transfer. It looks like the plastic is getting shaved away or cut into so the drive will not last very long. Also it gets very hot. Not a big deal for me except I worry it is exaserbating the weak cheap plastic worries I already have about this drive. Honestly I like it well enough except for the plastic. If it was not plastic all arround it would get a lot more use. I would suggest using it for a static application like in a retro console like a snes or static storage on an nvidia sheild or something like that.
4,We have a solid state travel laptop. This little flash drive provides the equivalent of a decent-sized hard drive. It's slower than a real hard drive or an on-board flash drive but for a travel laptop it's plenty fast works like a charm and doesn't stick out much. I only trust a handful of flash drive brands because I'm using them to store photographcs that can't be replaced and SanDisk stands at the top of that short list for reliable flash drives.
5,great device  very dependable
5,i like it
5,Works well and have only filled it half
4,This thing is perfect and compact which I love but the plastic loop I am afraid is going to break any minute and is not big enough and is awkwardly placed (which is why I give it a 4) so it's incredibly difficult to put on a keychain and I am almost positive I will lose it within the next few months! :P The low profile and massive storage size are amazing and the transfer speed is great.
5,I got this because I got tired of breaking flash drives because I'm clumsy. The low profile makes it super easy to avoid bumping and damaging the stick. Highly recommend. Very fast too.
5,This tiny little drive is fast to transfer in and out of and has a lot of room for storage.  Price was good and the performance is better.  It is also backward compatible with my older computers USB ports.  SanDisk has always worked well for me and I have confidence in their quality.
5,If you have seen the melted plastic and broken in my USB port review's on this productjust know that you don't need to worry about those issues if you're careful with your device!Otherwise It has a lot of storage in such a COMPACT size!So it's a great device depending on how you use it.
5,I have had other usb that were unreliable  and loose data or have  am intermittent connection. Sticks out a litter more than I expected but is easy to remove. Recommended value item. Used for several months with zero data failure rate. Would recommend usb 3 version but this does the job for affordable data storage.
5,I bought two of these devices. One was for my RetroPie setup so that I can put tons of roms on it. The other was a backup for my other Raspberry Pis. Since I'm using the backup one only for backup purposes I can't speak too much on the speed. It backs up overnight and ready to go the next day. I saw some reviews on here about the heat. It does heat up but if I pulled this out I would hold it by the outside plastic. I wouldn't touch the metal because of course that would be hot
4,It just work
5,A great product at a reasonable price. No regrets.
5,Good price and trusted brand
4,I use this as sort of a second hard drive on my MBP (2014). Does a nice job but sometimes mounts and unmount unexpectedly. Might be the MBP might be the drive. But doesn't add to the footprint so i'm happy with it.
4,Works great surprisingly small.  But unit seems to heat up easily.  This maybe from my laptop computer.
5,I bought this to enable Sentry and dash am clips in my car and it works great. How do these flash drives work when they are so small? The whole thing seems to be plastic but as I’m not going to be inserting/removing it often that won’t be a problem for me.
5,I bought one a year earlier and another few month ago because it just works fine. It's true there's a flimsy piece on one of the sides but it never broke since I don't mess with it. I love how tiny it is but how much data it ends up holding.
2,Since you can only format this memory stick to the newer file format it will not work for an Amazon 4k fire stick as they require a fat32 file system.  Otherwise its a great memory stick
5,I used this flash drive to hold a copy of some of my extensive music library and play it through my Samsung DVD Home Theater System HT-X20. The flash drive is plugged into the  front USB port on the HT system and music now plays through all speakers when the system is on the "USB" setting. This older home theater system doesn't have Bluetooth capability but it's still a great system and with all the music on this flash drive it can play 8K hand-picked songs in perpetuity and whenever. Not bad for a $14 investment. Awesome!
4,The only reason I didn't give this thumb drive 5 stars is because it is all plastic.  Maybe I'm old school but I like the shaft to be metal.  I know it doesn't change anything and I'm sure it's strong but that's just me.You can giggle now...I wrote 'shaft'
5,The most reliable brand i have found
1,These drives will overheat very quickly and lock themselves up (apparently for safety to prevent destroying themselves).  They are okay if you are just doing some word files or something but any large files or data transfers forget it.  Once your data is on them if you want to migrate your data off (say to a bigger drive or simply to back up your data) - it is going to take forever doing it one file at a time - or in the case of large files never get it off.  Will be looking at other brands going forward because of this.
2,I know write speeds are always slower than read speeds and that the claims are always faster than real situations but this is just sad.  I am not going post a bunch of speeds here as others have already been doing so and this is file and hardware dependent.Suffice it to say that I have much older flash drives that still work and at much faster speeds.  There is no reason to keep boasting the newest 3.x standardization if the performance cannot come close to matching much older ones.  Simple use as a portable drive for light use is just plain frustrating on all 3 that I have purchased.
3,It’s great right capacity works fine but only concern is the plastic this is made of doesn’t to do well with heat
2,I generally like Sandisk products. I like the this product's storage capacity speed of transfers and size. That being said this product has a thin plastic housing OVER the connector which promptly broke off inside my laptop USB port. Once i retrieved the piece I found it to be very thin plastic. The photo shows where the missing part exposed the connector. I was really surprised by the poor quality.I cannot recommend this: Two stars
5,This is an amazing USB flash drive for the money.  On my Fedora 31 Desktop which has front-mounted USB 3 gen 1 ports I got the following results from hdparm:sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/sdd/dev/sdd: Timing cached reads:  17452 MB in  1.99 seconds = 8754.66 MB/sec Timing buffered disk reads: 376 MB in  3.01 seconds = 124.95 MB/sec
5,Bought this to replace my husband’s bulkier thumb drive that stuck out of the front of his PC and would get banged into. This is pretty flush. A little bit difficult for him to remove. It is very small.
5,These are so small that I can put the into my laptop USB ports and leave them there for tons of extra storage for my photos and other files.  They are also great for sharing.  The only downside is that they are so small that they can be easily misplaced or lost.  I suggest a storage container for them when they are not in the computer.
4,The 2 of these that I ordered both came in at just over 250GB if that matters to you. Seem to work fine so far.
5,For professional reasons I need a lot of data stored in flash drives. Maybe you will say "put everything in the cloud". But when you use large files (e.g. hd movies) sometimes it is not that simple.I use a 258GB drive and this one was bought to be a backup of that.It works as expected is tiny enough to be with the home key the transfer rate is very good.In short an excellent deal
5,This is very small. it slides into the usb drive with ease. It works great. simple to move files to it from computer.
4,Being mostly plastic it has almost no weight. The little loop for the lanyard sticks to the side and can get in the way of some USB configurations.As far as function the thing is fast and works well. I have used it only to install through usb 3.0 ports but it has worked awesome for installing windows10 in several machines.It has a small design flaw as stated above but is very much worth the cost.
4,I like the size for portable needs so you can leave it in place on a laptop. However the small size and large capacity creates heat with little surface area to cool it off.  In most cases the physical contact with the device it is plugged into will be absorbing the heat.
4,Smallest 512GB device I have owned...  Shows as "only" 460GB (512 GB even formatted should be a bit more but whatever).  That said it is small and works fine.
4,It has high-speed data transfer rate but I wish its body was made up of metal because I want to use it as a portable storage to sync my files between my PC at work and my home computer and its body seem not that durable for frequent plug in and out. It hasn't broken or cracked yet and I am using it for about 2 months but I try to use it very gently to not damage its body.
5,This is a great productI have been using it on my MacBook Pro and an external drive.I love itThese are large graphics files 1 Gig+ eachGreat read and write speed. You do not feel the difference between the internal drive or this drive.
5,I've currently been using this Sandisk ultra fit 256gb usb drive as my primary drive on my Acer Chromebook 15 with Windows 10 pro installed in the usb using WinToUSB because I can't upgrade my 16gb ssd that's soldered to the motherboard and yeah it's been working and performing just fine so far at just over a month. For other Chromebook users trying to accomplish this just don't forget to expand/enable virtual ram on Windows it'll prevent software crashes and Windows will work a lot more smoothly.
5,I was impressed with the sturdiness this micro drive has. I purchased a different brand micro drive a couple of years ago and this one is much better. I wanted to larger storage this offered and have no problems with heating or comparability. Will be purchasing another one soon.
5,This super small micro USB flashdrive is perfect for a large amount of files! It is very small so you could lose it easily however since it is small then it doesn’t stick out super far on a laptop. It worked immediately when I plugged it in for the first time and with 128gb of storage it fits everything I need on it and more!!
5,Para fotos y vídeos perfecto
5,Headline says a lot.  Considering the amount of storage these have the product is very small.  Less than the diameter of a quarter and very light.  This is both good and bad as the small size could results in the device getting lost quite easily so I installed a lanyard on it just to be sure.  FYI this has encryption and requires a password to use so think its main purpose would be to secure sensitive information.  But its easy to setup and use.
5,This drive has plenty of capacity for a reasonably large music playlist to sit in the dashboard of a Nissan Rogue without sticking out and obstructing the junk tray below the jack.
5,I am satisfied with the quality and the value for the price.
5,Plug it in and it's good to go.  It's nice and discreet and perfect for moving large photo libraries off the main HD to free up space.  However it does take up a USB port.
5,This is perfect to listening to music in my car. Fits into the USB jack on the dash without sticking out and getting in the way and yet is easy to remove when necessary. And reasonable price!
5,Bought two of these exclusively for my Nintendo Wii U! one drive is for wii u games and other drive is for wii games.. this is my up grade from my old 128gb usb drives. they both fit next to each other in a small discreet fashion which i like vs the big long usb drives. no issues with usb loader and was able to format them according. And was able to hide my wii thumb drive successfully wiith out having the format or remove the wii thumb drive. THIS WAS ALL TESTED ON A NINTENDO WII U FULLY MODDED.
5,I use this USB and leave it always connected to my macbook and run itunes off of it. Have no issues and it works great while saving me a ton of space on my macbook. Would def recommend since it has a very low profile and barely sticks out the side of the macbook.
5,Small but with a larger capacity than my dad. It just stays plugged into my laptop and backs up everything.Very pleased.
5,I'm buying two more of these puppies as they are working great as back-ups on my PC's.  I have over 200 gigs of photos and videos I need to protect and having them on a tiny thumb drive is reassuring.  I can't comment on their durability as I haven't had them very long (months only) but so far so good and if one 'crashes' then I'm still covered.  Consider it cheap insurance!!!p.s. - given the size of my files the speed of DL's is sweet.
5,I don't know what everyone's complaining about lol.. from a tech's standpoint I have my Ubuntu installed on this drive for the development of my retropie. I am constantly moving files never having an issue and I do mean big files we're talking like 8 gig files.. mainly PlayStation 2 games and whatnot.. if you ask me it just sounds like people just want to complain when they don't know how to use a product or they aren't very careful with it.
5,I use it for music in both my house and car stereo it's less bulky has the exact amount of storage advertised also very portable and easy to use it's only flaw is not having a cover.
5,This was my second
5,Tiny; Will not fit in thick key ring; may need a tiny ring or flexible (cloth) loop to attach it to a keychain.
5,I love how tiny this USB drive is. However I've come close to losing it several times especially on my dark granite countertops. Solved by putting a cord through the loop part (cow hitch knot) That way it doesn't catch anything but is easily findable. No problems with anything being corrupted (so far). I have two for my Tesla and easily swap them out for dashcam footage. The cord also helps in pulling the drive as well in tight spots.
5,For the price I paid this was a great deal.  I'm using it as a media stick in my 2016 Ram Truck.  I have over 2500 song files and it works perfectly.  Can't speak for longevity since it's only been a week since I've owned it but I'll check in if anything comes up.
5,Picked this up to throw in my computer bag for emergencies.  Good product for the price.
5,I bought this flash drive to be used at work but somehow it ended up on my printer at home. It's super easy to scan stuff on the flash drive and then take it with to where ever. The capacity is amazing. I will probably never need as much space on a flash drive but the size is perfect. Sometimes I use it as an extra on my laptop to have a temporary storage for bigger files. Great product. Very happy with the purchase!
5,Our blink security system only use max 256Gb  so this is a perfect storage size for us.  I like it the most because is doesn't protrude out of the system like those longer thumbdrives would have.
3,I bought this because I liked the size and it can safely (I think?) stay plugged in 100% of the time. It works and was seamlessly recognized by Windows. I figured as a USB 3.1 drive it'd be fast too but unfortunately that isn't the case.If you need consistently fast storage DO NOT buy this drive as it throttles itself and slows down pretty quick for medium to large transfers. (In my case I'm moving hundreds to thousands of RAW files to/from the drive.) It starts out fast but slows down after a very short amount of time. If I pause the transfer to let the drive cool down it'll start quickly again and then slow down as before.tl;dr Buy this drive if you just need a lot of storage but don't need to worry about the speed of large sustained transfers. DO NOT buy this drive if you're looking to quickly move around large files.
5,It's a good flash drive high quality memory and plenty of it. Blazing fast speeds but it has a bit of a heat issue. It gets insanely hot for long periods of time. I use it with a linux operating system installed on it but the silver colored version of the same product does not get hot with the same use case so it seems to be this product.
3,This drive works fine in a computer's USB slot but using it with an OTG cable it gets way too hot. The cable itself feels warm to the touch but once you pull the drive out it's almost too hot to touch. Even when the device was turned off it got hot. I'm assuming that's because there is always power going to it through the cable. I'm sure it's fine to use in a computer but I wouldn't use this drive with any kind of a device that keeps constant power to it
3,I didn't realize that this was all plastic when I purchased it but the price at the time was OK anyhow. It has worked well but the plastic eventually cracked and part of it fell off. There are now cheaper and more sturdy ones with the same footprint so I won't be purchasing this one to replace it.
5,Nice use for my car and very easy to use.
5,These work amazingly well for ESXI host boot drives. I used an off brand thumb drive before using these and they were going offline randomly on the ESXI hosts. These are great because they are very low heat and mount very tightly into the computers USB port. I am highly recommending these drives for VMware Home Labs.
4,Flash drive works for backing up my files. I have a few dozen gigs of pictures videos and documents. It transferred at a decent speed videos where a bit slower than the photos and so were larger files in general. The drive didn't get as hot as I thought it would which was a great factor too. All in all I trust this device for backing up my files and will buy another if needed.
5,I bought this as a backup drive for my mini-laptop but because it barely sticks out where you can get to it I just leave it in all of the time! I fits inside the case and I don't need to worry about breaking it off! Now I have more capacity than I can use but I love the fact that I can be redundant with files and not feel I'm "using up valuable space". Wish all of my thumb drives were this compact!
3,I've bought many of these over the years as a portable backup drive for my laptop. I use iDrive for daily backup and essentially back up my entire laptop that way. These drives consistently fail after a year or two of service. For the price that's OK but one would expect a longer life.
5,I really like this flash drive. It has a lot of space built in security and transfers files fast. Over had no issues using in in several different computers including a chrome book. It's tiny though and I've temporarily misplaced it a few times... My fault not the companies fault but you should be aware that it is tiny and black so if you put it down on a dark colored desk be careful. It's exactly what I wanted and the value was very good for a brand name USB drive.
3,Yeah that's a Cure song but it's also the perfect representation of this flash drive.  It gets blazingly hot.  Think that box that they stick Paul Atreides's hand into in Lynch's Dune adaptation.  You'll touch it and think it's just hot in your head but no it's actually that hot.  It even gets hot when it's not reading data or when your computer is in sleep mode.  I have to take it out but then I worry that I've misplaced it.  I would NOT buy it again.
5,This is great. Holds a ton and when installed into the USB port is barely visible. I use it for music in my Mazda CX5.
3,I bought it for the blink camera but it doesn’t work storage backup keeps failing.
5,So tiny you'll lose it if you don't tether it to your keychain this device is fast and acceptably sizeable. Some space has to be allocated for the "just in case" of failed flash blocks which is fine and typical of flash memory storage but overall it hasn't failed in any way after many reformatting installing OSes and copying cycles. Great overall product.
1,I purchased one of these in August 2019 to replace a 128GB HP drive that had worked well but I needed something with more capacity and a smaller size. I wanted one with a low profile to put into my the back of my Wii U. I got the drive transferred about 100 GB worth of files to it plugged it in to the Wii U and left it be for about 8 months. It was used very little in this time.Recently I unplugged it and plugged it into my laptop to transfer some more files. During the third file the drive locked up and became unresponsive. I unplugged the drive and noticed it was very hot. I was never able to get the drive to work again. I ordered a replacement since there are not many drives this size and I thought maybe I had just gotten a bad one. I plugged the replacement in and started transferring files. The same thing happened. The only difference is that the replacement works again after you let it cool down.So I returned the drive. I have had the HP drive for about 4 years now so I ordered the 256 GB version of that. I transferred about 150 GB of data to it and the transfer speeds were over twice as fast as this SanDisk. I see other reviewers have had the same issues. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
5,The Amazon Fire TV Generation One requires Fat(32) formatting for expanded memory.  My research shows this means 16 GB and under USB memory.  I bought this formatted it to Fat(32) and it works fine.  Larger memory sticks did NOT work.
4,It’s a great product given the price and design. The only issue is that it heats up pretty fast and casing is plastic and looks like it not durable for heavy usage.
3,This Ultra Fit replaces the previous model that was known to have issues with over-heating. This new model does get quite hot (once it is plugged in). This has not significantly affected its performance however given that the chassis of this new model is entirely made of plastic the integrity of this Ultra Fit may come into question later on. Heat is a well known contributor to the reduced life expectancy of electronics. Read speeds are normal reporting an average of 75 MB/s while write speeds are considerably slow (9 MB/s). My main reason for purchasing this drive was to supplement the limited storage present in my MacBook Air. For that purpose this drive works reasonably well. If you were hoping to use this for video or audio editing don’t. This drive is best suited for media storage and playback.
5,Works great.  Perfect size to leave in my portable blu ray player while storing it in my backpack
4,Purchased this for sentry mode and Teslacam on my Model 3. It worked fine for a week and then began reporting that write speeds were too slow. Searching for a new option for the Tesla
5,great product for price and amount of storage.
5,I've been with computers for 50 some years before retiring a few years ago. The ability to have a half terabyte of storage on a data traveler the size of your thumbnail to me is amazing.
1,Product was great at first small large capacity but then it gets really hot after using it in any device.I mainly bought this to use for the sentry mode for our Tesla it's actually not compatible think it wrote too fast or something I forgot. Anyways I just thought I would use it to store movies.I left it in our TV for awhile since I was watching a movie like once a month from it. When we tried opening after a few months of not using to put more movies in it it doesn't open from any device any more. Windows recognizes it's a drive but it won't open or finish loading to open. It won't even let us safely remove it.I assume it's a busted drive now from the overheating. I would definitely not purchase this product again it's small size with the heating issue is a very flawed design. Maybe I didn't use it responsibly and eject it every time after I'm done using it it's still hella inconvenient to do that.
5,Great for laptops. Store photos on one and documents on another. Does not stick out so the risk of it being snapped off is very low. I would recommend this.
5,Perfect for car stereo.  Old one (a few years old) quit working in car but does work in computer..  Other USB flash drives worked car.  Replaced it with this one .  Works fine again.  Florida summers tough on electronics left in cars.
5,storage capacity" "easy to use" and "portability"
5,Using it to store my music library for use in my 2018 BMW G01 X3 M40.  I hate Apple Carplay and the normal bluetooth audio interface is very slow compared to my last couple of cars so I decided to try using USB storage.This one fits my large library and since it's so small you don't even see it connected to the USB port in the center console.  I formatted it as FAT32 and the car has no problems reading the library or playing the files.
1,I received this device yesterday and it has been completely useless.  I formatted it on a Linux laptop as a LUKS encrypted drive.  Running programs that attempted to write data to it caused the programs to freeze up.  I'm not sure if I received a defective unit or not but from looking at the other reviews it appears to be a common issue.  I re-formatted it in windows and I tried to use this device across two different laptops and experienced frequent freezes and atrociously slow write speeds.  Despite the description's claims of  being able to copy a movie in under 30 seconds I attempted to copy a DVD iso file of size 6 GB. The write speed would start off at about 2MB/s and quickly drop to under 200KB/s within seconds. I cannot even transfer such files as I watch the transfer flip between 0 and 300KB/s write speed. Windows is estimating it will take about 10 hours to copy such a file.  I don't have this problem with any of the other USB drives I use on the same ports or machines.  This was a total waste of money.UPDATE: I did decide to try and replace it hoping i had just received a defective item.  The replacement seemed to work ok for about a week but then I experienced similar issues as before especially the drive just locking up and refusing any write access. Reads would still work but were incredibly slow and when it drive was removed it was hot to the touch.  I'm returning this one for a refund and will be going with a different brand.
3,I don't have enough time with this to comment on it's durability. I can however comment on it's performance. While I knew the bold "130 MB/sec" on the package was wrong the poor write performance is a big disappointment. It originally came formatted with FAT32 and the write speed was about 5.5 MB/sec using h2stest as my measurement program. It took well over 40 minutes to completely fill the drive. The Read speed was quite reasonable at almost 85 MB/sec (close enough to the claimed 130 MB/sec). I then tried it after having reformatted with exFAT. That improved the Write speed to about 7.2 MB/sec with the Read speed still in the range of 85 MB/sec. The 10-15x ratio of Read to Write speed is still a major issue for me.The size is fine and on the plus side it doesn't seem to get as warm as their previous generation USB3 Fit dive.
5,Very small and portable device.You get 460 GB from the flush drive.The price is solid for the return.overall very nice!
1,This Sandisk 64 GB UltraFit USB drive rapidly heats up when inserted into USB port on my Dell and then quits working.  No problems with the other USB drives that I own.  Never had problems with a Sandisk product before.  Maybe I happened to get a defective drive.
4,the outside of the item is PLASTIC ... no metal including the USB plug.. Works well initially .. Hope it holds up ..
5,This is the third time I buy this USB. The security vault  app is helpful a good value. But the portability of this usb is fantastic super discrete You don't need to take it out becomes part of your laptop or device. Great reliable product.
5,I ordered a 256G SanDisk and it is around 10 times faster than any i have tried and it actually stores video.  Love it!!!I have 3 125G SanDisk drives & they all work great...I've tried many 1TB flash drives and none of them work when recording video.  They quit around 50GB.SanDisk is the answer.
2,Plugged it in as extra storage for my game system and shortly after it stopped working
5,I love how much storage and and high performance interface in this tiny package.It's so small that I have now misplaced it a few times but love the production.
4,Great storage capacity and of course the SanDisk reputation. I was looking for something small enough to build into jewelry and this was advertised as 'the smallest'. It's not.
5,I ordered this flash drive to use in my truck as a storage device for mp3's.  I had an older flash drive that wound up with some bad sectors and my music kept locking up in mid song.  This drive works flawlessly and loads really fast.  The USB port in my truck is in the console so I needed something small and this fits the bill.  Shipping was very fast.  I would recommend this drive to anyone looking for speed and something small in size.
5,I bought this to hold my many years worth of music in my car and other places (5 printer paper boxes full of CSs worth totaling 28GB. Haven't tried it with my video projector - soon.  Unlike some I haven't run any speed tests - just playing music so far - no delays on any device (used on laptop desktop and car).  The only con if you can call it one is it is so small that I misplaced it for a few days once.  I love it...
4,Ever had a baby centipede sting you? Well thats how hot this thing gets.Works great. Dont let it contact your skin for too long.
4,I haven't used this yet but it feels nice
1,So I went in a road trip and had this usb for about a month then it just stopped working during my travels. It was really stressful knowing that Sentry Mode was not recording and so as my Dashcam. It was a trip from Northern California to San Diego had a few close calls but thank god nothing serious.Don’t t waste your time with this product for your Dashcam / Sentry Mode needs it failed when I needed it the most. Absolute junk!2021 Tesla Model Y
4,It’s great to have a small size USB but after using for a while I found that was too small. First of all it very easy to lost. Second after using a couple times the USB became loose. Overall the price is great and the size have more advantages than disadvantages.
1,The size and storage is great...BUT holy moly these things get blazing hot! So hot you can barely touch them.  Instantly!  Before you can even start loading any files it gets blazing hot!  No good.
4,It's is very unnoticeable when placed in the usb port
5,Good for safe data storage like large Hi-Res Music files collection when you need to read them more often than write new ones.
5,I've had this fir three plus months. I love SanDisk's encryption software and have learned it's the only brand I will buy from now on. Pretty fast even on a 2.0. Does get a little warm when transferring a lot of data at once. And wish it came with the attachment cord but I have a pack of 10 for like $2 now. Size is the most attactive part which is why I needed a cord. I no longer worry I'm going to break off a stick hanging out the side of my laptop.
3,After unpacking and plugging this flash drive into my computer I read the DownloadSanDiskSecureAccess_Mac.pdf file and subsequently downloaded: SanDiskSecureAccessV3_mac.app (26.5MB) which kept quitting on me. I would likely have to look for an upgrade if there is one.My main complaint is that this flash drive is not 128GB as advertised but 123GB. The flash drive came with a few files and after downloading the app for Mac all of it took 37.4MB of space. So where did about 5GB go? This difference is too much to tolerate. I will be returning this flash drive to the seller.
5,So far so good! I used it to double my PS4 storage!It’s crazy that this little guys can do that5 stars
5,Great product to use as a dashcam/sentry mode.  Dont waste your money and buy one pre-formatted.  The Tesla will format it for you in seconds.
5,I bought this as a backup for my laptop SSD. I pushed 200GB to it with no heat or expansion issues. It is a tight fit but not overly so. For the most part I plan to leave it installed. 3.1 is fast but 200GB took several hours.
5,This has a very large storage capacity and a very small profile.  Great for laptop backup.  Highly recommend.
4,I looked many ways to have all my documents in just one place and I found this perfect for everything I needed. This product is easy to use and I can take this to many and different places because it's little and effective.
5,aEg - High quality great price fast delivery and fast speed.
5,WORKS VERY WELL FOR MUSIC IN MY CAR
3,Great storage capacity for the money gets hot and is too slow to use for video playback.  Bought this during an Amazon memory card sale and its a geeat storage option for my Chromebook.  Unfortunately I cannot use it for the intended purpose with my Mac book pro as it is too slow and gets hot to the touch when moving large files.  Great if you are going to store a bunch of small files slowly over time but the heat build up over sustained transfers likely led to its ultimate failure that other reviewers mentioned.  In previous SanDisk cruiser fit products there has been metal around the outside this one is entirely plastic and that might be it's design flaw...
5,My vehicle accepts a USB memory stick for mp3 music but it is in a storage compartment in my car and I was afraid the longer (2 inch) stick I was using would get broke off and damage the USB port. This little device took care of that and has all the storage I will ever need and then some.
5,This drive is tiny and I worry about losing it but so far it has been very handy and easy to get into crowded USB ports. It’s plenty fast as a USB 3 compatible drive.
5,I travel a lot for work and I have a lot of files I need on demand. This is a great device. It is small enough to leave in my laptop all the time.  This way I never have to worry about being without my files or needing to connect to the Internet to access them.  I love it.  Easy to use and very quick to access the files.
4,Transferred several hundred pictures from camera. Easy to transfer. Wish it was bigger in size. It could be lost easily. So far it has done what expected.
5,Works perfectly great portability and space saver and even better price then others. You can’t go wrong with this usb memory stick.
1,I wanted a larger flash drive for backing up my laptop (not my only backup device). This was the largest capacity but smallest size I could find. After it arrived I ran the standard fake flash check and this drive really was 256GB. Copying my laptop's OS image went smoothly and faster than my old 32GB flash drive. But that was  USB 2 device...A test boot and use found it to be both reliable and fast enough in case something happens to my normal SSD. Even bringing up LibreOffice was quick less than 5 seconds.Note that I over-wrote the built-in FAT32 file system as I use ZFS on Linux. This drive works just fine with alternate OSes & file systems. And my current laptop only has USB 3.0 (5Gbps) with slower processors (dual core Celeron). So this flash drive would likely be faster on newer hardware.Last I knew this was not as fast as some of the smaller capacity flash drives. Check the specifications and make sure you understand that before you buy.Update: Removing all but 1 star. The first device started failing about 6 months ago so it did not last 2 years. It was lightly used mostly for monthly backups. Finally gave up on it and purchased another brand's device. The second device purchased about 14 months ago is still working on another computer for it's backups and alternate boot media for recovery.
5,This is the perfect size for music in the car. it sticks out of the stereo just enough to give you something to grab. Works fine.
4,It's a good flash drive SanDisk is never a bad choice. Comes preinstalled with their encrypted folder system if you want that. The small size is convenient. I'm slightly disappointed that it's plastic and a fairly cheap one at that and not metal. That being said this being one of the cheaper options right now for 128GB drives no real complaints.
1,Got a dud...unfortunately I didn't start using for a few weeks and it died about two weeks after I started using it but it was already outside of the return window.
5,Those other thumb drives stick out and break off.  (Been there done that.)My uber-lightweight laptop is great but came with a SSD hard drive that just doesn't have enough storage. This provides the capacity to add on all my work from the office.  It's handy efficient and you don't even know it is there.  Just as fast but much less expensive than a new SSD drive!
5,This product is being used to store video from the dashcam in my electric car. I like the fact that it is physically very small and takes up negligible room in the car.
2,Just unpackaged this and put it in my computer and it shows the size is 460GB not 512GB as advertised. Very disappointing and a straight lie.
1,I bought this for my security system.  It got too hot to pull out of the module.  I had to use plyers and it took a few minutes to cool down.  I hadn't seen other reviews with the same problem.  Turns out if it is being used frequently it overheats because the size is so small.  Wish I had seen that review before I bought it.
5,As long as you use them for passive storage only and not actively run OS on them all the time.  These can last really long .. however beware  due to small size  can easily be lost..
5,Nice and compact no problems use for my security system blink.
5,I got this USB to store video footage from the Tesla Model 3. You want the ultra fit because the USB ports is in the middle compartment also doubles as a storage unit. You can want anything long sticking up that will block you from accessing the container. The 128gb also gives me months of video footage.
1,I bought this 128GB USB 3.1 drive.  The screenprint on the device made in Malaysia says 128G  but it's capacity is only 32GB.  I formatted on windows server 2022 using NTFS and exFAT on my PC and tried the same exercise on a Linux machine a different laptop a different desktop and a Mac.  All report this "128GB drive" to be only a 32GB. device with a 128G label.  If it's not a fake then it's trash and a HARD PASS.
3,Peaks out around 20 MB/s which is USB 3.0 speeds I have actual USB 3.1 gen 1 and USB 3.1 gen 2 devices and this is no USB 3.1. Storage space is all usable from my tests and max speed for write was around 21.5MB/s peak.Overall a good device but a bit false advertising on the speeds and USB model.
5,No issue so far.  All good.
5,tremendous storage in a small footprint
2,i bought this for a friend. I saw him last week to copy some items and when i saw it i was shocked cos pieces had started breaking off.
5,I like the small size and high capacity. The size allows me to leave it in my laptop without worrying about physical damage. Works great.
3,I initially got this because I wanted to run a ~130gb game off of it (and not have to worry too much about bumping it and it disconnecting) and when it started copying the files it was running perfectly. The problem was that after a short while it gets really hot and slows down dramatically. It works perfectly fine for lighter less constant work so I have it hosting a number of files on a samba server instead
5,Sandisk has proven very reliable over the years. Nothing proves 'You get what you pay for' than 'cheap' usb drives.  I have strayed a few times to my detriment but now stick with Sandisk and a few other long established brands.  And at less than $20 for 128 GB in a tiny profile this product cannot be beat.Any old IT guys out there remember having to justify a few TB for a project ?
4,I use this in my car stereo to listen to music files in multiple folders. Its size makes it less conspicuous. I hope to see car stereos allowing you to select folders soon if thats not already being done.
3,These are not made like they used to be made. They are now thin wall plastic instead of metal.Junk and waiting to break.If you buy plan on these make sure it is used in a way it is not handled much.Cheap junk construction.
5,I got this for my car to play music.  So far working very well.  Stays real close to dashboard so doesn't get knocked out!  I have several for when I want to listen to different types of music. Unfortunately car won't let me pick folder just finds ALL music so if I want to select type easiest just to have a couple of theseThis time replacement as 1st one "died". Not sure why. Working fine
5,USED TO MAKE ROOM ON A LAPTOP HARD DRIVE.
5,This is a great little thumb drive. I use it with an audio mixer for playback music during breaks. I'm always concerned having plugs and long flash drives sticking out of the unit figuring someone will walk by and bump into it. With my luck it would break the socket in my mixer rather than the flash drive. However this drive is so short there's no chance of that happening (it doesn't stick out of the socket more than 10mm or so). This was the perfect solution.
4,This usb is super small and gives me a lot of trouble when I'm trying to remove it from my computer. It would probably work well in a laptop or as a backup drive that you don't plan on removing very often.
2,We've been using the previous model of these ultrafit drive for years as an easy way to add permanently-attached storage to MacBook Pros (all with USB 3.0+). Just plug it in format it and forget it. They always worked great and always performed well. We just ordered 3 of this new model (the 256GB) and noticed very slow write-speeds. Checking System profiler it's easy to see that the old model registered full-speed every time it is inserted but this new model often reverts down to USB 2.0 speeds. We've tested all three drives and it's happening with all three of them. If we didn't desperately need the 256GB of storage in a tiny form-factor we would return all three of them. As it stands the performance issue really won't be much of an issue (they mostly house lots of relatively small files) but if you will be relying on needing reliable USB 3.0 speeds you may want to look elsewhere.
2,For a "USB 3.1" rated drive the write speed is awful not worth it.  I had purchased it for "side car" storage but in coping data over to it the performance is terrible. it averaged 2.1 mb/s. Copying the same data to the same port to a different thumb drive it achieves 101 mb/s transfer so it's not the computer port or data issue.  It's the crappy performance of this flash drive
1,I worry about my data being captive to some cloud.  Can they start charging you to retrieve data?  Is your data private?  Will you get ad's for stuff on your e-mail?Regular flash drives aren't that expensive.  I would like to see comments from people who have used it for a whilllllle.
5,I have one of these in my Silverado and Subaru both have MP3's and playlists. Zero problems reading off of them. The small form-factor is great for automotive applications.
1,Given the super small size I expected this problem. It can be faster when it is cool but when it heats up after a minute (hot enouth to burn your fingers) it only only transfers at less than 9 mb/sec. Why lie about performance SanDisc? I fortunately will still be able to benifit from this as a product but again.. why lie SanDisc?SandDisc specs are all garbage... Read speeds up to 130MB/s(1) [(1) Write to drive up to 15X faster than standard USB 2.0 drives (4MB/s); USB 3.1 Gen 1 or USB 3.0 port required. Based on internal testing; performance may be lower depending on host device; 1MB=1000000 bytes]It seems Amazon requires no honesty with sellers.
5,I love this flash  drive!!  First it is soooo small- low profile.  No worries about bumping the flashdrive and breaking the outlet.  BUT it is not so small you can't get it out.  Very easy to remove this per its ergonomic  design.  It is fast--3.1.  I did find that when it backed up my computer it was a little warm when I removed it but not hot enough to melt anything.
5,I use the flash drive with the Blink camera hub to store video data. It’s probably more than I need but the price was right.
5,I like the included SanDisk encrypted locker. It seems to be the best way to keep your private files secure.
5,I absolutely love the form factor! Low profile and easy to swap out. I use mine as a secondary drive on my laptop. I am a cyber crime investigator and this allows me to save all my pertinent and emcrypted information for work.
5,Don't ask me why I have quite a few flash drive this is the fastest in deleting and writing. I bought some newer they all have different speed.
2,I guess you can't expect much for $10 but all the reviews show way faster speeds. Honestly I've noticed this issue with a bunch of SanDisk products including their SSDs they will keep a product name/form factor for many years but periodically change the internals so you end up with different results depending on when it was purchased. See also: "SanDisk SSD PLUS"Once I use for my intended purpose I will report back with CrystalDiskMark but right now it is averaging 10MB/sec extracting large files on my i7 computer while connected to a USB 3.0 port. If it's as slow reading as it is writing it's going to take forever to update my car's GPS map...
3,Pros:Fast Read speeds (1.4-2GB/s fast)Small form factorCons:Really slow write speed (Like 10-13MB/s slow)I like to test new drives when I buy them so I started by creating a new 5GB file on my C:\ drive with the command:fsutil file createnew 5GB.zip 5368709120Then I copied said file over to my new thumb drive and oh boy was I disappointed. I only paid $7 for this but I expected it to be better...It should be fine for what I purchased it for though (OS install disk/Boot Drive).I also performed a CrystalDiskMark test on the drive to see how things went. It's not really pretty. Again its GREAT for what I'm going to use it for but I don't think this would be an ideal drive for someone shuffling data around.
4,Sandisk has always been good to me and this one works just fine.I'm not sure about the plastic USB jack housing but it has held up so far.USB3.1 is WAAAY faster than USB2.
4,It is only 57GB not 64GB
5,I'm using it with the FM bluetooth tranceiver in my car. Look at the tiny size in the photo-! But the performance is not tiny. It shows a stable high read/write speed if you use it with USB 3.1 ports.
5,love it
5,nice compact size so it does not stick out from the dash.  The usual thumb drive sticks out too much and is easily broken or knocked off but this sits almost flush so bumping it is not a problem.  since its fat32 it works perfectly in my car.
5,I needed more storage for my MacBook Pro which only came with 128GB. This little USB drive was a very inexpensive why to get 256GB more. I even bought one to use on my Xbox One. Definitely worth every penny.
4,Good value for this snug fit usb drive.  works well in my chromebook but like others mentioned it gets hot and stays hot even when i'm not necessarily writing or retrieving any data to/from the drive.  like when i'm just sitting surfing the net the drive is hot.  we'll see how long it lasts otherwise it's great.
4,just be careful not to lose it it is very small but very fast and the storage is amazing!
4,flash drive is way too small. Not practicable.
5,Needed to add a very small split ring and a small locking caribiner to attach it to my key set; otherwise excellent.
5,This is an awesome drive. It writes larger files very quickly and it's insanely small. I recommend it.
5,I moved a lot of data mostly my pictures. Plan to leave them attached to my computer. Bought the largest ones offered. Used as attached memory. Very easy to use!
5,This USB Drive is SUPER small and pretty cheap for the $/GB.  Especially since it's a micro form factor.  It's also quite fast since it's a USB3.0 drive.  I use this drive frequently for Playstation saves and captures that transfer to my PC Hard Drive and it's never let me down.  SanDisk is by far one of the best flash storage brands.
3,The plastic part that goes inside the USB slot is really really thin. I had 2. Both crumbled. These get pretty hot. The plastic must not hold up and it just crumbles away. You can still use the drive if you are careful. Hard to insert when broken until you peel away the remaining plastic. This accounts for the low portability and easy to use ranking.
2,This product broke after two months of sitting in the same port. Will not recommend. I'll stick with metal flash drive housings from now on.
5,Great overall USB but also really small! You could easily lose this if you don’t have a lanyard for it or something. But it transfers my files and data all pretty fast but it also gets crazy hot afterwards.
4,i like it . super fast  gets pretty hot and is pretty small but yeah its a usb drive... woooo hoooo!
5,I use it in my car.  I have all my music and it's small and doesn't get in the way.
5,Super small... great for in the car. Stuffed mine full of music and movies and it’s barely noticeable.
4,Price
4,Gets too hot after just a few minutes of usage.
5,Awesome thumb drive!  I am not using this for anything super fast I just need something that will work in my car for storing music and videos.It does both jobs very well and the low profile makes it almost invisible in the vehicle and less prone to be broken by something hitting it.The best part is that it runs cool and the plastic case keeps it from scratching my cars slot area if I am trying to get it in at night.
5,I really love this flash drive from the very first day I had it. It is extremely tiny well made and quite fast although it may not be the fastest USB 3.0 drive around. Anyhow it suits all my needs and I am happy to have it.
5,Never knew about these button size drives.  I leave it in all the time.  Fast and convenient size storage....  I have Unraid on it and system boot from it.
5,I usually use a USB flash drive to store all my favorite albums for use in my car.  But I recently purchased a new 2019 SUV and the USB port had limited space above the port.  Unless I could get a shorter flash drive I would not have been able to close my console cover.  But this worked perfectly.  Good fit good capacity good price.
4,Worked really good for a while as a boot drive but seems as though it’s slowed down. Being tiny was it’s function but seems like it may have over heated with the rest of the overheating laptop.
5,Sandisk always makes quality products and this is rock solid. Small if that is what you are looking for but be careful as it is small it is easily lost. I got one of these for my wife a while back and copied a ton of music on it and stuck it in her car as her audio system. Holds 4 times more music than Sirius XM radio appears to have in their entire music collection across all their channels.
5,A lot of storage in a very tiny package.  So tiny that it would be easy to lose..
5,I always buy SanDisk their products are the best sad it will be fully Western Digital soon WD is not a good investment.
5,I was using too much data listening to music in my car on my long commutes. I loaded this up with a ton of music and audiobooks and stuck it in one of my car's USB ports. As expected my data usage has gone way down and I still like the variety of music. I had to give up the flexibility of listening via my Echo Dot but the data savings are huge.
5,This mini USB device hold hundreds of songs. I put it in my car to listen to my favorites songs instead of endless commercials on the radio. This device is awesome.
5,I bought this for my Blink camera system. Works great. Arrived on time & in new.
4,So far working flawlessly. Currently this is the only 256 GB Fit size drive available that I am aware of. Read speeds for normal everyday activities are very good with acceptable write speeds. Very comparable to my Samsung Fit drives. Only complaint I have is the plastic casing instead of metal for which I deducted 1 star. Otherwise I am very happy with this drive and highly recommend it.
3,Oh my these things get extremely hot! I haven't used one long term yet but I don't know if I should.  I installed a 10GB image onto one and when I unplugged it it was so hot that it felt cold for a second before I realized how hot it was.  I tried it in two different laptops with the same result so it's not my usb port.
5,Unbelievable how small they can make these devices. Using it as a hard drive backup & its great.
5,I was running out of storage on a MacBook which does not use any standard internal SSD.  Popped this flash drive into one of the USB ports and now I have an extra 64GB of storage.  The flash drive is so small it stays in the laptop at all times and never gets in the way.  Inexpensive and it works well.
5,Does what it should small and portable! Can be difficult to pull out of a tight USB port/tight space such as a motherboard USB port because it is so small and not much to grab onto.Have been using this as the USB drive for my UNRAID server for a few months non stop now.
5,Used to store/backup university schoolwork and it's easy to transfer from laptop to desktop.
5,I like the combination of large capacity speed and small profile. Can be left plugged in without risking to be damaged. Some people have complained that it fails after extensive read/write usage. That's possible but it is a data storage unit not a hard disk with extensive read/write capability. Use it to store your songs and plug it (and forget it) in a car's USB.
5,An Amazing DiskOnKey. I used the previews model with 128GB as an extension storage for my Dell XPS 12 it's always plugged in and doesn't interfere with my case and bag. I have waited for a 256GB variant for quite some time and as soon as I saw there's a new USB 3.1 256GB model I bought it. It's an amazing device for laptops It works very fast. Read speeds are higher than the previews USB 3.0 model. Write speed is a bit higher. Worth every penny!
5,I received the package on time.  I use These for Music in My Vehicles USB port.  I Recommend Leaving The File System on exFAT. I tried NTFS Formatting. Did not work Back to exFAT then O.K.  For Music in a vehicle:  I recommend a 32GB stick
5,Great drive on USB Stick. They say it is waterproof but I am really afraid to test it.Can't say about that feature.
5,My TCL TV has an option to stop start and go back on a TV show when using the antenna.  It needed some additional memory to do this which this product supplied. I had occasion to use it the other day and it worked great!
4,Gets the job done. Write speeds dropped off significantly when writing large amounts of data. Seemed to bottleneck at around ~10-15MB/s. I also purchased a 32GB SanDisk Flair at the same time which performed miles better overall. If your only concern is small physical size this thing is great. If you want a bit more performance I'd take a look at the SanDisk Flair line.
5,Sleek little nub that adds internal storage to my Nvidia Shield Pro.  Seems fast and works perfectly.
1,I wrote a nice review complete with images but apparently it did not comply with guidelines so I'll just say that the flash drive is disappointingly slow when writing large files.
5,perfect!
5,Sandisk has been a reliable brand for me. These little Ultra Fit's are very handy without taking up much real estate. This brand tends to actually contain the advertised capacity. That's not always true.
5,Used as a dash cam/ sentry mode cam for Tesla Model Y. High capacity and haven’t had to delete or reformat the drive
5,I use this to play music in my car and the time is takes to index files and play them is much faster than the previous USB stick I had.
5,I have a bunch of high res audio files in DSD and similar formats. A normal computer can not play them so I needed a flash drive that can plug directly into my AV Receiver to read the files. It works for that. These files are huge for just being audio. Way bigger than MP3 or even FLAC. So the 128G for about $20 is a great price. The sound is absolutely incredible!
5,Nice and easy to use. And fast.
5,Great for use in my Model 3 for sentry mode. Nice and portable discreet and great amount of storage for what I need.
5,I needed just 16gb but in a low profile form. This flash drive is all that. It also will accommodate feastr speeds. Perfect for me
3,Disappointed it wasn't compatible with my Tesla for the security camers and alarm recording.
2,Did not use these long while using them they would get very hot and not the good kind of hot. They slowed down a lot when they heated up. When I plugged one into my desktop pc it began buzzing and locked up. I erased them and threw them away before they did major damage.
5,I use this as an alternate boot device on an HP Stream. Works great with Xubuntu - as fast as the onboard SSD drive - but it  gets uncomfortably hot. I've researched it & apparently this is normal. I would rather have a hot drive than a larger thumb drive that isn't hot - but your needs may differ.
5,Seeing alot of questions regarding using this for Tesla's. Short answer is YES this works great in the car. I even ran this thing through the washer/ dryer and took it out and it STILL works fine (while my Samsung one has never been abused and is already giving me speed errors). 5 stars.
5,This is perfect for my raspberry pi and super fast!
1,This is the 2nd one I bought in 2022. Use them everyday so they are often used.Both failed. First one failed 5 months later and the latest I bought failed 35 days later. Two out of two are broken which tells me that they are junk.
5,I tend to like my flash drives as small as they can get since I don't like carrying bagpacks and things like that. This purchase was so worth it. Luckily I'm not one for misplacing things so this is just perfect for me but if you're one of those people who leaves your stuff everywhere I think you might loose this flash drive quite easily. I'm really liking this one. Will purchase again. Works like a charm.
4,Great product because of the size but they didn't last long before they malfunctioned.
5,I really like these low profile usb sticks. I use it with my NVIDIA SHIELD for extra storage. works great.
2,I've bought and used these tiny Sandisk drives in 128 and 256 GB capacities with few problems.The 512 GB drive definitely has issues.It's quite slow - and that's reformatting it from FAT32 to exFAT it gets very hot and it gives odd errors with large transfers.I'd suggest buying a larger sized 512 GB drive instead - especially if you intend to use this regularly.
4,I purchased (2) at this good price. Stored over 500 songs and barely used 3 and GB. Very quick transfer from portable SSD drive to this flash drive. Will stay in USB port of car as low profile is non intrusive.
3,I don't mind plastic but this one just feels like it's going to crack under any pressure. The size seemed great until i tried to remove one from the port and man i think I'd better tie a line or put a ring so i can get a better grip.Performance-wise I have no issues it's fast and temperature is higher but tolerable.I think for practicality's sake I'll get a bigger one like the standard flash drive next time.
5,SanDisk has been good for me so far; read reviews about overheating failures... no problem seen here yet.Perhaps the problems apply more to the modern/hi-speed/USB3 users.
5,This are the best Flash Drive I have always bought  I have two more now  Minimalist Design  Really small Size and They are just beautiful  I am buying more on the future .
5,did what i needed it to do. was a little finicky in the beginning because I had to reformat it for larger files to transfer but other than that it was good.
5,This apparently has way more space than I needed for my 5000+ pieces of music. I found out later. I wanted it for my car player because is so compact and I wanted all my music. At first the player couldn’t “read” it. I contacted the people I bought the player from and they suggested making folders. My son took care of that for me and now it plays everything. I love it.
1,Had this for a little over a year. 1/3 full. Almost never used.  Intended for backup and access to files on-the-go when I travel and take my laptop with me. The files I transferred to fit are copies of files stored in larger desktop computers and hard drives.Now after no meaningful amount of use  the entire unit is "read only". I can neither add nor delete files. Google search tells me this is a very common problem for which the manufacturers have no remedy.SO WHY IF THIS UNIT IS KNOWN TO HAVE SUCH SERIOUS ISSUES THAT RENDER IT COMPLETELY USELESS AFTER LITTLE OR NO USE IS IT STILL SOLD?WTH type of useless get nothing-for-my-money but irritation and hassle product is this?GarbageHey Sandisk: KMA
5,Perfect for Tesla (model y). Just insert into UBS drive under car console and go to SAFETY & SECURITY and scroll down to Dashcam “FORMAT USB DEVICE” and you’re done. You can view on the Tesla iPad directly.
5,Works just fine for my Tesla. The thing is working well when recording activities when the cam is on.
3,Very small. Get a clip or something. It would be easy to misplace. Lot's of space for such a small device. Made of thin plastic looks fragile. Gets kind of warm if accessed a lot.
3,Well this is great because it works well and its small. Downside is its so small it will be easy to loose. Also for some reason it totally messes up the bluetooth connectivity to my mouse if it is plugged in which makes it super inconvenient. I probably wont purchase it for that reason alone.
5,Super small installation as expected super spacious capacity.  Nothing to complain about.
5,Excelente producto lo recomiendo
2,While the capacity is there everything else about this drive is insufficient.- Paper-thin plastic all-around: don't put this on your keychain and expect it to stick around- Performs almost exactly on par with a USB 2.0 drive (which max out at 24 Megs/second)- Seems to even slow down further when hot meaning it can really only do about 8 seconds of real work before throttlingMy Tesla is known to require synchronous writes which is extra work on drives and models like this from Samsung and SanDisk usually only last about 9 months.It might be better to just get a cheap usb-to-microsd reader and an endurance or popular micro-sd card because they do actually compete for performance at their price offering.This drive is too cheap to the point that it is probably negatively impacting the SanDisk brand that does not need any pressure from Samsung at this point.
4,It does get hot therefore 4 stars.
2,The plastic around the head is very fragile and within a few uses started cracking.I started using a silicon protector that came with a keyboard USB cable but the damage was already done. At this point about 2 years later the plastic opposite the contacts is completely shattered and fallen off almost up to the SanDisk logo.Personally I'm pretty disappointed as I generally enjoy the build quality on SanDisk devices. I've not had any other data reliability issues but as this is a rather high capacity and thus I'd need to be able to trust it to protect that large (256GB) amount of data I can't really trust it with the shattered housing.
5,It gets the job done. I have noticed that sometimes it feels hot but it is still working.  The size of it is crazy to me lol! It’s smaller than my thumb. But it gets the job done like I said. Just put a strap on it so you don’t lose it!
3,Maybe I am being unfair giving it 3 stars. But it is advertised as...* 160 MB/s (1.3Gbit/s)* ".. Write up to 15X faster than standard USB 2.0 drives .."I have a pretty fast rig (i7-7700 with a good MSI motherboard) so it's unlikely to have many performance bottlenecks yet this thing tops out at 17MB/s early in the process and then oscillates between 3MB/s and 13MB/s during longer copying processes. That said I am probably driving it off a USB 2.0 port (I am not sure) but hey USB2.0 supports 60MB/s so 17MB/s or below during long copies is a bit underwhelming.It does what I bought it for though - 256GB on a very compact USB thumb drive which allows me to keep a lot of video content on my Roku box.
3,I used for my Tesla X and Tesla 3. Unfortunately after few days cars are not recognizing the device and you have to format it again and then it works again . Just annoying you need to format it every 3-5 days . If you are using it for Tesla recording I will look for something else
2,Unfortunately for a 3.1 drive this has extremely slow write speeds! I bought this drive to use in my tesla for dash cam and sentry mode as it is very low profile. It worked well initially but when Tesla increased the number of cameras that it records it increased the drive speed write requirement to 4 mb/s which this drive unfortunately cannot reliably handle. It can be deceiving as it will work intermittently (my guess is that the write speed is probably close to but not quite 4 MB/s) but will inevitably pop up an error that the speed is too slow.As a caution the other reviews on here that mention that it works well for Tesla were  likely written before the software update which enabled the use of additional cameras.For other uses it is probably OK. However I just purchased a Samsung Drive with a similar form factor twice the storage and significantly faster read and write speeds for around $20.
4,Works fine fast. But it is really d**n hot. Burn your fingers off hot. I copy about 2 gb's and it heated up.Never had a flash drive this small. Hard to grip but hot. Bought 2 and both got hot.
5,Small and took all my musics
3,It’s a memory stick just slow uploads(15-23)  I wouldn’t move it around from PC to PC use it to expand your storage on your laptop. The USB part is very very thin plastic & cracked inserting it into your computer. maybe think about some kind of metal like most USD sticks are made of just my opinion
5,Since I have a car receiver with a USB input and have all my music in MP3 format this is the solution to bring it all together.  Great capacity could probably drive across the US a couple times and not listen to the same song.  Small so is barely noticeable in the dash.
2,So this is not my first Sandisk Ultra Fit purchase. I bought two of the 128gb previous version ones as well. One of those failed on me after some use and so called customer service to replace that.With this one the issue is the same. I have a laptop with 128SSD. I bought this to work as another hard drive so that I can work on documents and store files/photos/videos on it. A few weeks ago it stopped mounting. The only solution being that I would have to reformat with all the content being lost. I had backed up the drive so I lost only a few files but once reformatted it wasn't the same. I am getting a replacement one (again).The issue is somewhat simple. Don't use this for daily use. Use it only as storage. That's what I realized after these mess. And always back it up because it will go bad sooner or later...
4,This is fine for keeping plugged into a laptop. Technically it does say this in the description but it's should be made clear that this is thin plastic and would never last long if you take it with you everywhere. You could crush this thing with two fingers easily. Probably returning...
4,are right very fast I had the older version in these version seems to run much cooler though the wrist problem of not being quite as fast as the original version but steal one of the best deals
5,Superfast but easy to lose. A great compact design is perfect for music in the car. You can't even tell it's there.
3,When buying a flash drive there's 3 things to consider – for me at least: 1. Size 2. Capacity 3. Speed.The first two are obvious and need not waste your time with while skimming reviews. It's very small and has a large capacity. It does these two things perfectly and is why it has 3 stars from me. Simply put this drive's write speed is atrocious. While writing some videos (7 files 11.4 GB) it was clocking a sustained speed of around 10 MB/second. 18 gigs of music crawled at 8 MB/s. This should not take 45 minutes. While I understand it is a very compact drive these speeds are still unacceptable by today's standards. I'll be (hopefully) returning this and most likely sacrificing some size for considerable speed increases with a different product.
5,I had tried several flash drives to extend the storage of my 4k stick. This one was the only one that would work.Would buy again for my other Fire stick.
4,Works fine for mp3's played in my vehicle!
4,Its a very good size. I do wish the round part of thumb drive is metal.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It’s nice and small but housing is very flimsy and prone to cracking. Now it works 50% of the time.
5,Great little USB drive - never had a problem with SanDisk !!!
4,Works well.  I use it for music in my car.  It seemed slow to copy music to but not horrible
5,I use this in the USB port for my car stereo and it works great. I dumped my whole music library on it stuck it in my car's USB port and I have my whole library available as I drive.The small size is great for this as it is much less likely to be bumped or caught on something than a normal sized USB stick would be.
2,This is probably a great ultracompact flash drive but not for use in a dashcam application. I had it in my 2020 Tesla Model 3 for 11 months before it failed. Now it doesn't even show up when connected to my computer which means it's dead.While I would love to give it a good rating at the end of the day they should really advertise it as "NOT FOR DASHCAM".
5,I decided to buy this to use as the boot USB for ESXi.The size makes it nice to plug into the motherboard mounted USB header.I am happy with the performance of this model.The older "mini" type USB's that I have purchased in the past were quite slow compared with their larger brothers but this model appears to perform quite well.I believe that I would purchase this item again.
3,I have another model of this type of 64 Gb flash memory drive but it is made of steel and arrived with a plastic protective cover. THIS MODEL does not have the cover and seems to be made entirely of plastic. I am usually always happy with Sandisk products. I have many of various capacities for various uses. In this model the use of much lighter weight plastic casing has me worried that I'll be spending even more money to replace it sooner than later - not the problem except for the inconvenience of it but data lost from a damaged flash drive most certainly is. This is especially a problem due to the high capacity at 64 Gb. Wish me luck.
3,I wish it was more sturdy. It seems to be made out of thin plastic. Must be careful not to apply too much force.
5,Very portable. Fast transfer speeds
5,Size of this product is perfect for my Tesla as the small profile does not hinder access to my center console. 32G of storage is ample for my daily driving and recording.
1,The way the external "handle" is designed makes it difficult to remove and puts a lot of stress on the drive when you pull it out.  The design causes off balance forces during removal.  If you are buying something to attach to your device and leave it there this will be great but I move mine around from machine to machine several times a day. I don't expect this new design to last very long especially since the exterior of the plug appears to be all plastic now.  I loved my last Fit.  Not this one.
5,I needed some extra space in my Raspberry Pi 3 but didn't want the hassle of connecting an external hub and USB hard drive. This thing is TINY as small as a bluetooth keyboard transmitter. If I was carrying it around I would be afraid I would lose it. Works really well. I can see an array of these in a USB hub replacing the need for a second hard drive. Nicely done.
2,Small size. Slow transfer speeds.
1,I have had so much trouble with this drive. I have owned many brands and models of external and internal media and none of them have given me the grief that this drive has. First of all some of my devices aren't able to see it at all. Just a few weeks after I bought it and put my video collection on it it becomes completely unreadable. So after salvaging what I could with a data recovery program I used a third party formating program to finally make the thing readable. During this time I had filed with a return with Amazon. When I got the thing to work I decided to keep it. Now here I am again months later and the drive has become read only by all of my devices. Out of all the storage brands I have tried Sandisk has been the most disappointing and this device is the worst yet. If the thing had worked properly maybe it would have been worth the nearly $80 in early 2018. As it is I would regret this purchase at a lower price. Find an alternative.A side note: I wasn't thrilled with the idea of a thin plastic casing. From what I have gathered it would seem that Sandisk has chosen the material to combat the excessive heat produced by a prior model the Sandisk ultra-fit which I also unfortunately own. I purchased the samsung fit with the same capacity at the same time for the same price and I haven't had a problem with it to this day.
3,Have had this since march.  It works (really well) for a bit and then gets really really hot (multiple ports/computers) and stops working until it cools down.  Maybe 5 minutes of really intensive file-copying on a USB 3.0 port before it will start throwing errors and almost burn your fingers pulling it out (I usually wait a few minutes before even trying).Could be a flaw with just mine - and it's not completely died on me yet; though I can't say that the heat is going to be helping its lifespan at all...Again works great for smaller files quick processes etc.  Anything really intensive and time-consuming is going to heat it up and if it like mine it will stop working until it cools down.
5,I love how small it is!  Keeping all of my pictures on this instead of my computer.
5,Well with SanDisk the quality is always very good. Storage size for the price was in the good range. But what I liked the most was the size. It plugs into the PC and it is so small that it does not get in the way of anything yet it is easy to remove. I might just buy a 128 GB the next time.
3,I like the product a lot except after 5 weeks it has started occasionally failing.  I can be sitting not touching it reading what I have written and it suddenly displays the contents of BOTH usb 3.0 thumb drives - which should happen only when they are inserted or when I request it.  Fortunately it has not so far changed any of the content on these drives.
5,I bought one and a week later I bought another one. Completely unnoticsble in the port.  Great memory subsidy for SSD computers that have below 500 GB (Solid-state Drive) hard drives.
1,THE CLAIMSanDisk 256GB Ultra Fit USB claims you can transfer files quickly with 130MB/s read speed. With write speeds up to 15x faster than standard USB 2.0 drives and you can move a full-length movie to the drive in less than 30 seconds. The size of that movie file in their test is a 1.2GB MPEG-4 video which is transferred to the drive using USB 3.1 Gen 1 or USB 3.0 host device.THE TESTI ran Crystal Disk Mark with the USB drive plugged into a 3.0 Standard and then a 3.1 Type A USB ports. Then I tested it with a 1GB file and the read was almost 29 MB/s and the write was only 16 MB/s. I also captured the read / write speeds that Windows was showing when I tried to transfer files over. It seems to be inconsistent with its read / write speeds as you can tell from the pictures. Like a bad roller coaster ride.Plus as you can tell from one of my screenshots the USB drive only registers as a 233GB drive in Windows 10. Which is incorrect as other drives I have register the true space that they are advertised at. Where is the other 23GB of space?False advertising or I received a really faulty drive.The only good thing was the price which was pretty good $39.99. The other issue is that it feels really flimsy since the entire thing is made up of a thin plastic.This will be going back to Amazon.
5,Just Buy it. An amazing amount of space super fast transfer speeds and very small. This is a nobrainer
3,I had no complaints about this SanDisk 256GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive (SDCZ430-256G-G46) and used it for several months.  One day without warning it just quit working.  If failed fast and anything stored on it was lost.  I had used it for a few months but not that long of a period.  So I need to knock-off some stars.  I've liked SanDisk in general but after this and another of their drive failures recently I'm a little untrusting of them right now.
5,This thingy works like a charm and is about the size of one. Awesome sauce!
4,I love the small size. I usually just keep in the side of my laptop for things I may want to move out just have a backup copy of.
5,So tiny no one can see it is there! Yet I loaded close to 10000 songs and I have endless music coming out in my car playing randomly.
5,This thing definitely is small. It is the size it says it is.User beware this thing is so small that you can easily lose it. I’ve lost it in my office somehow but have sinc found it. Will be sure to leave it plugged into the computer so I don’t lose it.Of course it comes with the company software loaded on it but I have no use for it as it is not my thing.
5,I just set up 4 servers which have internal USB sockets for booting operating systems off of. As I'm setting up a VMware cluster these were essential as best practice says don't use local spindles for booting VMware but flash or SD.  These worked great for that.  Even better they're great for storing music and playing it off your car's USB ports as the flash drives are so tiny.. smaller than my thumbnail.
5,too early to really tell about long term build quality and robustness but ive got one of these on my keychain and its a good size and shape so it doesnt snag on things but still easy to hold onto and tons of storage great for transferring files tonky friends.
5,I have one of these plugged into the USB port on my car stereo and it holds a huge collection of music making my drives a little more entertaining.I also have one of these plugged into my Blu-Ray player at home with a large collection of movies and TV shows on it meaning I have an easy selection of my favorites always a few clicks away.
5,It's so small you don't even notice it or accidentally hit it. Perfect for my car.
4,Works great seems slower to write than my SanDisk 3.0 drives were in my Mac (re-formatted for ex-Fat which I need to Mac/PC) which I can't explain.  All of my new 256GB 3.1's seem to be the same (slower-write) speed. I like the little lip because it allows me to tie-wrap several of these into one bundle.
5,It's even smaller than it looks in the images.  If there is any negative about this thing it is the thing that is also what makes it pretty awesome and that is how tiny it is.  I am a bit afraid that I'll lose it.  I think you could probably put a keychain or something on it but there is no cover so not sure that's a great idea.
2,busque las memorias USB mas pequeñas posibles y de marca reconocida pues las necesitaba como memorias fijas en mi Macbook que tiene limitado Disco Duro. una vez mas confié en Sandisk pero me defraudo compre 2 memorias de 256gb pero una de ellas solo me duro algo de 4 meses de uso. si bien es cierto que las compre el 22 de noviembre recién llegaron a miami el 3 de diciembre y a su destino final (Lima Peru) aproximadamente el 15 de diciembre. puse en funcionamiento una de las memorias adquiridas y ante la falta de espacio en la primera memoria de 256gb comencé a usar la segunda memoria aproximadamente en el mes de marzo del 2019 y desagradable fue la sorpresa que un día al encender mi Macbook ya no reconocía una de las memorias USB que tenia ancladas a la MacBook. desde aquella fecha aproximadamente 15 de junio he intentado probar la memoria en otros dispositivos pero en ninguno es reconocida. escribí en el portal de Facebook de Sandisk pero ni caso hicieron a mi reclamo sobre la calidad de sus memorias.
1,Would not stay plug into  any usb drive on my laptop desktop or adapter.. First time I've seem this problem. all 3 of the 3 pack same issue. even while holding it in.. it wasn't readable. straight up defective  in all aspects
5,I have several SanDisk flash drives and they all work as intended. It is a great product and I would buy it again.
5,Kind of weird that it's made of plastic and the fit is a little snug but it's works normally for me. Great for the car.
5,I like the fact that it's compatible with the radio in my car. I dislike the radio's lack of ability to go past track 255 in any folder of the flash drive but that's not something you can help. It's my radio's problem. LOL
5,Fast little drive
5,I am impressed with this storage device the size is great for day to day use with my surface pro 7.  Just leave it in and your data storage is quadrupled.
5,No complaints so far
5,This tiny flash drive holds 256 GB and plugs into my Mac Book Pro.  Great for storing photos and video to save room on my boot drive.  It tiny in size so you can leave it connected and always have it available.  Because it is so small I would think it might get lost if you try to "keep it handy" and not connected.
3,I used this on a Samsung Blu-Ray UHD player.  The Player recognized it and now uses it for BD-Live storage.  The Sandisk encryption software can not be used or installed from your PC hard drive.  I tried opening it and installing from my windows 10 laptop and it said to get latest version so clicked to download it and then it errored on installation.  Not sure why.  However I do not plan to use the software since on installed on Blu-ray player.  It comes formatted as FAT32 with about 57GB of real storage available on a 64GB version.  Thus would give it 5 stars if the software would have installed properly and they would just plain not lie about the real formatted available storage.
5,Worked fine  as advertised high speed Writes almost 50 plus megabytes a second  super high speed reads close to 100 MB per sec very impressed by the small little chip seems like the real deal!
4,This thing is insane. I can't believe its as big as it is. I can't wait for the next size up to come out. I only wish it carried better. You can't put it on a keychain only tie some thread around it. An it is SUPER easy to lose. If they made one key-chain able I would say 5 stars
5,Works as it should
5,Fits down snug in USB port in car so protects flash drive form side impacts in storage compartment.
4,Gave this 4 stars for the reason I find odd. When transferring large files even via USB 3.0 on a new system through TeraCopy or Win Explorer. It drags. My older flash drives all 2.0 appear to transfer faster. I could be wrong. It could just be me but for the price it's worth it.
5,Love this thing.  I plug it into a USB port on the back of my PC and it acts as an extra hard drive.  I just leave it there.  It's so small I personally wouldn't want to try to keep track of this thing while carrying it around.
4,A little small for my old hands. But a lot of space in a small package.
1,This thing read only hard locked on me.  Apparently Sandisk says it does this to protect the files but now I have a useless hard drive... good job sandisk...
2,I really liked this item until it broke into little pieces of black plastic INSIDE my tower PC's USB port. I had only pulled it out 10-12 times to go between devices to update data...that's how fragile this is. I did not treat it roughly in any way. They just chose a poor material to make the USB plug with.If you're looking for something low-profile that you can plug into a device once and never take it out again this may work for you.From now on I will only buy USB devices with a metal USB plug. METAL. ALWAYS METAL. Lesson learned.
4,Was using as bootable iso image drive had then for 2 weeks now. worked great. The only possible problem is they get really hot. Almost hot to burn my skin when I touch the bottom. Will update review if this heat issues become a real problem. Otherwise I would recommend. It doesn't get in the way at all.
5,So far no problems with this unit! Works great and 256gb at this size for the price is competitive.Just what I was looking for for my intended purposes. Although if a tiny profile isnt as important to you there's better deals to be had at the expense of physical size- which may actually be a plus as something this tiny may be easily lost!
2,I use this to shuttle and store data for short periods (couple of days/weeks) between drives on my desktop machine. I woke up this morning to warnings that the drive was not accessible.-won't mount through various utilities-cannot be formatted-data IS recoverable but cannot be erased from drive.This ties into what another user reported in her conversation with SanDisk that in the event of a thermal overload the drive locks down.What this means is:-that 5 year warranty? USELESS since the drive still has financial info I cannot erase or scrub.-after 10 months of occasional use it's nothing but trash.Thanks for nothing SanDisk. I already ordered a replacement... and it's NOT one of your products.
5,Good pen drive. No issues in using. If you have issues in losing small items don't buy this since this is small and might get easily lost.
5,Just like any Sandisk flash drives! very good!But it's made of cheap plastic! I'm afraid it might break very easily after some time it will gain heat from use.. Hope I'm wrong.. But anyways I'm gonna be gentle with this and won't put it in a full bag..
5,I LOVE THIS ITEMTHE SERVICE IS 5 STARS TOO
5,Not disappointing in the slightest. Same as the last version but heat management is way better. My only fear is that the plastic used to make it wont survive in my bag so i baby it just in case. But the actual size i got was 114GB which is a bit disappointing was hoping it would be a bit closer to 128GB.
5,I use this to store large amounts of data files that I need transfer to other computers while traveling without having web access.
4,Got delivered quick and works great.
4,Very good only worry about damaging it when I carry it since it does not have a cap.
2,I bought the 128 GB version of this drive to support the dashcam and Sentrycam features in a Tesla Model Y. It would work intermittently but I would inevitably get pop-ups telling me that the drive was too slow to record the required video. The warning would state that the drive needed to function at 4mb/s or better. Given the stated speeds this drive should have handled that with no issues at all. After a couple of weeks I pulled it out and purchased a high quality microSD card made for cameras with a USB adapter. The consensus seems to be that that is the better solution and over the last couple days I have not received a warning.
5,Good I copied all my pictures to it and placed the USB into my Samsung TV
5,Careful not to lose this thing. It is pretty tiny. I use it as my windows installer drive and it works perfectly. I have used other small drives and they all seem to heat up right away. This one doesn't seem to do that.
3,5 STARS if you write small files every now and then but if you're going to write a lot of data to these SanDisk 64GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drives at one time the first files will transfer SUPER FAST then the drive will get almost too hot to touch and get INCREDIBLY SLOW long before the drive begins to fill. I worry that this thermal cycling will shorten the life of the drive.
3,Not much to say this is a quality product for file storage. The major issue I have is the unreasonable heat this product generates after long use. Be careful not to burn yourself. I mean it gets hot! Started worrying about my USB port. DO NOT use this for putting an Operating System on and running a server from it. For short periods of use only.
4,Gets really hot even when not transferring data.
5,Maneja buena velocidad de lectura y escritura se calienta un poco por el tamaño falta un cordón para poderla desconectar mas fácilmente por su tamaño. De resto muy buena compra
5,I got this for a Blink camera system. It worked fine unfortunately the camera was junk so I returned both items.
2,Is not compatible with the blink system. Needs to be 256 or less
4,Great form factor and color. Lots of capacity but read and write times even on USB 3.1 ports are meh. This is not a replacement for an SSD in an external case but it will work for other stuff great like storing media for my head unit in my car. Just now what to expect before you buy it.
5,Do not know how long this product lasts because I just purchased it. But others I have used  like this last well. So nice not to have to remove it from your device each time you move it or put it in a carry case. I use a larger one in my big computer as extra memory and I plan to put all my music on this one.
5,I have been  looking for the perfect USB for Dashcam & Sentry Mode.  Easy to format and install. Highly recommend it.
1,I used this to play .mp3s in my truck. Once all files were transferred I place in my truck and didn't remove it. Worked great for about 2 years. After that it pooped out and wouldn't play anything. I tried to read/re-format on 4 different machines including using DOS (Command Prompt) but it never read anything. DOS at least gave me the following error: Error in IOCTL call which according to at least one online forum it's "toast." :(
5,I use these to install ESXi host OS on.  I've used many of these drives and have not had any issues with them at all.
5,Small fast with large capacity! Works as a VM hard drive on my laptop.
5,I needed a compact 256 gb flash drive and this one fit the bill.
3,It gets hot and as flash gets hot it slows down. It's a fine drive for the price but don't expect blazing fast speeds for long as this thing can get toasty. If you have small bursty transfers it's fine. Also it's made of plastic and feels cheap.
5,Compact size and plenty of storage it basically acts as a secondary hard drive that's removable.
5,Compact and decent transfer speeds.  I really liked this device.
4,Like it. Only downside is that it really needs to be on a keychain due to size. The hole for the keychain is too small for a 1 inch key ring so you have to use a smaller key ring then attach to larger key ring. Just not very well thought out.
5,It's a thumb(nail?) drive. It's the smallest one I've used which is good and bad. If you lose things easily buy a (physically) bigger USB drive. If you're organized and/or plan to leave this little gem in your USB ports look no further. Recommended.
3,this drive serves the purpose of extra storage and it transfers files fast BUT it gets very hot quickly and that when it dismount I have to let it cool down to use again.
2,The few times I got to use this thumb drive it worked as expected. Copy speeds seemed to be what I expected and didn't have any trouble with it in that regard. It did get pretty warm after a large copy but nothing that I was worried about. The big issue is that the casing that get's inserted into the USB port is made of plastic. That casing broke after only 5-6 uses.
5,RED RIBBON NOT INCLUDED. Tiny USB flash drive that doesn’t interfere with other laptop ports. It is smaller then a quarter. It works on Windows MacOS and Linux. It does the job well and i use it to transfer files between laptop and desktop.
4,It was nice and easy to use. Very nice. Just really small compact. Not a problem  unless you are like me. Hard to keep up with small things.
5,I love this little drive it is tiny though and can be easily lost.  So I recommend keeping close tabs on where you put it.  But for the price it is a real deal.
5,Works as it should and doesn't get hot like a older one I had.
5,Love these little thumb drives. Fast and have significant storage capacity to extend my SSD and make emergency duplicates of important files.
5,Works great in my DVR. Seems to work better than the 2.0 flash drive I was using before. Also this is a lot smaller than the other drive.UPDATE:. After 6 months still working as expected. The small size means that the stick only extends out an inch or two. If needed I will buy again (I am looking at the 256 so I can save more shows).
5,I leave one plugged into my laptop as an extra HD works fine bit slow but it’s tiny and I haven’t broken it off yet which is the entire reason I bought it. In and out of the bag thrown on the bed not big enough to snap off the side of your laptop.
3,Slows down when hot and it gets hot easily. I mainly use this as an additional storage space for NAS which works fine.
5,Copied over my large collection of music to listen to in my car.  No need for SAT or regular radio now.  Some car radios might have issues with this larger drives but most new cars like Lexus and Mercedes seem to handle them OK.
5,Use it in my newer car that can't play CDs.  Unbelievable to this old guy how small and how much memory.
5,As described small and unobtrusive perfect for backup or "warm" storage. I would recommend it
5,Almost to small—if I didn’t buy to leave in the port I’m sure I’d lose it.  For its use it is perfect and super low profile which is what I wanted
5,Have purchased many sd and usb drives and on occasion have found some not to have the storage capacity claimed. This usb drive checked out as have the full capacity. Good buy. Good price.
5,These things are great.  They have such a small form factor that you can barely tell that they are even plugged in.  They don't get in the way of laptop bags or anything else on my desk.I've been using sandisk for years and I've never had a problem with these things.
3,As with most sandisk usb drives that are low cost the write speed is slow but the read seems to be off the charts.Pros- Read speed is fantastic on usb3 port  - usb3 is 500+mb/s must be dell's superboost  - usb2 is interestingly high must be dell's superboost- Doesn't get as hot as the aluminum versionCons- write speed is really slow  - usb3 is 11-15mb/s  - usb2 is 6-8mb/s- no sheathI got the 16gb cheap so it will do for what I need them for... the temperature decrease on the new versions is quite impressive. Even with gigabytes of transfers it was hardly even warm.
4,easy to load up no problems however I don't like it is all plastic don't know how long they will last however they work great
5,Other than being paranoid about losing it it's perfect. Super small size with massive storage and the little lip makes pulling it out of USB ports easy. Great transfer speeds so its excellent.
5,Bought USB for music storage and use in vehicles.  Plenty of storage -- could circumnavigate the USA at least twice and never repeat a song in shuffle mode.
5,Great price for the size
4,Does its job and isn't very noticeable a solid purchase and would buy another if the need arises.
5,It's a nice very unnoticeable usb drive. I got it to hold audio files to play in my car.
2,I mostly leave these installed so it's not a problem for me but if you plan to insert and remove them regularly the plastic portion of the USB key that inserts into the device is a very tight fit. Otherwise just the dependable flash drive you expect from Sandisk.
3,I bought a couple of these drives with the express idea of using them to transfer large volumes of data between isolated systems.  They seem to work just fine when using regular USB ports.  However when using them on a USB3.1 port on a Hazwell Processor computer they really heat up and suddenly Windows-10 can no longer "see" them!  I haven't had any loss of data/files and I HAVE been able to get around the issue by dividing my copying tasks into smaller chunks.  But a user shouldn't need to do this.  I've had no issues on slower clocked systems.
4,Easy to use and small perfect for what I was looking for the build quality is cheap and plastic the top part of the usb where you plug it into the computer has already cracked and a chunk is about to come off still usualbe.
4,Aun asi no se ve robusta con solo unos cuantos dias de uso estoy seguro que se me va a romper en las manos. Se hace un poco incomoda para entrar y sacar de la computadora supongo que voy a acostumbrarme con el paso de los dias. Ya veremos mas adelante....
4,I purchased this to record traffic and movement around my car.  It does a fine job in 30 second or one minute increments.  It should work fine for recording almost anything .
3,While this has worked well for me there are two major flaws.1. While it is slim it still sticks out pretty significantly. I wanted it to disappear into the side of my laptop like a mouse dongle but it doesn't. I forget the mouse dongle is there. This sticks out enough that I cannot forget it is there.2. It gets INCREDIBLY hot. If I am streaming video it can get so hot that I cannot have my laptop on my lap.  That is very concerning and seems bad for it and for the computer.The good is the size for the price and speed. Read/write speed is great and the 229GB formatted capacity is what I needed.
5,Great storage addition.  Need to format for correct file storage.
1,Bought 128GB drive and used it for daily backup of important files in case my hard drive fails or I have to take my files with me somewhere else.  Drive was used on work PC which was on only 5 days a week (40 hours/week).  After 2 months (about 45days or 360 hours) of being plugged into work pc the flash drive is no longer recognized and all my files are gone !! I wrote to it about 18GB of data.  Also the drive was running very hot.  Not recommended.
5,Great thumb drive
5,Nice compact drive ... Served the purpose for BU that Ineeded
3,I have been using the SanDisk Ultra Fit Drives for many years now.  The read and write speed is always great.  However this new updated USB 3.1 version is not as good as the previous USB 3.0 version in terms of design.  The drive is now made of plastic.  It bends and after heavy use may crack and break.  It also no longer include a plastic cover to cover the drive during transport.
5,This tiny USB drive has worked flawlessly since I bought it in May 2018. It currently is housed in my home media server running the Unraid OS on it 24/7. No hiccups and no glitches going on 4 months. Super durable cheap flash drive I would recommend to any one.Please note these things are extremely tiny and I would not use to transport them around. These would be super easy to misplace!
3,I am not going to be negative but I will say I can not remember the last time something so simple took so long to arrive. Ordered on the first and for it on the 12th. For a flash drive the size of a penny.....ok.
5,We have three laptops and these work great on the latest one plus all the desktops (even the decade old one) so something is weird in the laptops.
4,Indeed it's tiny and unobtrusive.  I bought one so I have a permanently-placed external drive to to daily backups to on a laptop.  It works.
5,I use this with my Nvidia Shield as internal storage. It works flawlessly and has a low profile in the USB slot.
5,This USB drive is so small it is really plug and forget. No worry about breaking off when carrying your laptop. It does get warm but never too hot to touch.
5,Just stays on the edge of my laptop and barely sticks out. Fast and reliable.
5,All you could want in a tiny flash drive with giant capacity.  I keep buying them.
5,As advertised. Used it to copy data files from an old computer running Windows XP. Worked just great.
5,It's what I expected
4,It's a tight fit. But that means it's very portable. The downside is that it feels flimsy because of the casing.
5,If you need something small and quick this usb drive will do it. its a good alternative to samsung devices if your trying to save a buck. used on raspberry pi projects and psxc hacking
5,Great seller amazing product I will only but this model in the future as it is compact fast and has the same storage capacity as all others. A++
5,Tiny size and works great.
4,Used this to run Linux OS's from and gets super hot really quick
3,The write speeds on this drive are abysmal. Copying data from an SSD the write speed starts at about 50MB/s and copies at that speed for about 3 seconds but then drops drastically to 11MB/s. Why does this happen? I'm using these flash drives as archival backup drives for data redundancy so I won't be writing to these after one day but the time it takes to copy is annoying for a product rated for USB 3.1 speeds.
5,Needed a compact usb drive for my car radio.Was perfect for a 2014 chevy cruze. (Sits nicely tucked in the armrest/storage console.)32GB is more than enough storage for my purpose. Transfer speeds are decent.
4,Excellent little USB drive. Small enough to remain plugged in on my laptop at all times.
5,These drives are diminutive. Sometimes that’s a problem removing the drive from the port. I also note that it didn’t work on the USB3 port of my late 2012 27 inch IMAC.
5,The SanDisk easy to use and the files are almost instantly available.
5,Great product
1,Do NOT use these with Tesla Dashcam.  The card WILL fail and SanDisk does not warranty any flash drives used with security systems.  Customer service stated that the onus is on the customer to contact SanDisk before purchase to confirm compatibility with every product you intend to use their drives with.  Ridiculous and VERY shady...SANDISK: YOU NEED TO PUT TESLA INCOMPATIBILITY IN YOUR AD
2,Fragile top portion of USB connector broke off after 1 year of steady use. This usually lives in the side of my laptop which sees a lot of carrying around and is plugged in and out several times a day for data transfers.Still works (for now) with the thin fragile plastic top cover missing.Now wiggles a lot in the computer when plugged in not sure if it will maintain a good data connection.I'd recommend the other CruzerFit model (metal all around) if you're looking for something that gets plugged and unplugged a lot or stays in a laptop that gets handled a lot and might be wiggled inadvertently.Write speed storage (I got the 256GB one) is great.  Even stood up to some static shocks from touching it without grounding myself after walking around on our office carpet.
1,Bought this because of the size. It won't stick way out of the side of my PC. I have10 other traditional ones that I've used for years.This one initially worked OK. 256GB...I added 2000+ files to the stick. I was later able to delete them.Next time I tried to add even one file it took several minutes. It took 3 seconds to delete a single file.I tried this on other PC's. I used one of my older ones in the USB port and it worked OK so it wasn't the port.I won't buy this style again. Waste of money.
5,It's good the speed never drops below 10-20mb a sec and most the time is at 120-140 even on my slow af usb 3.0 laptop.
5,Needed something discrete for music in my mini Cooper this was perfect. Have had no issue getting music on and playing in my car. Music turns on immediately when car is started and it has not failed to start just as fast.
4,it works
2,Gets too hot when using it. It makes me doubt if it will damage my laptop's usb port...
5,I used this to store music for my pickup radio.  Works fine.
5,Great storage capacity in such a tiny form factor and amazing price. Works great for extra storage on my MacBook Pro without having to carry around a bulky hard drive and usb cable. Fast and low profile. I will get more of these as needed!
5,This flash drive has fit all of my needs and was a great replacement to my older drive. I currently use it to store high megapixel photos and it works great. Would recommend!!
5,This was perfect for uploading photos during a 10 day trip.  Each day I uploaded from camera to this drive via my laptop.  It is so small that it barely protrudes from my laptop so I could place the computer back in its bag with the drive still in.
5,This works for me as a handy and fast back up device.
5,Works well to add additional storage for my Nvida Shield
4,Good capacity small side. I am using to listen music in my car. Is slow to write but is ok.
5,This little flash drive is awesome. It doubled the space on my Macbook Air.
4,the cost per GB is fantastic but the plastic they use is incredibly cheap and brittle...  if you are plugging it in and unplugging it constantly it doesn't hold up
4,These worked fine but are so small.  I decided to use them to copy some important files to and put in our safety deposit box for safe keeping.  I ended up buying an external drive for what I was originally going to use these for.
5,Great for my laptop
4,GOOD ITEM
4,this drive is hot literally just like other reviewers said. I had it plugged on my nvidia shield tv it does what it supposed to do so far it works well
5,So far so good. No issue. Hopefully it will last.
5,I use this in my tesla for sentry mode.  Works great for that very small hard to notice.
5,ok
5,Great compact flash storage device. Smallest usb device and relatively comparable to older micro usb models size. Good price in terms or capacity and affordability. Don’t waste your money on internal ssd when you can have this capacity and speed. Only decision maker would be how likely you are to lose it or not.
4,Drive becomes hot to the touch almost painful after use. This is of course fine - I'm sure. I wouldn't get concerned about drive life. But it is a weird phenomena.
3,took me a bit to realize that it would be smart to have at least a USB in my house for any purpose that might arise and decided on a 128 GB 3.1 flash drive seeing it would be plenty adequate. never had to make use of it until today when I tried loading video files on it and saw that mine was only 32GB flash drive. had to double check and I did indeed buy the 128 GB version unfortunately this was 3 months later from when I bought it. lesson learned. No complaints so far other that it does heat up quite a bit and of course sending me the wrong capacity sized USB.
5,Works great inexpensive and very small. Does get a little hot but I have a couple of other micro flash drives and they too get hot but it doesn't seem to affect how it works. My 2012 Nissan Leaf was having trouble reading a 32gb drive so I got this to see if the smaller drive would work better on the older car and boom works great! and for the price you can't beat it.
5,It's short profile is perfect. It does not caught/bump on other things that over time loosens the usb port.
2,The speed and storage is great on this drive but two things to note: #1 is its is extremely cheaply made. I know I keep saying this but the entire drive is a thin platic device. For my needs it is strictly being used for extra storage on a laptop that I do not feel the need to spend time or money upgrading to a larger drive. #2: If you are using it to transfer files between machines then I do not see it holding up. Look for a drive with metal connectors as this one has a plastic one. I love a bargain myself but this drive as I said is just meant for me as a cheap source of file storage. And frankly none of the files stored are valuable to me. You have been given a fair review.
3,If you're using this for basic storage small files etc it is perfect.  If you plan on using this to stream movies or large files the drive literally gets too hot to touch and will throttle the transfer speed to under 10mbs which defeats the purpose I got this for.
4,Very good flavor
5,SanDisk  the leader in the industry.  enough said.  oh and at this price a excellent value too..
4,I love how portable modern flash drives are.  This one is super fast and very very small.  The good part about that is it’s eash to keep on you all the time in your bag or on your key ring but it’s also easy to lose.
5,Works very well in saving storage on my Firestick.
2,Pretty upset that this only had 480GB of useable space. If I wanted 480 I would have asked for 480. Now I know there's never really a completely blank drive there's always a little bit used but this is nuts. I'll probably return this and get a different brand. Sucks because I'm a pretty big fan of these guys.
5,I use it for music in my truck. I loaded a few hundred songs on it and keep it in the truck usb slot. Because of the low profile i don't worry about hitting it and breaking it inside the vehicle
5,Very small and compact.  My worry is not being able to find it it's so small.
5,I use this to backup my files (in addition to Dropbox)
3,Am giving this 3 stars because I bought 2 of these at the time(2-3yrs ago)  to expand my Amazon Fire TV storage. One failed within a month ( it is unreadable). So am very much disappointed given the cost at the time. The other one is still working so am 50% satisfied. I bought these because of the compact nature of the device small and barely noticeable. Time will tell.
4,I really liked the price of the Flash Drive but it just didn't come with a cover. I keep it in a separate compartment when it isn't being used.
5,Compact and out of the wayPerfect
5,No problems with this thus far. I needed a high-ish capacity thumb drive to replace an older one. Thus far this is working fine.
5,Works flawlessly on my PlayStation 4. Was able to transfer videos without any difficulty and am able to watch them on my personal computer. Great product by Sandisk as always.
5,Great price for this flash drive. It is good quality. The only thing is that it says 256GB but it is actually only 225GB when you plug it in. But still worth the price. Maybe if you do a complete format on it before you use it then it would say 256GB. But when you first plug it in it is only about 225GB.
4,I use this in my Raspberry Pi Zero running RetroPie. It is the perfect low-profile fit for my small system. I would recommend where low-profile is needed.
1,Yes I know that storage drives are always less than advertised because of the base 10 or base 2 difference (for example mebibyte or megabyte difference) this is NOT that issue.For example a "512 GB" drive really will actually be around 476 GB when you plug it in. The problem is that this drive is 460 no matter what you do.I use Windows Mac Linux all of it. I am a computer engineer and work on these things a lot. Trust me; the drive I received is not up to capacity.If you had a 512GB drive and tried to mirror-copy it over to this drive I guarantee you it will not fit.I either got a fake or SanDisk missed the mark on this one (maybe that's why it was on sale).Returning immediately.
2,The desrition claimed it can read/write at 103 MB/s. Never achieved anything higher than 60 MB/s with USB 3.1. Avg R/W speed when transferring from a SATA 3GB/s HDD is around 30 MB/s. Heck my Wifi gives me similar speeds.
4,A must have for your car no more piles of loose CD's
4,I bought 2. One was a dud.  It was an easy replacement but I'd be hesitant on this very affordable drive to be the only place a file was stored
5,This the best product for my old laptop. I added to the memory of my laptop in addition to 4 GB of RAM and my old laptop is running better than when I first got it 1 decade ago. Granted the processor is not as fast as the processors on  laptops out on the market now but it definitely gets the job done for what we use it for at home.
5,Easy to use-very portable once put on a key ring
5,I use mine everyday and it works great!  It faster than most I have used in the past.  Highly recommended
5,Has excellent storage and serves it purpose very well! Love it
5,I bought it to use mainly as a boot-disk. Works very well. As fast as any other USB 3.0 drive.Best part is how small it is. Doesn't get in the way at all.Only part I didn't like was how small the hole to attach it to a keychain is - but that comes with the low-profile nature. I just put a string on it instead to keep from losing it.
5,I am using this to record video in my tesla.  I'm amazed at the capacity of this drive that is no bigger than the end of my thumb.  Great value.
5,Small and easy to use with any pc or laptop. Depending on the storage size you can store quite a bit it won’t store a vast amount but if you need it for only a few documents this will be all you need.
5,Perfect for data mules. Stores enough to be useful but small enough to hide in various places. Who needs a neural implant corrupting your brain when you can just load this up then perform your own low tech implant.
5,Yes
5,What more can you say when a product meets your expectations?  Well done sandisk.
4,What can I say ?  'It Works and does the job. As far as the increased speed I cannot discern that however if this is the latest innovation in USB speeds  then why not pay the $4.00 difference and for just a moment have the latest.  Semper Fi
5,I’ve gone through so many USB’s because I forget to take them out of my laptop which causes them to break or bend.. but this is perfect because it doesn’t stick out so I can leave it in my laptop with no worries!
3,The unit I got would periodically unmount itself as I was copying data to it.  I'd have to start the copy over again.  After about a half a dozen times of seeing this in an hour I decided that it wasn't worth keeping - I had no confidence in it.In general I have had good luck with SanDisk drives and I am not soured on the brand nor am I saying that my experience is typical.  I'll probably try another but my initial experience was poor.  YMMV.
5,As small as it can be made.  Totally secure eyelet on it not some little attachment that will break off.  It does read at 130 MB/s as promised wrote seq. at about 50 MB/sec.This is a plastic case.  Previous thumbs of this size were in metal cases which always corrorded when worn around my neck.  So the plastic will be good.  But is sure gets hot!
5,Tiny usb with massive storage. Ive been using this on my tesla for sentry mode. This has been holding up pretty well.
5,Perfect if you need a low profile and not have anything sticking out to much. Bought for neo geo stick works great.
5,Works great and is actually fast. Though this is the only drive I have ever had heat up on me during idle or use(just warm..not hot and I can touch to the face after use). I love that it has NO light. I never use the software that comes with zip drives so can't comment on that. For the money it was a very good buy in my book.
5,Small enough and unobtrusive. Trusted brand
5,Really small really good thumb drive. I use it to store audio files for my car stereo. The little blinky light shows read/write activity and that's fun to watch and let's you know that it's working.
5,Got this for a retro pi build. Works great.
2,This thing is super slow. I cant get over 24mbx out of it. Then watch it dip down into the 2mbs. I am using usb 2.0. This is downloading to the drive.
2,I use this product to store audio files and loops for recording music.  It's super convenient on my laptop but the 512GB version continuously loses its connection to the computer causing programs to hang.  Removing and reinserting fixes the problem but it interrupts recording sessions every half hour and causes data loss during live sessions.  Before I used an external USB hard drive for the same purpose with zero problems.  I'm returning and buying a similar thumb drive product from another manufacturer.
5,un excelente producto de entrada al mover la computadora golpe el USB contra la pared realmente fue un golpe suave y dejo de funcionar ningún USB nunca había salido tan delicado como este
5,Use it this for my Blink home camera system. Inserted into hub and was recognized immediately. No issues works great!
5,This will be dedicated to use with the Blu-ray player. The small size and black color allow it to blend into the front panel perfectly. It is thin plastic but seems fairly sturdy for in-home use. Don't think it would be a good idea to throw it in a pocket with a set of keys.  It doesn't seem to generate much heat. Very fast on USB 3.
3,Unlike the previous version of this the Ultra Fit this one has a plastic plug instead of metal and doesnt come with a cover or strap to hang from. And whats the point of making it "usb 3.1" if its not even faster than the 3.0 version. In fact according to the specs its actually SLOWER
5,Works as expected. Thinking of buying another.
5,This is a small fairly snug fit along the edge of my SurfaceBook and a very good value for expanding the storage capacity! It reads/writes data very quickly and is easy to leave in place. (I liked it so much I bought a second one on the Black Friday deals!) I've used SanDisk flash drives for years and these are living up to their brand!
5,Installed my PS4 as external hard drive works great I have spiderman installed on it and I have zero lag or issues playing it
5,Got this for my Roku... works great to store media. Transfers on the laptop are fast but not extraordinarily so. It's a little flimsy so be careful. Well worth the asking price though.
5,low profile memory stick.  Fits great in Surface tablet without sticking out and getting in the way all the time.
2,I purchased the 128gb model and if you simply use it for a few minutes straight it will quickly get very hot and after a while of using it regularly I guess it got too hot and died it still (barely) works if I only use it for a few seconds at a time.
5,Great product. Perfect use when perfection is required.
5,I use this to maintain all of my work materials. It provides the ability for me to transfer this to my home laptop and leave my work laptop @ the office. Excellent product. Due to its miniature size I keep it in an emptymedication container-easy to stick in my tactical pants pocket or stick in one laptop bag or the other.
2,I bought three of these SanDisk Ultra Fit USB 3.1 flash drives and all of them broke within a month of use. After limited use they stopped being recognized by my laptop and PC workstation when inserting them into a USB port. They were formatted by MAC OS and Windows 10 as exFAT devices because I wanted the device and files recognizable by both operating systems. Fortunately they weren't too expensive and not a big investment to lose. Still durability could be a lot better IMO.
3,It's a 128GB USB3 storage device. It served that purpose well. However the shell around the USB connector is very thin plastic and easy to break. If you mostly use it for backups or for leaving it in a RPi4 then it should last but if you plug/unplug it often I don't expect the thin plastic to last very long.
5,Happy with the storage!Works like it should.
2,I own  several ultra fit drives. because of the form factor it's the most convenient drive i ever had. previously the casing was made of metal and was very sturdy and reliable. now the manufacture switched to plastic which does not withstand active use (in my case). mine cracked in less than three weeks. too bad it used to be a very good product.
5,So its been working well.  I would recommend that as soon as you recieve it run test for authenticity.  LOTS of counterfeit out there.  There are both Windows and Linux tools that can easily do this for you.
2,The product is marketed as 512GB. The difference of storage space lacking is either six seasons of a "television" video series from apps or one video game downloaded and installed. The only reason why the product is not reviewed of one star is the compact and ease to plug in and use. Sandisk obviously is concerned about using less metal material evident with the carbon-fiber-like USB-A surrounding material in lieu of the typical outer metal material for the USB-A plug. The drive has a habit of disconnecting and reconnecting as well with noticeable heat not hot but warm to the touch.
5,This thing is tiny. It has great read/write speeds. When used with a device with a sunken USB port it can be a pain to remove. It is so small (but that's the point) that I'm afraid I'm going to drop it into oblivion somehow.
1,Edit: Changed to 1-star rating:Changing a previous 3 star to a 1 star rating:  Guess I was overly pleased with initial set up and use.  Drive failed the 2nd morning it was used.  Extremely hot to the touch and Xbox no longer recognizes as an avail able drive.  Additionally Xbox no longer recognizes that USB port. My uneducated guess is something to do with the extreme heat of the USB Drive.Will be returning this due to the extreme Heat build up on the drive and the amount of unavailable data space (Almost 10% of the drive is unavailable for use)I left my original rating/comments below:---------------------------------------------------Initial Review:  Wanted an inexpensive external storage to store/play games on the Xbox One X... with quicker load times.  Had seen a few reviews with this working on the PS4 but didn't find / or overlooked any mention of the Xbox. Bottom line...  it works.  Playing games from the drive works and load times are faster then the internal and the other 2TB external drive I have.My reason for the 3-star rating...  Missing 23gb both before and after the format.  Where is the other 23gb?  I was initially apprehensive as the Xbox requires a min of 256 for an external drive but after format (still showing 233GB) it loaded and played Assassin's Creed Odyssey just fine. .
2,it's so slow (write speed) that I logged into Amazon just to double check I hadn't accidentally ordered a USB 2.  (Before you ask:  Yes I have tried it on multiple USB 3 ports and multiple computers).Yikes.It was the best size / price / storage at the time I bought it on Amazon.  And the form factor really is wonderful.  But the write speeds really make that not so useful unless you're doing incremental backups or something and planning to leave it plugged in 24/7.
4,Great little device...speeds are good..
5,I transferred music from the 80s and 90s on cassettes  to this card and they were at least 10 of them and I felt it could take alot more.
5,Very nice i use this to record gameplay on my Xbox One X for my YouTube Channel and this works perfectly very small and portable easy to transfer from Xbox to PCGreat USB Flash Drive
4,Pretty fast super fast with large files but slower with lots of tiny small files (like 2000 is lots). It gets super hot but thats about it. 5 starts if didn't get hot and didn't stick out quite as far. Has a lanyard attachment too which is nice.
5,This is a very fast and very small usb flash drive....I use it to keep a second os on and it works great for that.
5,Great product use the 16gb for ready boost on my computer no problems yet and one of the 32gb for nas on my router works great the 128gb I was using for backups on my pc but to small
5,Very fast delivery thankyou i got this in the weekend.Will buy again soon.
5,Best solution for low storage capacity laptops like a Chromebook. It’s small and unobtrusive design is ideal for a laptop that travels. Just bought another with a larger storage capacity for another computer. It’s great!
5,Excelente for filling  music o pictures save memories
5,Great little device has built-in encryption software and reads and writes at VERY FAST Speeds.With 128 GB capacity.  A winner!
2,I have tried to enable Bitlocker on this drive at least a dozen times. Bitlocker encryption always hangs at 99.9% completed. I have tried reformatting to NTFS and that also doesn't complete. The only way I can get this drive to work is to reformat with default values (xfat - no encryption).The female plastic usb interface housing seems very thin and flimsy but hasn't broken with ~20 very gentle insertion/removals. There was no protective cap included with the drive.This will probably work okay for very basic xfat file storage once I reformat it AGAIN. My Linux VM would not recognize the drive at all. :(
5,Plug and play...without any hassle works great for firestick extra storage space...
5,Arrived as scheduled.  Plugged it in to my router and it worked fine.  I am using it as remote backup for files.  I even linked my Raspberry Pi to it.
5,Love them! These are my boot drives for TrueNas Core! Excellent!
5,Small with a lot of capacity.  Holds all my songs so I can listen to them in the car all day without a repeat.  The only thing I worry about is loosing it because it is so small.
1,I purchased a 128gb thumb drive to put movies on for a trip and when I began the 60gb transfer the speed was pretty decent but within about 3 minutes it slowed to a crawl and the thumb drive was uncomfortably hot to the touch. I ended up moving one movie at a time and waiting for the drive to cool down between each since I was afraid of the device overeating and dying like other reviewers have encountered.
5,Since this fits in the right side USB port on my laptop I can put every file I want to save on it instead of the laptop. It's been months and it's not even 1/4 full. Works like a charm for anything I want to view study or print. Everything is backed up.
2,I purchased this 256 GB USB 3.1 flash drive to add some storage to my desktop when I was moving files upon updating to a new PC.  It is tiny and inexpensive but very slow writing files.  Speeds varied from 35KB/s to about 4 MB/s.  I also own a Sandisk Cruzer 3.0 and it writes the same files to the same computer on the same USB port from 2MB/s to about 50 MB/s.  I believe the new unit is not working correctly.  As is I would not recommend this flash drive.
1,I have never thought twice about using SanDisk products until now.  I wanted something small and portable that my wife could use to get pictures off her laptop hard drive to alleviate space.  She copied all of her pictures to this flash drive and deleted them from her hard drive.  She noticed that the drive was getting hot while the file transfer was taking place.  Now the flash drive doesn't work.  When I plug it in to my laptop it recognizes that something is there but it can't be read.  Guess I'll have to use file recover software to "undelete" her pictures and hope I get them back.  I would give it zero stars if I could.  I expected better from SanDisk because they typically have a good reputation.  Now I will think twice. Really hacked off.
5,I bought this to use on my car stereo that has a USB port on it.  It's worked great.  The extremely small size on it makes it great for that use adding no visual bulk to the stereo.  Reliable product.  Just make sure you don't lose it as it's small size means it's easy to lose.
5,Excellent low profile usb.
1,I've had this for only about 1 year and have used it once and it's already dead.  I transferred some music files to it and then it sat in my climate controlled office.  Now it won't read or write.  It gets very hot to the touch after only 2 minutes of being in the USB port.  Gives me an error that says "The disk is write protected" which completely locks me out with no solution.I have had a lot of issues with Sandisk flash drives dying within the past 5 years.  They use to be good but I can't trust them anymore.
4,I want to More Storage Capacity. Up to 512GB.
4,I am very HAPPY with this Ultra Fit USB but I was expecting 250gb but when I checked it it was only 233gb.  I do not know why?  But I am happy after that
5,I like SanDisk.  I've used many of their products.  Unfortunately I appear to have received a dud.UPDATE: I was wrong.  It was an obscure Windows bug.I have changed my 1-star review back to 5 as this product deserves.  Windows however still has its issues but that's normal.
5,These are a great product. Incredibly small in size but huge GB capacity. Well worth the price.
5,Great memory stick with large capacity at a very reasonable price. Fast and works reliably.
1,After 9 months the flash drive stopped working and i lost everything that was on the flash drive. flash drive was always disconnected correctly and was never misused. sad to lose my work.
3,Copying data is like breathing - a chuck goes fast then down to zero then fast then zero. Needs a better buffer or faster chip.  Tried both Windows and Linux - same result on multiple machines.
4,Very compact Design Easy to carry on keychain not the fastest but gets the job done lots of storage available 229 GB to be exact! But it's Plastic so you have to be careful when pluging and unplug! Overall It's a good product!! I would Recommend it!
5,I have ordered several of both these and the prior generation 3.0 drive. I have never had a failure. For the price and the size they are fantastic. They are really easy to use to pack offline work on for expanded memory for a chromebook or tablet. The only con I can think of is where is the USB C version?
5,Fácil de usar confiable portátil excelente opción.
3,It's also Plastic.I thought it was metal with a plastic handle.It works well it's FAST. and small.I wish it were metal.
5,This thing is so small in my big hands but it fits perfectly in my Tundra and allows me to play my MP3s!
5,I use this as a permanent external drive on my mac laptop. Professional photographer and educator who needs instant space for photo shoots or downloading student photos. This is a perfect solution. Runs cool. Have purchased one for my friend's mac laptop for the same reason.
5,Large storage capacity in a small package. GREAT
5,As described so far working very well
3,Not a durable drive. Thin walled plastic breaks very easily.  Would not buy again.
5,Purchased this to install into a (internal) USB port on an ASRock Z87 Extreme6 motherboard. Had no issues installing ESXi onto it a much cheaper easier and more durable solution than buying an additional drive. Plenty of space to host ESXi but obviously not recommended for guest storage. Speeds are also quite good although not as important for this use case.
1,Cheaply made plastic drive and overheat easily.
5,Use primarily for music files played on various receivers and have had no issues. Does not get hot like the metal flash drives but more care must be taken as they are plastic. Satisfied with purchase.
4,First one broke in 1 hour. Replacement has been working so far maybe the first was a defect?
5,Works like a dream!
1,I don't know if this was a Linux issue or a product issue. I have never had to format a SanDisk thumbdrive before this but my box wasn't even sure it wanted to recognize the drive before I formatted it ext3/4. I tried formatting dos and ntfs it wouldn't work in the USB 2.0 slots or even recognize it was there in a 3.0 slot. It functions fine formatted as ext3/4(Linux formatting) but loses several GB of usable space. It's still big 119GB usable space but I don't know if that's because of space used for formatting or defective space bypassed. Still a fair amount of bang for the buck just the loss of one star from my usual five stars for SanDisk and I've been buying them for about 15 years. This is the first hiccup I've had with ANY of their productsEDIT: After just shy of 4 months with minimal use it has died completely. I tried re-formatting no luck. It never did work with my Kindle Fire but the 64GB USB 2.0 SanDisk Fit(The older version of this product) works like a charm with an adapter. So I ordered two more of those.This IS the first SanDisk thumb drive that ever died on me. I have an ancient 128MB Sport Drive that still holds data. It's just too small to be of much use now lol.
5,I love this little guy!  I use it with my laptop. It is running faster already. Great amount of space and a super tiny size so it isn’t in the way.
5,Set up the thumb drive to run a flavor of linux and it works perfectly.  The OS loads quickly off the drive and there is little to no noticeable lag in the execution of programs on the drive.  My only fear with this drive is that because of its size which is why I bought it I might lose it before I finish typing this review.
4,It is very small but it is hard to put on my keychain.
4,Good
5,Nice just don't loose it. Works as per design and is good backup for files and photos. Pretty fast transfer rate. Thanks
3,I know people like lite but this feels cheap it gets hot and so hard to handle because of size.  Perhaps if you stick in the back of a TV and not remove I'd say fine but otherwise I would not buy again.
5,Works as good as any other memory stick. Just trying to figure out where they put the memory. About the size of my thumbnail but just a bit thicker.
5,So cute it barely sticks out of the laptop. Great for last minute backup storage.
5,Perfect for Tesla dash cam and sentry recordings.Update 2/6/22. Burnt through 2 of these with in 9 months. Got an USB SD card reader and an WD Purple SD card in Nov 2020 no problems
4,I like a dust cap with a usb. They have a way of ending up in my pocket.Works fine if you just use them some were they can't pick up dust it will be fine.
1,I bought these fully expecting them not to be impressive but to work. Unfortunately these aren't worth even the small amount being charged. The only USB ports on my computer to recognize these are USB 2 ports. When they are recognized they are excruciatingly slow. Avoid these and pay more if you need something that works as it should.
5,Always a plus to have additional memory!
5,I purchased this for my model S tesla. It works great for the dash cam. Not much bad to say as it appears to be working perfectly and is extremely small
5,I use this to play music through the infotainment system in my Chevy Colorado ZR2 it works perfectly and doesn't seem to get hot.
5,Been using SanDisk for years. Their products just work as described.
3,While this is a cute little unit and it doesn't stick out of your computer very much I think it runs too hot to be a long lasting device and even when just plugged in and idle it is hotter than I expect memory to be.  I don't use this anymore but have it saved away in a box with some micro SD cards.I repurchased on memory and bought a full size Sandisk thumb drive and I'm happy with that and use it for data transfer between Chrome books.
5,Works as a an extended storage for PS4. Just make sure to "stop using" device before turning off PS4.
5,I purchased this to record my sentry mode recordings on the Tesla; no issues after about 10 recordings!
5,Small sleek and easy to use. Plug and ready to use. No issues using it on the computer or playing music in the car from the files on it.
1,Loaded the disk up with data and ejected from Mac computer. Mounted and tested data on Mac PC and Roku without issue a few days ago. Connected to computer today to add more and nothing happens. Tried Mac PC and Roku and it simply is not recognized and I have been unable to get it to do anything. Other drives I have scanner etc all mount fine so I know there isn't anything wrong with the computers or ports. Frustrating considering all of the work I did backing stuff up. Sending this back.
5,Great price and great portability
5,Great product.  Does what it is supposed to do.  Did not work for what I intentionally bought it for but that has nothing to do with it... more an issue with the car.
5,Bought these to use in my car stereos because they don’t stick out so far and have a sleeker look.
1,I bought the San Disc 32gig flash drive to put music on it so I can listen to it while driving cross country.I spent the time on the computer making sure the music downloaded.  I put it in the mp3 player in my truck and immediatly got the error no audio files present.I took out the  flashdrive went into the computer and saw that that it indeed did have the names of music files.  But after I tried playing them on the computer nothing would happen.I reflashed the drive tried again on the computer and nothing...this is the first time I've had to regret buying San Disk.  But thought I'd warn others.
4,Make sure to keep an eye on it so it doesn't get lost easily.There are better options for that price because its writing speed isn't good enough.
3,Definitely gets hot reading and writing but even just leaving it in the port it gets hotter than I would prefer.I’m using it as a Nintendo disk backup and will rarely be touching it so it’s probably fine but still worrisome.
5,Small compact and fast.
5,Formatting it for Tesla FAT32 took a while. If the size is over 32G Windows formats it as ExFAT. I ended up doing it on my MAC.But once I did it it worked perfectly.
4,I like how small this is and don't stick out from the laptop.
5,Sandisk is always a good choice.
5,This memory works with the Amazon firestick 4K and the OTG cable.It does get a little warm but who cares.
5,Thanks it looks great for saving my good stuff...
5,Small and works great. Seems a little fragile when handling but it is not.
5,I had the USB 3.0 version of this hard drive and loved it so much I jumped when I saw this faster higher capacity version. It works like a charm and I leave it plugged into my laptop all the time. It's fast small enough that I don't have to wrry about breaking it accidentally. Would highly recommend!
5,Could not be simpler amazing technology
1,The drive failed within a year. Fortunately I was able to copy to another drive just in the nick of time. Took 4 + hours to have everything copied over then when I tried to delete files folder by folder -- so long that I finally abandoned that. Tried to reformat rather than delete and the USB drive wouldn't reformat.
5,I stored 10000 of thousands of business documents on an external hard drive until it crashed.  Fortunately it was a device failure and my data was recoverable.  That caused me to move into the cloud.  As an additional backup this flashdrive holds my documents.  I update it weekly.  Mental comfort is worth the minimal cost.  Highly recommend.
5,De acuerdo a lo esperado
5,It's not the most cheap but it's the most convenient it has a fast transfer rate for small and big files also solid connector to last when used daily.It's a safe buy. Go for it.
5,Plugged it in to an Nvidia Shield to use as shared system storage about two months ago. Humming along just fine.
5,Perfect size and stays in the laptop. Doesn’t cause snagging. Great capacity.  Love it.
4,The drive works well. For about half of year there are no problems. Feels to warm after the use. In my opinion it's too small - easy to misplace.
1,It doesn’t perform speeds like a 3.0 drive seems slow and runs way to hot
4,Bought this for my wife. It was great!
5,Item worked just as it was supposed to and arrived on time. Great product and price
2,Bought it in Feb 2021 and now fails and not recognized by Tesla car or PC now in Dec 2021
5,I have a small portable laptop that I use on a regular basis. This unit works great for a back-up and for file storage. It doesn't get hot just a little warm. It's size was the key selling point for me... put in the laptop and put in the brief case. Yes I will purchase again.
4,Needed for car stereo.Don't forget to format thumb drive at Fat32 for radio to read.
5,This worked like a dream for linux mint. The laptop I was using was very new and linux did not have support for the existing onboard wifi. I bought this for $10.00 and plugged it in and it worked right off the bat.
4,Works well and transfers data quickly... but as in the title gets uncomfortably warm when in use (read/write).
4,i bought this to expand my storage one Nvidia Shield and it worked Great.It's plenty of storage for my Needs and is easily removed if needed elsewere.Great Product.
5,Used to back up a bunch of photos I needed to transport. Barely notice it sticking it out of my laptop. Down side is that it would be easy to lose.  Small and dark in color ... don't drop it down a sewer grate. You'll never see it again! Seemed to have a fast write speed from my ASUS laptop.
1,I purchased the 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive as an extra Flash drive because it is really small and less likely to get bumped and damaged. I plugged this Flash Drive in my desktop today and it says that it is a 32 GB Flash drive. I know mistakes happen but I paid for 128 GB and I only got 32 GB (1/4th of the storage I expected). I would like for the seller or manufacturer to make this right.
5,Bought for travelling works perfect stores data quick
1,This flash drive cannot save data and cannot be reformatted on either MacBook Pro or Windows pc after I had it for just over a month.
3,Disappointed! All plastic. Usually some pieces are metal.... feels like they cheaped out on quality.I was upset to see that there's only 114GB usable when it's listed as 128GB. This has some crap to do with how bytes are translated blah blah blah.... Still feels dishonest since I have 120 GB of data that this drive won't hold.
5,These are considerably faster than other USB 3 drives i have.  i am using these to install different linux distros and other software they they are so much faster than my old ones.  Glad i picked a few of these up.  I have been running Proxmox FreeNAS and other SW from these.  they boot great.
1,Edit: Drive lasted about 8 months then went into the dreaded SanDisk "protect" mode (read all the other reviews or search for it) and the drive is generally useless.  I do not trust these micro-sized drives they get WAY too hot and have no reliability.First beware that this tiny little "128GB" drive formats to a much smaller size (114GB on my windows OS).  That is not a pro or con though - just a fact of marketing and today's OS vs. drive manufacturers inability to choose and follow a set standard.  That said it is marketed to speeds up to "130MB/s" transfer rate and in my testing never even got past half that rate on the read side... and the write side was FAR worse at about 4-8MB/sec.  Over extended transfer large folders with MANY files totaling 111GB the average transfer rate I got on a USB 3.0 port was 25-30 MB/sec at best.  Also this drive gets HOT really hot.  In reading other reviews I am not surprised at the failure rate.  I do not expect mine to last.  The casing is entirely PLASTIC an insulator that makes it even harder for this thing to dissipate heat.  In the future I'm sticking to the metal Samsung drives.  Even the previous SanDisk Ultra Fit all metal drive was better!
5,I added this to an Nvidia Shield media center. It allows more apps to be added and helps buffer video content. Over all a big improvement in Shield performance.
4,Good
4,I took it out after a couple hours and was hot as heck. I guess if you keep it in your laptop it will be okay. I do really like it other then the heat issue. It makes a great download or backup drive.
4,Works fast. However the material doesn't seem durable. I'm almost certain that it will come off or break in the long term. Unibody metal design versions should be preferred provided hat all the other specs (speed etc.) are the same or very similar.
5,This drive does a great job. I have had no trouble with it at all. No stuttering on downloads; good flow of data. Can't find a thing to complain about.
5,This is a great product: reliable and capable of storing lots of info. The size is just ridiculous you even forget it is connected. I bought if for my Chromebook and it was very easy to set as default locations to storage big filesMy only recommendation is leave it connected because a device this small can easily be lost.
5,Not much to dislike about this usb. Works great.
5,I bought it to use with my FM modulator in my car. So far I haven't an issue and I suspect won't.
5,Work perfectly with my PS4 pro!
5,I use it for my 256GB SSD laptop and I am satisfied. I have connected this flash drive to this laptop permanently. I didn't feel any heat while transferring 90GB of data. The write speed is 20Mb/sec and read is little faster but I am happy with this. I now have 256 extra storage for my laptop.
5,My old 128mb drive was to long i was afraid i would damage the USB socket in my dashboard.  This one is so short you would not no it was there.
5,Love how portable it is! Small but big on space! Very fast in transferring items over to flash drive!
5,I love that I can encrypt the device. Very tiny can be easy to lose but a great product. Amazed by the physical size to data storage size. Perfect for traveling light. Small enough I can leave plugged into my laptop while traveling without worrying  about it ruining the USB port or the device itself.
5,Great compact 256GB USB Flash Drive
5,Use this to store music and plug into USB port in Auto.  Because it is Sooooo Short it doesn't get in the way other things and the storage capacity is amazing.  For $10  you  can't go wrong.
5,Love it so tiny had to attach a ribbon so I don’t lose it.
5,The order is shipped very fast.
3,This flash drive is 15MB/s Write and130MB/s Read. Not very fast. It's also so tiny you'll have trouble removing it from the port. So add a key ring to it to help pull it out. Otherwise it's great for those car stereos with USB ports. Stay inconspicuous my friends!
5,I leave this plugged in to my laptop all the time this is my third USB that I use for extra storage. No issues with it so far just wish it was a little flatter of a profile for leaving it plugged in or came with a cap so I could leave it on my keyring - its kind of an awkward carry otherwise.
1,So I have used Sandisk for years and thought this was a great option as a backup drive for my laptop - small plugs into USB port (so can transfer data from laptop to desktop if needed) and cheaper than an equivalent ssd. Bad Choice!  Bought this from AMZN in August 2018 and only started using it in the last month or so and now it is dead. I tried to write an 8GB ISO file from my Windows 10 desktop machine to this USB key and it all started file until about 13% into the  copy when the transfer rate dropped to about 2.77MB/s and then to... zero.  No worries just cancel and try again; no luck!  Tried to fully format - no luck. Tried to copy ISO again - no luck. It makes a good plug for an open USB port. As an actual USB key - its junk.  Comes with a 5 year warranty lets see how Sandisk handles this failure as this failure mode seems very common in the 14% of 1-Star AMZN reviews by verified purchasers.  I would not recommend this product and even if I get a 500% perfect replacement from Sandisk .... I don't trust this design (runs hot when writing to it) for anything other than a mechanical port dust cap.
4,Bought this with the intent of using it in a Tesla to capture footage from the on-board cameras. It’s speed portability and capacity have been ideal so far.
5,Works great in tesla for dash cam and sentry cam
5,The small size is nice in that it doesn't protrude from my laptop like other flash drives that I have to be careful not to damage with movement.  The one thing I am not happy with is that it is advertised as a 128 GB but it actually only has 114 of storage space.  That fact should be disclosed upfront with "...128 GB...".
5,I use these on my Chromebook and download directly to them instead of internal memory.  I can leave it plugged in all the time and it's small size doesn't interfere with portability or storage. Highly recommend!
4,ALL plastic.  The previous generations had a metal connector and a more durable feeling plastic shell.  These are all plastic and a little tough to insert.  Speed is solid.  No problems so far.
2,Originally I thought this was a bait and switch: advertise USB 3.1 speeds provide USB 1.0 hardware. I was getting ~4MB/sec write speeds -- which clearly isn't right.Bear in mind that the disk came from the factory formatted as exFAT. Out of options I decided to run a full exFAT format (even though the factory had already done that right? Right??). After running a full format I got 20MB/sec to 30MB/sec write speeds which is in line with benchmarks I've seen on review sites.The full format took hours to complete. I like the drive now but getting to this point was really upsetting.
5,Using this for playing audio books on an in-dash car stereo.  Compact dimensions make it less prone to being accidentally hit.  I was initially worried it would be difficult to pull out but it has a nice little tab that’s easy to grab.  It really is USB 3.1 can port files quickly.
3,I bought this thinking I was going to get better transfer speeds from upgrading to 3.1 from USB 3.0. NO its about the same or worse lol and that's even after converting it to NTFS ! ! Plus the item is really fragile. I have not broke it yet since I only had it for 2 days but its probably will happen! The plastic abound the USB connection is wafer thin! Save your money and stick with a more durably made USB 3.0 for now costing 30 percent less than this one !
5,Typically great Sandisk quality - works without a hitch!  This is a perfect addition to any of the newer lighter notebook computers with SSDs.  I have it in my MacBook Air and it just barely sticks out so still fits in all of my various bags sleeves etc.  Highly recommend!  :-)
5,It’s small and that’s what I like about it it does not get snagged on things anymore.
2,It seems weird that a big-name company would make a keychain USB that doesn’t fit on a keychain. Yet here we are.
3,Storage is accurate haven't used long but the drive is made of cheap plastic and feels very flimsy. If you had this in your pocket and sat on it it'd probably get crushed and damaged.
5,I keep this drive inside an empty prescription bottle with a lid so I don't lose it. Works flawlessly and holds lots of files.
1,It would take 3 days to transfer 20GB. This is an awful device. Don't buy it
5,My main complaint about USB flash drives is that the cheaper ones eventually break physically or the flash goes bad. This one is small and has worked great for a couple of years.
4,Only gripe is it is impossible to grip to take out of new USB sockets that are still quite grippy!
5,Great products. Really recommended.
4,Good product fast transfer speeds however it will not work in the BMW I-drive sound system. I'm keeping it for backup files.
3,I attached this flashdrive to my streamer so it was working at lest several hours a day. It gets extremely hot even after a few minutes of use. The build materials which are mostly plastic are not handling such temperatures well. In my case the device was toast only after 6 month.
5,Mag 410
5,Well known brand with great size and storage.
5,Great capacity and speed but fragile and easy to lose. I'm using it as a permanent storage for my WiiU. It does the job perfectly for that but don't buy it as something you would carry around. It would break or you'll lose it.
5,BlackMagic Disk Speed Test write speed 50+ MBs.
5,Great price and received quickly I use it on my Blink camera.
2,Update: half the plastic cover broke off both on mine and the one my husband bought (normal careful use). Taking off another star. Fortunately no data was lost.Prior 3 star review:I was very disappointed to insert my new memory stick and see that it sticks out twice as far as the old version. The old version only went up to 64 and I needed more space so I tried the new 256. I feel like it could get caught on something.  Also it's quite warm to the touch even when not in use.
4,Great usb device. Great storage. Just wish they had 512 gb at this size but great compact storage.
4,It does what you need it to do. It's a small light and fast USB Flash Drive. It may be too light and feels cheap and easy to break but I've had no issues so far.
4,Hot to touch. Unlike previous versions of Fit the casing is pure plastic and can't act as a heat sink I guess.
5,I use it for sentry mode in my tesla.
4,Nice drive with good security features
5,super tiny works fast. I also liked the "security vault" app that comes with it.one thing to consider: the USB connection is exposed so dust and other particals can get stuck in it over time and you better keep it in clean environment putting it in your pocket / backpack might not be the best idea
4,They do have the right storage I need. But they are hard to put in and te take out. Also because they are small they are easy to misplace.
5,Fast transfer speeds and reliable. These are really small perfect if you plan to leave them in the USB port.  However if removed from the USB port they could be easily misplaced.
5,Very compact with a lot of storage
5,Good storage and was a better value than an electronics store by a lot!
5,Good size both physically and in digital storage space. Easy to keep on laptop while on the go
4,Great product...been using a verity of SanDisk flash drives for years and they are always great quality. Only disappointment is no cover for the USB end like on the previous 128GB model I have. (Only reason it doesn’t have 5 stars)
5,I put this in my everywhere POS laptop.  It's been around the world with me and abused like an indentured servant.  No issues and it just keeps working.  Bought another for the wife and her travels.  Use it mainly for videos but also a few encrypted files.  No complaints.
5,super fast response the big benefit is the capacity and that it is unlikely to get broken because it does not stick out of your computer it can be expensive especially if you break the USB port on the main board of your computer. Great product
3,256GB quality is concerning in the quality of plastic - feels cheap. It does not have a light to indicate its mounted and no cover to protect the mount when traveling. Concerns over quality make it unlikely I’ll use it for anything more than disposable files.
5,High quality housing small size for portability and easy to use.
5,Fit in Tesla console box without obstruction
5,This Flash Drive is compact and is super reliable.
5,Easy to install and works great!
5,Tiny form factor fast
4,not a true 3.1 usb. it fits a 3.0 usb slot
5,This plug in is easy to lose so be careful!  However it is very convenient especially if traveling.  I was able to put my whole word data on one of these to take with me overseas.  Not sure about how long the data will last on the plug in but so far so good!
5,My car has a USB port that I use for all my music. I use this drive and it works great. Fast read times and very small. Love that it doesn't stick out too far!
5,I just fit over 3300 songs on this drive for my car stereo. The car reads it much faster than my old usb drive. It is so small and it takes up no room in the glove box. The coolest. How can that much data fit on this tiny drive and work so well. Amazing like magic
5,A great product at a great price.  Fantastic storage device for digital everything.
3,64 Gb is a bit small and I don't like the plastic metal would be better.  Does build up heat.  Not back for the money.
5,Use it as my dashcam card. Previous USB keys failed—maybe too slow. This one works well.It is super tiny. Works well in my case and if you intend to keep it attached—but seems like it would be easy to lose otherwise.
5,I love it. It is super easy to store and to use. I was afraid I would lose it pretty easily but I just attached to my keychain and it works perfectly.
5,Small perfect capacity for what I need and a decent price.
5,Just what I was looking for easy to use...great storage...perfect size...I'll be purchasing another
4,Great MP3 storage for auto. Gets very hot from use.
4,So Far so Good 256 k and fast
1,The product was returned. This flash drive has a very thin plastic body that cracked broke off and got stock inside my USB port. I had to use a headlamp and plastic tweezers to carefully remove several broken off plastic pieces from my USB port/slot. I ordered all-metal SAMSUNG FIT Plus and SAMSUNG BAR Plus USB flash drives instead.
5,Works great also works on a PlayStation classicThe 256 gig will not work on PlayStation classic unless you are using a usb hub
5,Bought to increase storage capacity of a small Dell laptop/tablet.  Plugs into a USB 3.0 slot.  Compact.  Out of the way.  Best way to increase capacity by 128 GB without buying SSD from Dell.  At reduced Black Friday price it was 5 stars in all categories.  Should have bought more!
4,I like fact that it is very small for all the data it can hold but it gets lost sometimes because of its size! The other thing that it has an effective capacity ~ 114GB instead of the declared 128GB.
5,Using this in Blink sync 2
5,Perfect size for leaving in laptop.
5,Worked great came fast!
5,These are fast work reliable and I have yet to have issues with SanDisk products. Definitely recommend.When is active use these do tend to get a little warm so keep that in mind. Usually from flashing Windows ISOs over vs just general use however.
5,We were able to back-up our entire work files on this tiny thumb drive.  Worked fine.
5,Good price excellent delivery and great size (to fit in small place)!
5,Excellent for my Tesla Sentry Mode
5,I'm using it for sentry mode for my Tesla.  It is completely unobtrusive and meets my needs.
4,It’s small in size but adequate space! However if it comes with a chain to carry  good . Otherwise it’s so small that I could lost it anytime.
4,Wonderful flash drive. Very portable doesn't take up much physical space but holds 65GB of info and is fast uploads and downloads
5,Used to live boot OS on laptops.
5,It had the capacity I paid for and works perfectly.
4,Very nice backup unit for documents or pictures.  I use to hold my music and can just remove and put in another computer with ease.
5,Arrived quickly and in undamaged condition - thanks Prime! works as expected.
5,I have chip memory in my pc and needed something fast.  Didn't want a record player to story my information.  This is a great flash drive.Strongly recommend.
5,this will not work for the front of your PSXC without soldering work but it will work with BleemSync backloading off the power cable with an OTG cable.
5,works perfectly
5,for memory storage ... great thing
5,I use this drive for backups and restore points. It's not a lot faster than a normal USB 3.0 drive and my SanDisk Extreme Portable External SSD runs about 5x faster so I'm not entirely sure why it's usb 3.1 but it's a good drive for it's size and the price.
5,It works extremely well above and beyond I have been using it for Steam purposes and it does the job...  Heat is not an issue it does it get hotbut it is not getting hot its own.  So far I have put it in performance mode and I do not think I am worried about issues in the future.
2,I bought the 128GB and 256GB models with the intent of actually storing 100+ GB of data. For that purpose these thumb drives are worthless. Write speed starts at about 40-50 MBps but after only about 1-2GB it drops down to 5-10 MBps. At that speed it would take a couple of hours to write 30 GB. Compare that to an external USB drive that can sustain speeds of 80+ MBps. The external USB drive may cost a little more but it has far more surface area to dissipate heat so it can write large amounts of data at sustained speeds.These little thumb drives are great if you are writing small amounts of data at a time...but then why would you need a 128GB drive? I suppose you could put your MP3 or FLAC collection on it (if you don't mind it taking 5+ hours to write the files to the thumb drive) so that you can play it in your car.
3,For the first 20 seconds or so the write speed is 30 - 40 MB then it drops to 20 or lower till the rest. Writing a 32GB movie takes 30 minutes or so. It gets very hot too. Not sure how long it will last.Not recommended.
5,I added this to my Chromebook and Wa-La Massive Storage Capability !!!Since I use Office 365 I'm able to plug this into my PC Update my files plug it back into my Chromebook and VIEW ALL MY OFFICE FILES...ABSOLUTELY AWESOME CHROMEBOOK NOW
5,No.more CDs for me.  I have this in my car's USB port.  I could drive.across country at 35 mph and not hear the same song twice unless I wanted to.
3,Cons: This drive is extremely flimsy. The plastic housing is wafer-thin. You have to be very very careful when handling the drive. Temperatures also get pretty warm when in use. Would be a good drive if you don't plan on moving it around otherwise be extremely careful while transporting it from one location to another.Pros:  Very affordable price for the larger capacity drives. Light weight and portable.
4,Bought to replace an older Sandisk Ultra Fit of the same size.  Went to do a bit by bit copy and the size of this new one is smaller so the copy fails.  Feels flimsy.
3,Great storage small & compact but this little guy gets extremely hot after awhile that it can actually sting your fingers to the touch.
3,You lose out on 4 GB with this drive and it tends to overheat when transferring a lot of files at once.
5,Physically the size as the previous (metal - 128GB) version but double the space and doesn't freeze/pause under a lot of data transfers.  It doesn't feel as hot to the touch as the metal one did but I'm sure that's because of the composite shell - which may or may not be a good thing since the metal helps dissipate heat.
4,128gb flash
5,This is excellent I just wish it came with a cap to put on after use.
5,I bought this for my daughter's tv. I put a bunch of her favorite movies on it so she can access them easily and watch them over and over again.
5,Is very nice
5,I like the size and performance of this flash drive.  I plan to use it when traveling with my laptop to augment its storage. I tested it on my desktop and it works well.  The size is great--small enough to leave plugged in and yet not difficult to remove.
5,Use this in my 2015 Toyota Tundra the low-profile shape is nice because I leave the drive plugged in always and it does not get in the way of other cables and interior items. Turned my factory stereo into a 64GB iPod very useful.
5,Works fine.  Bought these rather than a traditional thumb drive because they were a little cheaper.  Only draw back is they are hard to remove from a USB socket because there is very little to grab onto to remove.
5,Quite happy with this flash drive it's exactly what I was looking for in order to free up some space on my PC HDD.You even forget is here because it's so tiny so be careful when going thru airport security while inserted in your laptop to make sure it doesn't break.
5,Able to get 50 movies on this thing mp4 and basically unnoticeable when leaving it in the laptop.
5,Just what I needed works great.
5,Not the fastest USB3 flash drive but nice in that's it's so low profile and inconspicuous. I leave this plugged into my laptop for quick file transfers between machines that aren't network connected. I like that I can leave it plugged in rather than having to fish around for a USB stick that can get lost dirty or damaged in my backpack.
5,I've used this model for years and it works excellently great!
5,This is the perfect adjunct to my notebook pc doubling my total storage so I can pack in applications and store data out the USB port. I can even leave it installed when I travel. Data backup is made easy by using a second one to regularly duplicate the data and stash it in a safe place.
5,Great for laptops or tablets that have internal SSD with only 63 GB or less. Windows 8/10 uses most of that storage. This small USB 3.1 flash drive will allow you to store all your data on it thereby freeing up the SSD storage. It is so small when plugged in to a USB 3 port. Fast data transfer. Non-obtrusive.
5,I have it plugged into an on/off switched 4 port USB hub this way I can turn it on/off without removing it.  As for heat of the unit while on it's not hot just a little warm while it's on.  It's fast and works great with lots of 256GB space
5,Works great just as described I needed something small so it would no end up breaking or bending like the other drives. Works how it should.
5,Used this to extend my Firestick storage and it was easy to set up and works great!
5,I use this with the sync device for my Blink.
1,It came broken and couldn’t use
5,It works in my 2017 Tesla Model S P100D
4,Very hard to remove and not the fastest data transfer I've seen but adequate. Using them to provide music to a portable speaker and a receiver.
3,Does what it's supposed to and I love the small size. But it gets SUPER hot. I have 2 of them and sometimes the one I use with my macbook overheats and loses connection.
5,it really is the size advertised!
5,This is a very good usb! It’s sleek tiny and very fast. It’s as fast as my huge hard drive! Such a good value for money I highly recommend it.
5,Using it for my Tesla Model 3 dashcam and no issues so far. Will update after 3 months for durability.It has been 4 months and all is good! I highly recommend this or 64gb as Tesla upgrades the security feature and will record more requiring more storage in the future.
5,Using this in our HooToo travelmate that is our DLNA server in the car for long road trips so the kids can stream movies and TV shows stored on this flash drive to their devices.  No issues experienced so far.
5,Works beautifully for TeslaCam dashcam
5,Práctica y rápida
3,I have purchased these micro-sized USB thumb drives before and loved them. These however are made with a very flimsy plastic and feel very cheap. After a month I haven't even bothered to try to use them yet because they feel like they will fall apart in my hands.
3,OK it works. But I have to say the packaging of this tiny drive is ludicrous. It is ensconced in this hard plastic bubble that hugs every contour of the device. I initially thought there must be a layer you could peel away but no it's hermetically sealed inside. After embarking on a microsurgical odyssey to free the drive from the packaging I actually nicked of a bit of the plastic shell. Fortunately it still works fine but it was just so annoying.
1,I really like the very small physical size of the drive and the fact that I can find different capacities. It works well for music in the USB port in my car. It doesn't stick out so I don't have to worry about bumping it and breaking it. I've bought several of these so I can put different types of music on each one. The only thing I don't like is that there is no cap for it. The end is open so dirt and dust can get it. So far I haven't had a problem but it would be nice to have the drives protected when not in use.I'm appending my review and changing my rating to one star. I put music on one of these drives and it worked one time. I put it on my PC to try and reformat it but had no luck. The PC will not read it. I won't buy this one again!
3,The build quality is lacking. The thin plastic fell off within 3 months. And I think it's because this thing gets REAL HOT when sending data to it. Is that normal? It's literally way too hot to touch and I have some rather strong hands as a man. After I take it out of the USB port if I hold it between my thumb and forefinger I have to drop it after 2 seconds or it will burn me. Again.. is that normal?!
5,I'm using this to hold games for the Homebrew channel on a Wii it works perfectly!
5,These are so small that it's almost unbelievable they hold 128GB.  There is also a 256GB model.  They are fast and have worked flawlessly.
5,This was perfect for my digital picture frame. Small enough where there aren’t any issues with the stick getting damaged if the frame gets bumped (had an issue with a standard flash drive being a bit too long).
5,Perfect memory device!
1,This thing only worked for a few months. Then it asks me to format it but won’t format. Lost everything on it. Garbage.
4,Good fast and small.  Just what I wanted.  Gets VERY hot to touch after just a single movie transfer though.  Concerned about premature failure due to heat build up.
5,Works very well for extended storage on PS4
5,I have this plugged into the back of my portable scanner. It's perfect doesnt stick out or get caught on anything and risk damage to the drive or scanner.
5,Recomendado !!!
5,I use these in my cars for music storage. Stick them in and forget about them. Want to update tracks??? Quick and easy as always.
4,The 64-GB drive holds 57.2 GB
5,I do love all the extra storage it’s just that it gets very hot to touch! Not sure if that’s supposed to happen so I ordered a second one and will see if that one does the same thing but over all love the space!
2,I like the quickness and capacity of this drive. It is much smaller than I anticipated. If I had a USB port on my computer instead of a dongle adapter I could just leave it in the computer like a second hard drive BUT . . . that doesn't work with the adapter. I find it difficult to get in and out of any USB port even with a keyring to help as a handle.However the more concerning issue is how hot the drive is when it is ejected It's nearly too hot to handle. I wonder how long my data will last at those temperatures. It seems to heat more when plugged directly into my docking station than into the dongle adapter (which would give it more exposure to ambient air temperature -- my dock itself is always a little warm.Perhaps O should have gotten a regular size drive that might dissipate heat better?
5,I love how portable it is! I just wish that it had a cap of some sort or a small bag to store in while not I use.
5,Perfect for quick file transfer. I'll recommend putting a lanyard it is easy to misplace.
1,Slow…..worthless to me
3,it feels like the plastic is gonna melt after having it in for 30 seconds
5,Great price and storage size. speed is not up to par with usb 3 but much faster than usb 2.0. Only got 14 to 19 MB’s per sec on USB 3.0 port. Still a great buy at the price. Really very small and could be easy to loose or misplace.
5,Great to increase the size of the memory available on my MacBook Air and the size means it’s not obstructive at all.  I leave it in most of the time.  My only observation is that it heats up slightly more than I would expect but that doesn’t affect performance.
5,Love this little drive! Lots of space and so tiny. Fits nicely on tablets like the Microsoft Surfaces without making things look clunky.
3,I got this drive for my retropie setup. The drive holds all the games. Whenever I put the drive in my laptop it will run HOT which had me concerned. Thankfully it barely gets warm when it's connected to the retro game station setup. I bought the previous version sandisk thumb drive and it doesn't get anywhere near as hot literally had then both connected to my laptop and this one comes out like lava.
5,Its AMAZING how SMALL memory is these days! I remember when 20GB was HUGE on a 3.5" drive....Now for UNDER $20 (or even WAY less...) you get 64GB! I am using in a portable MP3 player....and it works perfectly! Love it!
5,Very handy and it's very good quality
5,Small unobtrusive and holds as much as my MacBook Air’s hard drive. So far a winner. Ask me again when I’ve had it for more than a couple of months.
4,It's great but I need to carry it in a little bag cause it's so small that it desappeared very easy.
5,it just works
5,Buenísimo 💯💯
5,What’s with all the negative reviews? This drive works great! Don’t believe those negative reviews they must have inferior computers and such. Works fine with PC and Mac. Just get this drive and ignore the ridiculous drivel.
5,Super small footprint.  Great performance.
3,I gave it a 3 stars because it died and I lost information stored in it. I used it on a Tesla model 3 to store the camera recording but the sandisk died due to the high  internal car temperatures. I purchased a different produc rated to withstand high temps
4,Nice unobtrusive usb from which I play my holiday music over my Denon AVR. Only shoes about 28gb available space when new. Don't know if that is normal.
5,This is almost the TeslaCam ready right after you create the folder then you don't need to re-format and start to use it.
3,I've had this flash drive for about a week now. Used it a handful of times and One thing I can say is this flash drive gets HOT. I transferred a few files back and forth from this drive and when I removed it the drive was really hot.Warning: It's made of plastic would not buy again. Especially since there is another version of it that's metal and I personally feel like that one is a lot more sturdy
5,Work well easy to use - plug and play
4,I have two potential problems so far.1- this thing gets HOT.  2 - it wasn't built exact in size so it's difficult to get in and out of moat usb ports.
4,No failure yet. Light usage for a few weeks. I plan to use this as a swap disk for a few VM's. Not sure how it will hold up.
5,Using for media playback in the car. Barely notice it visually. Plenty of drive space for all the podcasts audiobooks and other media files.
5,cheap and lots of space. I use it in my laptop to add storage without much notice.128 gb is the sweet spot on price right now at the time of review.
5,Great product
3,I purchased this to add storage to an older MacBook...I had hoped for the vaunted speeds advertised yet in testing I received 18.72 Mbytes/sec on a .5G file...Works I keep it but for Techies not as advertised.
4,Works with the SNES Mini via an OTG adapter but this thing gets HOT. The copy speed is ok and is definitely not fast enough to utilize the bandwidth USB 3.1 has to offer.
5,Good Product.
5,Profitable
5,The drive's performance meets my needs.
5,I love the small size and the ability to back up my data in case the unit is lost or stolen is a life saver
5,Using in my computer with Win 7.  It allows the "READYBOOST" feature to use the 256GB as a secondary RAM to increase the processor speed by 2 to 3 times.  Must be fast to perform the task. It works very well in this capacity.  Very pleased.
1,Do not buy this thumb drive! This is my second one that has died after minimal use. The mere act of plugging and unplugging it is enough to crack the housing and turn it into a paperweight. Even if you don't plan to plug and unplug it from you computer it is too fragile for daily use. If it gets bumped or dropped while plugged in it will die and all your files will be lost. I fell for this twice so shame on me.
4,It works and the price was good.
4,What can you say I keep music files on it to play in my truck.  It works fine.
5,Great product
3,I didn't know it would be so small.  It's about the size of a penny.  I loaded many programs on it but when I used the backup to save everything it froze up!  Tried it twice and it won't work.  Keeps freezing up and I have to pull it out of the USB port to shut it down!  I'm not sure if I can trust it now!  Might be sending it back!
5,Love this thing.  I have an old computer with 300Gb and this sits in one of the USB ports essentially doubling the storage space!
5,Primary use: audio/video files storage. Works fast and looks great. NO heat dissipation issues due to plastic body! Very low profile design fits for every application in the car audio or notebook without danger being hit and broken due to clumsiness.
5,I got this style to use on my fire stick because it's so small and doesn't take up room behind my TV.
5,Bought this to stream music from in my car.  It's small and unnoticeable when plugged in.  Works GREAT to stream music from.  Also love the size!  I bought a few more and put them in a fireproof box in my fireproof safe with photos and property stuff.
5,Great
1,Takes a good thirty to fourty seconds to mount on Windows 10 read/write speeds are not much better.
5,Good USB drive
2,The first one I received had trouble immediately. Synchronizing my Documents folder would cause it to heat up significantly and stop responding after maybe a minute. I exchanged that one and received a replacement. This is where the 2nd star comes from the return & replacement process worked very well and the replacement worked fine... until it didn't.It still heats up when reading data from it this seems understandable even if undesirable but is now refusing write access. I cannot write data to it delete data or reformat it.I have a 128GB MicroSD card that is older and far more heavily used than this and it still works perfectly fine.
3,I bought this for use in a Tesla for Sentry mode and dashcam. After a week or so I started getting intermittent warnings that the drive was too slow for dashcam (min. 4MB/sec). Maybe as the drive fills it slows? Or the looped overwriting of files causes slowdowns?
3,Flash drive arrived with a fairly obvious scrape on it. The packaging was damaged too so damage happened after it was packaged. Works fine but physical damage is obvious.
5,This is FAST. I ran Lubuntu on a laptop with this and it felt like it was booting from the hard disk. I will be buying several of these when the prices drop a bit for sure. Keep in mind for 3.1 speeds you need 3.1 ports. Some are only 3.0. They are backwards compatible though.
5,used for music in car works great
5,Work's great in my blink unit fast and reliable.
5,Great for my pocket radio/mp3 player
5,super easy to use fast and extremely portable . amazing :D
5,I bought the 256G and absolutely love this product. Despite of how some bad comments say this USB is flimsy I personally love it and can assure you that it is really not as bad has how ppl exaggerate it to be. Love the small size and the big storage.
2,this is listed as a 128 gb. we all know there's a certain amount that is used for the formatting but what I did not know was mileage varies. 2 years ago I picked up a samsung muf-128BB for something I was doing. I bought this about 2 months ago to recreate the usage of the samsung. until I was transferring data I never notice the little detail: I LOST 5 gb ON FORMATTING ALONE OVER WHAT SAMSUNG MADE AVAILABLE. so instead of 119 gb I had 114. not the biggest deal in the world but when you actually are using over 90% of the storage it makes a difference. next time I'll have to do a little more research before I hit order. in the meantime I'll live with it but pretty much the last time I go with sandisk for large storage
2,Was using this for about 13months as extra storage on a decent Dell laptop.  Today the laptop would not boot up past the Dell logo screen.  Ultimately decided to disconnect all peripherals including this USB stick to see if it would boot and it did.  The USB stick is unrecognizable in this laptop nor in other laptops/computers we have.  Seems like the USB got fried and perhaps in doing so was shorting out something so that the laptop could not perform its hardware checks at startup.It was plugged in Mon-Fri 8-6 for 13mo (less than 3000hrs) but was accessed infrequently.  Seems a bit short for failure.  Have had lots of other USB sticks in various brands including this one and this is the first failure.
4,First time using one it needed to be returned immediately because write protection turned on.
5,This was the perfect size (small) to fit in my car's USB port without me accidently hitting it with my knee (which happened before with the larger size).  16GB is enough for all my favorite tunes. If I ever run out of space I will certainly order the same size brand with higher GBs.
5,price - good.  size - excellent.  this thing is so small it's almost invisible!  adding this much storage in one step is what made this so worthwhile.of course it is so small it could easily be lost.  this is not an issue for me but it might be for some.
5,I got this to use with my Roku.  It is nice and small and blends in with the Roku unit.  Good capacity for videos.  Make sure you format it as NTFS so it is compatible with Roku if used in a similar manner.
5,Need extra storage?  This is it.
4,Worked perfectly!
3,I'll agree with the listing that that it does write faster then some of my USB 2.0 units but still it is just way too slow.  14 gigs took well over 15 minutes which for my application is just too long (I use the unit to play lossless files through my receiver).  I was expecting a much faster unit.The size and portability are good however.
5,I love these! I plug them in and leave them in my laptop as virtual hard drive expansion. They're also fast enough to run basic apps from them too.
5,This does everything it says it will do. It is my new best friend. It is faster than many of my other devices. The size is perfect for my uses- it is the size of a fingernail. File transfer is smooth and fast. I love it.
5,Works for autobleem on ps classic.Is very delicate and is fully made from plastic.I set it and forget it so it serves my purpose.Don't expect to use it day in day out for work or data transfer though..
5,Very good product. I needed a fast speed-storage device to process data between my gaming apps this device is actually doing a very good job.
4,Heats up very fast
5,Awesome!!! Small and works very well!
3,In short I'm a fan of SanDisk.  This drive was a little disappointing when it comes to speed.  Write is about 25mb/sec and read was about 35mb/sec.  Luckily I got it to read MP3 songs so speed isn't an issue.
5,Hard to beat.
5,This is a USB 3.0 drive that is awesome.  I use this in my car for digital media and the it only sticks out of the USB port a tiny bit.  Much more secure than a full size thumb drive.
4,Does it's job.
5,Works great in my vehicle as I have a USB music drive. Small and does the job. No issues and best for price/brand.
5,This product is so simple to use. I loved it so much that I ended up purchasing an additional one!
4,My only complaint is this thing runs SUPER hot. Otherwise it works well. I installed Linux to it so when I want to run Linux instead of Windows I just plug it in.
5,It is very compact and almost easy to misplace. However it’s easy to use and has super storage
2,It doesn’t get untouchably hot as the prior ultrafit but the body is now made out of plastic (versus metal).  So far so good as the memory stick hasn’t broken or cracked. But I’d prefer a metal body.UPDATE:3 months after purchasing and the plastic housing has already cracked. Will either try to return through Amazon or the manufacturer but I'm VERY disappointed at the quality of materials and the product. After just over three months of once a day use (I use the flash drive to update and download my work computer files Monday-Friday) the housing should not have cracked.While this model doesn't get as hot as the prior model there is something to be said for the metal housing that doesn't crack.
4,I do like the speed and the capacity it has.  However it will get hot.. good enough for what I need.
5,Purchased these to use to record Tesla sentry mode events. They arrived quickly and were easy to format for this use.
4,It is so small that it is difficult to remove from USB port. Needs to come with a dongle or something. Works fast and is reliable.
5,Just as described. Excellent quality and price!
3,Works fine very portable.  No activity light is something I miss compactness is great.  I haven't tested copy/move transfer speeds but it seems fine.  Fall 2019 - Feb`22: Flimsy plastic case.  Top-front plastic broke completely off although still functions.  Just gotta be careful inserting into "A" female USB.
4,Used it for my wife's laptop - good storage capacity and easy to setup and use.
4,I’ve created a multi-boot drive. Works as I expected the transfer speed is as advertised. Over twice the speed of the 2.0 version.
5,excelente
5,As spected
5,I use the usb for my car music
2,Max I’ve seen transfer speed was 40MBsMax 40 MBs W & R on usb 3.1 ports With Amd ryzen 7 pc 3days old it being so small is the only reason I’m hanging on to it. I expect 75% of advertised R & W speed but less than 25% just makes me Feel like someone taking my wallet at gun point with out even the curtesy of asking for it.....
2,I have two of the 256gb models and I'm not impressed.  One went bad after a couple of months and the write speed on both of them is miserable.  I used the linux dd command to write zeros over the entire 256gb of the replacement unit I received for the one that went bad just as a test that it worked OK and the average write speed was 18.1 MB/s and I verified that the device wasn't mistakenly identified as USB 2.  Yuk!On the positive side the read speed can get up to about 100 MB/s and Sandisk support did send me a replacement for the one that went bad without a lot of hassle.Still I think I"m going to try a different brand the next time I need one of these.
4,As expected
4,For sure this is not something you’re gonna wanna travel with but it’s light wait tiny and holds a bunch of memory so you can’t really go wrong
5,SanDisk memory drives have never let me down for so many years now.  They're compact + great-priced.
5,Fit in  my Philips Bluray perfectly.
3,bought 128 GB to download 118 GB....Was informed device is 4.9 GB short...Apparently SanDisk is a bottom dweller
5,This is good to have in a keychain. It's minimal and non intrusive. It has around 125gb of space. Decent speeds.
4,Works well so far. I did put a lanyard on it so that I hopefully won’t lose it. I can’t say for durability just yet as I only just started using it.
5,I only would like it to come with a little cap for when not in use
4,10-11 mb per second had it a while and hasn't crashed I keep it over 90% full
5,Love emI keep at least two aroundFast !
5,Works great with music for the truck radio. Size is great for the USB port that doesn't stick out from the radio to be obvious. Need to get another for th he bike radio to replace the 2 inch one I currently have on it.
5,The low profile makes it perfect for automotive use
3,Not USB 2 backward compatible. Fine in USB 3 but will not work in my vehicle.
5,So far so good👍
4,A little hard to remove due to its small size but that’s expected for a ultra small device. It gets a bit hot when writing data.  Great deal for the price.
5,Works great as stated. Would definitely recommend. Problems at the point(10-13-20)
5,I really glad that I brought this flash drive it does what I need it to do.
5,Es una memoria que aparte de su almacenamiento se puede transportar en un llavero y es casi imperceptible. Me resultó cómodo ubicarla en el llavero y es útil para guardar cualquier información la lectura es rápida.
3,I bought this to use in my Tesla to record security footage when the car is parked. It worked great for a while but then the car started complaining that the storage wasn't fast enough. Guess I'll have to upgrade to something else.
3,Still don't understand why say this product has 128 GB when it's only 114 GB. It false advertising. Don't like itl. 12 GB is a lot of storage I am not getting when I bought this USB.
5,Direct insert for USB.
5,Perfect for my car. Almost sits perfectly with the cover. Loads quickly and plays all my music. Great alternative to an ipod.
5,I liked that it had a plug that fits into your computer's ear phone jack.  This feature minimizes the risk of losing it since it's such a small flash drive.  Holds tons of information.
5,Amazing storage in a small size and super fast
5,this unit is fast and i had no issues. i put a little over 100 gig of music on it with no issues plugged it into the usb in my tesla model s and it works great!
5,Great price and size
4,The plastic is very fragile  other then that it’s small and fast
5,No bigger than a wireless mouse dongle. Seems to be speedy and large enough capacity wise
5,Tested perfect using ChrystalDiskMark. Note that Windows file backup works fine but Disk Image won't write directly to any thumb drive. The device is VERY small so it can be hidden (or lost) easily. I easily attached a lanyard to keep track of it; it has a bale for this.
5,This is a nice USB for general use.  It is not as fast as many others I have but great once the data is on the device.  Playback of videos from the device does not buffer at all.
3,I needed tis to store video but the write throughput speeds are too slow. I was seeing some periods of 2-3MB/s which is below the 4MB/s I require. I ended up purchasing the Samsung MUF-64AB/AM Fit Plus 64GB flash drive instead.
5,Bought this to put a live disk on it. Having a portable image on something this small is super convenient but it could also easily get lost in a pocket.
4,gets really hot.
4,Sometimes it self ejects or loses connection to my computer might be a bad USB port on my computer and not the thumb drive.
5,I have several of these I have never had a problem.
5,Best drive I’ve ever bought!!
1,NOT meant for a ton of writes! Burnt out after just two months of Tesla Sentry Mode usage. Get a "Endurance" model instead rated for the writes!
5,great size and price for smaller needs
5,Authentic 128GB USB. The plastic shell is a successor to a previous metal design. While I liked the feel of sturdy metal transferring huge amounts of data at blinding speeds did overheat that one on one of my computers. Plastic will at least keep this one from becoming hot to the touch.
5,I ordered and received the 32GB USB 3.1 Flash Drive. The Ultra fit at 32GB are hard to find at retail markets. These are perfect for the person that has many to take to different places.
5,Bought for my car stereo.  Works great
5,I used this to create a dedicated recovery disc for my laptop. It worked really well. I recommend.
4,Perfect for a Laptop. Normal flash drives stick out to far and can be damaged or damage your USB port. These type are small and added extra memory.
5,This worked perfect in combination with an OTG cable to use with Bleemsync on a Playstation Classic so I could free up the second controller port. Runs a little warm but no performance issues.
5,Fits into all USB regular slots. Does not block out other ports. Has a loop to tie a lanyard to. Could be easy to misplace if not careful.
5,Does what it is supposed to do...even survived the washing machine and the dryer by mistake of being left in my pocket of course.
5,Did exactly what it said it would do. I commute to work every day on the train so having a large storage with A low profile usb was huge for accessing documents on my commute and then working on my office computer.
3,Unfortunately the flash drive is not compatible with the system in my Nissan Rogue and the return period has passed.  Apparently it is not compatible with every car's system.
5,Using it for media in auto for child works great and doesnt stick out to where other ones could get damaged
5,Very compact and portable with good amount of storage capacity.  I use these in our vehicles to pre-load music and audiobooks.  Work great and lots of storage.
3,Bad: One thing I've noticed plugging it in for the first time available space is only 460gb.  I paid for 512gb not 460gb.Good: Small and portable.
5,Eet werks
5,It is very easy to set up. I purchased it for my Tesla to record the security video. It works great and great bang for the buck.
1,You could use smoke signals to transfer files faster than these things
3,Too small and the material feels cheap a little bit difficult to remove from the port. And you might want store it carefully this tiny thing will be prone to hide from you. Functioned normally hopefully it will last for reasonable period.
1,It was all going great until it died for no reason. I only use this drive to play music in my work car stereo so I can tell you exactly how many times it has been plugged into anything...once when I first got it and loaded music onto it and then 4 days a week for 9 weeks since I got it for a total of 37 times. Now I plug it into my stereo and it just says "no device" and Windows doesn't recognize that's it's there at all. Now I'm stuck for the next 10 hours doing a mind numbingly boring job without music. I would give this item a negative 5 star review if possible. Like someone else said maybe if you just need to expand storage in a device and never take it back out maybe it would last longer but I don't think 37 "uses" is excessive wear and it gets stored in a clipboard between shifts so it's not like it spends time banging against my keys or being abused any other way. I bought it because it was the smallest I could find but I guess that comes at a price.
4,Nice flash drive. Can be faster.
5,Works as expected I used on my Arlo Camera System to record video on detection an do the job perfectly the Arlo Base Station had two USB slots and I just installed a second memory. So far so good
4,Excellent!
3,I bought this because my brother in law had a few movies on another USB that I wanted him to put on one for myself for traveling and such.  My TV and my PS4 did not recognize this USB at all.  The only tech that would recognize it was a computer.
4,Good but too small
5,Great item - easy to use and does't stick out too far on the side of the computer which makes it easy to manage
4,Would've been nice if they included a cover for the flash drive.But overall its decent for the price. I recommend this product.
3,Got for a low profile media storage for a TV but the thing gets almost too ot to touch and I can reach in boiling water to grab eggs. So it gets HOT. Makes me worry about longevity going to get another one soon as I can and use this for installing windows 10 disk images or something.
5,I copied my 3000 song CD collection onto this tiny thumb drive and now have all of my songs everywhere I go!Love it!
5,This little memory stick sure does the job. The videos it captures via dash cam or sentry mode is great. Doesn't miss a beat. I've already recommended it to a couple of my friends that also have a model 3.
5,Works great.  VERY SMALL!
5,Super tiny and has Massive storage!
5,I use this in my Tesla for the sentry mode and dash cam and it works great.
5,Excelente
5,Came formatted with exFAT. So ready to use
5,These are great. The size is very small. The only down side is that the loop of plastic is a bit too small for some key chains. These are so small that they are easy to lose unless on a keychain.
4,No too bad
1,As others have stated this drive does not even come close to 256GB capacity.I mean I have owned too many flash drives to even count and I understand how to calculate capacity but the liberties that SanDisk has taken on the capacity of this drive is rediculous.  However they want to flip their #'s they have severly overstated the capacity of this drive and have screwed the customer over in the end..All in all I purchased this drive to replace a nearly full (1gb free) PNY 256GB drive that was a little large physically for the application.  Assuming we would be similar in overall NTFS formatted capacity I figured I could move the files over with no issue. But not with the liars from SanDisk. Apparently this drive only has 246GB capacity which formats down to 229GB. This compares to a PNY with 253GB capacity which formats down to 235GB.So while this product looks pretty if you are in a crunch for space I would NOT recommend it at all. With this issue along with the flimsy plastic design others have commented on this isn't something you want to waste your money on. Go with PNY instead
5,Good quality tiny thumb drive with good capacity for the price
2,It worked fine when I got it but now it only stays connected to my laptop for about 10 minutes.  Then I have to take it out and pop it back in to the USB  port to reconnect.  I'll try to save something on it and I'll get a message that says can't find it...was it deleted moved or renamed?  Also it won't show up in the list of available drives when you go into the files icon.  This made me worry if it will get to the point that I won't be able to access it at all and I'll lose all my valuable files I have saved. I've only had this flash drive for a couple months. Yesterday I ordered a different brand to copy to so I can throw this one away.
2,The USB works great when adding in small files over a long span of time (like adding a few hundred megabytes here and there). Using it primarily for storing pictures/music is perfectMy main issue was when I would attempt to transfer files that are a few gbs (movies programs etc). The USB is very small and thus runs VERY hot when transferring big files.  The USB will constantly disconnect and reconnect itself which ends up interrupting and fails the file transfer making it piratically useless for this function.Pros:-Fast transfer speeds (when working)-Good for storing small files-very compact and small easy to transport-can attach a small string to the actual USB for easier carryingCons:-cannot transfer large files without overheating (which kinds of defeats my main purpose of getting a larger capacity USB)
4,price is right for what you're getting
5,Great product and fair price. Quick shipping
5,Very small and portable the keyhole handle broke not sturdy enough
5,Very small great storage capacity.
5,Tesla use
1,Bought this to replace a 64 GB SanDisk UltraFit USB 3.0 drive I kept plugged into my laptop.Noticed within hours of transferring everything over that the drive would disappear from Windows 10 and Outlook would crash (PST file on the drive).  The first time I unplugged it it was rocket hot...  after it cooled down I plugged in again and it was recognized with all files fine.I suspect that since the frame is plastic and not metal it isn't able to radiate the heat as well.  I'm sure Outlook's constant access caused it to run hot but the previous one (with metal frame) was in there for over two years without a problem...But a few hours later same thing--drive gone rocket hot.  The third time this happened when I plugged it back in Windows threw an exFAT error on a BSOD...So I copied everything back to the smaller drive and this is now plugged into an HP Printer to be the Job Storage drive...  Doesn't run hot in the printer though it is overkill in that role...  At least it was only $20...
5,It is small not pricey yet large in capacity
5,I love the size of this drive. It gives me 256 GB of extra storage on my laptop and does not get in the way at all. It hasn't snagged on anything when I move the computer either. The price was very good and it is a great product.
5,Size capacity and quality are really good If you use this product properly you will never gonna have an issue. Just remember it is plastic so try to be careful with that. (and the heat it's normal).
5,This is a vast improvement over my old 256G USB Drive in speed. So small you hardly even notice it's there. Great for MacBooks. Yes it gets a little warm but nothing over 80°F.
5,Ultra Fit is exactly what the name implies... tiny teeny weeny bit of storage that holds a lot of filesor moviesor whatever you want... Rated at 128 gb of storage actually works out to 114 gb of free space after you format it getting rid of included software.
5,Delivered promptly. My computer accessed it promptly and download was fast and easy.Plugged in my car. It was recognized promptly and has been playing well sinceGood capacity and fits well onto small spacesSo far so good. Excellent product
1,I've purchased over 4 of these ultra fit usb flash drives.  The first 2 I ordered pretty much crap the bed I've transferred over 180gb worth or files onto the first 256gb version and i kept getting error loading a particular file from my console.  Reformatted and tried again and computer kept giving me error upon transferring files again.  I decided to use the other 256gb I have and formatted it and started to transfer 11gb worth of files onto it and at 45% of the way the transfer just stalls staying it would take 2days to finish transferring.. So do yourself a favor and don't bother with this version of ultra fit usb 3.0/3.1 because they're deemed to fail somewhere down the line.  Now i just hope the 512gb version i have on my PSTV doesn't crap the bed.. Knock on wood :(
5,This helped me update a HP notebook laptop. Is awesome for devices that do not have a lot of storage in them.
5,Very small...can be lose very easily.  Worked fine.  No issues.  Video is very clear.  Maybe get a larger capacity drive next time.
4,This drive would be great if you are using it in a place you never need to remove it but it's tiny and very difficult to remove.
4,Overall great product.  I wish it transferred a bit faster but it could have been the hub I was using.
5,It's super tiny so I can leave it plugged in all the time.  I used to move data from laptop to another and now have an extra 256 well 243gb to play with if my laptops hard drive starts to fill up.
5,Very reliable and a great low profile.  Works great in my cars and alarm system units where a low profile is required.
4,I formatted this with FAT32 so that it may hook up to my Honda infotainment system so that I may play music videos
4,Works great love the low profile. Sometimes get REALLY HOT to the touch but its never failed (these ~3 weeks). I'm a college student so I use it every day.
5,These Cards new model Sandisk USB Flash Drives for 2018 15X faster speed of data tranfer and 128GB of storage for $30.00 way better than Wal-Mart! But Beware the construction of this is all plastic for those of you who are looking for the ones with the metal casing.
5,fits perfect 2 months on the laptop and no failure.has simple to use encryption.
4,seams to work well i have had no issues it is very small though and could be easy to lose
5,Great Product Great Price but gets a little warm with continuous use... I now have two of these and have been using 1 for at least 6 months without an problems. Bought the second drive as back-up for first drive. Will buy again!
5,👌👌
5,Excellent user experience.
3,Love the price especially for the amount of storage space. The size was awesome as well almost too small and prone to be lost. My problem is that the plastic housing around the drive crumbled apart yesterday and now the drive wil not recognize when plugged in. 90 gb worth of backups on there and all lost. I would buy a sturdier drive if i had to do again
4,Works great as additional storage capacity for my laptop. Would be nice if it was a few millimeters shorter though.
3,I ordered the 256 gb and then only received the 128 gb.  Pretty disappointed.  Hard drive is great... Just make sure you're getting the size you want.
5,Easy to use.  I've listened to a music CD and used it to create a file backup already both successful.
5,Quick fast and easy. Used in my Tesla Model S for dash cam sentry mode feature.
2,The drive doesn't really come with the RescuePro Deluxe Software as stated … there is no link for download or mention of it on the drive or in the product documentation. If you do a web search you can download an evaluation copy … that you eventually have to buy.The description above deceptively words it as coming with Easy File Recovery with RescuePRO Deluxe Software "offer" - when it's really just an evaluation copy that pretty much anyone can download.
5,Product works well.  Vendor delivered product quickly for a good price.
1,Scam
5,El mejor usb en el tengo el sistema operativo de windows 10 pro lo uso como mi disco duro gracias SanDisk por ese usb tan rápido y pequeño
5,I use this product to bac up my laptop computer
5,Excellent product!
1,Item does NOT come with a cap for protecting your drive.
5,I use this with my digital frame as it allows me to have more pictures than the one the digital frame came with. This does what it’s suppose to do.
5,My friend used these to transfer old family videos (from the 1950's - 1960's. This worked wonderfully for them!!
4,Should come with landyard to carry. can loose easy not know if drop
2,The 1st thing I noticed about this was the length of time it took to copy files over. Not having a baseline to compare that with I just accepted it as "normal" speed write time.I recently purchased the Samsung version of this and the speeds were night at day. Without getting into all the techie stuff the Samsung took about 7 minutes to write 14.5 GB of data and a few seconds to delete the same amount of data.This device took about an hour to write the same amount of data (14.5 GB). It also took about a minute to delete the same amount of data.For the same price point I highly recommend the Samsung FIT Plus 128
5,I wanted a 64GB flash drive that I could leave it there all the time and not interfere with portability of the laptop. This drive fulfilled that.
3,It works well is extremely small sized affordable and seems to have a max write speed of roughly 30 megabytes per second in my experience. Although the 3 stars is due to the heat that occurs when you write to it. It's uncomfortably hot after writing a few dozen GB but this doesn't seem to happen when reading. I worry about the long term life of the drive given the heat issue.
5,Great product exactly what I expected.
2,I really don't understand why files larger than 4 GB cannot be copied over. I only found out reading comments from other user.
5,It Works very well.
5,I have a macbook and it only has 120gb this gives me a little more space to avoid my mac getting slow.  I always leave it in the computer ( I dont know if I should do this) and works fine.
5,These are excellent. Use almost every day. Only concern is they're so small I had to get a small chain to hang around my neck so I wouldn't lose them and had to enlarge the loop to do it. The storage is excellent.
1,Cannot be formatted to NTFS - it is exFAT only which does not work in my car.  Slower than most USB 2.0 drives I have. I sadly missed the return window because I did not need to use them immediately so now they just sit in my desk drawer waiting for the day I finally throw them out. I love all my other SanDisk drives but these are junk.
4,I liked the size and capacity. Fits next to my mouse driver to keep it compact.
3,After using for a while it gets really hot to the touch maybe because it's physically too small so the heat can't be dissipated quickly enough?other than the heating issue everything seems to be working as expected
5,Working
2,The insert part should be metal not plastic. The first one arrived bent. The second one is just as flimsy plastic. NOT good for frequent in/out of USB port. Plastic may be cheaper in price but a threat long-term because if the insert part becomes distorted in the least it (and your data on it) become useless. Get METAL insert only!
5,Perfect for what I needed!
5,Bought to replace my 120 GB IPod that the battery is so bad 1/2 the time won’t anymore. Installed all my music on in the car and it works great. Transfer was very quick also only using USB 2.0 on my Mac
5,ME ENCANTO
5,Great low-profile design. I use this flash drive for my car audio.
4,Had 128GB for a while; no issues. Bought this one for a very particular reason. Trust will work well too. Overall I like SanDisk products.
3,Won't work as extended storage for PS4 because it only reports 246GB available and the PS4 has a hard minimum of 250GB for external drives. I was afraid this would be the case when I got it since most "256GB" disks do not report the advertised amount to most operating systems and this is more a problem with Sony being pointlessly stubborn about their chosen cutoff but still disappointing as the form factor is so good.
5,The best flash drive out there in my opinion. The low profile is the only type of thumb drive you can use once you use it once. With storage devices dropping in price so fast now was the perfect time to get the storage I need and it arrived promptly at my door.
5,Great for use with car audio.
1,I got this to use as a boot device for my UnRaid server. it lasted a whole 4 months before dying. I can't recommend using it for that. It also got amazingly hot despite little reads or writes going to it.If you're going to use this for UnRaid because it's small and has a low profile don't.
5,Super small with plenty of space to use. Definitely recommend
2,I've had some Sandisk USB drives that have lasted for years. Those are the ones with the metal housing. This is plastic and it just broke with me simply pulling it out of my computer.  One of the plastic sides came off.Also before that when I recorded on it it got an error saying it's corrupted. Really disappointed in the quality of this device.
5,This is a great buy for the price. It is so small you can easily lose it if you don't get it stored probably. But I love it. It is in plastic but for the price and storage size it's a great buy
3,Does the job. Had to cut some of the plastic to make it smoother.Item does get hot after being plugged in for a while.It is also fast which helps tons.Have not ran speed tests but it transfers plenty fast for my needs of a small drive.
5,Not the quickest drive because it tends to thermal throttle when copying larger files but the storage is what I needed not the speed.
2,The pros. Small form factor and doesn't get super hot like the metal one.The cons. It is made out of paper thin plastic. I had it come apart inside of the only USB port my Surface pro has. It was quite the challenge to fish the piece out without damaging my device.I would only recommend this if you plan to install it and leave it. If like me you need a portable device to transfer files from machine to machine look elsewhere.
5,i love the size and speed this thump drive . i'll highly recommend it .
5,I am still using it.
5,Fast and don't heat up.  I have a number of the metal version and these far out perform them hands down.  Consistent 50mbs or more.  Speeds are dependent on what you're reading from and the size of file being read / written.  bottom-line - their fast.
4,Good but not durable
5,Micro sized and almost too small
4,Works great as a mounted file system on my DD-WRT router.  Fast enough and big enough to adequately handle traffic monitoring software.
3,Goodconvenient it has secure function ask for password to browse in.Once you format you will see 28.xxGB instead of 32GB.
4,This drive works fine but I am not a fan of plastic usb housings. I much prefer the SanDisk similar drive with the metal case.
5,Great deal on these flash drives. Small size big storage for only $20. They are so small just be careful you dont lose it. They tend to get a little warm after use too. I have notice and performance issues and they work good.
5,Some people have said this gets hard. This is true but I haven’t had it get as hot as some nor has it failed. I have installed my steam library to this and run my games from it. So far so good
5,Light sleek black hardly even know it's there. I've run Linux operating systems from flash drives but they always lag hang and freeze up a lot. Running one on this flash drive however it runs drastically better. It still hangs occasionally but not nearly as often it this works wonders.
5,Super compact device decent load and save times. I use it to keep steam games on my laptop instead of an external drive. Really great if you travel a lot and want to game on your laptop.
5,It looks awesome and its super fast.
2,I bought this with the assumption that it would be of similar quality to previous SanDisk products. I was wrong. Though the price is essentially the same as earlier UltraFit models this one is made of thin plastic. Despite the plastic construction it still gets desperately hot when in use. There is no activity light. I hesitate to carry it around for fear I'll break the casing. It also seems to stick out of my computer and catch on things a bit more than the earlier version.Now it is super-small and handy. It's fairly inexpensive. It's plenty fast. But compared to similarly-priced mini thumb drives it just isn't worth choosing. Get   SanDisk Ultra Fit 64GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive - SDCZ43-064G-GAM46         or   Kingston Digital 32GB USB 3.0 Data Traveler 50 110MB/s Read 15MB/s Write (DT50/32GB)         instead.
1,Bought this with the intent of having some extra storage on my laptop which also is 256Gb.Out of the box it appeared on the disk inquiry/Properties as 256Gb But I could not write more than 32+/-.When I tried to write to it it failed to write just beyond approx. 30gb. The write dialogue failed and stated the card needed to be formatted. I couldn't get any other read on the card it was useless so I formatted it and then it only showed 32Gb. I was surprised it wasn't actually under a gig as is often the case with the Counterfeit stuff.I'll tell you the packaging was definitely good. The quality of the card itself looked legit. This was fulfilled by Amzn So I bought it with confidence. But I guess the Scammers even get over on Amzn once in a while.Because there is a lot of Counterfeit Memory out there whatever you buy run it through tests as soon as you get it. Sit on it too long and you wont be able to return it.
5,I ordered this for my smart tv. Exactly what I wanted and no issues with setup.
5,I love this mini flash drive!  So many gigs in this little guy. Excellent for a laptop. I mainly have it connected to my PS4 to watch downloaded content on my big screen TV. And it is barely noticeable.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5,Yay for compact with lots of memory
4,It didn't work in any of my things that are usb 3.  Runs fine in my 2.0 devices
5,Es increíble lo que esta cosa puede hacer puedes guardar de todo en algo tan pequeño Super portable.
5,Small and reliable storage
5,Works with no issues.
5,I like it because it doesn't stick out so far from the side of whatever device you're using.
2,Great speed and high capacity but poor quality housing.  The housing is made of a very thin plastic and flexes upon touch. The advertisement and draw is that it has a small enough profile to leave inserted into the laptop and still put into the laptop bag/case. However this seems to be in an effort to hide the fact that it's such poor quality housing and seems to be easily breakable.  In addition unlike other Sandisk "nano" style drives there is no cap/cover to keep dust/dirt/lint out of the male end.  The Ultra Fit model covers both of these deficiencies.  I'm pretty unhappy and concerned with the durability of this drive especially if utilizing the vault/encryption feature.  If the drive breaks you could be out of luck.
5,Used this to expand the storage of my Fire TV. It works perfect gives more storage and loads fast.
5,Works great
5,Great item. Barely sticks out past the USB port itself.  Great speed.
4,This product does not come with a dust cover which was a little disappointing as I travel with it in my pocket most of the time.
5,Works as expected
3,Write speed is quite slow it will not work for sustained writes for Tesla DashCam or Sentry Mode..  wish I would have paid attention to the disk benchmarks before purchasing :-(
2,Worked fine for two years now it doesn't work at all. No damage was done but the device stopped working out of the blue.
5,I can't comment with actual figures but this device doesn't "seem" any faster than the USB 2.0 little brother that I had previously using a USB 3.0 port on my PC.  Regardless I was still looking forward to the size upgrade and that part is accurate.
5,SO Small great for low profile. I added mine to my Roku and it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. Looks like its part of the unit. The design makes it easy to remove as well. Great product design.
5,Love this USB key! It's small easy to carry and fits the low profile of my laptop computer. Conventional size USB keys protrude from the laptop and have to be removed the fit the computer in it's traveling sleeve. This one does not!!
5,Use it for a back up on my Mac Air
5,Exactly what I expected.
5,Works totally awesome for my Nvidia Shield it's not block the other USB port
5,I bought this for a MacBook because it was ultra small and doesn't protrude far from the edge.  Put into the same side as the power plug and fits well within the size of the power plug.
2,I bought two of these to use as boot volumes for a home NAS. (Admittedly not what USB drives are normally used for.) The read/write performance is fine but one of them would consistently fail and lose connection after a while because the drive would overheat.The casing is plastic and doesn't feel very strong. You can easily flex it with your fingers and you can hear the internals rattle around if you shake it. The previous version of this drive uses a metal case which is much more sturdy and acts as an effective heat sink.It doesn't come with any sort of protective cover and with its thin plastic casing I wouldn't expect it to survive very long on a key chain.At least it's cheap and fast.
5,It good for storage
5,No complaints
5,I didn't realize exactly how small it would be before ordering it. Next time I'm definitely getting a regular full size USB thumb drive
5,Needed short USB again other broke after about 3-3.5 yrs. Use in laptop for ReadyBoost. Having one I can just leave in is great. Speeds up computer a little wish could configure to use more then 4gig for Boost.
5,It's nice  to have  all of my  music and video In one place I lov it
5,Works as it should
5,This is a straightforward product.  It does exactly as described.
5,Perfect in storing MP3s and movies to plug into the back of the TV for on the go viewing and listening.
5,USB 3.1 transfer rates are incredibly fast this is a quality product that is durable. I wish that it had a loop or something to connect it to a keychain or something like that because it is so small.
4,Works well with the video shield doesn't stick out of the back
4,Satisfied with the product quality but does not easlily fit my car's USB slot. Wish the knob would have been on the other side.
4,Fast transfer of data. Use it for my music in my car. Small and discreet. Gets hot when transferring a lot of data. Overall happy with product.
5,I needed a very small usb that wouldn’t be in the way of putting things in the little cubby area of my vehicle. This usb is perfect! It’s very small. I only use it for music it’s worked without any issues so far.
4,Works well. Minimalistic
5,I use this to store and play music in my car when I don't want to plug my phone in. Works great hardly takes up any space at all. 100% would buy again and may still.
5,I use this for capturing video clips on my Model 3's sentry mode. It is tiny and works great with plenty of storage that I can go 2-3mo before needing to clear off space.
5,Used this for a photo frame.  The low profile makes it blend in with the case nothing sticking out to get broke.
2,The older  version of this product used to be made of metal. I loved my old one (which I still have) and bought a second. Data transfer rate is very fast.Now they are made of thin plastic (part that inserts into the USB socket) so only after a bit of use the plastic breaks / tears off and it no longer stays firmly seated in the socket.Too much cost cutting. Bring back the metal casing and it will be a great product again.
4,I love the compact size. I never take it out of my laptop 2 in 1. It provides the additional space I need.
5,It does get really warm when being used for a while only thing I wish was that it had a way of adding a string to it.
5,I was surprised how physically small this flash drive is but it's perfect to plug it in and leave it. I used mine for Playstation roms on the PS Classic.
5,Super super easy. Good fits for my tesla
5,This usb drive is very handy but it’s not really meant for frequent removal. It’s very flimsy and the build quality just isn’t there. It’s best used for inserting into computer and just leaving there. It is fragile and will break if removed frequently.
5,Fantastic backup device for my laptop.
5,Using it in my Jeep to have music. The media cover does not lay 100% flush but it’s hard to notice that it’s not.
5,They get a little hot but that’s if you’re writing a ton of stuff at once. I got them to back up my raspberry pi’s and it does it’s job. It’s as small as the WiFi dongle.
5,Great value. Easy to use lots of storage for my needs lives permanently in my usb port as small and compact
5,This slim line drive is the best for extra storage in a small space. I leave it plugged into my laptop all the time
5,128GB ...what else other than = GREAT!!
5,Purchased this to use with my truck stereo receiver. My old USB drive stuck out of the front of the receiver quite a bit and I was worried that it was going to get hit and damage the receiver. This drive is super small and barely sticks out from the receiver. Love it!!
5,QUALITY AT AN EXPENSIVE PRICE!
1,I was foolish and did not test the true capacity right away when I got the drive but have just discovered that the 16GB I bought is actually only 8GB. It also runs incredibly hot... like hot enough to melt and deform it's own plastic plug slightly. It warped/melted it's own housing! I've now binned that drive and will NOT be buying another.Just wanted to give any potential buyer a heads-up and a warning: DO NOT TRUST ANYTHING automatically even if it is a known/respected brand name and from what should be a proper source (Sold by Amazon not some 3rd party in my case.) Test everything. H2TestW is definitely my first task now with all memory cards and flash drives regardless.
5,This is the best USB drive I've ever used. People are always surprised of the ultra fit size.
5,So very small not for carrying around more for plugging in and forgetting about it. I got it for my raspberry pi.There are the speed results via USB 3.0 port on my laptop.Writing speed: 15.6 MByte/sReading speed: 79.6 MByte/s
3,It could be better
5,I like it. It is physically small though. I attached a string to it as to not lose it.
4,Really like this flashdrive though it seems a little flimsy and it gets really hot which is concerning considering it's made entirely of plastic.
2,This thing gets hot and it also doesn't tolerate heat.  That's a bad combination.  I had it plugged in to the USB port near where my laptop exhausts hot air.  As soon as the laptop started working hard it would blow hot air on the usb key and I would start to get read/write errors.  Moving it to a different usb port fixed that problem I think.But then:  after a couple weeks of using it the plastic housing broke and this tiny key isn't really usable anymore.  It's too bad.  I liked the tiny size and the reasonable price but I guess I'll go looking for another brand.Update: the key still works broken plastic bits notwithstanding.
5,If a USB Flash is inserted but later 'disappears' from Windows (it has been left idle for a period of time) it is helpful to verify Windows Power Management is not disabling the USB port for Windows Power Savings.
5,compact
2,I got this to use as a disposable drive but when it's been running and writing for a while it gets SUPER hot. Hot enough that you need to eject it and let it sit for a time.I would advise something better built or bigger as it allows heat to dissipate. Quickly returned this.
5,Super small and fast this is a good option for anyone needing some extra storage. It just hangs out in the laptop's USB port without getting in the way and has become a great addition to our storage needs.
3,The old metal ones were definitely more durable though it shouldnt affect the performance at all. I just dont understand how such a reputable company switches to plastic! The prices on these though is always great!
5,This thumb drive works perfectly.  It is super small; good capacity at a good price. And it is plenty fast; I am using it for the Tesla Model 3 Dashcam and Sentry Mode.
1,Con: This product has paper thin plastic that isn't very durable.Pro: It has a really nice hook that you can use to attach a lanyard to since it is so small.  It doesn't get hot like the metal ones.
3,Pro: It's tiny (physical size)Con: It's tiny (storage capacity)I purchased because of the physical size. It's small enough to not get broken out of a USB port in my car. This was bought because it was a 128GB drive .. it only has 114GB actual space (please stop counting 1GB as 1000MB) which left me with not enough storage to hold my entire music collection.
5,A small speed drive that can be left in your laptop so that it is always available and doesn't get lost. Great speed and capacity. I have several of these and am happy with all of them.
5,Very small which I like so easy to leave plugged in to my PC.
5,This is a good buy.  They are reasonable fast and include software so you can securely store and physically transport Sensitive data without fear of being compromised.
5,Worked perfectly. Can't say much more than that.
2,I use USB flask drives quite often and I am used to them heating up but these appear to get very hot - very quickly.  So far I have not lost any data but I am not comfortable with the heat being generated.  If I had to do it over again I would get a larger one that would reduce how hot the component gets.I have no other problem than the heat however - Sandisk usually makes great products.
1,I was using this for my tesla's dashcam. It was working great for 2 months but died a week after that. The drive is no longer recognized and cannot be formatted anymore. Would definitely *not* recommend!
5,Wanted a low profile USB stick to load music on to use in my car. This worked perfectly.
1,Bought two of these at the same time to copy multiple (hundreds) of files to them but they get very hot and overheat...causing it to be write protected and not readable. Tried multiple machines OS etc. Read other reviews about the same issue. Pretty much useless! I bought similar drives (SanDisk 32GB Cruzer Fit USB 2.0 Flash Drive - SDCZ33-032G-G35) prior to this which have had no issues I just wanted a bigger spot where I could hook them for transport. But ended up sending these back. Stick with the Cruzer Fit if you need this small profile USB drive!
5,Works great.  Fits a ton of music for a car stereo and looks almost undetectable in the usb slot not bulky looking. Great seller and great products.
5,It's a nice size for the storage capability.  I put a lanyard on it just to make it easier to keep up with. I use it with a small router in my pickup to store movies on which makes long trips more tolerable for the passengers.
5,Great product.  Very large capacity in an extremely small package.  Using to store pictures and music for my laptop.
4,First unit I got was duff.  Amazon promptly replaced it with no fuss and the replacement is working like a champ.
5,This is a very tiny USB Flash Drive and I also own the previous version. This one does not get as hot as the older version working perfect so far in my car loaded with mp3 songs.
5,I ordered it thinking it's be a little bit bigger than what it was. It's the size of the USB and maybe a half inch longer than the size that goes in the computer. It's great i like it.
4,Great bang for buck even water proof but dont suggest trying that out
4,The unit is very small and can be left in Port without damaging it. The hole could be a little bigger for a keychain.
2,Initial write throughput starts at about 40 megabytes a sec. Drops to 25 meg a sec at about 2 gig and drops to 12 meg a sec at 3 gig. I wanted to use these for Windows System Imaging but the need to quickly move 20 Gigabyte files around makes them useless for that.Tried 5 of these drives on three different USB 3.1 chipsets. It isn't like I'm talking about a bad driver disk or port. They just run out of cache or change mode from SLC to MLC at around 3 gig... and end up being slower than any other flash drive I own for large .WIM files. Including my USB 2 UFDs.They would probably be fine for photos. Just don't expect anything blazingly fast.
5,Ideal for storing Photos and iTunes libraries on my older Macbook Pro to free up disk space on internal hard drive. Doesn't seem hot as others described in reference to some earlier version of this product. Overall a great find and good value for the money
5,When we can get 256GB of storage in the size of your thumbnail for $30.Man what the astronauts from 1969 would say....Transfer speed just ok this isn't the olympics
4,I use this as a download drive on the back of my PC currently and it is working in a 3.1 port w/o problems.
3,Died after a few uses in my MacBook Air. I noticed it was unusually hot after removing it. Never before had a problem w/ SanDisk but most have had metal USB plug. This one is plastic so maybe doesn't transfer heat as well? I ordered another on hope this was just a fluke. Otherwise I'll downgrade to the older (slower) model.
3,The drive works well.  The plastic housing on the USB port is very thin and fragile.  It has slowly been cracking and pieces have been falling away even though it stays in a USB port most of the time and has been handled carefully.
5,A couple of BB recent irders I haven’t received satisfied
5,I have always used SanDisk and have never ever had an issue. I use them Exclusively for SD Cards and Flash Drives and have for years. They have never let me down 5-Star Product as always.
5,Samsung and Sandisk I would not buy anything else for SSD or USB memory. All those other cheap brands are junk one day your partition or data will just disappear. I like Samsung a little better personally but Sandisk is a great product too. Reliable.
5,The tiny actual size should be alerted to the unexpecting purchaser it was under a cardboard flap of the box and I almost threw it out!!!
2,Bought this for my car load music and audiobooks... and SanDisk always had good stuff.  But this is cheep plastic.  There's no way I can use this in my car over the summer it would easily melt.  The description even says in-car audio!  No way all flashdrives I've ever owned are metal expected the same with this but the entire piece is very thin plastic. If it was in my car the rectangular plug could easily warp.  Ok for home use why I'm giving 2 star but be good if they mentioned the material in the description.  I did find it in the Questions part but that's after knowing what I was looking for.  Ugg going to return this one!
5,Had to buy a replacement because I left it in an open compartment in the console of my car and the car wash folks vacuumed it up.
5,Great price for the amount of storage. Very small when inserted into a laptop. You do not have to worry about breaking the drive or the usb port if you leave it in.
5,I wanted a small USB drive for mp3 music for my Mustang that I did not have to worry about being in the way of other items I might place in the center compartment. Worked out great and plays music without issues.
1,Lots of missing space for user. Can't use it for it's purchase purpose. May never buy a SanDisk flash drive again.
5,Small efficient USB storage.
2,I have owned 3 of these now and 2 have already broken. After being used in a router for extra storage (formatted as ext2/4) the first drive would only mount read-only. After googling it this is apparently a common issue with this drive -- it essential breaks and degrades to read-only mode. A call to support validated this theory. After the second replacement failed in the exact same way I gave up on these drives. I have one left that I am crossing my fingers for!
5,Nothing not to like about. it works great!
5,Got this because it's very small and I needed a flash drive to expand my laptop's memory. This has been very useful. It's small so I can leave it plugged into my Macbook pro indefinitely. Highly recommend it.
5,Works as expected and is so small! Using it in our Tesla to record camera footage and it's working perfectly and doesn't stick out into the compartment at all so it is perfect.
5,Works great on Nivdia Shield
4,My old 8gb drive had reached its limit. Got 128gb for low price. Love it.
5,Awesome
4,Works as intended. Feels a little cheap like the plastic could break overtime if your not careful with it. Otherwise works perfectly no complaints.
3,As soon as the file transfer reaches 200-300mb the speeds slow to a crawl sometimes stopping entirely.
5,I keep this in my Lenovo 14" because I have a small ssd (128). I use this as a second drive. It is fast and durable.
5,Surprisingly tiny but I love it. I've hooked it up to the back of my router so that I can use it for future backups. My only complaint? I can't put it on my keyring.
5,Great product!
5,The flash drive worked very fast to write files. It was so fast that it got hot at the end of writing more than 200GB. Almost stopped writing.
5,The product works great for what I expected. Its size makes it slightly difficult to remove when in the USB port but otherwise no issues.
2,Verified on desktop with USB 3.1 port and on a  new laptop with USB 3.1 port that  read speed is 60MB/s.Capacity is also not 512GB but 460.BTW on USB 2 interface this only gives 30MB/s read speed so it is faster on USB 3.1 but far from advertised 130MB/s.
4,Large capacity small footprint.  Works as advertised.
3,SanDisk 128G? Not really. After formatting and cleaning the USB  the total storage was 114.4G. I like the minimalistic or inconspicuous design. It works.
3,Top broke off in side my computer and I can't get it out
5,I love this flash drive! It’s so small and can fit on a key ring. Plus doesn’t take up space when plugged in. So I can still put my laptop in a sleeve while the flash is in.
5,smallest size with biggest capacity. wonderful usb!
5,rewrite reviewso far so goodit perfectly used as extra hard drive for Macbooktoo small I bought with other item and did not notice it in the bottem of the box. and throw it away
5,I've had this a couple of week. It's tiny nobtrusive it never gets hot it's fast. So far it does on job and does it very well at a great price.
5,Added this to a gaming computer in a USB 3.0 port.  Moved a specific set of games to this device.  They load just fine from there.
1,I got this to add some compact and portable storage to my TP-LINK Micro Router (TL-WR902AC) It does not to work with this device despite using FAT and NTFS formats.  I also found it does not work with my Sabrent USB 3.0 hub -- it's the only flash drive that doesn't work on this hub.  The only way I can get it to work is to plug it into a USB port directly on my Motherboard.  I'm very disappointed with this drive's lack of compatibility as it's the first flash drive I've owned to act this way.While the Amazon listing does not specifically state USB 2.0 nor USB 3.0 compatibility (only USB 3.1 compatibility si listed) there is a SanDisk published paper for this USB flash drive (SDCZ430-256G-G46) that does state that it's backwards compatible with the older USB standards.My past experience with SanDisk USB flash drives has been excellent I've come to rely on the brand but this issue has been a shock.
5,Small and holds my whole music collection. You will need to attach it to a key chain or similar so it doesn't get lost. It literally is about the size of your thumbnail.
4,work great on Nvidia shield
5,Bought two of these for two different laptops to increase the storage space. They are very small and not bulky which is exactly what I wanted. It's only been a few days but so far so good with the performance as well.
1,HOLD ON THERE! DON'T SKIP THIS REVIEW! I bought this thumb/flash drive because was cheap small and supposedly fast. Was it as It said to be? IT GOT DELIVERED QUICKLY. I was very excited to try it out. I opened the package and it was than I thought. That is a great thing. VERY SMALL. (PERFECT SIZE). I plugged it into my laptop and there it is an instant connection. NO NEED FOR ANY SETUP. I started to transfer some files a total of 20 GB. IT WAS VERY SLOW But not at the beginning. It started with about 50-60 Mb/s which is pretty good. Then it quickly dropped to at most 4 Mb/s fluctuating between 100 Kb and 2.5 Mb. It literally said "1 day left." The problem was not from my PC. I have an SSD with speeds of 450 Mb read and about 300-350 write. I DON'T MIND IT BEING 150 READ (AS IT SAYS ON THE PACKAGE) BUT IT WASN'T.AND THAT IS WHAT THE CUSTOMER CARES ABOUT. I DONT RECOMMEND!
5,Like numerous SanDisk products I have purchased in the past this item worked as described right out of the packaging.
5,Un producto muy buen y fácil para usar.
5,Great product! Plenty of storage and very portable! This product worked awesome! Very quick as well. Would definetely recommend it.
5,The only problem I can for see with this is losing it it’s so darn small
5,Used to to create a USB Windows 10 64 recovery. Nice and small.
2,This product gets insanely hot.  It melted the glue on the rubber foot of my laptop which is directly below the USB port causing it to slide down over one of the speaker holes.  You can Google this product and find countless other anecdotes of people having similar issues with heat.  Not only that but after it's been copied to for very long the transfer speed tanks so your copies then take way longer than necessary.  It's just junk not even safe to use as a spare because I'm afraid it will damage my machine if I continue to use it.  Find something else.
3,...they're picky about USB 2.0 ports run on the hot side might even be *too* small and the off-center 'grip' can make it awkward to remove the drive. The deal breaker for me was that the drive would only work when plugged directly into a 3.0 port but wouldn't work in a USB hub with 2.0 ports.
5,Fast reliable and at an amazing price what more can you ask for. I bought mine to plug it in the back of my Nvidia Shield TV.
2,32 GB model arrived with 28.6 GB available which is probably normal flash drives are always a bit diminished.  The drive itself is made of really flimsy plastic - this is the first usb plug of any kind from any electronic that I've owned had that has not been metal.  I could actually break the drive by squeezing between my pinky finger and thumb - it is seriously flimsy feeling and bends with the slightest pressure.  If you try to insert it but you are slightly off your perfect aim on a usb port I could easily see this breaking with the force needed just to insert it in the usb port.  I'd return it but it wasn't terribly expensive and worth the hassle of that.
5,I needed a bigger SSD because my Windows 10 recovery drive would not fit on a 16GB SSD. This 32GB SSD worked fine. I like the small size.
5,This Flash Drive is very small. It is very fast and even after encryption. I would definitely buy it again. still writes fast.
5,This is what u need to add more ram to a laptop that is maxed out.
5,High capacity compact size bargain price name brand. All good.
2,I used this in my car to listen to MP3s but it's terrible.  It never lost my data (so not 1 star) but the random 6-8 pauses every minute or so make this a product and brand I won't buy again.  (I know the problem isn't the car because I saw the same behavior on my computer when copying data off of the drive.)
5,Producto excelente
5,I have been using this for  some time now and it works great the speed is just as fast as when I first started using it and it isn't to bulky like other drives
5,Comfortable to use and very versatile. Super fast and the best does not boot any errors.
1,As a drive it works great unfortunately it sucks for durability the shell is all plastic and cracked within a month.  still works it is just now the contacts are exposed and could be damaged in moving it around.  consider one of the drives where at least the USB connector is metal.  If you plan on swapping between several machines.  If you plan on just sticking it in and forgetting about it then it will likely work great for you.
5,Slightly less than 128 GB because of byte gigabyte conversion arithmetics. But the capacity is actually as advertised.
5,This works well as expected. I buy multiple at a time- I use them for work and such.
5,This flash drive is tiny but it works very well.
5,Runs a bit hot but speed is there and that’s a ton of storage for a little guy. Picked up two on Black Friday and use them to transfer HD footage to my students in the classroom.
5,i bought this because i bought a laptop with a tiny hard drive. i installed linux on the flash drive and works with no issues.  i would recommend this drive to anyone looking for a 128 gb drive.
5,Works great
5,Really good USB drive. Compact very small but also very large in ability to store many docs photos spreadsheets in a word many files. Highly recommend this product.
5,Great works as advertised.
5,I cannot believe how small this is.  The pictures of same on Amazon really didn't give me a proper perspective on its diminutive size.  I do backups on it.  No quibbles.
4,The drive is small and easy to handle but easy to get lost.
5,Works great. Can copy from older version to newer version no problem. Great for packing stuff up and using the data/files right from the thumb drive.. Killer.
3,Requires a password to access the files. It's great for if you value security but it wasn't what I was looking for in a flash drive.
5,Awesome
5,Awesome flash drive with minimal presence excellent transfer speeds and capacity and at a great price.
5,I got this from a recommendation for recording sentry videos in my Tesla Model 3. Only trouble has been the drive getting filled-up and stop recording but wiping the drive allows it work again.
5,Good small size
4,All plastic tiny and light. Low profile for my laptop and it has good transfer speeds.
5,Usual SanDisk high quality. Does generate heat but not bad. Never had a single problem with SanDisk products. Highly recommended. Tip: Put a piece of string on it so you don’t lose it.
5,I needed a usb that could hold and play my cd's in my new car that does not have a CD player. This worked perfectly!
2,Used a 256GB one as storage device for Tesla dashcam. Every now and again I would get a warning that the USB device was too slow and finally it stopped working completely. Like the most popular review said this probably isn't the drive you want for long term regular use.
5,Wow this this thing is small! It looks like a micro SD card in the pack. There is no way it could be any smaller. Looks easy to lose and somewhat hard to pull out of the socket.
5,Works great running home brew in my Nintendo Wii. It gets very hot but it seems fine. It is a little flimsy but I don't handle it much so it's OK for my application.
5,Tiny. But could be easily lost.It's perfect for the auto USB port filled with 256gb music 🎶
5,Begins to slow as space fills up but still good bang for buck.
5,Raised heel allows easy removal with thumb nail. A great way to add "an internal drive" that is recognized good size and easily removable. I leave it in my MacBook Pro all the time except when the USB port is needed for other use.
5,No longer have to worry about accidentally hitting the thumb drive & damaging the socket or drive.
5,Needed room for extra games well this was a quick answer.
4,Great done what I needed it  to do
5,Excellent used with my Firestick 4K.
3,As other users have mentioned the sliver of plastic on top of this USB thumbdrive broke off inside my computer after only 5-6 uses.  After 20 minutes trying to dig out the plastic from my PC I find the drive no longer sits stable inside the USB slot and frequently disconnects itself from the PC.  Very frustrating
5,Incredible amount of storage in a tiny button. I like that I can keep it plugged into my laptop and don’t have to remove it when I slip the laptop into my briefcase or carry bag.
5,Small enough to not stick out yet enough capacity to hold al my tunes.
5,Super small. Great little 256GB usb drive. Very fast. Stores “most” of my music. Waiting for a 1TB next. Highly recommended
1,I bought to use in my Tesla Model 3 for storing dashcam video; the car complained that it was too slow to use.Later I wanted to transfer a 12GB data file. I quick-formatted the drive for NTFS and started copying. It took approximately 1 hour to copy the single file. Towards the end of the file transfer I watched the transfer speed graph cycle between 0 and 19 MBps every 5 seconds.It appears that the drive has a small amount of high-speed cache for buffering file transfers which runs out for large files. Given the large capacity of the drive this makes no sense other than as a cost-cutting measure.The drive is useless to me because I cannot use it in my car and it takes too long to copy data to it.
4,comes formatted as FAT32 (works with Raspberry Pi)about 115GB useablegetting about 75Mb/sec when transferring 300-1200MB files.
5,Great for bringing a few large video files with me in a tiny package!
5,Very handy and fits my needs.
5,This product works just fine.  I'm just slightly concerned that it gets rather warm with extended use.  Makes me wonder about longevity of the product at those temps.  I will post again if something happens.
1,Bought the 128G version to store media using the DLNA USB port on my router.  Worked great for a while and the small form factor was nice so it didn't stick way out of the router.  Very fast and no problems transferring files initially.Now after 8 months it has locked up into a permanent "write-protected" read-only mode.  I can't delete files or even re-format the drive.  My data is still on there and I can transfer it just can't do anything with it.  Read an earlier review that mentioned it goes into a "safety mode" to protect data which may be a good feature.........but the drive is basically useless!This drive gets extremely hot no matter what device it's plugged into.  That may be the reason it locked up.  I've used Sandisk drives for years without any problems so was very surprised when this one failed!  I would avoid this model.
5,You have saved my laptop freed op a; ot of space when this if fo;; I will be back to buy more from you thank you
5,It's a USB drive. Very tiny and barely sticks out. Can leave in your laptop and barely know it's there. Smaller then most USB Bluetooth mouse receivers. They do get really hot when transferring large files.
5,Works as a backup device for important files using the password-protected vault. With the PC on "Lock" when I'm away my data is pretty secure.
5,Works well. The small size allows me to leave it plugged in to the USB port on my laptop.
3,These do seem to be reasonably fast and work OK. My biggest objection is that the connector part that goes into the host device is made out of plastic instead of metal—and flimsy plastic at that. So I'm expecting the connectors won't last very long. The low price however means they should be easily replaceable.
5,Large capacity to hold a lot music AND it's not obvious that there is a USB stick in my dashboard if someone casually looks into my car.
1,I purchased 4 of these to use as boot/installation media for various operating systems. It was a waste of money. You cannot boot an OS off of them which is surprising considering I've been working with computers and bootstrapping OS's for 16 years and never run into a USB with this affliction. Something about the firmware on these makes them absolute garbage. They heat up a worrying amount while simultaneously performing terribly compared to the advertised speed.Despite quoting how fast they should be (and a USB 3.1 drive should be fast) they are about 10x slower than a USB 2.0 drive that I had plugged in to my computer. 2 of the 4 I bought maxed out at 25MBps. I will be returning mine as soon as I can. These are easily the worst USB drive I have encountered since I began working with computers.
5,Other users describe the unit to overheat mine doesn't seem to have that problem (it gets warm but not to the point it hurts you to hold it)So far working as expected.
5,Seems to be working great - using it as DVR storage plugged into in my TCL TV.  Haven’t had any issues.
5,Works Great Fast got 141.45 MB/s Read and 51.08 MB/s in a USB 3.1 port. They have a nice hole to put a leader through helps me keep from loosing them.   SanDisk 32GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive - SDCZ430-032G-G46
3,I wanted to use this thumbdrive to become a WIndows 10 Recovery Drive.  The recovery drive tool says to use drive with 16GB free.  The SanDIsk 16GB Ultra Fit doesn't have quite enough space to hold the recovery image.  Oh well at least I now have a nice 14.8GB drive that's pretty small and fast.
5,I got this for playing music in my car and it works.
5,perfect for everyones needs
1,Upon receipt of this flash drive I inserted it into my laptop and it was not even recognized.  I tried several PCs and laptops in my household to no avail.  It is much more cheaply made compared to my older SanDisk flash drives as it is all plastic.  I ended up returning it and buying a PNY 64GB Elite-X Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive.  It worked perfectly and is a much more durable looking device.
5,It is incredible that in this size you can save the mitrad of the capacity of my notebook (which is 2018). It's very good Saves small and large files fast. And it does not show on the notebook. Good storage capacity reinforcement.
1,Near daily use resulted in this product falling apart. First one of the side plastic pieces surrounding the pins broke off then the top. Today the plastic house just pulled away from the board. Will need to transfer everything to a sturdier device.
5,Bought this to carry a large chunk of my music library of ripped CDs in my car. Works excellent and it’s tiny size makes it inconspicuous when installed in the car. Excellent product
5,caught it on sale - more than enough storage capacity for music and images for my tiny netbook; small size does not stick out to risk damage as the bigger flash drives do
5,What a great deal on this flash drive. Take the money you saved and take a bus downtown to the junkyard and find a hubcap. Then attach it to the thumb drive via a lightweight chain. Otherwise if you're like me you'll quickly misplace it.
5,No complaints.  Great size great storage great value.  Used this to back up my ps3 to replace the hard drive.  Also leave in my macbook as external storage.
5,Title says it all.  I needed a small USB to move files around and this works perfect.  I did not need massive amounts of storage-  This was perfect.
5,This was perfect for storing a ton of video. It’s tiny though!! I feel like it needs a carrying case.
5,Other than keeping the prices of these guys down no other USB flash drive needs to exist.  These are the best in pretty much every aspect.
2,I formatted the drive as ExFat and used in my Nvidia Shield for a few months.  It was largely a read only device to begin with as I didn't add too many files.  Today I tried to add a new file and found that it would not allow for writing to the drive.  Upon searching the net for workarounds I learned that the drive will go into read only mode when it detects something wrong with the operating system it uses in order to "protect against data loss".  I'm left with a 256gb drive that I need to replace after a few months of use.  Stay away from SanDisk products.
1,Though this is a name brand company. Something is wrong with this particular product. The first one failed after 2 months the replacement did not work straight out of the package. Return was honored and I bought another brand.
5,Es buenisimo super rapido y comodo
3,and they didn't include a keyring/string. 2/10 wouldn't buy again but would accept as a gift because why not.
2,Arrived quickly matches pictures and descriptions. No issues storing pics. But it gets hot real hot. Never had a thumb drive or storage device get this temperature. I became concerned that the plastic would melt or crack and lodge inside my computer. Bought another storage devise and tossed this one. Good luck.
1,UPDATE: This thing is absolute garbage. Tried to move 15 GB photo gallery over to the drive and moved less than 1 GB in over 24 hours. Also my laptop is acting super screwed up when this is plugged in. Couldn't get internet to work and unplugged--the second I did internet worked fine. Blotchy screen now an issue. My laptop is less than a year old and I'm worried this caused serious damage. DO NOT BUY!First I use a macbook air and I had to reformat the disk. Sandisk has the instructions for this listed on their website using screenshots and it was very helpful. I got this because air's come with pretty much no storage space. Moving your photos library is pretty easy on a Mac but man it is taking forever! All their stats on how fast it is are lies. Takes about 3 hours to move a relatively normal sized photo library over (15 GB). Once it's there I backed it all up on a separate drive just in case!
4,Plenty of space  very small  good speed but I wouldn't take in out has much as the metal version.
5,Wow such a low price for so much storage. Its fast too. Loaded al my videos onto it. Just great!
5,This little scan disk was perfect for all my music that I needed  for my  church service at prison.
3,Cheaply made very fragile get very hot. Liked the older metal ones better!!
5,Easy to use works great. Very easy to transfer data or pictures to. Love it.
4,I wish it was mettal and not plastic but i love the form factor
5,Works top notch using it as a backup file taker in my Mixpre-10T Recorder.Have yet to experience a card failure in all my years of using this brand.
5,This tiny USB flash drive is as fast as any I have ever used fits so close to the socket that you hardly notice it is there and 128gig is amazing for the price.
5,Decent speed.  Works good.  Doesn't over heat.  I loaded mine up with MP3 and leave it in my truck 24/7.  Even in the burning hot sun it continues to work as expected.
1,The drive was purchased and stored until it was needed (about 6 month later).  It was stored in an office area without humidity or potential issues.  The drive worked for a week and it stopped working without any sign of issue.  This was my second drive from SanDisk.  My first one lasted almost 2 years.  The version being reviewed has a flimsy plastic part that it is exposed to external impacts.  It looks pretty but it's not functional if you are looking for an drive to carry out daily.
5,We mainly use it in the car. You can’t even notice if it’s there unless I point it to you. I love it.
5,Works great smaller than expected
4,Good
5,It was very easy to format don't take up any space and the memory is great...
5,Great Value. I bought these to hold radio shows to play in my car. Very satisfied. I feel like George Jetson with these.
5,I use this drive in my car which has USB 2.0 port for music (Ford SYNC). This drive is way faster than my old drive nice and small too so hopefully it won't break like my old one did. Would recommend
5,I use it in my car radio as storage for MP3. It is compact and barely visible. It has a little loop to attach small line or ring (very nice feature).
5,Was a perfect addition to my laptop to offload some storage from my SSD. It took a few hours to copy about 120 GB of data; but no complaints so far.
2,This USB drive gets ridiculously hot. So much so that it shuts down and my iMac then throws an error telling me that I shouldn't disconnect drives without ejecting them first.  Yeah right. It shuts down on its own when copying large video files.Pretty much worthless but maybe I'll get lucky and it won't shut down when reading only writing.
5,Happy
5,Great little drive for PlayStation Classic.  Bought this to use my own games. Works flawlessly and now have 135 (with spare room) games at my fingertips.Love the small footprint too.
5,superfast retrieving info and storing info. Size is a + when you need a lot of them as I store my audiobooks on these flash drives.
5,Compared to my USB 2.0 128GB this guy is pretty dang fast. Not quite lightning but served to backup and offload several items from my PC and it didn't take too long.
3,Small light weight and inexspenive. The only major disappointment is that the portion of the drive that plugs into the usb port is made of plastic not metal as it should be. The plastic is extremely thin and feels as though it won't last long before breaking. Only time will tell but my expectations are low.
5,Use it occasionally when email file transfers are impractical. Not sure of rootkit/malware (potential per NSA) lurking in the dongle.
5,You can't beat SanDisk quality.  This tiny form factor is amazing.
5,I've always loved the size and value of this drive. Have different sizes and they all work as described!
5,I'm a DJ and use this for low profile drive in my Pioneer CDJ'sI've heard stories of people coming up and stealing whole drives at clubs you don'e even see this one when DJ'n
5,My son needed a few extra gigs on his PC to store multimedia files. We went with this SanDisk product based on reviews and price. We're happy with the product. It was easy to install and immediately use.
3,Packaging is dismal.  If the product was meant to be portable shouldn't it be covered with at least durable material that could resist some wear and tear?  It would break in the first week if not day if you were to put it in to your key chain.
4,Does what it's supposed to.
5,I just got it. It gets a little warm but they say it is normal. Not like it burns to the touch! I am giving it a workout so I will keep in touch.
5,I use multiples of these to bring around my digital "crate" for DJ'ing. Transfer rate is more than enough to load music into most software.
5,Ordered this to reformat my son's Xbox One S. It did the job for me flawlessly.
5,Solid usb broke one before when I dropped my lap top. They don’t work if you break them. Other than that never had any issues but they are easy to lose.
5,I was looking for an "hard drive" extension for my chromebook. Works as expected. It is tiny and has stylized curves.It gets a little bit hot but that is perfectly normal.A good buy no doubt
5,I reformatted for macOS (use Disk Utility). Works well. Reasonably fast file transfer. Smaller than my thumbnail. Fits in my travel bag without adding too much weight but stores a quarter of a terabyte.
5,This 128GB flash drive was just what I needed to put all of my 109GB of music on.  You can't go wrong with a SanDisk.
5,Nice to get a nearly flush mount on my laptop. When unplugged from the laptop it's really small no lanyard loopor anything easy to lose.
5,Fast and extremely small USB thumb drive made of plastic so no heating problem with this one:)Super fast delivery great shop highly recommended!
5,Use this as a (emergency) drive. Situate it update it & forget about it (until you need it).
5,Excellent... Have used it now for years. Perfect for cars small size does not interfer or get in the way.
5,plastic and light weight could have come with a lanyard but it works and it's fast enough
5,Love it. It's almost too small.I had to tie a ribbon on it so I won't lose it.
5,It’s a good flash drive however it gets hot on larger transfers and slows right down. Smaller transfers work great though. Plastic is very thin I wouldn’t risk this on a key chain.
5,So small you can attach it to your notebook and not notice it's there. Cool.
5,This is so tiny that it doesn't get in the way when I put my laptop in its case. I leave it connected all the time and always have extra storage space for downloads and files.
5,Just as expected
5,It is perfect fit for using in car for music.  Only drawback is that when it gets too warm it does not fuction correctly.  After unplugging it it cools down and works like normal.
5,I bough this to use in my Tesla Model 3 for the Dash-cam feature and it works great for this feature. No issues at all. Very small and compact drive. Definitely recommend this one.
4,Works great gets really hot but very low profile.
5,I'm in love with this little drive.  Lots of storage for such a tiny piece of hardware.  I've got it connected to a Fire Stick.  Works great.
5,So far its worked well in my new laptop. I was looking for something tiny that I can leave plugged in and this one seems to work well. Easy to use
5,I think is important to put a cover so the memory wont be open in all places a little of protection dosent going to hurt
5,Using for an unraid build. Up and running in no time and so far so good.
4,Good and small...pause
5,Unbelievable that this is so small and stores so much data. I use it in my Tesla Model S for the dash cam and Sentry video storage.
5,Nice value and works great.
4,Runs hot so life may be limited....
1,Plugged this into my windows machine and it does NOT show up as 512GB. It shows up as 5.99 GB..So what on earth are you selling here? Seems like false advertising. Very upset and a waste of $$.
1,Should have listened to the other reviews. This thing has horrendous read and write speeds nowhere near its advertised rates. They get worse as it gets hot and it heats up QUICK. Avoid this flash drive unless you don't care about speed.
4,Works as advertised.
3,should be 512GB and as it turned out it has only 460gb
2,I just plugged this into my work windows 10 laptop so that i could backup all my files after a lexar USB drive i was previously using failed. I plugged it into the same port i previously had my lexar drive in right next to my logitech unifying dongle for my wireless keyboard and mouse and they stopped working. I moved it one USB port away and it works somewhat but my keyboard and mouse skip around. I moved it to the other side of the PC and the keyboard and mouse seem to be working but i'm worried about long term use of this drive. I feel a RMA in the force....
5,This little gadget worked perfectly out of the package and is very much out of the way. I won't have to remove it to put my laptop in it's case.
5,I love the small size combined with the large amount of storage space. It is just what I need.
5,Purchased for Tesla to store video footage. Works great and doesn’t get in the way! Larger storage is great since the 64GB filled up fast.
2,On the plus side:  The computer end of this is good it reads fast and writes fast.On the minus side:  I've only plugged it into the car 2x and the computer 4x so in/out 6x all together.  In this short use the plastic front of this thing is making creaking noises I'm afraid its not going to last very long.I know I should send it back but there's no point in asking for another one as the design is simply not that sturdy.
5,I love it its small and very discreet. I just leave it plugged in and use it when I need space.
5,This is the size of your finger nail. Its really convient to be able to take around without size.
1,I bought two of these flash drives (SDCZ430-256G  BQ191257582W) from Amazon and promptly tried to copy a bunch of my files to them and they both failed during the copy process with a Write Protect error.The first one failed after ~40 GB of data was copied to it and the second failed after ~50 GB was copied.I found more information on SanDisk's website indicating that this is a feature to help avoid losing access to existing files when a drive is detected to be failing... and once it happens there is no fixing it.BOTH usb flash drives now contain very sensitive files that I can not delete. I need to destroy them.Fortunately Amazon's replacement/return policy has saved my money but I would not feel confident using any new version of this type of flash drive.For reference my computer is a Lenovo IdeaPad FLEX-15IML running Windows 10.
4,Disk is very useful with good storage space
3,Size and speed as advertised. However the plastic is flimsy. If you plan on anything other than very light use I'd look at a metal drive or something with better construction. The plastic broke in a matter of days.
5,Good price good drive and fast.  I read were these were getting hot.  I leave mine plugged in all the time and I did not notice any heat problems and this drive works just fine.
5,I use them as music storage in the car.  They work perfectly.
1,It's very small in physical size which i thought would be good.  However you must be extremely careful in putting it in the usb port so not to collapse the very thin top against the recording.  you must hold it by the sides which makes it very difficult to slide it in the usb slot due to its small size. i would not buy again.
5,It's a flash drive. It works. It is fast. As described. I was able to put Antergos on this flash drive and it runs pretty well although the USB port i plug it into heats up a lot.
5,The small size means it is not bent/dislodged when I move my laptop. Several weeks after buying it it continues to wok like new. It is the second one I have bought.
5,Great reliable product with very convenient size and good capacity. No issues so far.
1,Will not play in my car
5,Use it as a storage drive on Raspberry pi 4.  Works as expected
5,Love it!
5,It's formatted in exfat but it has a bug that not allowed me to storage big files. Luckily it was solved by formatting it again on exfat
3,perfection for all speed performance and size but not working any more after 4 or 5 months of use unfortunately too much disappointment perviously i gave it 5 stars but now 3 stars for those months of working. i can't believe that and i exactly i start using it in April 2019.....
4,A great little USB flash drive but write speed is pretty slow...
3,I cannot speak for reliability (it has not been long) but this thing feels SO cheap. It's made of some flimsy plastic. I cannot fathom this will last very long at all. Will not be buying again.
4,it works like a charm but it get hot really fast (upwards of 70C)
5,Used this for automated backup of data for wife's home business.  Fast and unobtrusive very portable.
5,What can I say…works like a gem!
4,Great lightweight and low profile item.  Really easy plug and go style.
5,Nothing to dislike about that flash drive. It has lots of xapasitc and is extremely compact.
5,Stays in my laptop permanently.
4,works well on my R Pi not as fast as expect. Need to see how long it will hold
4,Good price & material
5,Good
5,Great memory! Quality!
5,excellent
2,I've only used it for a day. A DAY and it's having problems. Flash drives are known to be portable but it being the size it is makes it rather difficult to diffuse the heat it generates as data flows through it. If heat is ever an issue it slows down because of it. So much for USB 3.1. I can't say it's bad I've had worse flash drives but I'm overall disappointed in this.It's small but I've found that the little opening it has is too small to even thread string through it to carry around meaning it's quite easy to lose. And I mean really easy to lose
2,Product was shipped and it was crushed. It now won't fit in the USB port. The cost of shipping it back is going to cost me just about as much as it did to buy the product so I'm just pretty much at a loss. ScanDisk is a great product so I'm sure the product would work fine had it not been crushed and had the amount of storage as advertised. This is a very tiny little thumb drive and I was happy about that.
5,this drive is VERY small which will fit nicely in your wallet if needed.  I'll use extra care when handling it so I don't lose it.
1,Went to read-only mode immediately after I plugged it in. Likely it was already faulty to begin with. Either I’m so lucky - or chances are they just dump faulty ones from their stock.
5,Only issue here is durability. But for me I leave it plugged into my Macbook Air at all times ... so there's very limited opportunities for it to be dropped or broken.
5,These are great for your car because it is very short and less likely to be bumped. Plenty of room for your music
1,When I Right Clicked to show "Properties" it showed USB Flash Drive to be 256GB when I received It. Once reformatted "Properties" showed it to be only 32GB.The price seemed like a great deal for a 256GB drive but was very overpriced for a 32GB flash drive. That was the RED FLAG I should have listened to. Internet research shows that many Flash Drives are sold as claiming to be much higher capacity than they actually are. My understanding is that some small amount of software is pre-loaded that make your computer falsely show the size larger than it really is.For this flash drive if I never used more than 32GB and/or didn't reformat it to make it a Windows Install USB I would not have known about the fake size of the flash driveAmazon DID REFUND my purchase price even though I didn't find the "Scam" for 10 weeks so I am only out my time and some hassle and not my $59.
5,Perfect to enable the dash came in a Tesla.  Small form factor is a plus!
5,Great way to store music and videos
5,Good value drive great for portability.
5,How do they get this much memory in that tiny chip?This is so small it does not project from my computer at all. Just enough for my thumbnail to pull it out.
5,Very small and compact. Perfect for android tv boxes.
1,I bought this for the dashcam in my car.  After 2 years of operating fine it just stopped working today.  The computer sees it but any interaction with the drive just times out.  I bought name brand because I've trusted SanDisk in the past.  Very disappointed in losing the data.  Of course the warranty is for 2 years and it is now 4 months past 2 years.  Timing is perfect.
4,Seems to work ok but gets very warm when using them.
4,It gets pretty hot.
1,Finally got the chance to review this. Mine worked only 3 months when I connected it to my NVidia shield in case I needed to install more apps. It never got used except the fact that my shield console formatted it after first connection. After 3 months it just stopped working and could not be formatted or used with computers. I will not recommend this for use where you may have to keep it constantly connected to something.
5,Fits the bill for a USB 3.1 drive easy to carry and gives me plenty of space to moving or sharing videos.
1,Worked fine for 3 years. Then died quietly.
4,easy to use and fast to copy information great memory for the value
2,Bought for use in Tesla Model 3 as dash cam and not only is the form factor very hard to plug into the USB port being actually too compact but it gets extremely hot during use and write speeds are terribly unpredictable causing some camera clips to fail to write in time and corrupting the filesystem eventually.  Often the clips are either zero length or half the frame is missing.  downloading to computer is very slow as well.  Replaced with a Samsung Bar Plus 256g seems much better.  It is also metal instead of plastic and doesn't get hot and reads very fast.
5,Es muy rapido USB 3.1 y velocidad de lectura escritura bastante altas se siente la diferencia de otras unidades lo utilizo oara ampliar la memoria de mi nvidia shield tv y funciona muy bien.
5,Small easy to use and I backed up all my computer photos and put this away in a fire proof case.
5,I'm still amazed how much can fit on this drive considering how small it is.
4,I like test l that it is sleek. I don't like that it is only 64 g
5,I like the small form-factor and being USB 3.1... I use this product for storing a bunch of movies like 72 of them for only half storage so far
1,No recomiendo comprar este productoPor que no tienen las 64 GB de almacenamiento como se describe en su publicación solo tiene 57Y por otro lado  tampoco es  3.0 de velocidad como se describe.
5,Like the compact size don’t need to worry about breaking my car audio USB port!!
4,Very happy nice and fast works good for my Nvidia shield
4,Just excellent and compact.
4,More storage of cords.?
2,I bought this to play mp3 file thru the usb port in may car.  Worked great for about 2 weeks then it failed.  To be honest I don't know if the fault is the drive or my usb port.  However the car usb port still works fine with my iPod.
4,Lightweight is an understatement. 256 GB is the best thumb drive i have !!!
4,Gets much hotter than the full size version but can R/W up to 100MBs in most use cases
1,This device stopped working within a week of having it. It would overheat to the point that it burned by hand to pull it out and then became unavailable on my computer. I bought this to back up all the files on my computer and now those files are lost. The company let me know that I can pay their partner company to recover my files but there would be no guarantee. They seemed to be more focused on letting me know they aren't responsible for the costs of my lost information instead of giving any insight as to how I can recover them. This company makes good many selling dysfunctional products and then making their customers pay even more to recover the files they trusted to be stored on the device.
3,This Flash Drive fits too tight into the USB port so I would not recommend it for those who constantly removes it. Doesn't seem durable enough for constant removal. Since I use it as a D: drive on my Laptop placing files pictures and music; it frees up my C: drive.
5,Using this to house programs and such for my PS2. Works well. No issues. PS2 sees it with no problem. Speeds are good compared to the PS2. Nice and small footprint.
5,So small it sits on my laptop all the time. After several months using this no problem so far.
4,Worked for a couple hours then died.-edit-Returned it for a new one works great
5,I use it for sentry mode in my car. It's recorded everything so far.
5,I have a bunch of them. They are great for sharing large files.
5,Just wish it was a little  longer hard to remove  from  certain ports
5,Very good quality and easy to use
3,GOOD. If you have any issues customer service will make it right. If I need another one I would definitely order again.
5,Great product
5,Great item for those with your games movies or music. Handy for Xbox one pc and Mac. USB 3.1 128gb drive is the fastest I’ve seen try it out. Great price
2,Melts from cheap plastic and should be designed with aluminum. Don’t Buy!!
5,Its been 3 months and its working great. If it breaks in the near future I'll take this comment down.
5,Very good product small and high capacity.
5,Works good  I leave it in my mini laptop
5,Longer flash drives often get in the way and bend. This one is almost hidden.
5,worth it
5,Fantastic quality and size! 256GB in a tiny package with SanDisk quality. I have one loaded with videos for my Raspberry Pi and one loaded with MP3s for my car stereo.
3,Bought it for using with Tesla Model X as Sentry mode USB device.  But the car reports that the speed is too slow to write videos.
5,Exactly what I needed and expected!
1,Two didn’t work for Unraid
5,Great must get
5,Great product use it for my Nvidia shield to add storage would buy again.
4,It will never get close to the advertised speeds but is a good product nonetheless.
5,This is a great value high-capacity USB key in a really small package.
4,Using it at the moment works fine! a bit on the cheep make but works..
5,Great flash drive. It's small lightweight and fast. The only complaint that I have is that when you plug it in the first time it leaves a mark on the drive.The body is plastic.
3,Small and convenient thought I kinda wish it had a port protector for it.Recommend ONLY if you can absolutely keep it from being damaged. I say that cause it's plastic instead of metal so if it has so much as a crack on it it's over.
5,Using this in a laptop as a secondary drive. The laptop's primary drive is a small (32gb) SSD drive. It has been working fine for last couple months.
3,This looks too fragile to use on a keyring or to leave in a travel laptop.  It is small and has worked for light usage.
5,Good
5,Good price
5,I LOVE these little things! So unobtrusive when in a USB port but plenty of speed and storage capacity.
4,Good price but it's too small too easy to get lost. Hard to use.
5,Sorry Fast. Very Small. Would be easy to Misplace. Would be nice if brightly colored to make less likely to overlook if dropped
3,No good for Tesla model 3.  Read/write speed deteriorated overtime and warning from car that it is too slow to store all videos
3,High capacity but struggles to wrote 40mb/sec consistently
3,Description says we can leave it plugged in and use like and extra drive. So I left it plugged in to my MacBook resulting the device and MacBook super heated even when it’s left idle. Except this everything is fine fits great like it’s not even there good transfer speeds material seems little delicate though!!
5,Excellent as a leave-in-place drive for laptops or micro-computers / computer on a board like the Audrino or Raspberry Pi. Highly recommended.
4,Arrived early worked great almost lost it.  LOL.
5,Tiny perfect for storing music for car stereo.
1,I recommend purchasing something else with a metal casing instead of this low quality plastic that is susceptible to wear and tear from heat.
4,Very handy and useful.  But it has produced some heat.
1,The model I ordered (32G) arrived and is very different from the ones shown in the amazon site. Specifically it has no cap. I need a drive I can keep in my pocket and this is the second SanDisk drive that I receive without a cap. In fact a cap wouldn't even fit because of the particular shape of the drive. The drive is too cheap to bother about returning it.
1,I purchased the SanDisk 256GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive sold by and shipped from Amazon. And the retail package was for a 256GB unit. But what was inside the package only had 32GB capacity. Avoid buying this product as somebody is supplying fake capacity drives to Amazon.
2,It worked great for about 2 months then it overheated and doesnt work on my nvidia sheild no more. I haven't tried on a different device like my laptop but I'm pretty sure its fried. Big waste of money since it only last 2 months and ofcourse I could not do a return or exchange after 30 days from purchaseUpdate: December 2019. I went with the metal sandisk 128gb stick and attached it to my nvidia shield though a USB extension instead of the USB port on the sheild. So far so good. No more overheating and still works after all this time
5,Got one of these for each of my kids wife and mother and loaded all my pictures on them for the year for Christmas.  Almost filled it up!!!
5,Small but got a good quality and huge storage capacity for its sizeWhat I dislike that there’s no cover for it to protect from dust
5,Easy to carry since I always leave it plugin to my laptop all the time.
5,This low profile USB flash drive works like a charm! Plug and play quick and small enough to just leave connected all the time. Actual formated size is 114gb.
5,I have tons of these.  Never failed easy to carry in any situation.
4,Works as expected does get hot but not so hot you cant touch it.
1,Very slow won't hold more than 32gig then you get an error message that says the disk is dirty tried on three different devices and two operating systems. DON'T BUY!
5,I bought this for my car dash-cam save space really compact. Pros is sometimes too small to be found...
1,Overheats when doing large file copies. Then the device disconnects from the computer disrupting the copy job.Don’t recommend for large file transfers.
3,Using it as a backup device for my PS4 Pro 500M LE. I didn't want something that would stick out too much. While this does the job removing it is almost impossible. I had to add a strap to pull out the device. Otherwise it works for game backups.
5,Now usb sticks can be pooled to expand onboard storage to TB range for a fraction of the price.
4,great
5,Awesome way to take my media on the go
5,Good flash drive
5,Nothing much to say except that it's small nifty and does the job very well. I needed a very low profile usb storage device. Be careful as I lost one of them already.
1,I bought this for my Anycubic Mono X printer.  Formatted it Fat32 as I am supposed to and then put some files on it to configure my new printer.  It locked my printer up so soundly that I had to hard reset the printer every single time I plugged it in.  On top of that just leaving it plugged into my laptop made the thing get uncomfortably hot.  I feel this item is not safe to use.  It was the lowest capacity model they offer and isn't worth my time to return it.
5,I bought it specifically to work as a USB 2.0 device. So I was aware of the slow speeds.I use it as expanded storage for a Wii U and it works great.
5,I am using this as my photo storage drive for my MacBook Pro. Works as expected with good speed. Not getting very hot.
5,It's hard to believe that 128 gigs of data fits on this thing and the vast majority of it is just the USB port
5,Fast to load and reads quickly in my Toyota.  Holds more than the 9999 file count limit of my audio system even with many mp3's at 320kbps.  Durable against heat.
5,I'm using this to add some data storage to a small laptop with limited SSD capacity.  It works well and is small so it doesn't obtrude.  Works well.
5,Needs a lanyard or a bell!  These things are tiny!!!
5,Working great a a small media drive on the back of WiFi Router
5,I keep waiting for the bad news! It seems perfect - I can not believe 256G for what I used to pay for 64m
5,Everything I expected & needed for quick picture storage at a great price
5,Great product at a great price. Am very satisfied. Highly Recommend!
3,The drive works fine very fast but when users pick a drive to load up the capacity should be legibly printed so one doesn't need a magnifying glass to see it.
3,This flash drive will not work with my PS4 pro or my new Roku TV no matter how I format it.
5,Excellent product
2,I know it's a low priced item but it is REALLY cheaply made.  The thin lip of brittle plastic will probably snap before I get to use it 10 times.  I would not buy this item again because of the poor construction.  It's basically junk like carrying around a bird egg in your pocket. I would NOT recommend this flash drive to anyone.  Metal or stronger plastic should've been used.
5,The product works as described. There can be inconsistency in the transfer speed but no enough to make the product less than 5 stars.
5,64 gig in this little thingWould be great if it had a hole pre-drilled so it might be attached to "something"
3,very small but not fast enough for teslacam even though this is 100mb/s
5,Fast speeds that work for a bootable OS. I would reccomend this inexpensive drive.
5,Works as you would expect. Great for songs for car. Gets very hot when reading/writing. May be too slow for many applications.
5,as described
5,works as advertised
1,I bought three of these to load with audiobooks and music for a long trip. None of them worked in either of our cars. I tried formatting them re-formatting them in different files systems (FAT32 NTFS etc.) and none of them worked. According to the cars owners manuals these should have worked but they didn't. They worked to load and play music and audiobooks on the computer but not on the car stereos. If you order them try them immediately before you head out on a trip and can't play anything.
4,works great and its very small and compact
5,Love the size and capacity....not bulky sleek design
5,Excellent product fast shipping highly recommend.
4,Arrived exactly as advertised. Would’ve given five stars had it been made out of metal rather than plastic.
5,Tiny I can leave it in my Macbook Pro all the time.
5,Un buen producto no tuve problemas en la escritura y lectura la presentación del USB es buena a mi gusto llego bien empaquetado sin ningún problema.
3,Lots of storage and this thing is tiny. It is a usb 3 drive but the write speed is pretty slow. After a large file transfer this gets very hot to the touch.. Has yet to quit working but I don't believe this will last that long
3,Works fine but slow. Used to dual boot a cheap Chromebook.
5,I love it.  Now I have my office in my pocket and the files go with me even when I don't have my own laptop.  What an improvement over the early "thumb drives."
5,using it for a few projects.
5,A1
2,This flash drive could NOT be used in my new HP laptop running windows 10. I tried many fixes tried a dozen suggestions online followed prompts by my laptop but the files on the flash drive could not be recognized and therefore I was unable to transfer data from my old tower comp. running Windows 7 to this new laptop. Yet when I put it back into my old desktop it opened all the files flawlessly. This product said it was compatible with windows 10. Apparently in my case it is not(?) This is my experience so buyer beware.
1,The drive arrived looking damaged but it worked. 3 months later it is no longer recognized by any of my computers.
5,Amazing
5,Very very small if you don’t have it on a keychain you will lose it  otherwise much better than a hard drive your data is much less likely to corrupt
5,Same as vendor described
5,This is an excellent storage media.  And it doesn't seem to get as hot as some other similar flash drives.
5,Using this product in my TCL Smart TV usb port to be able to pause and do backwards and forwards when watching antenna tv works great live it!!
5,Super small and cheap. Great for Model 3 Dashcam function. Doesn't overheat or cause issues.
5,Good price quick delivery small form factor
5,It does exactly what it is supposed to do -- without taking up a lot of space. I leave it plugged in all the time without any problems.
5,I put about 40 albums on this thumb drive and leave it plugged into my car. No more commercials or annoying radio DJ's.
5,For some unknown reason it did not work with the nissan media player.
4,Copied MP3 favorite songs for playing in new Hyundai USB connected radio.
5,It works perfectly — high capacity and quick read/write.
5,Great product I do Not regret this purchase at al.
5,I didn't use it didn't open it either only bought it for the Nvidia shield but ended up returning it but damn that's allot of storage.
5,no problems
5,Works great. You do have to be aware of where you put it down!
5,Got this as an auxiliary back up space and dumping ground for miscellaneous files for my laptop. Fast transfers and no need to remove.  Great price!
5,i like everything about it its small
4,Just thx
5,Super fast transfer speeds. Small design but overall great usb
5,Plugs right into the side of my laptop- I don't have to worry about it at all. Will look for larger capacity.
5,Great.. a lot  storage for files etc. Arrived in great timing. Good condition never been used.
2,While the attractive small size is nice the drives performance negates the advantage of the large capacity. I feel this drive is slower than the previous USB 3.0 version of the Ultra Fit that I previously owned. While the read speeds are decent the real world sustained write speeds (60GB of RAW photos) are below 22MB/s which is very slow for a USB 3.1 class drive. This makes this drive unsuitable for transferring large amount of data quickly so I regret getting this model.
5,I like this usb device. It is small and confortable.. I have used it for a couple of months and it works great!!
5,Excellent. Using it in my MacBook Air. Ru s quite warm though which will impact reliability so be sure to keep a backup of all on this drive as well.
5,love the storage so tiny I always feel like I'm going to lose it
5,Love the slim form factor. Fast USB. Great for being on your keys for a portable cam.
5,But great for porn.
3,Performance has been iffy and the drive is prone to randomly unmounting itself when I peg it hard with I/O. Maybe this is to be expected from such a small device but it still frustrates me. The last-generation Ultra Fit 128GB did this too albeit with hotter results.
5,Me gustó su tamaño es perfecto para el carro. Es la segunda vez que lo ordeno y estoy maravillada.
5,Bought this for Tesla dash cam use.  Comes formatted fat32. No corruption issues no error messages (esp with latest update).
5,Does what its ment for at a very fast speed awesome purchase
5,I was impressed with speed.  I write and use this for backup.  Very fast data rates.  No issues.
5,Purchased for photo storage...works just fine!  I was not concerned about ultra fast speeds however it was fast enough to keep me from downing a cup of coffee (unofficial speed test).
2,One of the reasons I bought this flash drive was because of its compact design. The one I received even though it performed within the specifications is slimmer and more protuberant from the ultrabook thus more inconvenient to keep it plugged when moving around more risky for the ultrabook.
5,I can't believe how small and yet has a great storage capacity. Just be careful you don't lose it.
5,Na
5,Used it to save music in different folders and play it in my new Land Rover. Love the form factor. Fits very snugly in the glove box!
4,good product and good price
5,nice
5,Purchased this for a PS Vita TV works great.
5,work good
5,It does the job and it's tiny and easy to carry everywhere. Absolutely recommend!
5,Performance is very good  affordable price
5,Reliable. Portable. Easy to use. Perfect companion for a laptop with limited storage space. Want a 500GB version it!!!
5,So small i forget its in my laptop sometimes
5,Highly recommended.  Would buy again.
5,A+++ product and great communication with seller.
5,Small profile makes them perfect for laptops unobtrusive  on desktops SanDisk always reliable.
1,To note I have a lot of computers and one of them has a small amount of 'flash' storage so I use external devices for it. For $42 this drive is not worth it. It crashes. It advertises that it can 'transfer files' 'Transfer a full-length movie in less than 30 seconds'.I can't even transfer small files without it overheating and *crashing* my entire computer. To put that into perspective I use a gaming machine built for playing games at the highest graphical setting. This happened to my gaming laptop *and* my gaming desktop.I attempted to transfer 6.24GB of storage onto it's impressive 233GB of free storage and it crashed numerous times freezing and locking up my system twice. I have to transfer one file at a time.To transfer 756 MB of storage took me about 10-15 minutes.Be prepared for complications with this.
3,Writing is very slow for this drive - perhaps 5MB per second even on USB 3. It also runs very hot.
5,Exactly what I needed
5,it's very small I recommend putting a lace trough it so you don't loose it
5,This works great. Not a lot more needs to be said..
5,I am using this for my other computer files after failing to use it for my Tesla Model 3. It is not compatible with my car. It's okay.
5,Good build quality. Very discrete when plugged in. Perfect for my needs
5,This thing is fast it uploads 2gigs in less than a minute .
5,I love having one of these on my keyring. Makes it possible to sneaker-net files around any time the need arises without adding noticeable clutter or weight.
5,Safe when carrying laptop
4,Good
5,Small and compact. Easy to loose but use a strap to keep track
3,Are these supposed to get this hot?  Plus I may be crazy but I swear it does not play music as loud as my other USB thumb drives.
1,I have many different USB flash drives of all speeds sizes makes and models.I benchmark and categorize each one so that i know what i need for quick and dirty jobs to reliability and travel jobs.This is by far the worst usb flash drive i have ever received. I have had errors and issues that are fixable with past drives by formatting or adjusting the VSS setting on my computer or even just something basic as changinf to differnt usb ports.but countless hours of tests 2 different computers 3 additional hubs multiple formats to different file systems (fat32 NTFS ExFat etc..) ...NOTHING has worked to keep this drive connected to transfer a few files even the USB FLASH drive TEST utilities cant complete a simple speed test because the flash drive will disconnect when sending dummy file packets to it.Extremely disappointing
5,As expected plug and play. Use it as back up...no issues so far.
5,Highly recommended.
5,It’s crazy how tiny and cute these are. They don’t get in the way but very easy to misplace
3,Got this as something to carry my tunes in my car had it plugged into my computer for 10... maybe 15 minutes disconnected it and it was pretty darn hot! Not scalding but enough for me to just use it for carrying files from here to there.
3,buy it for my car-cams but keep showing error of not fast to download the data.
4,Get's hot really really quick when i transfer 10gb of videos and files.
5,Great Item
5,It's small and compact. Just what I was looking for.
5,Hard to believe this tiny thing can hold so much. :)
5,Loved small thumb nail size. Held over 200 movies. Now my kids don’t scratch dvds or not put them back in cases.
5,Good value for backup dok. Pretty quick and can keep some hd movies along with personal staff
5,Purchased primarily to be used to access Windows encryption because my PC/Laptop doesn't have TPM chip.  This more than fit the bill.  Great buy for so much file space.
5,Hold a lot in such a little container. Works great.
5,A lot of reliable storage for a decent price. Fast access and a name you can trust. What more can you ask. Happy customer.
5,Stores a lot of songs for the car entrainment center.  Still adding and the extremely small size is great.
5,Perfect to add the pictures were wanted for a digital frame.
4,Good
3,Very fast but... So small it's hard to hold insert or keep on a key ring.
5,this USB drive will not get bent in your laptop.
4,easy to use
5,As expected with high quality and expected size
5,Terrific storage for thousands of songs books and other audio for truck USB.
5,As describe works great they have to send a replacement didnt received the first time
5,Works great in my car no issues so far.
5,Does exactly what it was made to do.
5,It is very small and easy to have on the laptop all the time
5,Big memory small in stature very convenient. Easy to lose though.
5,this works perfect on my nvidia shield seems very fast memory .I would buy this again if needed well worth the money
1,Slower read rates than the competition or as advertised. Write rates put me in a coma. Dipped down to 300 KB/s with an upper range of about 20 MB/s. On average about  700 KB/s to 1 MB/s write speeds. Overall just a disappointing product.I do think that if you're simply looking for cheap storage for documents have lots of patience...this may be the flash drive for you. It's definitely better $$$ value. But as a boot drive or frequent transfers perhaps look elsewhere.
4,Very good size
5,So small and compact you need to be careful not to loose it it's virtually invisible but works like a charm.
2,This product is now complete garbage.  Great job on this one I must say. This type of low quality product is exactly how a company destroys their reputation and put themselves out of business.  Cheap thin and very inexpensive plastic is used for the housing. Burst data speeds sustained data transfer speed is nowhere near advertised and is a complete lie to the consumer. Please consider using another manufacturer for your data storage needs SanDisk is no longer a contender when it comes to a reliable and quality product.
5,Works great. Very small and exactly what I wanted.
5,Watch out..!!! This product is so small physically that you might lose it in the couch. But it will free up oodles of space on your computer.
5,Item was shipped and received quickly. Everything was described perfectly and I recommend this seller.
1,Bought to capture dash came footage in Tesla.  Failed in less than 2 months.
5,Just what I was looking for and a great price.
5,For DJ
3,I am pleased with the low profile and capacity of this drive however was sad when the drive stpped working just after the support window closed. I strongly urge everyone using this drive to back up their data to an external regularly!
5,I purchase it second time because I lost my first one. It's great and easy to carry.
5,Not too big and not too small! Outstanding price too!
5,And this is no exception.
5,Definitely worth the money.  Don't be fooled by non name brand empty promises.  I tested this myself and it really is 256gb.
5,Easy to install and doesn't get in the way
4,Works fine ... so far.
5,Great USB it's so small and large capacity I can have several movies on it and still have my docs for my classes.
5,I put a keychain lanyard on it so it won't get lost. Great product.
5,I put 64gb on it with no problem.
5,Smoking fast delivery.  Great price.  Nice job Amazon
5,As advertised. Would order again.
4,Gets warm but I guess its normal
5,SD
5,It’s can be hard to find at times but that comes with being so compact. It doubled my storage on my laptop.
4,Mark it you will get 200GB of usable storage.
5,I use this for an install disk (bootable)  !!!
5,The speed is reasonable and it is what I expected.
5,Works great with my nvidia shield.
4,Product arrived promptly and worked great.
3,Really like the size. I loaded 70GB of music on it and use it with a Macbook Pro and it reads really quickly. I'm a little concerned about the amount of heat generated by the product while in use (gets hot).
5,Nice and discreet!
5,Nice for a digital recorder I have that doesn't stick out and get in the way. Have one in my car for music and it's not so visible.
4,Works well
3,I bought USB 3.1 thinking that it would be faster. It transferred my backup folder as fast my USB 2.0  USB drive. Keeping it for it's size and price though. I won't buy another SanDisck drive.
5,Fue muy grato poder utilizar este producto! Me encanto!
5,Small enough to fit right in my usb port in my car and not know its there. Great for music .
5,Overall a great buy was able to encrypt the driven problem. very portable. 5 stars!
5,Use these for everything. Storing music transferring files backups etc.
5,Such a good deal for 32gb. Super tiny can carry on a keychain.
4,It's almost too small to get hold of and insert to a connection.
5,Small for the use case and fit well  have to wait and see how the durability goes as its plastic. but so far so great.
5,I have many usb drives and this one is the best.  It is fast and the smallest unit you could have.
4,Takes a while to transfer files.
5,My only negative critism is that I wish it had an L.E.D. indicating something being written to it. Oherwise it's fine.
5,Great my first and I can buy it again!!!
5,Good amount of space for the price and in a small form. I have this on my Xbox one and it doesn’t look out of place
5,I bought this flash drive to replace my old 125 Gb drive so I can listen to music on my pickup stereo
5,Portable and easy to use.  Good speed for file transfer.
5,Great little drive
2,This unit died in less than 11 months of always-on use storing software project files and music. It is the second SanDisk low-profile USB Flash drive to fail on me and this time it will not even show up when I plug it in unlike the last one which I was at least able to recover the data from. This unit may be fine for typical USB-stick usage -- moving files etc. -- but beware SanDisk's "plug-and-stay" claims.
1,I purchased two of these after losing a thumb drive with some sensitive information on it. The password could not be created on the first one after I plugged it in to my computer. The second I was able to create a password and place files in the secure vault but am not able to retrieve the files as there is no prompt to put in the password when the drive is inserted into the computer. Very disappointed in this product. Way too much money spent on this looking for a secure way to store files.
5,Easy to use does what it’s suppose to
1,I purchased the Sandisk USB drive on September 30 2019 and as of December 29 2019 it has completely stopped working.  When I insert the drive in my USB port I get the message "Power surge on the USB port. Unknown USB Device needs more Power than the port can supply.  I contacted Amazon via chat for assistance.  I was instructed to delete the USB controller drivers and reboot my laptop.  When I told the person with whom I was chatting that I would lose her  she said she would call back in a few minutes.  It's has been more than a few minutes and no call back.  I would like someone to refund my money for the flash drive.  It should last more than 3 months.
5,Good little guy you may end up losing it if you carry it around because it is so small.
4,Like size but easy to misplace.
5,El tamaño es ideal para el equipo de audio de mi automóvil... y la capacidad? inmejorable: muchas canciones para escuchar durante mi conducción.La recomiendo 100%
1,Purchased the SanDisk 32GB flash drive on October 14 2020. Did not use the drive until after the end of the year(2020). Stored files on the drive intermittently for three weeks. Yesterday 01/30/2021 the drive became unreadable. I have tried to uninstall format and scan the drive but nothing would fix the drive to make it readable. All of the files approximately 23GB are inaccessible. Three weeks of creating the files will have to be recreated. I bought two of the same drives in the original order. Don't know if I want to use the other drive.
5,If you want small this is it.  Great value.
1,wow I should have stayed with the Scandisk drive I normally get. This drive worked for about 48 hours then just stopped functioning properly.  Tried everything and took to a tech shop verdict is a "bad device".
1,Bought this for additional storage for a MacBook Air. Worked great for 5 months then stopped responding. Tried repairing the disk (Disk Utility and CHKDSK) to no avail. Also unable to reformat the disk. It appears to be completely dead taking all the data with it. I'd recommend using this only for transferring data that's backed up elsewhere not to expand storage that isn't backed up elsewhere. Very disappointed.
1,Like another reviewer on here mine only formats out to 32 gigs. I've tried in USB 2 and USB 3 ports on two machines (both Windows 10). I can't get this to format out to the advertised 256gigs. Was going to order a second to see if it was a fluke but reading the rest of the reviews about reliability going to go with an entirely differnet product.
5,Pretty good storage for the size
5,Easy to use! Great product!
3,I bought the 128GB version when I deleted all the files that the USB came with total memory of the flashdrive was 114gb.  I would expect 1-2gb missing but not 14gb.
5,Works for what I wanted. Put all my music on the flash drive. The only thing is I need to tell Itunes where to find the songs for every song.
5,Great way to add memory to laptop
5,It’s small in size but delivers what u expects from 256GB drive getting over heat after using it for whole day that’s worrying.. but overall I m very happy with the performance
1,Died within TWO WEEKS of light use as a boot drive for unraid. It's only accessed during boot and the OS gets loaded to RAM so there's very little the flash drive needs to be good at. I just wanted something small.Confirmed the superblock is bad and there are many unreadable clusters. My most recent backup of this data is several weeks old so I lost a lot including configurations that were difficult to figure out.I don't know why I ignored all of the bad reviews here. I'm extremely frustrated.Don't be a chump like me. Find another drive.
2,Was using this drive to run Ubuntu on a server that did not have enough sata ports for a 7th drive for the OS it overheated and became read only XD REALLY sucks cause now I have to redo everything.  Do not depend on this drive for anything mine only lasted for 8 months and there was not so much as 128GB written to it more like 40GB... Its too small for its own good shouldve got a full size!
5,Never had a problem with Sandisk always reliable never fails!
3,Feels cheap and too tight of a fit.
5,I bought it to plug into the stereo in my car and it reads fast and is low profile so it is hardly noticeable.
5,Hard to believe that this amount of storage is possible in such a small device.  Fantastic item.
5,Works great at a great price and fast shipping.
5,I was very surprised if the quality of something so small!  Will tell others about how wonderful deal this is
4,The small size of the ultra fit is perfect for my laptop.
5,I put a cord on it and it can be hidden just about anywhere. My critical data is secure.
5,but it comes with a loop so you can secure it to your keys or a cord loop. fast read and write.
5,Aun no lo uso pero se ve muy bien.
4,Good amount of memory but on the flimsy side
5,Works as advertised. No problem in settng up a password.
5,These low profile flash drives are perfect for use in the truck for the mp3 music  for my laptop and fantastic for my Micca media player.
2,Bought as write up included how to back up files but no use instructions came with it.
4,Plastic body less protected
5,Excellent product. It's fast and very easy to handle.
5,I use this for a persistent Ubuntu install. It isn't quite as fast as an SSD but way way faster than a HD.
4,My son needed this for college.  Works as expected.
4,Music
5,Pedí que enviaran todas las compras (4) en una solo paquete... Lamentablemente me los enviaron por separado
5,Hooked up to MacBook Air  used to store 139GB of music no heating up just warm no problems
2,These worked just fine but I don't know for how long as they get really hot with active use.  That's probably because they are quite small -- much smaller than most -- & there's not much heat sinking.  In fact they are small enough to easily get lost & are harder to handle than standard size thumb drives.If you want something very small & are going to use is intermittently these should work fine.  For me well I'm returning them.
1,This gets very hot every time I use it. Not warm but hot.  I stopped using it because I was worried it may damage or melt my computer or car usb slots. Maybe I got a defective one but the Samsung one that I bought to replace works fine.
5,Excellent value. Fast transfers. Love the size of the product.
5,So far so good. Love the small form factor.
5,Bought this for the low profile and decent storage space to use in my GMC Infotainment system for movie watching.  Works great.
1,The drive is very small size which I liked.  I formatted it first FAT32 and then NTFS either one I was getting not more 10 mb/s write speed...very slow. They say it is 15X faster than USB 2 speeds not true. I was using a High speed USB port. For this price you can buy  a 1 TB external hard drive. Unless you need the size I would not recommend.
5,This tiny little flash drive packs a big punch! Perfect fit for my laptop & makes keeping all thing college related easy.
1,Only used it on and off for about 18 months one day it just stopped working ("USB device is not recognized by your PC"). Tried multiple PCs and took it in to a shop that does basic data recovery and they confirmed the on board controller was toast. It's eligible for an RMA but frankly I'm not going to bother and picked up a Samsung equivalent instead.There's likely a design flaw as it ran very hot when it was working. Disappointed.
5,Purchased to increase memory on a Chromebook and it does the job well. Lots of storage and very fast.
5,Amazing little price of gadget. Very handy. Didn't get excessive heated even on prolonged usage.
5,Used in my 2019 Acadia for music.  Short so it is almost not noticed when installed in USB port.  Won't break.
5,Works as designed with my new laptop. Made a Linux 18.94 boot drive on this and work awesome fast. Booted up and was installing software in no time.
5,Great for storing music in my cars.
5,Perfect for a leave in flash drive.
5,This has a ton of storage in a VERY small form factor for cheap!  What more could you want?
5,Works as it should. No complaints that I could think of
5,Good product at a great price... At least when I bought it here on Amazon for $21.99 back in July 2018.
5,Perfect for my daughters  tablet
5,I wanted an additional storage drive that I can keep on my keychain this was the perfect size
5,Samsung quality. It's a USB drive. No issues.
3,Copying several thousand mp3 files (average size ~ 5mb) to this device took forever. Write speed was about 12 mbps -- faster than USB-2 (obviously) but seriously disappointing. Good thing I'm only doing this occasionally!
5,does the job
5,I bought this for an unRAID setup to hold the OS.  Thus it is seldom written to.  It does its job limited as that may be.
5,SanDisk 128GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive works great! Very fast. Easy to use! Very happy with my purchase.
5,Works great and very compact fitting into my ASUS 2-n-1 for storage space expansion.
3,I use to have loot of USB flash drive for work. This is the new model of ultrafit. Previous model was made in metal and i am very satisfied about that. Those are made in thiny plastic. They will not last long
2,all of a sudden i started getting write errors on the disk.  when i did a little research I saw that the disk write protected itself due to a bad sector ... i can read the data but can no longer store any data on it.  seems like a similar problem many people are having with this product .... buy something else .....
5,Looks great and works good. I am using it in my car for hearing songs while driving.. its very compact.
5,Great product very fair price.  Super fast shipping.  Top quality!
5,works with telsa sentry mode easy to set up and get working
1,About 1-2 months into using this I started noticing oddities. So I ran some tests and formatted the drive again and all was good. I don't use it all too often so I really didn't notice anything until just now. The drive is inaccessible now. I have only used the drive 5 times since Oct 2018. 5 TIMES! 2 of those times were just running tests and doing a format. So annoyed that this drive doesn't work. I haven't lost any data on it because it is just used to transfer data from one device to another (again I don't do it often but when I do it would be nice if this device worked).Maybe I got a dud hopefully I can contact tech support and see if they can help me out with this problem.
3,I like the drive for it's small size and capacity.  I am disappointed in the write speed.  Slower than advertised.  It is also made of this plastic and I worry about the durability.
1,I bought this less than 2 years ago (128GB version) because of its small form factor. The write speed was very slow so the larger capacities aren't really very useful. A few days ago the drive became read only and I can't reformat it (I tried all kinds of low level formatting it's definitely a fail-safe feature of the drive I wish I had known this before spending an hour trying to reformat it) making it useless and broken. No more SanDisk for me.
5,Well I good price fast delivery
5,I couldn’t believe how small this was. Works great.
4,It can get hot really fast.
5,Note: I did not touch any of the included software on it I formatted it immediately as is my standard practice with new drives.
4,good
5,Is very small and not notice but when you use it
5,Well worth the money
1,The audio files will not be recognized because the flash drive does not have or support fat32.  Format options only exFAT and NTFS.  Unless
5,Use these to add video to car tv screens read and write speeds are perfect
3,The size and speed are great however the material covering the USB part that goes into your computer is incredibly thin and flimsy.  Also there is no cover for this just an FYI.
1,2 of 3 came defective they don't even fit in the usb port due to the flash broken on the sides. Unfortunately I noticed it too late to return them.
1,When an item is specified to be 64GB. That's what it should be not only 57.2 GB. Now I have to buy another product to fulfill my needs. It got worse. I purchased this item to put my music on it to play in my Chevrolet truck (2011).  The item is only formatted in exFAT or NSTC. My truck cannot read those file formats; it can only read FAT32. I'll have to add this product to my pile of  flash drives that I will rarely ever use and some day will just throw away as not meeting my needs.  In all honesty however I did not know of the limitation of my truck and did not know the file formats limits until I ran into the issue of my truck not being able to read/connect to the drive.
5,Great for tablets that have small internal storage. Maps as another drive and very small profile makes it easy to leave permanently attached.
5,Great product
4,Like it. Works well.. Buts get hot..
5,Very portable. Practical for everyday use. You don't feel it in your pocket.
2,Great physical size and storage capacity but transfers are slow. They start fast but after a few seconds slow down. I ended up returning it since it was purchased as a leave-in device and it overheated often making it unusable several hours a day. replaced with a Samsung 128GB which is slightly lager in the physical sense but is much faster and never overheats in the same USB port. This SanDisk drive would be good for cheap capacity but not as a leave-in drive.
5,Well... since I found the error of my formatting ways it works great in our Model 3.
2,Awesome that you can get a lot of data on this. After a handful of plugins and unplugs the plastic top broke off inside my $1700 laptop blocking the port. USB ports are limited on laptops. I was not happy that it broke so easily.
5,We purchased this to work with our Roku TV for pausing live TV.  It works great and there's been no issues.
5,Good usb drive
1,Bought this to back-up school files.  During a transfer of files it "write protected" itself and is now useless.  There is no manual switch to turn write-protect on/off so now it's $20 garbage.
1,Purchased October 2020 Owned for a day long enough to do some preliminary read/write cycles. No complaints about speed.Runs very hot. When writing at max speed it was too hot to comfortably keep my finger on.  When reading (Playing movies in a video player) it runs warm/hot.  In my opinion this is a failure of engineering.  Electronics fail when they heat cycle themselves so drastically.The plastic feels like it will break soon. The rectangular frame that plugs into the USB slot won't last long especially if this is kept on a keychain with anything else in your pocket.
2,Cannot be used as APFS encrypted on Mac.*Update* It can be used APFS encrypted. Just make sure you delete any containers and you format the root drive using GUID partition map. Its really easy on Mac.
3,Had one stop registering in my computers after two days of use. It just would not seat properly in any machine. Managed to wipe it and get a replacement from amazon. Loving it since then but very cautious about it.
2,I purchased 2 of them. I was very happy with how small and portable they were. I plugged both of them to verify if they were functioning. They were plugged in for probably less than 1 min and I removed them. They were super hot. I am not sure how long they will work. But I am not convinced that they will last long.
5,Love these small drives with a lot of space.
5,I use this in different vehicles and it works great in all the stereos. Fast data retrieval and plenty of storage space.
5,Works really well. I love the low-profile size. Great storage for a really low price.
3,Very small which is a plus however it won’t fit on  typical key ring.
5,Product was delivered on time and exactly as described. Very handy to have. It's tiny and it does not get as hot as the previous models.
5,Great product
5,Could easily be lost didn't come with some type of string or hook
5,This small USB drive is very small and works very well for car audio.  It is small and light and works exactly as expected.
5,Large storage capacity in a small package.
5,Great buy
5,Tiny thumb drive with a lot of storage capacity.
5,Perfect for car to carry musicsmall so make sure u attach keyring
4,it is very small...easy to get lost....but it arrived well packaged.
5,This drive is insanely fast even in a USB 2.0 port
5,Works great! Not as fast as they claim but what thumb drive is?
5,More than enough storage for my car's USB slot.  Always plenty of music to choose from.
5,Works great. Perfect for the car. It is nice and small and inconspicuous. It holds a lot of music and audio books. I wouldn't hesitate buy more.
5,It’s so small. Great for portability. Easy to misplace. No issues so far. Use primarily for video storage at work.
5,Worked as needed.
4,Small enough to get benefits
5,Love the compact sizegreat for car stereo
5,The only problem (large capacity fast operation) is thaat my friends all want one so I had to order three more!
3,It works...but....the whole thing is made of plastic. Even the port. And the port is fairly flimzy. Not sure how long it will last but it works as it should.
5,Great for what I use it for
5,great
5,Ideal storage for my mini laptop. Easy to name and auto transfer data to the drive.
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING.The SanDisk 128GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drives. I have purchased at least 5 of these plastic USB drives from SanDisk and they do not hold up anywhere near as good as the metal ones  They break very easily and they melt.  I had to fish the melted pieces out of two of my Nvidia Shield TV devices.  Stick with the metal-bodied USB flash drives.  Stay away from the plastic ones I think their real crap.  BTW I contacted Sandisk they were supposed to send me an e-mail for warranty replacements in 30 minutes.  However 4 calls and five days later I'm still waiting for a  response from Sandisk.  Hopefully you have better luck than I.
4,Needed another larger one.
5,Small form factor with lots of storage!
5,Excelente compra!
5,As described - that's all I ask when I order a little black USB 3
1,Incredibly thin plastic sleeve slides in to the Usb slot. the unit runs exceedingly hot 120 degrees infrared the plastic becomes brittle and cracks along the corners. overheats are typical of the 3.0 usb mini chips.Look for a metal slide with ventilation ports in it. Both Lexar and Verbatim offer them. Sandisk only offers the ventilated ones in their 2.0 series
5,I want a small usb drive for my wii u with alot of storage and this was a great choice.
3,Works as it should but the entire thing is made out of cheap plastic not metal like other USB flash drives. Had I known this I would not have bought it.
1,I received the scandisk 256 GB on April 1st  2019 AMD proceeded  to save my Work information on it. Most were pptx lots of surgery vídeos and lots of thousands of pictures of surgeries because I am an orthopaedic surgeon university and hospital professor. Everyhing seemed to be ok untill yesterday Whe my 2 Mac computers told me that could not read the scandisk 256 with no reason at all. It was not exposed to sun water strikes nothing more than common treatment you can see it in pictures I added no damage. Both computers told me the same. If I can not recover the information I Will be in serious problems.I do recomend not to buy this product. IT is not same Wayne to back UPS information
5,Really nice device.really portable and safe.
5,Instantly ready for use. Just note that the device can get hot to the touch directly after use.
4,Smaller than I thought it was going to be
3,I like how small it is but there isn't any use to having a USB 3.1 if it cannot transfer data consistently at the speeds that 3.1 is rated for. It gets really hot and the transfer rate drops.
5,Fastest and smallest stick I have user so far. No issues in playing 4k videos directly from stick and heat generation is minimal. Great product!
3,works fine quick but because of the size be careful about large data transfers it will generate a large amount of heat quickly
3,Capacity is 114 GB after formatting for NTFS.Write speed is BAD - average is around 17-19 MB/sRead speeds are good - average is around 135 MB/sSize is tiny easy to carry around.
5,both my children have this riding on their computers.  it has very good storage and you can save movies in it.
5,I have three of these now two of which have been in constant service for a year. Excellent product.
5,This is just the best little USB drive ever. Very small unobtrusive and lots of memory packed into a very tiny device. Typical great Sandisk quality.
2,I am disappointed in SanDisk for having a plastic casing. It is so flimsy and is definitely not up to standard on their past products. It makes no sense. I can say that this will be my last batch of SanDisk I will ever buy.
4,It works
5,Working as intended. Great product.
3,Error on Tesla.  Not fast enough?
5,Great portable memory addition! Great price for that much memory.
1,When plugging this USB drive directly into a Mac mini (2018) it shows up under System Profiler under USB devices as “SanDisk 3.2Gen1” however it does not show up on the desktop (automount) nor in the Disk Utility application.  It’s as if the OS lacks a driver to recognize and mount the driver rending it useless to me.
5,Excelente
1,Didn't work at all
5,Received timely and as described.
5,Liked the small size as I used to send 30 Gb of photos to my son
5,got them for my son so am not familiar with pros and cons
5,Great size to leave in the USB port - adds a good amount of storage easily
2,Planned to use this USB flash stick to store videos from Windows OS on HP desktop PC. Tried to format SanDisk 128GB as NTFS - it fails to format in NTFS no matter what cluster size is chozen.  Well… Then formatted it in exFAT using default settings - success tried to copy bunch of videos - worked but only if SanDisk plugged in directly into PC USB port not through powered USB hub.
5,Perfect little Flash Drive. Fast and reliable. First I used it for Windows installation and it was swift. Overall very pleased with it.
5,Excellent product compact size it's just too bad it does not have a case
5,It’s the best that a thumb drive can deliver as a USB 3.1 flash drive!
3,I love San Disk products.  They have always done well for me.  I purchased this one for my High School Senior niece as a preparation for college Christmas gift.
5,Love the size.  Easy to insert into USB port and remove.  Use these for Windows recovery disks and like the small size for storing.
5,Low profile and it performed as advertised.  Very satisfied.
5,Me gusta
5,A little tight fit
5,As small as it can be made. This drive works flawlessly i would recommend this drive to anyone
5,What a handy little drive. It has enough capacity for my projects and is easy to carry around and use.
3,The product is plastic made feels too light and surely breakable. Not as expected.
5,Previous drive took up too much footprint for In-car use. This one is low profile and works great
5,Really good and size is perfect.
5,fits right into my car usb port and its almost invisible... love it!!!!
5,Works well and does not get hot. I use it on a daily basis all day long. Would definitely recommend.
5,Does what I need with out error
3,Both read/write are slow compared to other storage devices I have. Missing recycle bin.
1,I ordered this drive on March 3rd. I had another SanDisk drive that I used for years. I decided to upgrade or at least that was what I thought. I transferred all my files with ease but yesterday I was unable to open my drive. I tried the norm of turning my computer off restarting and then when desperate I moved the flash drive to another port. No luck. I walked away and tried again today...nope nothing. I had my husband try his luck and nothing and then he even tried it on his computer and nothing the drive is not showing up. Now it's all gone. The quality is just not there anymore.
1,They have pumped up fake good reviews so you will still buy.  Read first!  These constantly fail under normal use.  I bought the 256 GB model and in less than a day (my first copy job) it hard failed and locked on me (no way to recover).  Only solution is to send it back in to MFG and then they will replace.  However they then have your data as there is no way to delete it and they just replace with another bad drive!  Totally unacceptable.  Never will buy san disk again.
5,Great product
5,Delivery on time and as described.  A must for folks who need SSD backup
4,Bien
4,Very convenient
5,have 67 albums stored.  minimal obstruction in the compartment.  works well in the new CrV
5,Wanted small music USB storage to not be an eyesore in the car.  This is a perfect solution!
5,I love these flash drives. They have very fast transfer speeds and are super compact.
5,Using this for my music library since GM is not producing some new vehicles without a CD player option (2017 Impala).
5,Si
5,Works great to store movies and I put a colored zip tie around the opening so I do not lose it since it is so small.
5,It's great tiny but with large capacity.
5,Good product
5,Works great
3,Write speeds slow down significantly with sustained copy operations. I was ok with this as the benefits of the drive esp the size were worth it. But after two months it stopped working entirely.
4,Just what I need for may computer
5,This flash drive is so small looks great and performs perfectly.
5,This small stuff makes me using my Macbook better. So happy :-) Thank you for providing this awesome product!
5,Desde que lo tengo no da problemas y es muy rapido para leer y escribir
5,Una unidad que es rápida y sencilla de usar
5,I use with my laptop. Wish it had a light to let you know when transferring data....otherwise does the trick
5,I used to carry around my 1TB storage drive but this is so much better and I don't have to worry about dropping it and causing damage
5,What more can I say! I use this in the car and it has worked fine.
4,Runs cool and is very fast. No problems.
5,product as advertised.  excellent presentation.  I will use it shortly
2,USB flash drive is no longer detected by my laptop.  I cannot even run a scan or format the drive.  It worked great when it was working.
5,What a great product. Works well for what I need.
5,functions as advertised.  Using it to back up photos on MacBook.  Great for that use.
1,Man complete waste of time trying to upgrade my BIOS with this. It can’t. It won’t read. It gets pretty hot as well. Be weary.
3,this product is a great idea but instead of having 256GBs of space it only had 200GB.Why is that??  You should advertise 200 GB and not 256GB
5,Small and easy to use
2,I needed this for an image that was 475Gb.  You would think that a 512GB stick would be enough.  Not with this product.  It's only 460GB after wiping it clean.  What a disappointment.
2,Generates significant RF interference when plugged into a USB port adjacent to for example a wireless transceiver for a mouse or keyboard. Gets extremely hot when used extensively. It can be difficult to remove from a USB port because there's so little to grab hold of once plugged in.
5,Needed to expand my 256gb Lenovo laptop. I use this as additional hard drive space.
5,Great product. Compact design is wonderful. Also functions perfectly with LUKs encryption on ubuntu
3,Not fast enough for Tesla sentry mode. Car complains that write speed is not fast enough.
5,great storage.  Small form factor.a must have.
5,+ Compact size. Can have a TeraByte in palm of hand.+ Writes & reads smoothly+ $57 Good price
5,Think that mustbe original. I bought how original.  This usb 3.1 read speed 130mb/s but those usb 3.0 and wriitrn on the box 150mn/s
5,It's hard to grasp how they manage to fit 64GB into such a tiny USB drive but it works like a charm.
5,This is so good it is hard to believe it!  Glad I bought it.
4,No problems
5,I use this in my car stereo in the USB port. Very responsive very low profile. Blends in nicely with black car stereo.
5,Like it. Perfect for my tv.
5,Great capacity for its small size
5,Perfect for my outside speaker plug and play! Got music for weeks.
3,It does what I was expecting. But it get very hot.
5,Works as expected arrived on time as indicated by seller. Love the capacity and size of this gem. Will definitely be a return buyer!
5,Perfect for plugging into the back of my TV!
5,Transferring information easily between computers.
1,Purchased 3 of these several months ago but just used one today.  It got so hot it actually burned my finger!  If you put it in a USB 3.0 slot it gets hot even if not using.  When you actually copy files to/from it gets incredibly hot!  I did some research (better late than never) and found other folks have had this same problem.  When sitting in a 2.0 slot it still gets hot but not quite as hot.  I would not use this particular model.  Unfortunately my window to return has closed.  Buyer Beware!
1,Fills to around 64GB and will stop allowing writes to the drive.  I question the profitability of the criminals faking these.  How much are you guys actually making turning around maybe $5 minus the cost of faking the cosmetics?  Are you maybe buying these in bulk then ripping out the guts and replacing the internals with cheaper and smaller storage?  But then what are you doing with the real stuff?  Listen I can appreciate the gains in a good old fashioned criminal enterprise but the profits from this elude me.
5,full 64G capacity
5,Low-profile design allows me to plug it into my car usb port without sticking out too much. Love it!!!!
4,Works great for music
5,got for dirt cheap can never have to many of these little guys
5,Technology gets better and cheaper!
5,just like I  ask
1,This tiny flash drive offers a lot of storage the low transfer rate does have the speed to back it up.From buying this flash drive I've learned that buying drives with a high storage volume requires a high transfer speed to back it up. When  you need a drive this large chances are you're moving either a lot of files or a few very big ones. On my computer i was only able to tranfer at a rate of 2.4  MB/s on a usb 3.0 port which is unacceptably slow for large file transfers you probably bought this drive for.Buy a better flash drive and dont be like me and actually read the transfer rate.
1,Got this as a replacement for a slim thumb drive that had less space and had lived in the side of my computer for 2 years. I transferred all the data added a bit more and went off to work. By Day 3 of work the flash drive wouldn't stay mounted for more than a few minutes. Waste of money. Waste of a work day. I switched back to my trusty smaller old one. I had mistakenly thought my last one was a Sandisk based on my amazon order history but I now realize that when I had bought that one I actually ended up switching back to my even older Samsung (the one I've reverted back to using)
3,Slower than snail snot for loading audio files it maxes out at about 5MB/sec!!!!!More than 6 hours to load 170GB of 7000 FLAC files.
1,The plastic casing on two of these USB thumb drives has now failed.  One was in my laptop when the drive began failing to be recognized.  Turns out that the actual chip in the casing cracked in half from the case being trapped between the laptop and the wall.  The casing was insufficient to protect the chip and split where the rounding protusion meets the USB port rectangular piece.  One is no longer safely insertable into a USB port because the thin plastic box to match the USB port has separated at the corners and can stick in the port without very careful insertion and removal.
4,As advertised
4,Perfect
5,Perfect
2,This little USB drive gets very hot and the write speed gets to 1 to 2 MB per second very slow. Looks like others have similar issues also. I would suggest a larger metallic USB drive which will be better at conducting heat.
1,Violated a personal rule and went for something cheap without really looking at the reviews or the specs on the drives. As mentioned elsewhere these are 95% plastic and not durable at all. Transfer rates were all over the place. I specifically got three of these for Clonezilla and imaging workstations. After just a few uses the drives were unusable. I suppose if your looking for something just to archive your files to they it would be fine but daily use will like lead to a lot of lost data. All three are on the way to a landfill. One is still brand new in the package so it's free to anyone that finds it.
5,Maybe adding a little rope to avoid lose it. Perfect portability. Excellent product
5,Great product I use it in my arlo camera station as it takes up no room and you can barely see it.
5,Pros:  Small very fast and also Linux-friendly. Using it for backup.Cons: The packaging is very difficult to open and get the unit out.
3,I was excited when I ordered this product. But then after receiving it  I could see that it looked cheap and was way too small.
5,This ScanDisk  flash drive is great . but keep an eye on them around others they disappear quick.
5,Use it for the sub in the car. Flush with port does not break off
5,Ultra high capacity in a small usb key. Good memory usb i used it how second disk in my portable pc a work great.
5,Excelente me gusta mucho por que es bien pequeña y se disimula bien para usarla en mi vehículo
3,It is not very fast. I have got another one from another manufacturer. Which is much faster. But I like the size of this. It is very small.
5,If you’re looking for a flash drive that doesn’t get in the way this is for you
4,good
5,We us to back up our MacBooks with Time Machine.  Works perfectly.
5,First one defective. Replacement fine.
5,Super small easy to carry light...perfect
5,Compact Flash Drive that is fast and good for use in portable devices where a longer flash drive may get broken off during handling.
5,It’s amazing how much storage this little device holds. Discretely tucked into a USB port it adds a wealth of storage.
5,Storage capacity and size are awesome. Tiny but distinct. Authentic and fast. Both in writing and reading
1,It suddenly stopped working last night. I just kept it plugged into my printer so I can scan documents to it as a back up. Plugged it into my computer and it isn't even recognized. A shame cause I liked the large storage size and small form factor
5,good quality but be aware their custom garbage bags are expensive and poor in qulity. Walmart plastic bags do a better job
5,Just what we needed
5,Works as designed but it does get hot.  I used it a to dual boot ubuntu alongside windows.
5,Buen producto llego en los tiempos establecidos.
5,Just awesome  no pendrive can be better than this. Worth every penny. One of the best.
5,As stated
1,I got this drive to use in the car to listen songs. I can't copy more than 10 mp3 files (average length 2-3 min 5-15 MB) at a time. It heats up very quickly and stops responding. I have to take it out wait for a few minutes and start again. Given the size it's very difficult to take out and insert so often. Every time it's inserted in the computer it says there is an error.It seems to be working in the car. The folders are arranged in alphabetical order and it plays. It gets hot very quickly.  Not sure how long it will play continuously in the car due to overheating. Will update once have used more often.
5,Small and unobtrusive not likely to damage my laptop. Working well for what I needed.
5,Very compact. And ergonomic form factor.Very fast file transfers 50Mb/'s in Windows 8 copy and paste.
5,This device was such a saving and great resolution for storage
1,Was working fine until it suddenly crashed and lost all my data. It failed at the one thing it's meant to do. It had one job and was terrible at it. It's a piece of junk.
5,Exactly the quality I would expect from Sandisk. Works great and fast transfer of data.
4,Great
5,Very good quality
5,Fast easy to use perfect size for my needs
5,Love how slim and sleek this is. Great for job storage printing for my printer.
1,The drive goes incredibly slow it overheats and it fails constantly. This time would it failed it came back as a 64 MB drive that is in raw format and it's right protected. I believe that it is a logic failure of the drive. I am receiving a replacement for the warranty but I would rather not have to drive at all if this is going to happen again where I would lose all my information.
5,I really like this little drive. It’s super tiny but it is fast as hell. I was honestly surprised.
5,Great
5,Great storage capacity for all my music for my car
2,It's taking me hours to copy 25 gigs onto this?  No way this is USB 3.0.  Seems more like the original USB 1.0The price is good and the thing is tiny which is crazy for its size but unless you want to wait all day to copy things onto this . . .
5,Adding a 256 GB solid state memory to my desktop with good encryption and portability if necessary.
5,These low profile flash drives are the way to go. I leave mine in all the time since it doesn't protrude out.
5,64 GB capacity captures all things necessary for the century mode on the Tesla model three
5,Lots of storage at a great price
2,This is the first USB thumb drive that uses plastic rather than metal for the material around the USB port. I don't think it would survive very long in my laptop bag.
5,This has been perfect for my home security system. It has recorded a multiple months of nonstop recording without hitting it's capacity yet.
5,Very good buy.  It's an easy way for our neighbor to share his movies with us.
5,Only concern is to be aware where you leave it.  Very stealthy
1,it stores things correctly and is larger in capacity but the exterior shell is made of super thin plastics that can and will break with lots of usage or mobility which is half the reason you buy a drive this compact so essentially they are defeating the very purpose you buy this drive making it plastic. I would not recommend or even buy it again i think I'll just go buy a metal one for the same exact price.
1,I bought it last year(April 2019) as an easy way to transfer data but only really used it once every 2 -3 months. I noticed that it would get really hot when plugged in but I thought that was normal for how small it is. The last time I used it was December 2019 and it worked fine now when I try to use it March 2019 it gives me a Write Protected and wont even let me Reformat the drive. This seems to be a common problem with this drive and is only fixed with a replacement. I do not recommend this product if it cannot reliably last 1 year with minimal use.
5,Received quickly.  It works as it should. I would recommend.
5,I used this product to store my music mixes and listen to them in my car and elsewhere.
5,Nice n small it doesn't look that big on the side of the laptop.
5,I ordered to consolidate all my jump drives.  It worked as expected.
5,Very compact and designed to small size. Very handy. Be careful while carrying.
5,It fits in next to other drives that are a little wide.  Has worked flawlessly
5,If you want to store data this is the right one. A++++++++
5,Great product easy to use lots of storage for such a small size
5,Really small thumb drive.  Bought it for a windows boot disk.  Works great.
5,Very good product
2,They used plastic where they should have used metal. The reason why it's all black is because it all plastic. The device still works but it is cracked in several spots during normal use. It's not durable which I assume is why it is cheaper. Will make sure to purchase metal drives in the future.
1,I bought this to use with my small Macbook Air for storing portable files. The drive was tiny and fit well with my MBA. But after a year of light use it suddenly just failed. It would not mount when inserted into my computers Macs or otherwise. I reformatted on two Macs and two PCs and initially it would work again but after just a couple of days it would stop working. This is unacceptable for a storage device. I have a Western Digital Firewire hard drive from 20 years ago that still works! Sandisk quality has really declined over the years. This is the 2nd Sandisk product I have that has failed under normal operating conditions.
5,Ton of space works great.
5,I bought this store a bunch of files on and wanted a VERY small footprint. This was it. Great product
5,It's tiny and works well
5,No problems at all!
5,Getting an average transfer rate of 114. Not bad for this little drive
3,Compared to the Samsung alternative product this product offers inferior performanceMy write speed was about 12Mbps. I got about 19Mbps with a similar priced Samsung fit flash drive.
5,This flash drive holds many of my digital scrapbooking files.
5,Shipped quick great product. I use these every day at work. I would buy from this seller again.
1,Lasted 2 werks then went into "Read Only Mode" because it detected an error on the drive. I looked it up this is intentional to prevent data loss. "Send in for warranty exchange". But I can't because the data is sensitive. So I just lost $80.I've used Sandisk products for years. But in the past 3 years I've had 2 (lightly used)16gbs usbsj ust become unreadable and My Sons SSD become undetectable...but this last one is the last straw for me.From now on. Samsung or Corsair or anything except Sandisk.
1,I installed this in my MacBook Air straight after buying it - never removed it from the USB port never knocked it bumped it or dropped my computer. 5 months later it stopped working entirely without warning and now it won't mount on any Mac or PC so all data on it is gone. Thankfully it was backed up but what a massive disappointment for something that was gently used for less than a year. Disposable junk - don't waste your money.
5,I can carry all of my appraisal files with me instead of having to go to the office.
5,super small and does not get in the way on my Surface Book
5,Works as expected. And really portable
5,Works as described. What more could I want? Great product!
1,April 25 Update to my review at bottom: Drive failed. Began corrupting individual files then lost all files completely. (Has 5y warranty but what good is it if SanDisk asks to ship it back for more than the drive cost?) It got really hot during use.A nice knurl on the device so it is much easier to remove from your computer then those tiny drives from Sandisk before. My main concern is this gets to warm/hot when in use. Will it really last?
2,Was going great then all of a sudden its dead. My data gone!Computer sees it but says capacity 0 and free space ZERO.Hope my backup software had everything but I do not have the room to restore to another drive.Very frustrating seems to be as bad as mechanical HD's only lasting a few months.Guess I will try PNY...
5,Strongly recommended
5,It held all of windows 10 and has more storage space
2,I am giving it 1 star in both categories only because you have to run the following CMD commands in order to unlock the disk drive:diskpartlistdisk *ID the Disk # of your USB*cleancreate partition primary**then reformat your drive.
5,Easy to loose
5,I love it!
1,Does fine on my older laptop connected to a USB 2.0 port but when I try to use it on a Win 10 w/only USB 3.0 it drops after a minute or two.I tried updating the USB 3.0 drivers on the newer laptop and that didn't fix it. The problem isn't the USB port because an older Kingston 64GB drive stays connected no problemo. $40 wasted. I wouldn't recommend this at all.In trying to troubleshoot this I noticed several threads at Microsoft Support e.g. "SanDisk USB drive not working in Windows 10 (which was working fine last week)." Their standard solution uninstall USB 3.0 driver and restart doesn't work. The only thing that does work is returning the faulty SanDisk flash drive to the place of purchase.
5,This low profile flash drive fits in the 2019 Es350/ES300H USB port with the lid closed.
5,Size I needed for files.
1,1) Flimsy bendable plastic  end unlike the smaller capacity ones2) Corrupted my computer often wouldn't detect it. Now it doesn't detect it all3) I had bought another one of these a few years ago and I vaguely recall that that similarly failed the same way.Thankfully I knew better than to put irreplaceable content on Sandisk high-capacity flash memory (after previous bad experience with bigger SD memory cards) so all I lost was offloaded recycle bin files and some videos I'd copied from my computer that I was planning to watch while travelling.That said I've bought another Sandisk USBC flash drive so maybe I'm naive.
5,Bought this for the invidia shield as external storage. Works well if recommend
1,I bought the 256GB for extra space on my laptop. Unfortunately this little thing seems to bake itself to death if left plugged in 24/7. This was my second 256 that died after less than a year.My suggestion if you plan on leaving one of these ultra fits plugged in 24/7 is to get the 128GB (or smaller) version. Myself and a coworker have had good luck with them so far. He has had this version of the 128GB for well over a year and although it runs a little warm it’s been stable the entire time. I’ve had the previous version of the 128GB plugged into my lab server booting VMware off it and it’s been going strong after for about two years I think.
2,Was using as a dash cam for my Tesla. Less than a year of use and it’s completely dead now. Definitely expected more from it and apparently this kind of use isn’t covered by the warranty. Bummer. Will try another brand/device this time around.
5,a great product for the money. easy to loose so I just leave it plugged in.
3,Lasted about 6 months and then died.
2,the problem with these drives is the plastic falls apart and then you have great fun getting one out of PC. stay away and get a regular sized bigger and better made stick.
5,Easy to use
4,It’s good but very light
5,It's a tiny USB drive for a great price
5,Only drawback is easy to lose on a messy desk.
5,Small compact out of sight when in device fast processing/transfer speed.
5,This is great for my laptop pc  for storage. Fast and works great. Good price too. Recommended.
5,Great extra storage.  My old laptop needed this.
5,This item was shipped quickly and it is amazing how small and fast it is.
5,I’m afraid I’ll lose it and the plastic is a bit fragile so be careful
1,After one month it stop working in my Tesla
5,Works as expected
5,Satisfied Customer. Item received promptly and exactly as described.
5,Works very well as internal storage for an Nvidia-Shield.
5,Great product bought to store CD collection for use in car without CD player
5,Fast write speeds stores a ton of stuff and a tiny package. I'm pretty pleased with the purchase.
1,Complete trash.I had this drive for about a month. All of the sudden the transfer speed dropped down to less than 500 KB/s - it didn’t matter what computer I tried it on.I contacted Sandisk customer support and they were useless wanted me to run a bunch of tests on it - I’m just glad I was able to transfer the 20 gigs I had on it before it dies completely only took 2 days to transfer those files.Do not buy!
5,Great flash drive nice and compact. May have to buy another!
5,Great for additional storage in computer.
5,It’s good will buy more
5,Great amount of memory for a very small footprint. I like that it sits very flush to my laptop.
5,Easy transaction.  Easy set up. Small and discreet. Amazing video quality. Would purchase again
5,I love the size and small footprint!  It's also very easy to remove from ports thanks to the curved design.
5,Great speed great price and great size!
5,I like its low profile and extensive storage capacity.
5,Perfect for my car!
4,OK
5,Good quality as promised
5,Ty works great
2,Great speed and size. Mine fell apart. The chip came out and the back broke. Not a very solid design.
5,I bought these to use as Operative system start up on my laptop and worked exactly as intended
5,Very good usb I recommend
5,Works great  adds storage quickly.
5,VERY SMALL EASILY MISPLACED SO STORE IN A BAGGY OR FIXED LOCATION IF NOT BEING USED.
5,So far so good. I've been using it now for one week and its holding up.
1,Do not buy this product. It lasted 2 weeks before the plastic broke off in my laptop. It is currently still stuck in there.
2,Seemed to be working for about a week.  Inserted into computer USB slot today and Windows would not recognize it -said it needed to be formatted.  It had over 80GB of data on it.  Nice.  It's a very good thing I know how to make BACKUPS of my data and actually do it.  I do not recommend this if you're not willing to make regular backups of it.
5,excellent product. highly recommended
3,Reliablitiy of one of the flash drives was terrible.
3,The black portion of this USB drive is flexible plastic and not metal. If you are ok with this then buy away but I prefer metal.
5,I like the potability I used it for storage in my Tesla.
3,Good drive but could be a little faster for a 3.1 drive. I got a Samsung with the same specs but a lot faster.
5,So low profile sometimes I forget that I had it attached
2,The good: warranty fast enoughThe awful: build quality these paper thin plastic USB shrouds are simply not not built to take even occasional reinsertion never mind being carried around.Sorry Sandisk for the sake of 1/10 of a cent you went too cheap here. I will have to look to another brand.
5,Bueno
3,Bought 2. One died after 11 months.
5,It's tiny. It works. No excessive overheating. It is really 256 GB. If there was a 512 GB version I'd have gotten that one.
5,Very good item
5,This USB works great Rizza Ford my X32 mixer to record
5,Nice product
5,Popped it into my smart TV to watch movies and shows. Works perfectly as expected.
5,So much storage in such a small size... I keep this plugged in to my MBP2017 as additional storage...
5,Great little flash drive.
5,I am using it as an extra memory for my laptop's SSD memory. Works fine for 6 months already.
5,have 2 one in tesla one for editing works great
5,Worked great. Tight fit.
5,I use this as a boot drive for my macbook air that only has a 128 GB HD.
5,I've been looking for this since I bought it. it's SOOOO TINY
5,Works great
5,I keep this thumb drive on my keychain and I can't tell it's there.
5,Great product  works
5,Worked as adverstised.  Using it to expand my internal storage of my Nvidia Shield.
5,What else can i say dollar to functionality it's a great flash drive.
5,Muy buen producto
1,I started to have problems within 3 month of purchase sometimes it would not show on desktop sometimes it would show but disappear on its own so it was unreliable to use. Returning it for replacement through Sandisk was big headache it too long to get the replacement so if you need to use it all the time it is bothersome they will not send you new one unless you send the defective one back first so if you need to copy all the files to new one you have to go through extra steps. The part that plugs into the USB port is cheap plastic and that may be why it breaks so fast.
5,Very good
5,The product is as described. It works great. Please be aware this is very small and can be lost easily.
5,Very portable flash drive with plenty of storage space for the price.
5,Perfect for my needs.
1,2 of 3 died in 1 year.Bought 3 of this drive 256 Gb used for Tesla Dash Cam.2 of died after 1 year. Window said drive is damaged and could not recognize. Mac did not recognize drives because they died.Only 1 left.It's very hot when I copied files or when my Tesla is running.
5,Works great. I keep it plugged in all the time.
1,Used it for the on board dash cam on a Tesla. Started having issues 9 months in. Now won’t work and won’t even be recognized on a desktop. Not cheap and did not last.
5,Really nice and small works no issues. Only problem is it's too small I already lost mine!
1,I purchased mine on December 30 2019. I used it very sparingly since then and only wrote a few large files to it about 1-3 GB in size. I'd use it briefly once every few months.However as of today the disk totally failed on me and I lost all data on it. I haven't even owned it for 6 months. This is the first flash drive that ever failed on me. What's most alarming is it happened in such a short time period with hardly any use. It got hot easily and was fairly spotty even before the fail.
5,I have absolutely no complaints it is exactly what I hoped for!
1,I'm sure it's a great product as soon as i get it i will post a review
5,I love how small this flash drive is.  Completely unobtrusive in my application.
5,This is small and unobtrusive.  It holds my music for my car.  No problems.
4,I love it
5,Works as advertised. Very low profile for the storage size.
1,bought 2 in nov 2020.... i have used 1 with no issues. after filling that one up i plugged in the 2nd one and its only 32gb... too late to return
5,Like most usb thumb drives works well. 3.1 has fast read and write speeds.
5,Great!
5,Excellent flash drive.... Small and tested speed at 137MB/sec (Bytes not bits)  If you want bits multiply by 8.
5,You can't go wrong with a Sandisk product.  Great quality and exactly what you pay for.
2,It's hard to pull from device you plug into needs a bit longer handle like a pulling cord or something 🤷🏻‍♂️
2,The drive overheats during large and long file transfers. I've lost data that I wish I didn't. I would not buy this drive again.
5,Exactly as described and on time. Good seller. Thank you.
5,Great Value
5,Little an powerful. Almost so little they disappear in the slot!
4,Excelent
5,I needed it for an Android tv and it works wonders
5,Great item with a great price.
5,Excellent product for a great price. Title says it all.
5,Small size large capacity I use this for my Nebula Capsule I load films etc on to it
5,Just what the old lap top needed. As advertised.
5,Fast very compact. Only downside is I don't know where I left it.
5,Small enough to hook onto my key chain. Love it.
5,Nuff said
5,Great option for an always connected backup drive to a laptop.
5,Small and portable with lots of space to store my files. Recommended!
5,that so more storage comes in such a small package
5,Perfect in Quality Value for Money Delivery
5,Used pc bios and windows updates no issues.
1,I got everything downloaded and backed up no problem. The next time I tried to access this drive I couldn’t find my files and it continued to tell me my password was wrong. Of course theirs no way the recover the password and the instructions I googled referenced a button I don’t even show. Don’t waste your time on this one. It looks better than it works.
5,It's just so east.
5,Great price great storage capacity and super low profile.
5,Backed up my laptop on 10 of the 64 gigs. It is perfect as an emergency restore drive.
5,It's ok
5,Very FAST
2,I bought this to use in my Tesla as Tesla recommends it. It worked great for about a month then just stopped. I also checked it on my laptop and it won't show up there either.
5,Great thumb drive size to use on your HD TV to watch movies (or anywhere else)
5,Very slim profile with a convenient finger groove to make removing this usb a breeze. Highly recommend for the price!
5,Fast transfer speeds great capacity love the low profile
5,ALMOST TOO SMALL I KEEP MISPLACING IT I THINK I'LL  GO WITH A THUMB DRIVE NEXT TIME.
5,Great product but it is so small be careful not to loose it
5,You get plenty of fast storage with this - no brainer.
2,I used it like a hard drive and never removed it from my laptop. It just died after a year returned an error and that was the end of it. I used it to hold large data files simultaneously reading/writing multiple files. I'm trying a different brand. I have other flash drives that still work after 10 years...
1,Used this device as a unRAID boot drive which write very little to it. Mostly reads on boots and sa to say it made it barely a year and half. Now I can't get my boot data off it.
5,So small yet so fast.  I love it's compact yet reliable size.  USB 3.1! I love technology.
5,Fast and huge storage.  I used them in an array setup for 0.5TB array in two USBs.
5,So small yet houses so much data.  Love it!
5,Small size 256 Gb fast speed storage. Perfect for my needs.
5,Worth buying!
5,Small & inconspicuous. Stays in my car & I don't worry about it.
2,I've owned this drive for 11 months and used it for my music library in my car.  Recently I've been experiencing playback problems from the drive.  Tonight I reformatted the drive and copied the 100GB of music back to the drive.  I'm getting a copy speed of about 15 MB/s from the internal SSD to this drive.  Very disappointed.
1,I was writing from an sdd in my computer to this drive via a usb 3.0 port it would only get up to about 20 mb/s a secound then I tried to fill the drive passed 50gb which it should be able to do being a 128 but my computer keeps telling me its full so i know its a bs drive. Amazon please do something about this. Something is clearly wrong with this batch of these drives or something...
1,Seems fine but very hot when left on Chromebook and frequently given notice that it has been incorrectly removed from device even if I haven't touched it.
5,As expected
1,The temperature of your device dries out the plastic part of the product and cracks it.
2,This is the first time I have ever been disappointed by a Sandisk product. While storage and speed of the drive are as advertised the build quality is terrible. The USB part of the plug itself is made out of plastic. Cracked after a week of use. Terrible product. I've never seen a USB plug made of plastic and that is definitely for a reason they just won't hold up.
3,Not recognize always by the computer. Get heated.
5,Really really nice
5,Item exactly as described!  No problems
5,The drive works fine but it gets quite hot even when I'm not working or transferring files.
5,The Sandisk 128gb usb drive is compact and works great for my music collection. Great buy.
2,It broke after 18 months. I am still using the earlier version of it. The earlier version has smaller capacity but much more durable. It also has a plastic cap which this one does not have. The problem with this version is the plastic exterior which gets hot and cracks.
5,It is small mounted on my notebook and is SanDisk great quality.
5,Good quality
5,Works exactly as expected. love the small size as I leave it always plugged into my small laptop.
5,Excellent performance in a small form-factor.
5,Holy crap how do they sell these this cheap?
5,Got it for the iPad
5,Good
5,Great option for your model 3 Tesla on board camera storage.
5,Good product. Only complaint is that it gets really warm during extended use.
5,Great price and product. These are my go to usb drives now.
5,This is great as a live backup in my computer all the time. Stays out of the way easy!
3,It's very flimsy.Need to be careful every time feels like usb stick will break/crack.Will not buy again.
5,Perfect for a low profile unit to capture video in a Tesla model3.
5,Good
5,Very compact and quick.
5,Love it.Gonna buy a couple of more FAST!
5,Lots of fast storage and reasonable price
1,Probably would actually melt if left unattended.
5,Easy to carry anywhere and lots of storage
1,After the test an extremely negative attitude arose both towards the product itself and towards the SanDisk brand in general. The speed is significantly lower than stated. I will never buy products from this manufacturer
5,Fast works great small.  Using it on a TCL Roku TV for live TV buffering.  Love it.
3,Theyshould provide a plastic sleeve with this memory stick.  I need it on another SanDisk 128K drive.
5,Great USB. Works great in Tesla Model 3 for dash cam.
5,A really good small flash drive especially for the price.
5,Lots of room and really fast read/write.  Does what it's supposed too really quickly.
3,The unit is fine but it gets far too hot for comfort. I have literally burnt my finger on the thing
5,Great Product.
2,My drive gets to hot to touch and it is not seen all the time. It is not the laptop/pc I am using because it happens in more then one. It doesn't take it long to get hot. I am currently copying everything off it  to another drive to be safe. I buy SanDisk all the time and this one just is failing to  much.
1,It's only 460 GBytes.... 52 GB MIA.
5,good
1,I bought 2 of these to use on laptops which were of course filled with important data. Then when they were about half full I went to back them up to another drive and they both died while being copied. MAJOR PROBLEM! Since they were the original record of my data I lost all that work while doing "the right thing"... copying them for a backup. They always ran hot to the touch so apparently they couldn't take the heat while copying 100GB. It's not the small size I use micro SD cards a lot and I back them up too with no failures. So these are just crap!
5,Used these to back up important files from my notebook.
5,Wanted to expand the storage in my Chromebook and it's compact size works nicely.
5,Super-compact huge storage space perfect for my Tesla model 3!
5,It is everything that was advertised; compact 128gb encryption good speed.  No issues
5,As expected
5,Works great for Tesla Sentry Mode and Dash-cam features.
5,Tiny fast USB 3.1 very reasonable priced; you will forget that it's there.
5,Excellent tool for your car. No more bad radio stations .
5,Easy to use
2,I installed the 512 GB Sandisk flash drive in the Raspberry Pi 4b's USB 3.0 port and hdparm reported only 64 MB/s write speed instead of the advertised 130 MB/s.
5,Sexy
2,This flash drive stopped being able to be read/registered within two years.
5,Its a flash drive. What else do you need to know?
5,Works like a charm. No issue.  As good as any flash drive at low cost.
5,I have a Nikon J5.  Very slow buffer.  This card helps with the write speed.
5,Good for the price.
1,I have bought a dozen Sandisk USB Flash Drives in preceeding years with very good luck.  I bought this drive (256GB USB 3.1 ) in the hopes of getting another good experience.  In transferring files the first day  the performance was in the 8 to 30 mb/s range in a less than 1 year old Dell XPS 15 with a 3.1 port with nothing else running on the machine.  Sandisk missed the boat on this drive.  IT is big and very slow. Now I have to go find another source. Do not buy this drive. The performance is more in the range of USB 2.0.  Sad....
5,Works Great
5,It does what it's supposed to. Can't really ask for much more
5,Great for Tesla model3 dash cam storage
1,I bought this USB 3.1 Flash drive to have the highest transfer rate posable. It was advertised at up to 130 MB/s. I have two different devices with USB 3.1 and have other SanDisk products that transfer at over 100MB/s on these devices. This Flash drive is the slowest of any I own at 32 MB/s. It looks to me that it is running at USB2 speeds since it has the same transfer rate on USB2 as USB3.
5,It's small. It weighs nothing. Speeds are roughly as advertised. Gets very hot during transfers but so what.
5,I purchased 64 gb pen drive it found to be nice capacity drives with excellent speed. Gets hot when operated
5,Fantastic product. Very reliable. Highly recommended.
5,Works perfectly in my data usb in my 2016 Ram 1500. Over 4500 songs on it !
5,Using for extra storage on my xbox. (256gb minimum for xbox external drives btw)
5,Kinda hard to push into my port
5,Nice
5,Great price
5,04/15/2018 Good and little flash drive.  Have it for back up.  Will re-buy if needed.  wjc
5,Exactly what I was looking for haven't figured out how to make it a bootable device
5,Love the nano size works as expected
5,Small and unnoticeable.... just what I was looking for to put in my car.
5,Excellent and elegant
5,Outstanding value for storage capacity size and speed
5,Great little USB. I use it in my car for music.
5,Worked perfectly in my Pioneer Sampler and would highly recommend.
4,Perfect
2,The speed is too slow plus it gets very hot when transferring data into it.
5,I USE THIS WITH MY LENOVO FLEX 11 AND IT WORKS GREAT.
5,Very small. Perfect for a raspberry pi project.
5,Works great!  Thousand times better than those cheaper knockoffs!  Very happy!
2,Love the extreme low profile of this but I am very disappointed by the slow speeds. On Windows 10 I was getting 7MB/s maximum on video files to or from the device. Not sure how they can claim 130mb/s.Not sure if I'll keep it I will probably lose it and it might not be worth trying to keep track of if it doesn't perform like it's 2018.
5,Used for storing bitcoin blockchain data. I run a full node and this drive has worked seamlessly thus far.
5,Love the size
1,This thing overheated and ejected itself after I used it for 5 minutes. Using BlackMagic I found that its best write speed was 52 mbs. and read speed was 24 mbs. It is composed of plastic and it seems like some bits of it have melted off and oozed into the USB inner wall after FIVE MINUTES OF USE. Please don't buy this hunk of crap even if your budget won't let you just try and save up for a passport USB which is much better.
3,It's nice that it's so small but that's double edged sword. It gets real hot real quick and the speeds suffer as a result.
5,Does the thing.
5,Good
2,It’s nice and compact. It reads fast enough so going through tons of folders to find  your files is fast but the extreme con of this is the write speed. It is extremely slow to move files folders or downloads onto this usb in the first place. If you are copying a large file (about 1GB or more) to this usb it might take 25 minutes to do so.
5,I love this USB drive. I can leave it in my PC without having to remove for storage.
5,Good
5,Love it !!
5,Works great for me so farDoesn't get to hot
5,Awesome product
5,It works
5,I love it
1,I bought the drive here on Amazon. It worked the first day. The second day as I was copying two files from my Windows 10 laptop to the drive the copy stopped with a "drive is write protected" error. I tried all kinds of software solutions: including running "diskpart" in a command window regedit format etc. I even tried it on Mac. All attempts failed because the drive is actually unwritable at the hardware level. I then thumbed through dozens of posts on Sandisk's forum - lots of problems in this area many frustrated customers no solution. Perhaps there's a pattern here... I'm returning mine and never again buying a Sandisk USB drive.
5,Also works at good speed. Seems to be good quality although it plastic shell.
1,It worked great for a couple of months. PC stopped recognizing it from time to time and asked to reformat. It lasted less than a year. I won’t recommend it.
2,This flash drive is a disappointment. It is no longer made of metal compared the USB 3.0 version and the read/write speeds are not significantly better. I'd stick with the older USB 3.0 version as the only thing t his really has going for it is they have figured out the heat issues and this USB drive barely gets warm compared to the  heat output of the older usb 3.0 model.
3,It broke when I pulley it out of my MacBook Pro.  Still worked.
5,thank you
5,Great product...very fast.
1,So bought this and left it in the package until 6 days after the return period expired. Opened it today and it is not recognized on any computer I tested it on (3 different ones). Rebooted cold booted etc. Just not recognized. When I pull it out as others have said it is super hot. Only wished I had opened the package and tested sooner. I have a similar one that I have used for years with no issues just needed a larger size. Just out the money now I guess. Will be shopping a different brand moving forward. I would steer clear of this device as the failure rate seems abnormally high.
5,Small and fast looks sturdy enough although the case is made entirely from plastic.
5,This usb is light and fast
5,No issues.
5,Bought it to use with my modded PS1 Classic. Works great
5,es super pequeño y muy veloz
1,I purchased this for use in my Tesla to take advantage of the dashcam feature. It worked great for about 3 months then suddenly was no longer detected. I connected the device to my laptop and it was not discovered.After chatting with SanDisk support I was directed to file an RMA request for a replacement under warranty. I've purchased many flash drives in the past have even gotten several free drives over the years from work events this is the first drive I've ever had a problem with. Most last for years with no issues very strange to have as many failures as are reported on this.
2,Downgraded from 5 to 2 starsIt was great while it worked but died after only 7 months
1,Could not format via Tesla even after formatting to various std conventions.
5,I really like SanDisk products!
5,no complaints.  tiny enough to keep it plugged always.
5,works as intended on a Nvidia shield TV for external space
5,Fit perfectly with a low profile and large storage capacity exactly what I was looking for.
5,Works fine
5,A good value and love it's compact size.
5,This USB flash drive works as it should and man it is fast.
5,I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
5,Excellent!!!
5,Tiny
5,Doesn't get as hot as the metal model almost too small afraid I'll lose it!
5,Good product shipped to me  very fast.
5,Great product
3,This flash drive doesn't read from all my PC only recognized on the Mac even after I re-format the device.  What a disappointment!
2,I could not give a full four stars because the drive is so darned slow when it is in use.  It is nowhere near USB 3.1 speeds when moving large files so it's not good for "readily available" storage of multimedia.  Otherwise it is durable and easy to use.
2,I had the old 128GB metal version of this USB drive and it is much better. The new model is plastic and very flimsy it will not take long for the upper non-supported plastic of the housing to break just from the inserting and removal of the drive from the USB port. They went way to cheap on the housing. Storage size is great and speed seems fine although not formally tested.
5,Perfect for your vehicle's USB music storage drive. This thing barely sticks out and is unnoticeable.
1,Worked great for a couple of weeks and then just died. I ordered a replacement to see if it will last longer. If it dies as well I'll be going with another brand. Not very impressed with the first unit but it had great reviews so I'm willing to give it another go.Update- got the replacement in the mail and it lasted me 7 days and then I started getting errors in my car about the flash drive. Will be returning and going with another brand. I’m glad amazon is good at returns because this product does not last.
1,Junk.  After 6 months I had to do scan repair on it one day which isn't unusal to have to have to once in awhile on flash drives if you take it out during files saving or those kinds of things.  The next day computer wouldnt read it anymore.  I tried all of the usual troubleshooting to then find out from a data recover center that it would cost 800-5000 to try to recover from this monolithic flash type drive.  Stick with the usual flash drives more durable.  And backup backup backup  save 3 copies of your data everywhere!!  And now to cloud :)
1,Don't buy. I ignored the warnings of others to my detriment.  They were right.  It seemed to good to be true.  This is a piece of c.....  Worked great at first but it gets *really hot.  When it died I spent an afternoon trying to recover it.  After multiple computers not even being able to recognize it I finally found one that would assign it a drive letter for about 3 seconds then fail. I tried DOS Windows Disk Management tools and online help and software.
5,Good price and quality
5,Good
5,This is a very small but capacious flash drive.
5,im using this little guy as a permanent addition to my laptop. Fast and unobtrusive.
5,Nice low profile perfect for my Mac.
3,It gets hot quickly and even read operations execute as slowly as a USB 2 drive.
5,Excelente producto.
5,Muy busca
1,Device broke within 3 months the portion of the device that is held by the USB port is made of flimsy plastic. Look elsewhere.
5,Nice size and capacity
5,Works great. Just remember in the eyes of windows it's not a true 128GB more like 119/120ish
5,Works great
1,Bought 5. All 5 failed and went into READONLY state. If you use it enough it will get so hot that the circuitry goes into lockdown. What a POS.... should really be a class action lawsuit selling these faulty devices
5,Good
1,Worked great for its purpose...until it didn't.  This was really only used for data reads very few writes after my data was copied over.  It's been sitting on my desk for about 4 months now unused but I plugged it in today and it's not even recognized any longer.  Not by Windows not by OSX just nothing.  It was inexpensive but I still expect to be able to plug it in and see my data.
5,Works great
5,Great Product
1,For those of you who aren't teacher edTPA is essentially a 50-70 page report you must submit in the state of New York and pass prior to being a licensed teacher. I had mine finished and saved on this drive and one day i went to plug it in and it would not open. I took the drive to the computer store and the gentleman explained to me that this drive is only meant to transfer information not store. Meaning it is only meant to be plugged in and un-plugged around 50 times. So DONT SAVE ANYTHING IMPORTANT ON THIS USB DRIVE
3,1) Very Fragile2) Very slow on usb 3.1 port or 3.03) Handy
1,Purchased this for use on a new Unraid NAS Server. Thank god it failed right away during the initial write because I was going to rely on it so heavily for my server to start! Came out of the USB port hot as hell. Garbage.Details: when using the Unraid USB creator it would just stall on the extracting phase and then just overheat. I guess it was just stuck in an endless writing loop. Afterward I tried the same usb creator on an old flash drive and it worked right away.
3,Didnt work with my Dell. Needed the stotage needed the security but only got half the storage.
1,The product feels very flimsy. It's the connector or plug-in is made of plastic. AND it keeps giving me an error on the blinks Sync Module 2.  It really should be made of metal... cost cutting gone too far. I do not recommend
2,Me lo ofrecieron con descuento al comprar un Sandisk extreme ssd 1 tb.Figuraba como usb 3.1 y lo compré pensando que era 3.1 Gen 2 al igual que el ssd.Resultó ser 3.1 Gen 1 mucho mas lento!!En ninguna parte vi que aclarara que era version vieja. NO ME GUSTÓ ESO ! El pendrive igual esta bueno
3,received evertything work but only 57GB available strorage off too much from the so called 64GB
5,Very good product no doubt about that
5,Used for Sentry mode in Tesla Model 3.
5,Cheap and good
1,When I got it i replaced old Samsung drive that I had for 3 years.I thought I get better drive so I got this one. Oh Boy I was wrong.Now I get error message that drive is protected. I can only get data from it but cannot write to it.I only use this drive to backup my work. So I do not delete write and delete again.I only copy files one time and leave it there forever.AVOID LIKE A PLAGUE!!!
1,Bought the SanDisk 16GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive plugged it into my Windows 10 machine and I get this crap right off the bat. Windows does not even recognize the drive. Formatting does not work. So I tried it on a Windows 7 machine with the same results. Little wonder why these are so inexpensive. SanDisk is a pretty reputable USB flash drive manufacturer too but this one is an example of the expression you get what you paid for. I'll look elsewhere. PNY is a good option. SanDisk seems to be eating the white soft underbelly of cheap Chinese crap. A shame too.
1,My only issue with this SanDisk 64GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive is the casing. I've removed this flash drive from the USB port on my laptop only a few times. As you can see in the photo the plastic case has broken off leaving the pieces in my ROKU USB port. The drive is working but the connection is glitchy.  All broken pieces of plastic have been carefully removed from within the ROKU USB port.
5,Heat up a little when doing Large file transfer everything going well.
5,Works great for storing ROMs and saves for my RPi3 Retropie setup.
5,slim and portable
5,Need this for work to load secure desktop and it's just amazing. Love this. Highly recommend
3,The larger the transfer the slower it gets as it progresses....its a POS
5,Worth every penny nice sleek and almost non noticeable.
5,Very fast but easy to get broken
5,All Good
1,Others have already corroborated the pitfalls of this drive quite well but I feel compelled to warn others. Read speeds are fantastic and pretty standard for a flash-based (non-SSD) USB 3.1 drive. The chokepoint is the cheap and nasty flash memory and controller. Go for a Sandisk MicroSD & their MobileMate USB3.0 reader. You'll get parity in both read and write speeds.I bought two of these and 4 of the 32GB because they were on sale and their performance is the same. I guess I'll use them as windows boot thumbdrives as they do not suit any sort of daily use that requires writes.
5,I hardly remember it was external storage..
5,It works great and works fast. Yes it is plastic but it works!
5,Great
5,Great value
5,Bought 2 of these for my Nvidia shield and it works well. Definitely a go
5,Good. I leave it in my laptop for storage and auto file saving.
5,Great price. Great product. What else is there.
3,good
5,good
5,So much in so little.
5,Exelente producto
5,Very small
5,Good
5,Muy buena y rápida a la hora de transferir datos
5,Put it in my truck  for my music
3,write speeds are pretty slow but it seems to get the job done.
3,It gets really “hot”. I’m afraid sometimes to use on my laptop
1,I should have read the other reviews first.  I have the older version of this flash drive that I use to transfer my files between multiple computers every day.  So after a few years I thought I should get a larger faster newer version.  I loaded 7gb of my files onto this (128gb) drive before it locked itself in readonly mode.  Meaning it is damaged.  Now I am out the money.  I can't return the drive because it has confidential files on it.  I can't erase them because it is readonly.  DON't BUT THIS DRIVE!  get the old metal ones - they are nice and reliable.
5,Good product!
5,meets my expectation
5,Good
1,This disk is completely unusable. It is not recognized by Windows 10 or by Linux on multiple computers. When I attempt to format it I get a "write protected" error. It has never been successfully written to. I have no idea how it could have become write protected. I think it is defective. I wish I could give it zero stars. I didn't use it right away and now the return window has closed. I've used dozens of USB drive over the years and have never had any issues. Something is wrong with this one. Don't buy it.
1,After 6 months or so on my Macbook Air it "all of a sudden" stopped being recognized on my Mac. Took it out put it back in and never worked again. So much potential lost data (thankfully backed up elsewhere) and after trying recovery software realized the USB was completely dead wiped and unusable. Purchased another one yesterday via Prime Now and our Macs at home won't even format the thing giving constant errors. We purchased a Transcend Jetdrive instead which works great. I do not recommend this SanDisk Ultra Fit it simply is too risky for Mac users (and potentially everyone).
5,Facil
5,Muy bueno
5,Really small. Barely sticks out of the laptop.
2,Although the form and factor and well designed this cable does not support high speed data nor charging factors - i.e. when plugged into a standard wall charger the device consistently states it is charging at slow speed (not even normal speed and certainly not fast charging).  This product is a good pick if you don't mind a trickle charge approach.
5,Useful  !!!
5,a pleasure to use.
5,This tiny optional has all my files in it.
5,Storing music for usb input in vehicles
5,Portability
5,works as advertised good price from a trusted brand.
1,Was compact and easy to install as a USB drive for my Tesla's dashcam but after a few months the flash drive simply died. I was able to access all the saved videos but the Tesla was no longer able to record to it. I tried formatting the drive but to no success. The drive was simply not able to be written to any more. Bricked.
5,Muy bueno gracias
5,Great for storing and playing music in the car.
5,Great speed compact design awesome capacity. Highly recommend!
2,Seemed fast enough. Used as Ubuntu boot drive on Chromebook Linux system. However it failed after several months. Don't know if because of excessive writes or other failure. I noticed it got very warm in use.
5,It's a flash drive. It worked when I plugged it in. What more can you expect?
5,Works flawlessly
1,A los dos meses de uso desapareció todo lo que tenía guardado y después no lo reconoce ningún lector de memoria que decepción!!
1,Payed for 256GB. It was marked as such on surface as 256GB but it was only 31.9GB(32GB)
5,Great way to add extra memory and storage to old computers.
5,All good
3,Storage size is as stated unit is extremely small speeds are very slow
1,Buyer beware. Seller buys discontinued models and sells for new.  Entire description is a total lie. The package claims 5 year warranty not true. Sent a 2 refund requests never answered. The drive is a has a manufacturer's defect. Will not even plug into USB anything.
5,It's very small but powerful. Best of all my thumb drives.
1,CAUTION!!!! When I backed up all of the files from my work computer to the secure vault it deleted everything!!! Pictures quotes invoices bid packets blueprints- ALL GONE! I spent two days with tech support from sandisk microsoft and data recovery companies. In the end my information is gone and there is no way to recover it. As a USB device it works great but they have some serious issues regarding their vault features. I was able to pull important files from my email but I lost a lot of data.DO NOT BUY or else this may happen to you.
5,Amazing
1,Se calienta mucho le puse solo 5 gb de música y al ponerlo en el estereo del carro no sirve para archivos si funciona solo que muy caliente
1,I don't know what is happening over at sandisk but this is the second storage product I've owned and had major problems with. First was a micro sd card that would fail intermittantly (almost immediatly after purchasing) that sandisk replaced twice in warranty (both times were a pain and tons of filling out forms). Now this one I used once the transfer speeds were abysmal (approx 14 hours to move 100gb of data on usb3) and now trying to format it on osx it won't mount or format. Absolutly the worst and a real shame since sandisk products were so great but this is the last I will ever buy :(
5,very good price and quality
5,Works excellent I'm using it im a Wii U and is functioning great!
3,Only had this product for 2 months and it does not want to be recognized anymore
5,Very nice compact design and good transfer speed.
1,Product died after a few months of sedentary lifestyle in a studio.  Perhaps it needed to move around more.  That’s fine. It’s in scan disc heaven along with all the files it store as a back up.  Sadly cannot recommend.  Unreliable :(
1,Not recommended the speed is similar to that of USB2.0 and it is very hot.
5,Good product
5,Good product
5,As advertised.
5,I have a couples of sandisk flash drive and they work fine!
1,I like this unit vecause it was convenient.  It was compact and I can leave it plugged in all the time.  But it would overheat.  It lasted less than a year and it stopped working.  I opened an RMA with Sandisk and they will send me a replacement.*UPDATE* I got a replacement from Sandisk.  The replacement unit has died... again!  And there is no way to recoup my data this time.  This turned out to be totally worthless.  If you buy this make sure to backup your files somewhere else.
5,Great products
3,Very tight fit in USB slot seems like it's going to break.
1,Failed after little more than a week of use. It was used as a boot drive for a small ESX server the logs were all saved to ramdisk or other storage so there was next to no read or write load on it. The fact that it seems to be made entirely of plastic probably didn't help. Would not recommend.
5,Very tiny back-up for my PC.
2,Don't be excited by the USB 3.1 label on these. You won't get anywhere near USB 3.1 expected performance. I bought two of these since the price was so low. Now I regret this purchase. I use one as a portableapps removable drive and it's slower than expected in both launching the portable applications and updating software.
5,Super small worth every sime
3,Realy slow
5,Nice and small for car USB port.
5,Ease size and amount of storage space.
5,Its a flash drive. Stuff was able to be saved and accessed. Good stiff
5,Works good for a windows boot program.
5,Works perfectly with my PlayStation classic!
5,Plugged it in and works like a charm.
1,Will not work on GM vehicle USB Data ports due to out portion is plastic and not metal and is not grounded. Therefore the vehicle will not recognize that there is a thumb drive plugged in. I wish it was noted that it was not metal and plastic in the description.
5,Easy
3,Basically everything that is black is plastic thing and bendable. Durability? We shall see.
1,I've had a very hard time using this drive for a number of reasons including what I mentioned in the headline. The drive gets VERY hot which can't be doing much for performance or longevity. The other issue is that every time I try to copy data to the drive it seems to run normal for the first minute or so then crawls to a halt. Using CarbonCopy Cloner the copy fails due to the timeout option in the tool when the target device stops responding. It seems to have gotten worse and I now consider it money lost.I would NOT buy this device.
5,Great price very satisfied with product.
5,good buy..just wish it came with a cover
5,Does exactly what I wanted it to. This is my music library for the vehicle.
5,Excellent product and fast storage
5,Fit all my music with room to spare
5,Works perfectly with a GPD win 2
5,Used this item to store data. Works well so far.
2,I bought this to use as a leave-in drive for a Chromebook. It sticks out about a quarter of an inch but the main problem is it gets very hot even when not reading/writing. It was hot enough that I decided to just take it out rather than leave it that hot the whole time the Chromebook is on.
5,Fast shipping and no problems with product
1,It was a great product initially but after it broke I lost years worth of film that I had been collecting. I had planned to back up the data from this flash drive but I believed I had more than a month before it would break so I didn't do it in time. Very disappointing.
5,Una memoria excelente!!! Gran capacidad y sin ningún problem!!!!
5,Me gusto
1,I like Sandisks security and the typical product quality but the shell on this is made from thin plastic which is easily broken. Previous one was metal and did the job perfectly. If they change back to the metal design I'll definitely buy their stuff again because I'm usually happy with their products.A rare fail unfortunately but don't give up on their other products.
5,What's not to like.
5,It's the best. Lots of GB and really small and lightweight.
5,Great Product
5,Didn’t quite fix the problem I was having with my computer.
5,Tiny fast and effective with less heat issues of it's predecessor. Absolutely worth it.
5,Does what should using it with cell c port adapter
5,Works wonderfully I use it as a local backup
2,I ignored some previous comments about this product's error to buy this USB because it's quite cheap and tiny. But the error happened to me several times. File couldn't be transferred from laptop into it after I copied about 10 GB data. Be careful with your data!
3,Not as fast as it claims to be...hardly get 40mbs (less than half of advertised speed)
3,Fit is very tight in USB 3 socket no carry case to keep dirt out.
5,Xmas
5,More like 58 gigs but its solid. Does what i need it to do!
5,Very good price and does the job
5,Small
5,super
5,slik usb device  with superior speed
5,Great usb drive love the size
5,Works like a charm
5,Because there are small
1,This seemed very decent at first.  I've been using it for little less than 3 months.  The plastic housing is crumbling apart.  I would recommend buying something with a metal rather than plastic body.
5,Works great.  I truly trust this brand
3,Not as advertised only114 gig after format......cheap plastic... guess I'll take my future business elsware......
5,Good price.  Haven't had any issues with it.
5,It’s cool
5,Good value for money
5,Excelente producto y gran capacidad. Lo recomiendo.
5,I use it as an immediate backup place for important files.
1,The plastic USB connector is so flimsy you better never remove it from the slot otherwise it will break.  Terrible!
3,Good
5,Works great. Fast doesn't overheat and has made it through the washer.
5,Recommend to everyone works great small form factor
5,Works as described
5,Worked for a year and does not work now
5,Great item works good.
5,Very low profile and working great!  No heating issue at all...
1,Nothing worse than to order something and be sent an item of much lessor value.  Paid for 512gb of memory and be sent a 32gb of memory.  Some people!
5,its small and works fast
5,Great product.
5,Super small with high capacity
5,great deal for the money.
1,I'm getting write speeds between 10 and 20MB/s with the average being close to 12MB/s. The older version of this would transfer between 60 and 80MB/s. I specifically bought this drive over a PNY one (that I returned because it was too slow but was less expensive than this one) because it had a slow transfer speed. Looks like I'll probably be sending this one back too since it is only getting USB 2.0 level speed (all of the USB ports on my computer are USB3.0). Very disappointed the old version was much better than this one.
5,works great and its a good price
5,I liked it very much
5,It is what it is. Works as advertised.
5,Worked as it was supposed to.  No issues
5,Amazing so much storage on a small drive I keep it in my Chromebook
1,works fast enough but getting quite hot quickly all the reviews that mention it are true. Flimsy plastic plug part is EXTREMELY POOR  CHOICE as the tiny drive has nothing to dissisipate the heat with. I found a solution that seems to work so far: Drive->USB-A to USB-C adapter-> C to A adapter-> A to C adapter-> my phone's USB-C port. This would make it runs cool BUT DEFEATING THE WHOLE POINT OF BUYING A COMPACT DRIVE! NEVER GONNA GET SANDISK COMPACT DRIVES AGAIN UNTIL THEY UP THEIR GAME!
5,Exactly as advertised.  Works perfectly.  Arrived promptly.
5,👍
5,Works great
5,Ideal for my yamaha keyboard
5,This was to put music on for my car. It works great!!
5,Very good Sandisk product. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
5,Works great no problems
1,Just loaded 120 Gb of important documents to that drive to move between computers from the different private networks - and KAPUT! The drive cannot be mounted and /or accessed at all. No access from Windows / Mac / Linux /etc.  Tried multiple reboots multiple computers multiple locations. No access. Nothing. That drive has suddenly become a dead piece of plastic. Be ready that  a SanDIsk drive may one day NOT be available to you at all!! Always have the SECOND copy for that data. Do not trust those 128 GB USB thumbdrives.!!!
5,Impressive lots of data space
5,excellent
5,Great product
5,The size is great for a laptop good value!
5,32GB flash drive works great. Came quickly as advertised.
5,Muy bueno rapida en la transferencia de datos
1,it all lie first time order  i check item space size is 460 so  I return  post office charge me 4 and amazon send me back new one out side box said 512 but  I put laptop only 460 again  so please any one read this do not buy  it all lie and please do not buy any that company item thank  I never buy that company any more thank again
1,SanDisk is incorrect in the statement of 512 GB capacity.  After deleting the utility files included the very largest capacity was only 460 GB with either FAT32 or NTFS.  Very misleading and very false to claim 52 GB more than it can deliver actually SanDisk is lying.
3,can't do play by track if put in vehicle USB port. only artist or album
5,Great brand well made and great quality.
5,my storage problems have been solved
5,Low profile design. Perfect for my car.
5,Great buy fast shipping just what I needed for hi-res music files.
5,Works well on my laptop
5,It works great in  my car usb port
2,My gripe with this unit is it's external design. Very flimsy. The section that is supposed to receive a key ring is plastic too narrow and thin. I don't see this thing lasting too long either by being easily broken or by internal damage since the female USB has no cover.
5,Fantastic price
1,Came in a neat package simple clear plastic with a outer cardboard layer and sealed inside with a thin layer of cellophane. There were no marks scratches or anything to indicate use but was completely unresponsive when trying to plug it in. Multiple USB ports from 2.0 to 3.0 couldn't get a response out of the thing so I give up on it. Micro SD cards don't have this level of suckage.
5,Great value! Works great !!
1,I BOUGHT A 128GB SAN DISK WHEN I INSERTED IT INTO MY COMPUTER IM ONLY SEEING 32GB FREE AND I'M NOT SEEING THE REMAINDER OF THE STORAGE SPACE
5,Works really well.
5,as described great price. would buy again!
5,That's a perfect sized Thumbdrive
1,after a few months when I plugged in my drive it required me to reformat the drive in order to use it. I lost all my data. now I am afraid to use it again. it becomes a piece of junk.  I have no problem with Sandisk drive before except this one.
5,Exactly as advertised nice and small.
5,Nice lil card added program for password protecting.
5,Measures up to expectations.
5,Excellent product food enough to satisfy the needs for daily backup in my laptop.
5,Fantastic
5,what it does
5,What I needed
5,Honestly I find this USB good more than expected. Can confidently recommend it.
5,Works great
2,The SanDisk 64GB Ultra Fit USB3.1 Flash Drive is a HUGE disappointment.  It probably reads at 3.1 speeds but writing is slower than all my USB2.0 drives.  Very disappointed and not recommended.  Returned.
5,Works as one expects it to
1,Purchased one to use a video backup device for our Tesla worked fine for about a month then died completely. Not sure the cause but after trying to revive it on several different computers I can confirm it is dead. Might work fine for light use but don't recommend if you need something which has anything other than occasional use.
5,Great storage source!
5,Small fast high capacity!
5,I liked the size very much. It's downloads fast.
5,Quick and portable.
5,Perfect for PS classic.
1,The drive is reported as Write Protected and based on technical forms on the web this indicates a flash drive that is damaged.  Using Windows and 3rd party tools were ineffective at removing the write protection.  Drive reports as 460GB (512GB) and there is no System Volume label.  Possibly a counterfeit drive?  Good thing for a good return policy.
5,It's cute and the speed is very good.
2,I bought this item 13 months ago.It stopped working a week ago. First I thought it was my PC giving me trouble but it’s the flash drive I have very important info stored in it that it’s probably gone. Very dissatisfied. DONT BUY THIS FLASH DRIVE.
5,SO HAPPY WITH THE ITEM!
5,Just what I needed
5,love the flash drive 16gb
5,Using for my fire TV works great
1,My 256 GB lasted exactly 6 months.  Dead.  NEVER had ANY card fail before.  From any manufacturer.  NO MOVING PARTS how cheaply made to FAIL.  *Has to be thermal effects* of a truly poor design flaw.  Also a light usage case.  But lost all data.  I paid MORE than what they're going for now.  But I WON'T BUY twice!  Probably never will buy SanDisk again.  Really no excuse.  "Warranty Replacement" is literally taking weeks with several hassles/hoops to get through.
5,Works great in Tesla Model 3.
5,Great compact drive with solid performance
1,I'm in UBS 3.0 mode on a Surface Pro 4 using the built-in port and the write speed frequently drops to 0 for seconds at a time.  The same behavior occurs for 2 different drives so the drive is unfortunately not defective.  I've tried flipping write caching with no improvement.  It's just one of the slowest USB drives I have ever written to -- average write speed over 13 GBytes of reasonable size MP3 files is maybe 5 MByte/sec -- not even USB 2.0 speed. :-(
5,Works perfect and easy to use
5,Small with a lot of storage makes this perfect for my car stereo.
5,Does get warm but so far that has not caused a problem.
1,I bought the 256 GB version I got about 70 GB of data on it then it kept telling me I couldn't put any more data on it.  It was actually HOT to the touch.  I was dubious about this tiny drive from the start should've listened to myself and not wasted my time.
5,Easy to copy files over and it works great in the car.
1,Would not work defective
2,My SanDisk Ultra Fit boots sometimes and does not boot more than sometimes. After I bought mine I read on the MX Linux Forums that this USB stick is troublesome for many people and NOT recommended.
1,USB didn't format dead on arrival. I don't recommend this product. Buyer Beware.
5,SUPER fast and EXTREMELY small. Love it (just don't lose it)! ;)
5,Works great in my computer.
5,It is a bit challenging to set up.
5,Works great. Easy to use.
1,This Sandisk Ultra fit USB 3.1 256gb drive was great when it worked. Now it is not recognized by any computer I have and support to try to fix is left to forums and googling the internet with no success. Very disappointed in this particular model. I have other models of Sandisk USB drives that continue to work flawless. I don't recommend this product
5,Exactly what we needed
5,small and hidden away
5,Reliable and goodGets a bit hot
5,Nice
5,Love this product for storage portability
5,Small and powerful. Lots of room.
5,Good Value. Important Documents in General.
1,used this between my laptops and now the 128gb drive is showing as 4MB!  How does this happen only after few uses???as stated I like sandisk and have used it for years on my other devices...hope this is mere one time event.btw it is so small it is a matter of time before it gets lost somewhere...guess this is another good and the bad of it.
1,I love the SanDisk Ultra Fit 128GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive - SDCZ43-128G-GAM46 and have several ones I use in the car and around the office/ home.I just received my order for the SanDisk 128GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive - SDCZ430-128G-G46 and I can't believe it's slower when transferring several and even single large files (1GB+)!Also apparently the body is made out of plastic... they probably thought of it being a good idea for heat dissipation but I can't see how this is going to be durable.
3,Way to small and easy to lose.
5,Excellent
1,As title states the flash drive overheats like crazy in usb 3.0 ports and will disconnect if left plugged into them. It's basically a usb 2.0 drive.Worthless to me.
5,Small enough to leave in USB port -
5,Great product works great and tons of storage.
5,Full capacity 256GB
1,Bought this back in 2020 and now it’s dead.  I can’t use it on my Tesla and my laptop won’t even read it.
5,Pequeño y con mucha memoria.
5,Lots of GB in a small package.
5,Small and clean design. Fits perfectly.
5,Excelente
5,good and small 1 week delivery to Israel
1,When using this jump drive at all it gets INCREDIBLY hot. Don't buy!
5,Best ever
1,Product listed as new but had been cut open and taped back together. The drive had been used and renamed and triggered an error message saying there was a problem with the drive upon plugging into computer.The enclosure is also made out of flimsy plastic instead of metal like previous models.
2,The tiny size and large capacity are very tempting however it didn't last very long and was prone to overheating. In the end the thing burned itself out after only a few short months.
5,Great Item at a Great Price!
5,Excelent
5,I really like the size and amount of space this drive has
1,Purchased in 2/2019 and worked just ok for a while. Transfer rates were only ok from the get go. In July the drive would 'lock' and not transfer anything anymore. I reformatted several times which it did successfully. Still would freeze when transferring large files. After looiking on the internet for answers found out that this is a common problem. So....I had the drive in my laptop this whole time and I believe that it cannot take the extensive use of being in laptop. Possible heat issues. Will not purchase again.
3,Nothing spectacular. Does its job stores computer data and information.
5,Great product  great size
5,Would buy again!
1,I bought these drives for my resin printer.  The files write fine to the USB drive however none of my 3d printers can read from them.  I have PNY drives and they read fine.  Same format everything.These drives are 100% plastic.They get super hot and when they do they fail to read or write.Do not buy.
5,Works great! Works like it is supposed to!
3,Very useful and small.
5,This was a good purchase.
5,Fast  small and discreet USB thumb drive.
5,Great small drive.  Works perfect for music in the car.
5,Rapida y facil de usar
1,Bought this Jun 2019. Used it with MacBook Pro regularly as a working drive to save files. All of sudden it just died today (a little over a year) and won't mount. Luckily it died just after I finished a Time Machine backup otherwise all the 128GB worth of data would have been gone. I have used numerous USB thumb drives over the years. I never have one died on me like this one. Really Disappointed.
5,I use this to keep data off of my MB Air. Awesome.
5,Tiny size right bloody Affordable!
5,Fast shipping and exactly as described.
5,speed is ok & very compact
5,Excellent flash drive. I use it for extra storage in my Chromebook.
5,Used for surface pro
5,Works great so far
5,Easy to install in my Tesla Model 3
5,Best I’ve bought lately for storage media
5,Teeny tiny can stay in the computer all the time. So convenient!
5,fast and small size with 128g capacity
5,Very good product works flawless
5,Great for adding space on windows netbooks
5,Great Product & Value .
5,Very good
5,I bought this to support my dashcam. Perfect!
1,Purchased 4 of the 256g drives to put my music on for my car took over eight hours each to fill and guess what. Not 1 of them worked tried in both my cars laptop and 2 desktops. Very disappointed.
5,Small.easy to use!
5,Good product
1,The USB drive worked great for 3 months. Then it died. Completely. It was around 1/2 full of its 128GB capacity. The error was physical - the plastic end cap bent and warped the plastic on the body as well. This is from normal usage. For comparison I have another 128 GB USB drive from Samsung that I used in exactly the same way and it has been great for over 1 year.Sadly the cheap plastic body cannot stand up to even normal usage. It is now dead and a waste of $33. Too bad.
5,This thing is smalllllll
5,Great value size and capacity
5,As described.
5,Works perfectly and very fast.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I've used many of the SanDisk flash drives over the years this is the first one that is a big disappointment. For starters there is no protective end cap that you put over the end while not in use and the body is made of plastic versus stainless steel. It is just as fast as the other flash drives but... these 2 features will make the flash drive wear out 10 times quicker. Not worth buying. Spend the extra three dollars and get a stainless steel body on another one of the SanDisk products.
2,Newer 256GB seam to fail after a couple hours of use.
5,Plug it in and it works.
5,Expect nothing else but quality and efficient super fast USB drive
5,I use for storage. Perfect so far
5,Great to have so much memory in a small size.
1,When I received the device it does not provide the full 128GB of capacity instead only providing just more than 114 GB Note that this is *not* an issue of GB vs. GiB (base 2 versus base 10 calculation) since that would at least report availability of 119 GB and change.Instead when viewing the device using fdisk in Linux it only reports a total storage size of 114.6GB (240254976 sectors 123010547712 bytes).I've contacted SanDisk support and will update the review once I receive their response.
1,When my first SanDisk Ultra Fit (64GB)  locked up in a couple of weeks I bought another one because I felt it must be a fluke and I liked the form factor. What a mistake. The second one also locked up in less than a week apparently because I actually attempt to copy a couple of gigabytes of data onto it in one operation. Now it won't mount or reformat. What a joke! I wasn't using the security software or doing anything unusual—it just died! THIS IS A DEFECTIVE DESIGN!
5,It is small. Perfect for my Tesla camera.
2,bought this specifically for my dash cam recorder which needs a fast usb. It errored out. Further testing showed the usb doesn't operate at the advertised speeds. 2 stars because its still usable are a regular flash drive for everyday files
2,I like it its small fast and no annoying bright led lights. Perfect for everyday usage.Update: after 20 months 2 of the 4 has stopped working... I dont know what's the problem it's just stopped initializing as an usb drive... Taking out two stars because of it...
3,read speed is good. but write speed is not as usb 3.0 speed.
5,Great***  Everything Does & Works As Said...
5,Bought it to be used with my Nvidia Shield. Works perfectly
5,Love it
1,Cheaply made product that I’ve had for less than 3 months. Removed product from laptop’s usb slot this morning to discover part of the top surface of the drive’s plastic casing broke off (and is still lodged in laptop’s usb input).Since I’m gentle in my handling of electronic products and not a consumer who has a bustling work/commute/travel schedule this isn’t an end-user problem. Thus this will be my first and likely last time using a usb drive that’s not encased by metal.
5,Good quality and does the job.
5,works great
1,This drive decided it was time to go in full "read only" mode for some strange reason. I cant format it or delete/edit any files on it. The data I have on it is now a time capsule. I can access it but I cant edit or delete it which makes this drive kinda pointless. I googled around and it seems this may be a safety feature that you cant fix. Do yourself a favor save a few more bucks and buy something better this thing isnt good.
5,Works great & easy to use
5,as promised
5,works perfect
1,One star because it does not always work I have to un plug and plug back in for it to start working again and some times I have to repeat the process a few times before it works. It is unreliable and not worth the money.
1,Used as a fixed boot drive in a file server. Drive had minimal  writes but was powered on constantly for months. Worked without flaw for 6 months or so then the boot failed. Unrecognized in linux and windows. Now it is just a terribly tiny and useless paper weight.Made in Malaysia out of plastic primarily. Things are cheap but I got higher expectations than 6 months MTTF.
1,Very easy get hot! it gets hot in 2-3s after inserting mbp and become very hot after 1min.
2,Absolute trash. died after one month of use for recording dashcam vid in my tesla. don't buy this one!
2,I was able to use this for only about a month and a half. As I was using this for work most of my files were on here. one day I go put it in my laptop and it is no longer readable. All files gone.
1,After about a year it stopped letting me add picutes.  I kept getting a message that it was "write protected".  I tried everything I read on the net and NOTHING worked.  This is a piece of garbage!
5,Excellent piece of device
2,This thing was so flimsy it broke in the usb port.
5,Just as advertised
5,Buen artículo lo recomiendo
3,Data storage
1,Wow had this new SanDisk for only about a week and suddenly I could not copy files to it any longer. Got error saying it is "Write-Protected". I tried it on different USB drives and even a different computer as advised to determine the issue. Say problem on a different computer. I thought SanDisk was still a good name in thumb drives and the reason I specifically chose this brand when I purchased. Apparently not. According to SanDisk "There is no method to fix this." See link below. I would NOT recommend purchasing this product.
5,Easy external storage solution. Very convenient.
1,My computer wouldn't let me transfer a 14gb video file to it. It said the file was too big! I got this for the purpose of freeing up space on my laptop. I still have 209gb left!! It's not that I'm running out of space on the thumb drive it just won't allow me to transfer the file. I even tried using third party software to send the file and got an error. If you have this much memory but can't transfer big files to it what's the use??
5,Good USB drive
1,Just stopped working today.  Computer can see it’s plugged in but won’t show any files.  The little blue circle on my PC just keeps spinning and drive got really hot.  Lost some important files very disappointed.
5,None
1,This drive gets way too hot and as a result becomes nearly unusable. Trying to copy two  8GB (16GB total) video files ended up taking several hours. Sometimes the drive would get so hot it would stop being able to write to it at all. It ends up doing the peaks and valleys thing where it will transfer at full speed for like a minute and then take 2 minutes at sub 1 MB/s. Unreal. Super annoying. Avoid at all costs.
5,awesome deal and thanks
5,Great Product. Will Puchase Again
2,I would not recommend leaving these plugged in any longer than moving files requires.  I have not done a speed test but these are being sold to add storage to a tablet or laptop Which is not a good idea!
5,Works for a Model 3 dash cam
5,Dosent get better
5,Small and very functional will buy another.
5,Good Product Fast Shipping!
5,Works great
5,Great
5,Good experience so far
1,This devices will lock you out from further storage once there are too may writes to the flash. This is a "feature" according to SanDisk. OK but it would be nice if there were some forewarning; rather than one day just not being able to write to the disk and beating your head against the wall trying to figure out why!
5,Super small and fast with a slot for a lanyard.
5,Stays relatively cool and has pretty fast speeds
1,Would not fit into any usb drive on my laptop.  First time I ever had this problem - have lots of usb flash drives.  Threw away packaging when I opened it so unable to return.
1,Used this in my Tesla X for sentry mode.  The drive failed after a few weeks.  I formatted it again and it wouldn't work.  I bought a second one and it did the same thing.  It worked for a few weeks then failed. My computer won't even open them now.  Now amazon won't give me the option to send back.
5,High quality
5,like the size easy to keep stored in the PC
5,Love it order more
5,Does the job well
5,Good product
3,Not bad on sale.
2,I loved this USB flash drive but it did not last long!  I don’t know what happened but I lost all my data on it could not restore any of it. Really bummed out over this!!!
5,Love the size hardly anything pops out of your USB port
3,It's ok
1,Not readable.  Shows files on drive but cannot access.  Worthless
5,My computer recognized it just fine. Seems fast
1,BAD!!!I wanted to download sims 4 which needed 15GB and I didn’t have enough space so I decided to buy a 16GB usb hard disk I preferred it Monday and got it today why I plug it in and it says 14GB out of 14GB I waited just for me not able to download sims 4 I needed 16 GB not 14 because if I need 14 then I would’ve used my other usb’s for that rip off
5,videos files uploaded very fast
5,product was just as advertised
5,Good product
5,thans
5,Too easy to bend and break
5,I always trust SANDISK !! Love these little flash drives
5,Small and light
5,Works great!
5,Plug & Play
1,This product is labeled as 256GB but it was only 32GB which I only discovered while attempting to copy files to it.  Thankfully the return process was very easy and smooth.  The replacement unit arrived quickly and shows about 230GB free storage.Update:  I returned the flash drive and received a replacement.  Same exact problem with it where it only has 32GB storage instead of  256GB verified on two different laptops.  It is being returned and I will try a different brand flash drive.
1,worked in just enough time to not get a refund. How convenient don't buy.
1,It has the size. It has the portability. But goodness gracious it runs really slow and heats up a lot. If your plan is to hold documents and/or videos then this will do but I wouldn't even trust it with sensitive information. I think from all that heat one day it'll just not work.
5,great product for the price
5,I give this an A+
5,all you will need
1,This unit sounded fantastic.  I did read all positive and negative reviews It was a great concept but a waste of money. It is made of plastic and gets hotter to the point of being almost untouchable.  It has failed multiple backups or file transfers and keeps disappearing from the list of devices with no reason and I am concerned that the heat could damage my laptop.  It is in my do not use pile of devices.
5,Good Product
5,Excellent product
5,Works great!
5,Small  and  compact and fast at a great price.
5,Good product
5,Works great very fast transfer speed
1,this is a complete joke i had about 50 gigs of data on my drive and i go to use it middle of a small transfer of less then 5 gigs it gets extremely hot too hot to touch for a moment when i pull it out of any usb port. waste of 45 bucks unless you only need it for simple files that you can risk losing NEVER buying from sandisk again ill go back to my samsung flashdrive that at least doesn't break.
5,Todo excelente!!!
1,Copying 6gb to (256gb capacity) drive is estimating at 12+ hours the mac dialog says "about a day" now. This is lots of small files but is making the drives not particularly useful for this case. Was averaging a slow 8mb/s on another computer as well.
5,Great pricegreat service
5,Good
5,Works well
2,Did not work for Tesla cam - which is why I bought it. The write speed was well above the minimum requirement but it fails to write even after multiple reformats.
5,Easy to do
5,Nice
1,This was a great little device and until recently I would have given it 4 stars.It is really getting hot after several hours of use and stops working entirely - my MACbook no longer recognizes it after about an hour. I have to stop working pull it out to cool down and try again in 15-20 minutes. Not very productive.It is so very nice and compact but the heat gets to it even with a fan right underneath.
5,compact small works like it should. Holds a LOT of data.
5,Speed and quality are very good!
1,I bought this because it was on sale but I returned it right when I got it out of the package the next day. I didn’t look at the pictures on here about how the (normally metal) piece that goes into the computer is plastic and breaks easy. Not even worth considering for the price if it’s just going to break off
5,An excellent product. Worth the orice.
5,Satisfied
5,Is good!
5,Size is almost always an advantage
5,Great product
5,the item arrived very fast and works great.
3,Drive gets hot after a short time while in use.
5,Works well on a Mac
5,It's good
5,Works great stores 29GB
5,Very
5,good price good quality would buy again!
5,Great price for great product
5,Micro item with a Mega Punch.
5,Great value
5,great little thing
5,Great speed and size. It can fit in my ear!
5,It’s super small and nice
5,Perfect
2,I use this drive to provide additional storage in my laptop. The speeds have become slower over time but SanDisk says it is performing according to their specs. If you can find an alternative avoid this one.
5,Compact unit with large capacity
5,Works as expected. Great price.
2,The disk is fine for light use. But if I try to copy more than a few gigs off of it at once it overheats and dismounts. Not just writing but reading is enough to overheat it.
5,Great storage and portability
5,Great product!
5,No issues
5,Useful little device.
1,Both drives use a controller chipset known to be defective.  I didn't know until I spent an hour yesterday trying to use them.  Researched and found it was a known problem.  Didn't test them on delivery because Sandisk products have akways been reliable.  2 weeks beyond the return window.  My bad lesson learned.  Always test as soon as they arrive.
5,fit great.
1,It throttles REALLY BAD. What else do you need to read. I got this to store in a safe with my other drives as a redundancy. It slows to usb 2.0 speeds after only a minute of writing data and after about 5 minutes of reading data. If I was using this every day I would be upset at how painfully slow this becomes.Very similar to most small USB drives. Get a slightly larger drive with more body/frame to act as a heatsink and dissipate heat.
1,I purchased this in January and now in June it's dead. I chatted with a SanDisk rep and of course they'll replace it but everything on it is a total loss unless you use their recommended data recovery partner and that can cost a few hundred dollars. This is a crap drive. You are being warned: DO NOT KEEP ANYTHING PRECIOUS ON IT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE YOU WILL LOSE IT.
1,This is JUNK! Cheap unreliable plastic overpriced JUNK! I repeat JUNK! I will NEVER purchase another Sandisk USB stick. It fails within weeks. I have other 10 year old USB stick that still work.
5,Love it!
5,Excellent Product!!
1,Horrible quality from Sandisk. This device will not stand normal wear and tear. the cover is plastic and flimsy. Mine broke and now am in eminent danger of my drive getting ruined at anytime.
5,Small form factor /Fast transfer speeds
5,Small but potent
5,excellent
1,I ordered a 64gb and 16gb Samsung USB 3.1 Ultra Fit for transferring files for myself and my wife.  Instead of an Ultra Fit we received an Ultra 3.0 flash drive from JDI Electronics.  As you can see in the picture it's labeled on their stock sticker as an Ultra Fit but they don't accept returns so I'm having to look for resolution directly through Amazon.Can't speak for its quality or how it works since I won't be opening it.
5,Good
5,worked as advertised.
1,This product is essentially worthless as it overheats to the point where it will melt enless its unplugged or cause serious damage. I would avoid this product and go with Samsung or Adata usb drives.
1,Sad but Sandisk products have become super low quality.  Common and recurring "Read only" situations render the drive useless.  Oh sure you can send the drive in via RMA repair but if your drive isn't encrypted and you have data on there then you're just giving them the drive with all your data.  Most people aren't aware of this and don't realize the implications.  Sorry but I'd pick another vendor...PNY Samsung anyone other than Sandisk.
5,Works good very small
1,I have had the 256GB USB storage device since late November 2018. It has recently become defective where there is only 30GB worth of space on the disk. That is not left over space that is TOTAL space on the disk. I am not sure where the other 226GB has gone because I have not used that much. I guess I am just SOL. I would recommend looking into other disks on the market that are not 1/4 the physical size of a pink eraser.
5,NO ISSUES WORKS HEAVY DUTY AS IT SHOULD
5,Great product! Arrived on time and works perfectly.
2,it is a wonderful little thing but outer case broke on one side would like to get a replacement but to late still works great
5,Perfect
5,like have a new hard drive
5,Fast and properly work
5,It makes my computer work faster
1,I was a bit skeptical when I first got it since the whole body of the usb connector is made of plastic. But I decided to give it a go since I was looking into something portable. At first it was working great but I gotta say I rarely used it I'd say about once a week and today the thing broke off. Really poor construction. It still works but I wouldn't bet any sensitive data to it.
1,My flash drive is not working after a month. I contacted SanDisk and this is their respond."Please be informed that we have received the pictures of your flash drive and we have reviewed them. As per the pictures which you have sent this flash drive is a Non-SanDisk® product. We would request you to contact the place of purchase / host manufacturer for the replacement of this drive."This Seller is selling counterfeit product.
5,As expected. Just a perfect tiny little thing.
1,It's may be portable small with ok capacity.  But it quit on me right at "one/1 " year mark.I paid $16 at that time. Now the price drops to $10. It's a small amount of money but caused be a big losses ( no data/images be recorded ) for not being aware of.New buyers or users have this product and still under 1/one year warranty  please be alerted. Do the necessary replacement.
5,Exelente
1,I just got a new laptop but wanted a bit more storage to go with it. This seemed to be the best answer with it's large storage and it's low profile. The second I plugged it in my mouse stopped working tried every trick I know from a few years in tech repair and could not get the mouse to work if the flashdrive was plugged in.
5,Great storage stick. Durable.
5,GOOD SIZEGET NO HEAT FROM ITADEQUATE STORAGE!
5,Small and transfers data fast like any other drive
2,In terms of storing data it works well but the downside is that the part you put in the USB port is made out of plastic not metal like every other USB stick I've ever used. Every time I use this I'm afraid I'll break it.
5,Excellent
5,no noticable issues. works normal
5,love it
1,Flash drive crashed after 10 minutes of writing data out of the box.  Went into a "read only" mode and drive became write protected.  Could not add any further data to the flash drive.  Could not reformat the flash drive.  Evidently this is a known issue with the product per Amazon help team.  Can't return the product for a replacement as there is some sensitive financial data on the disk.  I will have to eat the cost of the device.  Buyer beware.
2,Was not a true usb 3.  Actually was almost as slow as usb2.
5,Plenty of storage for photos.
5,Works great
5,Good as expected.
5,Low profile for the car
5,Good
3,Writing speed is not so fast and heat issues
5,Decent speed
5,Bastante información en poco espacio.
1,I bought this to use in my Tesla Model 3 for dash cam/sentry mode video capture. After using the drive for a week it is unable to write at the minimum write speed needed (4mb/s) needed for video capture. Note that the specifications claim 15x the 4mb/s write speed of usb 2.0 drives. The drive's write spec is greatly overstated. I have a samsung usb drive that I have been using for months that works without issue.
5,Simple and works perfectly
5,Great Product Great Price
5,Perfect works great.
1,I purchased this to backup all my important material.  The device failed basically the first time I tried to use it.  It seems to have shorted out?  It was not recognized by multiple computers and I lost valuable information.  Terrible product.  Would not even consider this again and this probably will cause me to not purchase from SanDisk again.
1,I bought it over a yr ago and was working fine. Add a few more pictures and then plugged into a 2nd computer and no longer working. I tried to format and can't. Longevity quality very bad
5,Great
5,Has worked great for what we need it for.
1,The drive can be quick formatted. However during writing of files it keeps having errors. Trying to do a full format of this drive failed multiple times. Finally have no choice but to return the drive to Amazon. Repurchased the Fit Plus 256 GB by Samsung. It writes and reads much faster and has no errors in formatting. Maybe I got a dud from Sandisk but the Samsung one has a much faster read speed. I recommend the Samsung Fit Plus 256.
5,As described perfect small memory stick
1,Purchased in February 2020.  Ran fine no indications of a problem then suddenly yesterday 7/7/20.  Computer says  I need to format this device.  Tried 3 different computers.  Same on all 3.  USB drive is unreadable.  Lost 3 months worth of data I'd been saving onto the drive.  Guess you could say I'm very not happy with this product.
5,Excelente Artículo... REcomendado
1,This drive was purchased but never used.  I finally needed it and opened it after sitting in my desk for a year. After saving transferring over 200 Gb of data from a dying PC the drive locked up and was mysteriously write protected. All attempts to remove this "protection" failed and therefore I couldn't even reformat and try again.  SanDisk support is MISERABLE and wouldn't send and RMA for defective merch.  AWFUL. DO NOT BUY.
1,Worked for a couple weeks then the cheap plastic literally started falling apart into tiny pieces even though I rarely moved it around. Pieces of plastic fell off into my USB port.
5,Small and fast
5,nice
5,Good
5,Really small.  Works perfectly.
5,Exelent
2,Not the high quality of other Sandisk thumb drives. It may be OK if you set it and forget it but after repeated insertions and extractions I could see this plastic frame cracking or breaking off.
1,This seemed like a really good and convenient option at first. Now after less than a year of use the drive is dead. Its not clear what caused it but it is unusable. None of our computers detect it most of the time and occasionally detects as zero capacity. I'm glad we didn't have any important data stored on this piece of ...
5,Good for money
1,All of a sudden my laptop did not show that it was plugged in tried in the other 3 USB ports and nothing. Tried it on 2 other computers and the same thing! I lost years of academic work photos videos and other import documents.  I am external disappointed and upset that this product would fail randomly like it did especially since I've only owned it for about 2 months!!!!
2,The plastic on the USB plug is very flimsy and broke after a few uses. Drive still works but I will choose one of the metal body models next time.
5,No spare magnet adaptor for the phone charger.
2,My little drive died after a year of service on my Tesla. When I look up warranty info it reads not covered if used on board dash cam.
1,I used this USB for my car’s dash cam videos and after 8 months it just died and I can’t access anything. Neither my car nor my laptop will recognize when the drive is plugged in so I can’t even try to format it again. I’ve seen other reviews that says it’s a “safety feature” from getting overheated or from transferring super large files but it’s pretty counterproductive if they’re permanently locked/the drive dies.
1,This product stopped working after two uses. Dud!
5,Very good ítem
5,Good buy
1,After using flash drive for video download I wasn't able to see on my TV(65")  anything but rectangular  pixels sizeof 1"x 0.5" which tells me that TV unit is starving for data. I have decided to run benchmark test using CrystalBenchMark.Test was running very long time due to flash drive memory speed. Blister pack is having information that flash drive is 15X with speed up to 150MB/s.  Benchmark results are : sequential read=33.58 MB/s sequential write=17.09 Mb/s.
1,I bought 2 drives to serve as a boot device for my TrueNAS installation.  Both drives failed after 6 months and within 2 weeks of each other. Sandisk replaced one of the drives under warranty and I'm about to send the other drive to be replaced as well.
5,Works just fine with my Raspberry Pi 3 B+
5,Great
5,Good for the money and great quality.
5,Buen producto
1,Please please please DO NOT purchase these flash drives. I purchased both a 256 and 512gb version of this same drive and both of them the plastic where you plug into your usb drive has broken off totally. I have no way to retrieve the data on these any longer. Luckily I have back ups!
1,The shell is all plastic it is not recommended to buy!
5,Excelente
1,purchased for nvidia shield as internal storage expansion (android TV).  # month in get strange shield behavior.  Notice some apps say waitigng for internal storage.  eject and replace does not help.  Notice small usb plug very hot.  Try to reformat shield says it cant.  Move it to PC PC also fails to format.  Should have figured as hot as it was.  Put in a new usb 128 stick format all is well.
5,works perfect
2,ITEM IS VERY BRITTLE. PLASTIC WILL CRACK ON YOU AFTER MANY MANY USES. NOT WORTH IT
5,Works great
1,There is always a defective unit or two that makes it into the marketplace. It was my misfortune to get one.
5,No funciona con dispositivos 2.0
5,good price good product.
1,I am a student who wasted money on this product. Now let me tell you I am a fan of sandisk. However this one was a disappointment Yesterday the flash drive was working fine. Then this morning I inserted my sandisk in my laptop and my laptop don't recognize the disk. If you are willing to purchase the disk make sure you buy the warranty. Now all my files are lost.
5,Does the job time will tell
5,Excellent Flash Drive
5,Works well. I like the slim form factor.
5,Works as described. Good price for the capacity.
5,Very reliable
5,Love it. Another perfect little item from Sandisk!
5,Nice!
1,If you're playing Backup Games or Digital Download Games on your Gaming Console like Wii and Wii U. I do not recommend this USB Flash Drive.It will stop working after over writing data.I recommend other USB Flash Drive by SanDisk (USB 2.0). That I'm been using for Wii Backup Games for few months or more and I have no issues at all.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EHG3GVM
1,I bought these so I could download music files from my computer to play in my truck but the truck will not even recognize the flash drive even after I remove the encryption feature  not very happy
2,I bought these to use in the mp3 player in my truck and motorcycle. They are very hit or miss. About half don't work. Cheap though no point in wasting time sending them back.
5,its a fast little USB memory stick.
5,Works great. Just what I was looking for.
1,It broken after three months. It get very hot. I though that may cause damage and I tried  not to leave connected to the computer too long.  Then the cover came out.  It is still working without cover but not safe.  This product cannot co-op with large data transfer which worth while to have 256GB capacity.I could not contact the company and Amazon issued the refund as an exception.
5,Good Value
1,So cheaply made that the USB port on the computer does not make contact with the drive.  Buy the Verbatim for the same price.  At least the part that fits into the USB port is metal.
1,Inconsistent Write Speeds! save your money this is an ok drive it gets really hot and does not keep a consistent write speed. For example I have a data dump I want to copy over its a ton of files all roughly the same size but a lot of them. At first the write speed is ok but after 4 minutes it goes way down like 75 percent reduction in speed. I am so annoyed! I would say save your money get a different drive. IMO
5,Item is as described
5,arrived on time good size and fast.
1,I get a 'File To Large' message on files over 4 gigabytes. Very disappointed. Reason I bought a very big capacity storage flash drive was to put big files. Also write speeds slow down after accouple file transfers.
5,good quallity as allways sandisc do very fast
5,Works like a charm.
1,Needed a small form factor USB drive so ordered this one. It worked well for a few weeks until the very thin plastic (about 0.003" thick) cracked. The crack runs the length ways and makes it very hard/impossible to plug into a USB port to the point of being useless. SanDisk makes very good products however this is not one of them. Do NOT buy.
1,Died in one year
5,Worked like a charm
1,Worked great for the first 10 times but now it doesn't work at all. The drive never appears when inserted (in multiple systems) and becomes extremely hot. Garbage!!
5,Perfect size
5,Good quality usb drive.
5,its so small yet so big!
5,Amazing love it!
1,Got it for “deal of the day” for a great price but it’s only 32 gb. Go with a better brand / seller if you actually need the 128gb. I was using it for a windows install on a new pc build so only needed 8 gb. Not worth the hassle to return.
5,GREAT
3,super fast but it can get hot quickly
1,These get very hot in use and I guess thats why they dont last. Wont mount and if it does it only mounts for a few minutes before disappearing from the system with the error message saying to eject properly before removing. When it worked it was great but a year isnt long enough. Dont recommend.
5,No problems so far
5,Great value very fast transfer rate!
5,Great
5,As expected.
5,Compact size with large capacity. Reliable data storage.
5,Item is as advertised
5,Great thumb drive for music in my car.
1,After 6 months used by my Tesla it doesn't work anymore.  Don't know the reason but my Tesla started to warn this USB Drive didn't work and then I got it checked by all my windows computers that they cannot read it.
5,Good and best
5,Perfect and compact for my projector
5,Just as advertised. Great value.
5,Excelente
1,100% failure 128 & 256g runs very hot both locked up re unforgiving write protect BS the crook manufacture enacts if it sences problems.  Can not reuse.  This is a frigging scam I believe.  Never scamdisk again
5,👍
5,It’s very nice small like it
5,Great memory transfer speed.
5,Small space lots storage
5,Great idea works well
1,I primarily used this drive in an nVidia Shield TV and it "died" after only 2.5 months of usage.  The drive is now locked as read-only and I cannot add/remove data nor can I (re)format it.  Diskpart lists the current read-only state is "yes" while read-only is "no".  There is no way I've found to fix this so I've opened an RMA with SanDisk.  We'll see how this is handled and will update my review accordingly.
3,only 229GB freesmall fast but missing 27GB
5,Good
3,The material is not durable.
5,Nice and compact
5,Nice product
5,Good
1,This drive didn't last a day barely lasted an hour.I bought this for storage for my Chromebook. started loading files and it stopped at 12GB. It is dead.Removed drive from my PC and it was almost too hot to hold.The drive is visible on my Chromebook and in Windows but that's it. Can't read or write. Will be staying away from plastic USB 3 drives from now on. Thanks SanDisk!
5,Lo esperado
5,Super fast and tiny.
5,All my music is now in my truck.
5,So much capacity in such a small package
5,Works well with my chromebox/chromebook
3,Did not perform as expected
5,A++++ just what the doctor ordered... THX!!
5,Works as expected for a great price.
5,As advertised
5,Great brand flash drive
1,I am having a challenge trying to play my left side Saved Sentry activities.  The other activities automatically go into Quick Time player but for the left side (only) it is in an MP4 format.  This only lasted for 2 months and now it isn't working at all.  I lost my $$. If you buy this make sure you tested it out before the refund date expires.  I was highly disappointed.
5,Food product..works as expected.
5,Very Good Product
5,Works great for my MacBook Air
5,Super convenient super small and easy to use!
5,Everything ok good product and receive at time.
5,Working great thanks
5,Great Buy. Happy customer
5,works perfect with Media files
5,Great value
1,Didn't work for me when trying to use for Time Machine encrypted. It kept getting ejected automatically. I'm guessing because it got too hot to finish the encryption. Tried to use it as a regular unencrypted Time Machine and Disk Utility can't even finish formatting the drive before it pops an error. I hope I can at least use it as just attached basic storage. Gonna try formatting it on my windows machine then try again on my Mac.Would not buy again.
1,The drive worked for a month. It was plugged into my laptop most of the time and held some movies from my desktop. Suddenly my laptop started saying it needed to be formatted to be used. It won't format shows only 16MB and the eject media shows it as "Anisha". Googling that it appears to be a somewhat common issue with these drives. The drive is ruined and cannot be fixed.
1,Buyers beware this is my second drive thats failed from SanDisk this on lasted 8 months then died can't format used it for school nothing that would damage it downloaded the SanDisk software the restore it but no luck not showing up on any computer can't even get a replacement or refund luckily I had everything backed up
2,Lasted less than a week before it started getting very hot and stopped working.
5,Very nice product
3,very hot..... I worried my data
5,Muy práctico
5,Easy to use and very handy.
5,Super fast in this size crazy design
5,Holds numerous files
5,As advertised 👍
5,Great
5,ok
1,The tip of the USB drive is plastic.  I purchased two.  On the first day one got bent just enough so that I could not get to plug in properly.  It is useless.  I have been inserting the second more gingerly and it still works fine.  I should have read the reviews more carefully before purchasing.  Definitely inferior to the all metal USB drives.
5,Excellent product. Great value.
5,the product is excellent & meets the purpose
1,These drives get REALLY hot. I dont think these are good for moving large files of continuous heavy usage. It also doesn't work as a storage for music in my truck. Pass this one by.
2,this USB driver (SanDisk 64GB) gets really hot in normal use.
1,Had this drive less than six months it died yesterday and took my data with it. It got quite hot and had very limited use in my Nvidia Shield as extended storage. I won't be getting another. I paid just under $45 on Amazon at the time I purchased. Got an equivalent drive from the local Microcenter for $23 at approximately the same time and it has no issues as of now.
5,Great product
5,I've had no issues
1,I had one thought it was a fluke but it happened again. The wall of the drive is very weak. (Wall is the 4 sided part that is plugged in). It just cracked after 2 weeks of 1x day use. Not much.They used to be stronger.That makes 2 in a row that have done this making them not want to work.
5,Works
1,Low use Flash DrivePurchased Sep 2020Failed Mar 2021'Nuff saidToo bad we can't give ZERO stars or that's what this USB flash drive would have gotten
5,Excellent portable product
5,AAA+
5,Great product
1,I thought this little flash drive would be great to keep plugged in for a automatic backup.  It worked for the first couple times showing up on my desktop.  Now it won't even show up on any of my computers.  I'm glad that it was only back up files instead of something that I would need to access.  A waste of money to good to be true.
5,Just awesome. Almost too small. Lol.
5,Works great
1,Used this with my Sony Android TV. Worked well. For a month. Failed completely. Now I can't even format it. Tried on a PC / Mac won't see it Disk Management doesn't even work. Waste of money and time.
1,The write speed on this drive (256GB version) drops to less than 100KB/second after the first 400MB or so.  To fill the 256GB disk would take half a year.  The read speed is good - if you have the patience to write to the drive piece by piece.Just noticed that Amazon finally took this off the search results and "sold by Amazon".  Don't buy - especially don't buy from 3rd party sellers.
5,Very cool.Works well.
1,I have used similar (lower storage capacity) thumb drives for storing my music so i can listen to it through my car audio system.  For whatever reason my car cannot see this drive even though my computer had no problem seeing it and sending 100GB of music to it.  I'm not sure what to do with the thing now :(
5,Good product
5,nothing to say - its great..
5,Excelente artículo
5,Thanks
1,The USB port in my car will not read it.  I ordered a replacement and nothing.  It still will not read it.  I was so excited about this flash drive.  I have about 10000 songs I wanted to transfer to listen to in my car.  I guess I'll go back to the one that's sticking out and easy to hit and damage...at least it worked.
1,This disk always ran hot but worked well for a few months. I like the slim profile. I leave it continuously inserted in my MacBook Pro now it keeps disconnecting (my Mac complains about it not being ejected properly). This is very annoying as I frequently use files on the drive. When I have files open it disconnects and causes issues. Not happy with this at all. Suggest you look for a different option.
5,Great
5,Good
5,Great for vehicle works perfectly.
5,Incredibly small and fast data transfers!
3,that's good
1,There is something wrong with this usb drive. It gets extremely hot. I switched to a different port and a different computer and it did the same thing. My other usb drives do not. Also everytime I plug it in windows 10 reports it has an error and when it goes to fix it it says there is no error.
5,Prompt shipping and product exactly as described.
2,I bought two of the 64GB model. Only one worked.  Oh well just buy twice as many as you need I guess.  Didn't find out until much later.
5,Great product great deal and it came fast.
5,Fast shipper product is as expected
5,It works
1,I have two other "button-size" USB drives. One runs a little warm the other not as much.This thing gets literally too hot to touch with bare fingers.
5,Worked as hoped and the right size
5,Nice
1,I purchased this to download video from a security camera.  It took several hours to download a few minutes of video.  I bought 256GB USB drives from Costco  They download so much faster than this little device.  I guess it's cute so it's got that going for it.
2,planned to use it for permanent storage in my chromebook it heats up the surrounding area of the usb port to the point it is hot tot he touch
1,Unstable. It periodically disconnects by itself and my laptop cannot recognize this usb drive. Reconnection requires MS Windows to fix the error every time.  I cannot rely on this device. I might loose the data one day.
5,Like it a lot. fast & big.
5,works
5,Small compact and fast.
5,Very good
5,Great product
5,Great buy
5,Perfect
5,Awesome
1,It's just been plugged into my computer and it died. It can't be read anymore and it will keep my computer from booting or shutting down if it's plugged in. Lost ALL of my data.It also gets very warm when it's plugged in like it's shorted out.I have seen other complaints like this on here. I will not buy SanDisk again.
5,Like
5,Very nice.
2,Purchased in November of 2018 and is presently FAILING risking losing all of my business data.  Trash.
5,Perfect
2,40MBps write and 110MBps read but heats up badly after writing large files. Had the dumb idea to write 6GB and touch it to skin more sensitive than a finger tip. Now my upper lip tingles from a slight burn.
5,good price
5,love this for car
5,Works great and has been reliable.
5,Too much plastic
5,Great ultra small thumb drive.
1,WTF? This is made of a Very Thin plastic. I don't doubt that the memory is good but come on. This is about as thick as a sheet of copy paper. I downloaded some music and plan on leaving it in my usb drive. I don't mind it being plastic but make it quality. I Would Not Recommend this to anyone.
1,So disappointed. Bought this to help transfer data from my old computer to my new one. When I went to plug it in it said it was only 7.66 GB. Not the full 256 GB I paid for. If I wanted a 7 GB flashdrive I could’ve bought one for the fraction of the price. This is a scam
5,Awesome
5,Works fine.
5,Great deal
5,Perfect
1,SanDisk 128GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive - SDCZ430-128G-G46        Right out of the package the drive was damaged (Not the plastic casing the internal component) and would cause my system to lock up every time I tried to copy files to the drive.  This was confirmed by an error written to my Windows System logs  Thankfully Amazon has a good return policy.  I'll definitely be selecting another brand of flash drive.
5,Works as expected
5,Very good
5,Great product well worth the purchase.
5,Tiny and large
5,Great deal!
5,Good
5,works great
5,nice stuff
5,Thank you
5,Great product
1,Por alguna razón sin utilizarla por mucho tiempo simplemente dejó de funcionar. Requería copiar unos videos y empezó a tardar demasiado hasta el punto de sacar errores. Luego intenté y ya no dejó escribir nada. Puedo ingresarla y veo los archivos que tenía ahí pero no me permite escribir y con eso se convirtió en algo inservible para mí.
5,Works great
5,great product for the price
1,The flash drive worked great for a year but just around 11 months since I bought it it suddenly disconnected in the middle of making a transfer and since then it has refused to connect to any computer I plug it in to. If you have this backup everything on it because it may break without warning.
5,Great Drive
1,I was copying files (larges of them but not in big size) from another sandisk flash drive to this file it quit at around 20% was done.  That's the end of it.  The PCs are not even able to recognize it at all.  Disappointed.
1,I paid for an 128 GB flash drive. I received a 64 GB flash drive instead... It's very good on function and all with my computer but I didn't receive what I paid for. That's all. Hopefully this mistake won't be repeated in the future...After trying to add anything to it I discovered the 64GB flash drive was more decoration than function. Nothing I tried to copy would write on it. Highly disappointed...
1,I purchased this as a gift for my wife to put her music on for her car back in december 2018. She FINALLY decided to open this week and have me put her music on it today and the USB will NOT mount on any of our Mac's or PC's.The unit get's INCREDIBLY hot and will not format is it is unmountable. I'd avoid this purchase. Period.
5,👍🏻
5,Great Product!
1,I am not sure how this device could get a 5 star review just on speed alone. I tested the device in copying 60GB of data on a USB 3.0 port and never got higher the a 15 MB transfer rate. Secondly it's cheap and DOES run hot. I may add picture later to the review but this is not a product I can recommend even if it was 1/2 the purchase price.
5,Todo impecable
1,Ordered on Feb 1 for use as backup device. I'd noticed it was running hot otherwise seemed ok.  Failed on October 30th.  Device cannot be accessed on multiple PCs.  No recoverable data.  Not a good backup device it seems.  :(
5,low cost good quality
3,Plastic body looks cheap.
1,Bought this in 128gb to expand my laptop's memory. After less than 4 months of basic use the plastic casing broke off leaving the chip exposed. After fiddling with the stuck chip in my laptop it somehow became unwriteable (read only).  Extremely disappointed and I could not access Amazons product support (the link expired in march). Have emailed Sandisk and would appreciate a replacement from the manufacturer. Thanks.
1,Bought it 4 months ago and used it once or twice. Today I tried to copy some files to it and just found out it was read only. What's the heck! I googled and tried on mac windows and linux. None of them worked.I gave up. My time worth more than this crap.== Edit ==FYI: In windows diskpart it shows:current read-only state: yesread-only: no
2,heat damages the structure in less than 6 months
5,affordable reliable and portable.
1,For some reason the read rate on this drive is incredibly slow. Have 40g on the drive trying to play music and it takes forever to load. I put in three different drives with similar storage ratings in the same file size and none of them had this delay. Love the small size but it’s worthless with this delay.
5,Works good.
5,Good
5,Super miniVery fast100% satisfied
1,Paid for 512gb and received it. But when I plug it in says 460gb not the problem. It only allows me to store 250 gb no idea why.
5,Well worth the money highly recommend
1,NOT WORKING after two month!!!Got it for my Model3 sentry mode footage.(Someone recommend it for Tesla cam).Was working fine in the beginning but after few erase (You need to erase the content when full) now it shows "write speed is too slow" when plugged in Tesla.Can't use it anymore. I guess this is the price of being cheap. Sad. 😔
1,The storage works. Everything is fine. It just get suuuupper hot. Within a span of 1 min it feels like it was in an oven.
1,Overheats horribly Ive purchased TWO of them SAME issue. It started giving me eject errors so I tried to back it up to another drive but it got so hot it locked up and crashed. I plug it back in now my computer doesnt recognize it so I lost EVERYTHING! So frustrated! Also its much cheaper now. Horrible experience.
1,Can’t format it  getting heat
5,Great
5,Works great
5,not yet
1,Benchmarked in fast USB 3.1 desktop at a fraction of the quoted speeds and about half the speed of my old 128 GB Lexar sticks. Case and plug are both plastic and easy to break. These are a waste of money.
5,Yes
5,Amazing. Perfect choice for my need
2,El flash drive al colocarlo en el MacBook y hacerle el primer formato no funcionó más. Quizás algún defecto de fábrica
5,Excellent. Recommend
5,Super nice fast and sleek
5,Excelente!
1,I've bought a lot of SanDisk memory and have had such good luck that I got ahead of myself and moved some data onto the 256G version that I did not have backed up.  It stopped mounting within 5 months.  I was able to run a recovery program but at 200GB+ worth of data I won't know if it was properly recovered until I attempt to use all of it...
5,Good
1,Bought this hoping that it will be decent at transferring files. It definitely throttles when moving large blocks of them. Finally it craps on you after a few weeks. This drive locked on me. I tried every way possible to reformat it. I went through wiping it through cod. Still nothing. Amazon tech support was kind enough to help but it was no use. Do not buy this!
5,Excelente
5,Works as advertised
5,Awesome add for Nvidia shield!
5,Thank You.
5,Thanks!
5,Received in good condition thanks
1,This item in the picture I provided was delivered to replace the first one I ordered. Both are identical and both are the wrong item. In other words you replaced the first wrong item with the identical wrong item. The order was for a 3.1 Ultra Fit flash drive. Both items received were 3.0 Flash Drives and not the compact format as pictured on the web site.
5,Excellent product. Fast and compact.
1,Would not mount after one week. Cannot even wipe it clean to return it. Other flash drives working fine.
5,Isn't technology amazing?  256GB...
5,Works great!
2,Used to store files which I did. But there was a issue with my password so now I can't access my files at all. No one to call for help.
5,Excellent product.
1,It worked perfectly for a while but died after only 9 months. 4 months in my tesla started complaining it was too slow then it just stopped working after 9 months. My computer won't even read it now. Would probably be fine for a document storage drive with light usage. reading and writing video camera footage seemed too much for it.
5,Great product!
1,it was broken the first time it was used. I copied my favorite tracks from my computer for use on my car. everything was perfect until I heard the 5th song everything was silent. USB is not working and I cannot connect to my computer. It was completely broken and could not connect to all the devices I had.
5,Super compact and fast!!
5,Excellent
1,Ive stored over a hundred gigs on this 128gb device. But now when i plug in this drive it gets very hot to the touch and my pc asks to format the device. All of my data is GONE! And the device can now only be formatted up to 64MB (its supposed to be 128GB). This is terrible
1,I bought two of the 64GB versions due to their small size and usb 3 specs and speed.  I intended to use them with a Tesla for Sentry / Dashcam use.  After formatting to Fat32 they worked briefly before being rejected with a warning that performance must be at least 4MB/s.  A USB3 drive should easily beat this...
5,Perfect
1,I see only 114GB instead of 128GB as advertised.The company says that they calculate the space as 1GB=1000MB and not 1024MB. With that calculation It should at least show 125GB but it only shows 114GB.I think this is a fraud and counterfeit product. Will be returning it.
5,Excellent
5,excellent runs cool not hot
1,This flash drive has a great size but falls short in the materials used.  The portion that you insert into the computer is made of thin plastic and after just a few weeks of use this plastic has split.  The drive is still usable but I don’t think it will last very long at all.
5,Smaller that expected
5,Perfect size good price.
1,The only good thing about this usb is that it is small and very useful for the space I needed to plug it in my car. This never worked therefore did not store any footage of the video features of my car.
1,When I received this drive I stored 96GB of data on it. On the next day the drive wouldn't be recognized by any of my computers and devices. My PC and laptop make a sound when you connect the drive but nothing else happens it doesn't even show up in Disk Management in my windows PC or in gparted in my linux laptop.
5,The bes
1,We use the Sandisk flash drive at our Company to show customers their video from an amusement ride. I just bought 10 and out of the first 4 we used 2 were corrupt and we had to give the customers free rides to video a second time.
5,Good
3,SLOW
1,This flash drive is not worth your money. Ever seen a plastic USB? There's a reason for that: This thing gets very very hot even after only a couple minutes! I returned mine ASAP because I did not want to risk damaging my computer. Just spend the extra couple bucks to get the METAL Samsung drive with the same capacity...
1,I like the size and utility of this drive but it became corrupted and my data was inaccessible after using it for just over 1 month. I tried freeware to format the drive but after some research figured out that it's "fried". Maybe it was my specific Drive but I unknowingly missed the 30 day replacement/return policy date  to try again.
1,Moved 128gb from my samsung usb (highest storage flash drive from that brand) to this 256gb Sandisk. I noticed Sandisk was glitchy and much slower compared with Samsung but acceptable. Now it has been 2 weeks and has stopped working completely. Cannot risk return because my files are on there and its not covered on warranty. I will still try to talk to the seller Buyer Beware.
5,Amazing!
1,I returned the first drive because I thought there was something wrong with it.  Turns out they are all 233GB and not 256GB as advertised. Do not buy this if you want what they offer because you won't get it. I checked partitions reformatted and re-scanned and it is not an issue of overhead or partitions.
1,I bought this to use for the built in “TeslaCam” dash camera in my Model 3. DON’T do it!!! Despite what the specs say this drive will NOT reliably work and your Tesla will repeatedly give errors that the drive is not fast enough to support TeslaCam. I returned mine and purchased the Samsung drive instead.
5,Ultra compact pendrive.
1,I bought three (3) of these sandisk ultrafit i have been using them with my Nvidia Shield TV. They all no longer work says the disk has been locked. I tried to format this is not possible "disk locked". I waisted my money cause all three no longer work. the sandisk manufacturer website not helpful suggest there is nothing that can be done.
1,I did not check the capacity of this usb when received it. The stamped letter on usb said 64G.After 3 month used this usb to store my files. My pc said this usb was full. I checked and found out instead of 64Gb as print on usb it is actually 32Gb usb. Too late for me to return.
1,The flashdrive lasted about 2 weeks and died got a full refund from the seller.
5,Fast and perfect!
5,Fast data transfer
5,Works as described.
5,Nicely priced
1,I bought this brand because of the name thinking it would be sturdy and solid.  I received the product and the metal is so thin it was bent when I opened the package. It felt like it would completely break if it was even possible to use.  My current smaller storage size thumb drive is a TAB brand.  It is way more sturdy... I’ll be purchasing that brand again!
1,If I could give this no stars I would. The connector is made out of the thinnest plastic instead of metal like every other drive afraid I will snap it off in port or get smashed in your pocket. This might be fine if you plan to plug it into a port and leave it there forever as its as durable as a toothpick. Speed won't matter once its broke
1,The SanDisk 128GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive is advertised as a 128GB drive which should have a usable data storage capacity of about 119GB.  However this drive has a  data storage capacity of only 114GB which is 5GB less than comparable drives including those made by SanDisk.  I called SanDisk customer service to inquire about this issue and they gave me the runaround.
5,Quick delivery. Works perfectly!
2,Cannot maintain decent write speed for long. After about 20s at 50MB/s write speed dropped like a rock averaging <5MB/s. Probably the same thermal issues that plagued my previous generation Ultra Fit drive.
1,Order 512 GB as showing in the order link and on the product packaging but actually its less then 460 !
5,Fantastic USB
5,slim and fast
1,I've had this flash drive for less than 6 months. It's only use was sitting in an Nvidia Shield. Took it out recently and trying to format it. I keep getting Write Protected Error. Was reading Sandisk site and it says I need to return it. Not happy. Hope the other one doesn't fail like this one did.
5,Very good
5,Great
1,Avoid this model.  I had used smaller capacity larger form factor SanDisk drives successfully in the past so I trusted the brand but this model is a loser.  It locks up and hangs regularly can't even unmount it.  I suspect that it is overheating and then stops processing instructions from the controller.  Saw some other reviews reporting similar behavior.
1,The speeds are slower than USB 1I'm using USB 3 port on my computer that with my other USB 3 hard drives drives transfer at rates that are 20-30 times faster than this drive.I've experienced slowness with SanDisk before but was hoping this drive would be different since it got great reviews but I was wrong I will never buy another SanDisk again
5,Economical
1,Mine randomly deleted all of it's files about a week after having it had to pay to get the data recovered because non of the free to use applications worked. Glad I got what I needed because when I plugged it back in a couple weeks later not only has it deleted everything again but now windows can't even format it so it's useless.
5,Works still so far.
5,Does the job!
1,Extremely hard to insert  it feels as if you’re forcing it and is equally hard to remove.  Worst of all stopped working after two days.  Would no longer show up as a drive on my laptop.
1,I love the size.  The performance is good.I can't use this basically anywhere for fear of it nuking the device.  I wanted to use this in a PS4 but I won't risk burning out a USB port.The device gets molten hot.  Not good at all.
5,It works!
5,Works as advertised.
5,I like the size.
1,I kept it in my Nvidia Shield for about a month then in an old Wii.  Only wrote data to it 3 or 4 times and otherwise it was read only.  It worked great for 3 months with the exception of excessive heat until it locked up with no warning  I do not recommend.
2,I have no confidence in the long-term reliability of this drive so have abandoned it.
3,Great
5,Great
1,At formatting returns "Unknown Disk Size"At writing returns "Write Protected"
5,Came as advertised.
5,Great
1,I bought this with the intention of putting my whole music library on it. Worked great for about 2 months but one day all my files had disappeared. I lost my ENTIRE music collection. Just gone. If you had similar intentions with this product please don’t buy this. I would have given this product negative stars if I could
5,Good
5,Best thing ever
1,The drive cracked two days outside of the return window.  I am now stuck with a flash drive that doesn't work and can't be returned.  The drive housing is very inexpensively made and not built to last.  I've not had this experience with other manufacturers but seems like I have had issues like this with SanDisk products regularly.
5,Works great with my iMac
5,not bad) on USB3.0
5,No problems
5,great seller A++++++
5,Thank you
5,Works as expected and is very small.  Just what I was looking for.
1,I had high hope in using this as a small backup device or even a boot-able recovery. No luck. The drive is constructed of plastic and becomes EXTREMELY hot when plugged in even when no data is being transferred. Waste of $30. The tiny footprint is attractive and tempting but trust me...buy a more reasonable solution.
5,Excellent
5,Ok
5,very good!
5,Fast and compact.
1,I password protected it with Microsoft bitlocker. After 60 days new windows started poping up in every 3 to 5 minutes to enter bitlocker password to unlock it. Tried different laptops; no luck. Formatted it and tried to lock it again with bitlocker.  New window started poping up again like before. Waste of money.
1,I use small USB drives to save all of my files I use as a teacher.  I bought this one to back up my 64GB drive I have already been using for over a year boy was I surprised when it completely stopped working after using it for less than a month.
1,It has tiny size and big capacity. It’s convenient to carry around. The USB is also fast to read and write. The only thing I don’t like is that the port part is made of a very thin fragile plastic. Mine is broken after 5 months use. Really unexpected!
2,I used this device as a storage for my Nvidia Sheild and it stop working after about six and a half months.
5,ok
1,Arrived DOA.
5,Great size for the amount of storage. Works well for what we need it for. May get a few more.
2,The USB drive doesn't work on my Tesla 3 dashcam. The write speed is too slow. Don't buy it for this purpose!
1,After 2 months it died I had only pdf's and some backup photos on it it wasn't even 7% full and now it's garbage do yourself a favor if your looking for a good small usb drive and go with Samsung besides the the stick dieing it's made of really cheap plastic
1,I purchased this product 12 months ago to be used within my Tesla Model 3 to record dash cam videos. Within that time the USB completely failed and cannot be uploaded on a typical PC.
1,I bought two of these to use with Raspberry Pis. They both failed and were dead and unreadable about 6 months in. Plugging it into multiple computers it's not being recognized and is dead as a door nail.  Good price/storage point but durability and longevity were much shorter than hoped for.
5,Nice little drive.
5,Very small. Works great
5,🤩🤩🤩🤩
1,The transfer speed was atrocious.  Rated at up to 130 MB/S.  It transferred 8 files so slowly - 1 MB/S and less.I formatted this as exFAT and got rid of all the extra crap it comes with.I would skip this one.
1,Might as well throw your files into a black hole as the drive will corrupt and you will lose everything.  Then you have to send your drive full of maybe unrecoverable data to sanDisk to get replacement.  Yeah right I'm going to send all my personal files to SanDisk.  What a joke.
5,Work great.
2,Thin plastic plug in. May break with any force out on it. I have never seen a plug that is not metal.
1,I needed to copy a large amount of files and ran out of space. I looked at the capacity and noticed it was 16GB and not 128 as advertised. I checked the label on the flash drive and it indeed says 128GB.Do not buy this is a scam.
2,It was small and good to carry with my keychain and very light and everything.The only thing it doesn't do is to carry my files around. It won't turn on at all.
2,It says USB 3.1 with speeds up to 130MB. Definitely false advertisement. It doesn't go beyond 60MB in best cases.
1,Comparing with some other similar items it gets very hot. San Disk has one of the 'worst' customer services possible!!!The SanDisk Customer Service is 'Extremely' Abusive and does NOT stand behind their words!  Besides Ultimately Poor Communication! Contacting them is a very bad experience!
1,I hate leaving reviews specially bad ones. But this thing is so slow that my old usb 2.0 is more consistent on speed what a shame a fake advertising. If u want move a heavy file or copy it just do it overnight or you’ll wait forever i swear.
5,great!
1,Bought on of these to store large files. After normal use of mainly reading the files stored in it it simply stop being accessible. I have tried on Mac Windows and Linux i can not access the data. It gets very hot under normal use. I think this has something to do with its early failure.
5,Compact and responsive
1,It stopped working in less than 3 months. I went through all  the possible processes to reformat the drive to no avail.
5,Awesome Price
1,The housing on this unit is made of flimsy plastic.  It does not look like it will hold up.  My old SanDisk UltraFit had a housing made of solid metal.My older SanDisk UltraFit USB 3.0 is a lot faster too.  Maybe it's the metal heatsink...Very disappointed.
2,Too small and would easily get lost. Bought it for each child to download family pictures
5,Great
1,Product required exacto knife to remove from package.  After removal I found that the case was completely crushed flat.  It took quite a while of playing with to get the frame of the plug square enough to insert in the PC.Will NOT buy again.
5,love it
1,Started acting wacky... Then pulled errors stating > “Power Surge on Hub Port” or “USB Device has exceeded the power limits of its hub port... Pretty much died at about 1.5 years.  You would think it would last longer than that...
5,Good
2,This thing gets extremely hot even when it's not being used. I will not buy this again until this gets corrected.
5,Fantastic Drive
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!  This product melted in my computer after very little use.  Too late to return now as well...
1,Second drive to fail within 8 months. I was able to replace the first one because it failed within one month of the purchase and I was able to return to Amazon for a replacement. Unfortunately the second one just failed after the window of return is over. I don’t recommend.
1,I purchased to transfer all my music from my MacBook Pro to flash drive. Around 110GB of songs took over 24 hours (computer constantly turn on) to transfer. It was painfully slow. I purchased locally a 256GB flash drive from Samsung similar size and it less than half the time.  A big disappointment.
1,I bought this 3.0 256 drive from my PS4 as added storage since it met the minimum requirements in the listing turns out it does not the 256 GB flash drive is actually only 232 GB and cannot be used. this is worthless to me now.
1,Cheap plastic on drive cracked as soon as I got it.  It worked really well for a few months then part of the case broke off and now it doesn't work at all.  Disappointed because I've been buying SanDisk for many years and never had a problem before
5,Works well!
1,I had this attached to an nVidia Shield and it worked great for about 2 months. It was pretty hot after plugging it in and it never really cooled down. It worked great for about 2 months and now it is saying that it is write protected and I can't format it on windows or on the shield. Bummer
1,it made of plastic and it broke easily. I would not buy it again and instead I would look for a more durable material
5,love it
5,Great
5,ok
1,i bought 2 sandisk ultra fit 128g flash drivesand 9 sandisk ultra fit drives.for some unknown reason they all wentpermanently read-only - making them useless.this is apparently a know issue from as far back as 2014.stay away if you don't want this to happen to you.
1,SanDisk fails to mention in their product information that this drive might need formatting and that is not possible to do on a Mac (as confirmed by their customer service). Even though this is an egregious oversight they would not offer me a refund.
1,I bought this in September. It worked great- and so I put everything I needed on it. Today it stopped working all of a sudden. My computer won’t even register that it exists. I’ve tried multiple other computers. It is a ghost. I’ve owned this for 6 weeks or less. I’ve lost several presentations. I’m soooo annoyed.
5,Thank you
2,Pros: portableCons: 1. slow USB read/write speed 2. I can not write more files whenever the storage reaches 128GB.
5,Excellent
1,Great price and size but it heats up way too much. If you plan to not leave it plugged into your computer then it will work for you but If you leave it in for more than 20 mins its almost too hot to touch. I would recommend a different solution for risk of hurting your computer.
1,Less than 7 months of use. Purchased to record security video in Tesla. The second time I checked the flash drive I realized it does not work at all. Tested on two different computers and neither were able to recognize the product was in the usb port.
5,Works as expected.
5,Works as expected.
1,The product is small and great and easy to use. However after a few months it locked it's self so did not work with my Nvidia then when I contacted the company they said they could not help me and it was too late to exchange. Very disappointed...
1,I have 3 of these drives the older version is made out of metal. This drive is plastic Cr@p. while copying data it fails (2 weeks old) this maybe something to do with heat. whatever it is plastic has to go. returning...
1,I like the idea that it could hold a lot of data. Bad thing is it started heating up and finally stopped working. Lost all my data. All this unfortunately started happening right after the return policy closed. I was a bit disappointed Sandisk is a good brand. Do not buy this product
1,The Drive was very quick but got very hot just plugged in.  I was very surprised how hot it got.  I may have just got a bad one.  The read and write speeds were very quick.  I am returning because of the heat issues.  This is the first issue I’ve ever had with a SanDisk Drive.
1,This thing gets very hot. In a plastic housing it’s for certain going to crumble like an Oreo cookie in milk if you remove it immediately. Had it less than 18 hours and that’s my take. Transfers well but gets very hot.
5,Love it
1,Put this drive in my Tesla Model Y and it died in exactly around 12 months after installation.
5,Good
2,I have had this 2 months and it broke already. Will try to contact seller.
1,It stopped writing/reading after 3 months of use in my Tesla. Got hot. All plastic even the part that goes into the slot. Not a big issue but it probably didn't help the heat dissipation. Bought a Samsung for next try.
1,This drive benchmarked in the 11th percentile.  Suswrite @10s intervals netted 7.7 9 9.7 7.4 7.7 7 MB/s.This is a poor performing flash drive.  Do not buy expecting USB 3.0 performance.
1,I purchased this and a samsung model of the same size. Their transfer speeds are orders of magnitude apart. What takes 2 minutes on the samsung takes 20 minutes on this. It's crazy. Do not waste your money unless you just need the space AND have patience.
1,the drive died after 6 months. didn't write fast enough to work with tesla sentry cam so used as drive to store MP3s. One day it just stopped working. Reformatted the drive and now the drive does not work at all. Garbage.
2,It melted And stopped working after just a couple months of use.  Needs to be made of more durable material obviously.
5,Excelente
1,my mouse became completely erratic whenever this flash drive was plugged in. upon removal all became well.I'm a Mac guy so I reformatted for Mac. No improvement.On top of that. this drive is slowslow.slow and hot!DO NOT BUY!
1,Really wish it wasn't plastic. After constant use it started to crack then broke in my laptop. I needed to fish the broken pieces out with a blade. I am sticking to metal drives from now on as I am noy satisfied with this.
1,Arrived with opened package obviously used as it has someone's data on the drive virus checker said it had malware did not have the promised recovery software.  Now I will need to go through the trouble of returning the product.
2,About the size of your little finger nail. Not handilable.  Have to gift it to my 10 yr old niece
1,Storage is good easy to use. But for some odd reason it reaches really high temperatures. I’ll leave it plugged in for about 10 and thing is hot.. Maybe my laptop is to blame (MacBook pro) or maybe it’s a defective item. Either or I stoped using it.
2,A little over 4 months and its no longer recognized my any device. Data is lost and drive is unmountable.
1,We ordered the 256gb drive. It said 256gb on the packaging. Actual storage space is 32gb. If I could request a refund I would. Don't buy this product.
1,The device seemed good. It saved data like it is supposed to. It died and is now in read only mode after very very minimal use. By minimal use I saved about 80MB to it and then a bit later went to delete that data and write more only to find it dead.
2,Too slow video records and something wrong with Flash drive or inside system .
1,No returns on this
2,Outside casing that plugs into the USB slot is thin plastic that breaks easily.
5,thank you
5,great!
1,Just a few moments after plugging this USB Flash Drive in my laptop is was extremely hot.
1,It is defective. I contacted the seller and he never replied. I lost my money on a USB brand I thought it was good
1,I used it to dual boot to Linux on my company laptop which has an encrypted hard drive invisible to Linux. But after a few months it would not allow me to start up Linux. It turned out that the USB stick was hard switched to read-only and would not switch back with any utility I could find. Bummer.
1,This is my first 128GB Flash Driver But it is very disappointing I copy a 1.1G file from my computer to the 128G driver the writing speed only shows about 333K/s. It is much much slower than my USB 2.0 driver.I tried to format in NTFT type the writing speed still the same.
2,It's made of plastic and write speeds are atrocious.  It was a good deal for a reason...  Not recommended.
1,Need help purchased this 256GB drive the package and drive both say 256GB on them. When I plug the drive into my computers it says it’s a 31.9GB drive. I already tore open the package what can I do?
1,Stopped working after 2 months of use.  Noticed that when I removed it from my laptop it was burning hot to the point it was too hot to hold it in hand too bad I can't return it now.  I had such high hopes
1,Storage is great but it's a cheap thin plastic and hole to put on key chain is too tiny.  Usually I only buy this brand but this one sucked
2,Speed drop after 30sec of higher transfer speed then drive transfer at usb 2.0 rate.
1,Frequently overheats and unmounts (on its own; uncontrolled by the OS) during large (>1GB) file transfers. I suspect that the plastic overmold in place of the usual metal connector is a big part of the problem.
1,Says "write protected" and I get i/o error messages.  Ton's of complaints about these all over the net.  I'm not going to jump through hoops to get a 20 buck usb drive to work.  The rest of mine are just plug and go.
5,good
1,This product worked well for about 8 months. It started to work intermittently. My computer won't even recognize it. Now it sits on my desk. It's less like a thumb drive and more like a thumbnail clipping. Total garbage.
1,This use drive is NOT Durable. It crapped out on me several months into using it. Would not recommend buying.
1,the exterior of the device says "256 gb" but the actual capacity is only 32 gb - purchase at your own risk
1,This drive arrived unusable.
1,I purchased it for my Tesla Sentry mode - worked perfectly for a month and now it doesn't save any footages. Waste of money will never buy this again
2,What a disappointment. This is supposed to be the leader of the industry.  Turned out to be pretty unreliable.
1,The plastic case broke with careful use.  Then it became Write Protected making it useless.
2,its too tiny i lost mine within few weeks overall good product
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!
1,I bought one of this device on Jan after 2 months of intensive use I lost my information and the device is not working properly from one day to another my files was disappear. Also the transfer speed was degraded as USB 1.0.Do not buy this product.
2,pros:- high transfer speed without data corruptioncons:- plastic is cheap. It breaks easily
1,Paid for a USB 3.1 flash drive to get decent read and write speeds and got a USB 2.0 that is way too slow. Used USB DEView to confirm. You should check to see if you got ripped off too. I want a refund
1,The key doesn't work and the price asked by Sandisk to repeare it is ten times more high than the usb key price.So very disappointed. This is the second time i by a Sandisk usb key that doesn't work.I'm sorry Sandisk but I will not give you a third chance.
1,Another Rip-Off USB 3.1 Flash Drive. The write speeds never topped 42 MB/s. I had great performance from aRocketek Aluminum USB 3.0 Portable Memory Card Reader Adapter for Micro SD Card/TF Card Reader Adapter &  Samsung 128GB 100MB/s (U3) MicroSD EVO Select Memory Card with Adapter (MB-ME128GA/AM) combined.
1,Not sure what happened and sandisk couldn’t help me.  Maybe just a lemon but some scary moments.
2,This is a cheap piece of plastic. Spend the extra dollar to get one that isn’t plastic.
1,The USB worked excellent for the first month then started giving trouble to read / write files until it completely stopped working. By the time it stopped working it was 2 mths from the date of purchase and I wasn't eligible to return it. I loved sandisk products until i purchased this one :(
1,After using it for a while it just enters a read only mode and when that happens you can't format it you can't do anything. It's a known hardware issue and SanDisk is not recalling their products. I have two other ultrafits that got bricked too.
2,Not fast enough for my dash cam
1,Failed to work as a decent storage unit for my Nvidia Shield 2017 might have even killed the WiFi and Bluetooth in my device and I can’t even get the controller to work on it without plugging it in to the device
1,Junk. First time I tried to write 20GB of files to it it failed/disconnected 4-times. Also got very hot but expected that. Reformatted and tried a day later. Same constant failures. Sent back. As a comparison I bought a Sandisk 256GB USB3 regular size drive from Costco and it has perfomed flawlessly.
1,I had this Plugged Into My Blink Camera System and It Stopped Working After 9 Months.
1,Horrible! Didn’t get to use it once! Now when i put it in my pc it slows down the mouse. My other usbs are fine this one sucks. They need to discontinue this crap! I want my money back!!!!!
1,About 8 months of usage and drive is completely dead. Doesn’t show up on any computer or device. Heats up super fast after plugging in. I have bought three of these and willNever purchase one again.
2,First one failed I finally got a replacement many months later
1,The flash drive brook after two weeks. I used it at most 10 times.I don't understand if the item is covered by the warranty so I am asking here if there's anything I can do to have the item replaced.
1,Locked up and became unusable. Getting another one from San disk may just put in a display case.
1,I screwed myself for putting off a project for a few months. The return window ended 2 days ago just my luck. I mounted the drive and only 4 GB is available.I ordered a 128 GB drive.Needless to say I am upset.
1,Very small size and works well. The down side was it can heat up significantly.Update 08/11/2019: I find it heats up a lot and stops working eg after transferring 30gb data you got to cool it down before using it again. Not sure if this is a defective one or others have had this experience.
1,Product failed after 3 months of light use. Would not recommend to anyone will not be buying another and will be replacing my other 128GB ultra fit right away before it fails too.
1,Returned it don’t recommend it. Did not trust leaving it plugged in due to excessive heat.
1,I used the disks for extra storage on streaming devices and I was happy with one of the disks but the other one is not recognized by any of the devices or my laptop and computers.
2,Same slow speed like the previous model. I get only 10MB/s write speed. USB 3.1 is just a marketing ploy.
1,Bought this to record dashcam video footages in my car and it died within 6 months of using it as a storage device... I guess a daily use of it was too much. Lost ALL data on the drive.
1,Did not work. Storage space kept saying not enough space so could not use. Had to run to Walmart to get a new one.
1,Been using WD and Sandisk products for a long time. ordered three SanDisk Ultra Fit (64 GB) and two do not work. Computer does not recognize??????????
1,This product broke within to weeks of using it. Product comes with key ring but is made out of plastic so thin it cracks while on your keychain. I called the support number and they said they would not replace it because the drive still works.
2,I've had two out of three of these go bad.
1,I simply lost all my data from the USB Drive after 8 months of use..
1,So cheap material a d workmanship. I have the 128GB one. It is a better quality with a jacket to cover and protect it from dust harm.... But not this 256GB one. You pay a good money and you get a JUNK. How cheap this guys can be?
1,Did not even last a week before dying.  It’s pretty sad that they are so cheaply made they can’t last at all.  Lucky I kept a backup for this one and didn’t lose anything.  Won’t buy another Sandisk product again.
1,Sustained write speed over few gigs of files can't exceed 25MB/s. WTF. Portable hard drives can pull over 90 MB/s from the same ports I've used then in. They still get hot but won't burn your hand like those old metal ones.
1,Doesn't work on any system I've tried. Pc game console Mac.
1,This drive got so hot I felt it might ruin the equipment plugged into.
1,This was a nice compact usb drive.  But shortly after using it for 2 -3 months it just stopped working and my computer can not recognize it.  what a waste of money
1,I attempt to add files to transfer they don’t show up on the other device (tried multiple devices) USB does not work in my car when all others do. Absolute waste of money. Purpose was to hold more music files.
1,130mbs reads 53.8mbs writesI'm doing the speed test and the terminal on Linux. After I got done it got super hot.
1,Overall good quality of fabrication.However writing speed becoming way too slow after a few month of use.Thus defeating the purpose I bought them in first place.
1,Really bad driveWorked fine for 8 months. Then it started to fail. Memory became unreadable. Do not purchase.
1,This drive is useless. It went into write-protected mode after a couple of months and is basically unusable. According to the Sandisk website the product needs to be replaced but my country (South Africa) is not supported for a warranty claim.
1,This product is very nice and portable although probably a bit easy to loose. However when I tried to use it it worked initially but after only a minute or two of use it stopped working no computer would even recognize it.
2,It died in 11 months.  Not impressed.
1,I have had this for Scan Jump Drive for 4 months and it over heated and lost all of my files. I have Jump drives that are 10+ years old and have no problems.So disappointed.
1,Was great until it stopped working after 4 months of use. Used it in my Nvidia Shield TV as extra storage now I have to buy another one. I'll probably try a different brand to see how that work out.
1,Worked fine for 6 months. Now completely dead. DO NOT BUY.most of these reviews don't account for long term usage.
1,It is very small the feature I like but gets hot quick. Also it interferes with wifi stopping wifi altogether. My unit has problem or it is general problem with this device. I am traveling already so I can not return disappointed !!!
1,It’s corrupt. It’s been corrupt since I opened the package. Very unhappy. Got another one also corrupt? Tried on several systems? I’m not having it.
2,se relentiza cuando se calienta
1,Used  one time and now it will not read on any  device.
1,Item gets too hot when connected to laptop.
1,This USB gets incredibly hot with just a little use.  I will not use them out of concern will cause some damage.
1,Little thing overheats and burns out. Had mine for a week adding edited video files to it and the little guy dies on me. Lost all my files because of it over heating. Cheap material just a plastic little mess. Very disappointed and not buying again
1,The USB drive stopped working after a couple of uses within 3 months.
1,Worked for the first two days.  Now doesn't work at all and I can't return it.  Absolute garbage.  Tried to format it different ways.  Complete garbage.  Buy something else.
1,I used for this Tesla cam recording and it stopped working after a few weeks and not recognize any more
2,After looking into the usb the actual size is 114GB...
1,Bought june2020. Failed before 2021. Used in tesla m3 for dashcam. No longer readable by car or macs. Disappointed.
2,Not good as described
1,Lost if already.  Gone out of my pocket.  Portable is one thing but this is too small and has no 'key chain loop' on it.Waste of money.
1,Approximately one year later this drive crashed and I lost all of my data.  Drive cannot be repaired.  Not recommended for anything of importance.
1,It came apart when I tried to remove it obviously not well put together.
1,Designed to fail. Drive unmounts during large file transfers - do not buy if you ever plan on moving larger size files around. Hard to do anything with after happens.
1,It quit working in less than a year. I had it permanently plugged into a macbook for time machine backup and the computer stopped seeing the disk. Tried on other macbooks with the same result.
1,Died after 3 months of daily use used for school work. I'm lucky I made weekly backups. Now when I plug in the drive it does not warm up anymore (previously idled warm to touch just by being powered) does not appear in dmesg / device manager now.
1,only use one year and then its dead…..
1,The headline says it all really but let me reiterate: there's no point in having a large flash drive if you can't write to every bit of it before it gives up and switches to an unrecoverable read-only mode.
2,Gets very hot very slow read and write.
1,This Item gets really hot when in my machine. Worried it will delete my data or cause a house fire!
1,I Connected the USB and noticed my computer slow down My mouse kept freezing and was unable to do anything on my computer even when I was not copying anything it was just plugged in
1,Stopped working after few months with very minimal use. I never though a flash drive can just die.SanDisk warranty process seems cumbersome and not with dealing with. Sad see they aren't honoring their customers.
1,This product quality is very bad! Cheap plastic! If have to be careful while you carry it with your key or in your pocket or bag because the plastic is very cheap so it could be broken easily.
1,This thing didn't perform too well. The casing heats up very very hot and eventually broke due to the heat. I would not buy another one.
1,I kept this plugged permanently in my laptop as supplemental storage.  It was seldom removed and was not exposed to water or the elements.  However in less than 6 months it's failed and can't be recovered.
1,Way too SLOW.It is slower than my old usbs.The USB gets very hot and it messed up one of the USB outlets on my laptop
1,Please dont buy for Tesla sentry mode write speed want work properly.  It may work for other things but not Tesla sentry mode.  I will keep because I have other uses for it
1,This stupid little thing ate my files. I got it to store extra photos since they take up lots of space. However once I got them moved over it has been impossible to open or access them!
1,At first it was a good lil USB but after a few weeks on my keychain the cover started cracking until it just cracked off terrible. I'm going to try to get sandisk to replace it
2,Heats up too much.
1,Do Not Use on a Tesla. It will report the error "Dashcam: USB Drive is too slow to save"
2,Good value but very slow.
2,damage this one tying remove cover  - unit is  so small
1,Deceiving product. Manufacturer are saying 1GB is 1000000000 bytes and that is not the issue since I knew about it. The issue is that it should be 256000000000 bytes if it's 256GB but when I checked It's 246011527168 byte which makes it 245GB in their term.
1,Very flimsy plastic on the top. Broke after a couple months of use.
1,The product is good as I have used it in the past.. The problem is in the packaging. I have destroyed 2 of these drives because I can not open them. I Will no longer use this brand.
1,Advertised for 256GB but got less than 150GB.
1,Had this thing for about 3 months. Stopped working. Tried re-formatting this and nothing. Deteriorated pretty quickly. I would've expected this from a knock off company. Tried using it on a different known good PC and same issue.
1,This is or was a great drive. However after about 2 months it became corrupted and I lost all the data on the drive. Customer service is absolutely terrible as well. Unfortunately I wouldn’t recommend buying this
1,it stops working.
1,Failed twice.  Then it died beyond rescue in 4 months and one week.Before this one I had used a 128GB flash drive by Samsung for two years without any issue.
1,Gets extremely hot after transferring 4 GB of data.Could smell hot plastic.Returned.
1,The write speeds are pretty terrible. I get only 2.5 MB/S. The same port on my computer will do 150 MB/S with a different drive. Reformatting then testing with three different products made no difference.
1,I mean that's basically it. I left it in the port most of the time and something must have melted in it because it wouldn't pull out. After basically prying it out the USB port on my laptop no longer works.
1,The item is poorly made with thin plastic and extremely slow when you are copying several GBs of data. I saw KB/s when I was transfering data from my ssd to this flash drive. I am disappointed.
2,Gets hot fast
1,I bought this for my MacBook Pro and was working well and I was pretty happy until it just suddenly died on me. Now it shows the drive on disk utility but is just unable to mount. Now my pictures are all unable to recover.
1,I ordered a 256 GB flash drive but received a 128 GB device instead. I'm sure the drive will work fine. I just expected to get what I had ordered & paid for.
1,The whole thing's made of plastic. Cheap garbage. NOT supported in the Playstation Classic maybe with a hub not sure. But that's what I bought it for and it doesn't work. So it is trash to me.
1,The product came totally smashed and the package was damaged
1,I bought this flash drive for my Nvidia Shield to add extra storage.  It worked for about six weeks and just stopped working all together.  I tried reformatting it but it's still not working.
1,I would advise against buying this one. After using it to transfer a large amount of files 2 different computers lost access to their USB ports and camera.
1,I couldn't get it to work. PC would not recognize it tried several times and ways. Worse Amazon said I never returned it and charged me for this defictive item.
1,Super hot when reading and writing. It got to a point where my Mac was warning me about the USB temperature being unsafe. I immediately look it out and there's a burning small from the USB drive. There goes 12 bucks for nothing.
1,Transfer speed started at 10mb then decided to reformat the drive to NTFS copied a 5gb file and transfer speeds started at 100mb then constantly slowed down to a crawl back to 10mb.  Took about 7 minutes to transfer the 5gb file over.
1,i have bought several of the sandisk 3.0 and they work great.  this one has been nothing but problems.  constantly hanging up and fouling different processes even though the disk itself doesn't trigger any errors.
1,I've had good luck with SanDisk products but this just up and croaked after a month.  The SanDisk recovery software that cost another $39.99 couldn't recover anything.  All totaled just under $100 wasted.  Very not happy!!!!
1,Had to return them
1,Would not work with my Chromebook.
1,this devices get so hot that after 1min of use when copying files it keeps unmounting and mounting due to overheat.
1,It doesn't work in my car's USB port like my previous USB's. Make sure your USB is compatible with your make and model of your car's USB port!
1,Failure after 1 year - error in Tesla S and in computer
1,This is some bull crap and a waste of money.I am pissed off.First day it stopped copying and said error with only about 60gb added to it.I want my damn money back.Amazon
1,It worked only for a month and now it is doesn’t work at all.. it is corrupted.. I used it for my car’s dashcam..Waste of money..
1,Worked great for just over a year as my iTunes backup drive before failing during a simple iPhone restoration and is now unreadable on any machine. Tried two different recovery software and still unrecoverable.
1,Only had a few months. Constantly disconnects.
1,Needed a dependable Flash Drive. Drive now Read Only because it failed. Followed all the steps from SanDisk they confirmed it failed. Now wasting time RMA'ing because I cant return it to Amazon now. Dont buy this.
1,Cons: Made from plastic...over heats. Not reliable: failed Linux installation 5 times. I really would like my money back.Updates after more investigations: VERY slow. The USB flash is definitely ~16G not 128GB!!!! what a ripoff.
1,The product does not work.  I have reached out to the seller(Calvin and Hobbs) 3 times without any word back.  Just terrible.
1,It seems every Sandisk USB stick that is not "extreme" is hot garbage. Slow and oscillating write speeds ~10MB/s.
1,The small size is ideal for my needs.  After a week of use important saved files were no longer accessible from multiple computers. Drive extremely hot when removed from any computer.
1,Keep getting error disk is write protected. Would not recommend.
1,I bought this to replace a 128gb drive made by another manufacturer but dd complains about running out of space when cloning that drive to this. Very disappointed unformatted space is only about 114.6gb
1,Complete junk it worked for 2 days and because I didn’t open it right away I passed the return policy date. Waste of money!
1,it plastic and gentle to wear and tear if you'll be putting it in and out of your computer be careful.this is after 9 months of use
1,DOA - Never worked.  Gets incredibly hot when plugged into my laptop but wont register so can't use it.  Never again SanDisk!
1,This memory stick just stopped working only a month later... Right past the return detail
1,Its actual write speed is not mentioned. Doesnt work on model 3 for sentry mode. Keeps failing saying that the write speed is not greater than 4MB/s
2,Plastic!!!!!
1,Put this in my Tesla but get error that write speed is too slow.  Get a different usb if u plan to use this in your Tesla.
1,I ordered the 256GB version.The package I received says 256GB.The device capacity is only 128GB.Only keeping it because couldn't afford delay for the usage.
1,Failed within 60 daysApparently when these drives detect internal errors they go into write protect mode that can’t be undone.I guess I will try and make a warranty claim with SanDisk
5,I bought it for the blink sync module.Large in capacity and small in sizeEasy to use just format to ExFAT and plug it the sync module.
1,The screenshot speaks for itself - this is the '64GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1' model freshly formatted on Win10
1,Total scam only had 67 MB worth of storage
1,My four year Samsung USB 3.0 thumb drive can blow the socks off of this drive.  Don't waste your money for this 3.0 drive.
1,It barely lasted a couple of month of light use. All of my wife's student files as well as precious photos are irretrievably lost because of this garbage product!
1,Unlike others' experiences I found that this drive did not keep up with my Tesla Model 3's dashcam / sentry mode write data rates. Returned.
1,after about a month the drive died it gives the message "write protected" Sandisk tells you to request a replacement for this error. I requested a replacement but I wouldn't use this drive for important stuff
1,Interferes with other usb items. Too small and difficult to remove
1,Great storage capacity portability and size. But gets extremely hot when adding files. Almost to the point that you cant touch it. Huge problem that sandisk needs to fix
2,Write speed is very slow.
1,Will not consistently do fast write. Had 4 out of 4 fail for Tesla camera recording within 2 weeks.  Had to upgrade to Samsung.
1,Takes 2 hours to fill up or more.  More expensive drives are 5-14 times faster.  I won't buy more of these.
1,The drive just quit working in less than a year.  No computer would recognize it at all.
1,I'm disappointed the flash drive doesn't work. It was a DOA. cant play movies from it take two centuries to save or copy stuff. tried everything but I guess the flash drive is just dead.
1,Used for Sentry Mode in a Tesla. Went to look at files after one week and USB cannot be recognized. Probably couldn’t handle the heat.
1,Unfortunately this arrived and was only recognized in 1 of 3 of my computers. Other drives are detected in all computers. Attempted reformat and other things but unable to have it appear in those computers.
1,Few words needed. Here you go.Plastic. Broken. Gets hot. Tight fit in ports.
1,I have bought two of these over the last six months they last about two months and then the data corrupts and the USB is unusable.  Don't waste your money.
1,Unable to copy delete any files and also format. Customer service was not at all helpful.
1,I bought two of these drives and both died after small use and became unreadable. Stay away from these!
1,Did a quick fromat of this drive and it now reports a total of 32GB... DONT BUY
1,I just received the item in April.  It lost my data and said the only way to use the drive was to reformat.  Then it cracked.
1,Used this in my nvidia shield. used as external storage for it. Only transferred a few files a couple times and went to use it again and now its read only.
1,Over heats and is slow
1,Dont buy this. It gets over heat i mean really hot and whn used in car it doesnt get regonized. In pc works for 20 mins and gets over heat and thn stops working.
1,My USB 3.1 64GB Sandisk "Ultra Fit" memory stick arrived crushed un-useable. Sandisk's packaging is horrible and the memory stick is made out of very thin plastic. I don't know how they don't just put them in small plastic cases.
1,The drive stopped allowing writes after 3 months of usage. Now I can only read my files and can't write delete or format the disk anymore.
1,Lasted 10 months of light use before it died.  Now only asks me to reformat and lists volume as 64 mg not 256 gig.  Completely dead!
1,This item is bad quality
1,Painfully slow I get multiple errors when trying to copy over large blocks of data waste of money.
1,The cheap plastic broke and got stuck in USB port for two of these. Stick to metal USB drives.
1,Not too sure what occurred with this drive. Formatted it properly but my phone truck and blu-ray player do not read it. My computer can but that doesn't suit my purpose. Guess it's just another computer attachment.
1,My android tv box does not recognize this as being quick enough to use as internal storage when a Sandisk USB 3.1 64gb works perfectly. NOT PLEASED
1,USBs get way too hot it's concerning.
1,Bought this for my Tesla but the speed for writing the dashcam video is too slow so it doesn’t work.
1,Just disappointed with the performance way too slow seems almost like USB 2.0Using on a mac if that matters.
1,i just received the product use one day and the product dead
1,This drive must have broken within the fifth time of using it - quite a disappointment
1,Used this as storage device for my Tesla Model 3 dashcam footage. Died after 6 months.
1,Doesn't work. Write speeds start normal and then invariably go down to 9-12 MB/s. Returning.
1,It gets really hot and Windows will detect it using Disk management but it could not access the data or could not format it.
1,Do not buy very slow.
1,In less than a year the drive has write protected itself. Per SanDisk website this is a 'feature' for when the drive detects a failure.
1,Stopped working after only 1 year.
1,Very thin plastic on the end inserted into the port. it has no rigidity and I am seriously concerned about it's durability. I cannot imagine an engineer would design a product like this. Returning ASAP.
1,uploaded movies on drive to use on smart tv but would not recognize usb. Did work on Xbox one and Blu-ray players. For what I need it for did not work.
1,Worked fine for 6 months recording videos then it stopped working. Now no longer able to access the device.
1,I had this drive for a day and tried to move about 130gb worth of files with it then it just stopped working.
1,Nice profile overheats during daily use for backup.  Life span is very short due the size and the overheating problem.
1,Returned this one as the speed makes it useless. Tried to formatted in different FS and still very slow.
1,Product works great for about a week then it quit working. Not recognized by device as storage unable to reformat. And very disappointed as I always thought SanDisk was a decent brand
1,This flash drive is completely corrupted within a year after minimal use. Avoid.
1,Failed after a while causing me huge loss of data
1,This product always ran hot when plugged in. I thought it was odd. After a month it just stopped working and I lost all my data. Definitely don’t recommend this.
1,Trash!  Dont buy.  Broke while sitting in iMac right after return window ended!!!
1,Horrible. Literally stopped working a day after the return window closed. I/O error read only now. Will not format. Horrible product with short life span.
2,gets HOT!
1,This USB memory stick gets overheat broken off after a few months and left the broken piece inside the USB slot.
1,Just like others reviewers have said this flash drive either gets drive protected or is unable to be formatted. Already on a second RMA un just 4 months.
1,Not reliable at all.  The case is flimsy.  Not recommended despite its compact size.
1,Unable to sustain 4MB transfer speed. Only worked fast brand new. Even after formatting the drive remained super slow.
1,Horrible no funciona se calientan y su velocidad de copia falla cuando copias carpetas
1,I backed up data on this flash. It worked fine for few days. I connected it after a month but it does not boot up probably all data is lost.
1,Would not format write to or download from. I have requested a replacement. We will see how that one works out.
1,It works but it would only hold around 28Gig.  Will not boot grub boot loader properly.  Find a different drive.
1,After about 7 months of use this usb stick decided to die. Could not be recovered. Could not be formatted.
1,Very cheap and flimsy plastic. No Cap. Gets filled with dus and lint in pcoket. very cheap product by Sandisk. Dont recommend
1,Cheap plastic casing.Moved ~2gb worth of files to this. Windows cannot read the disk unable to format. Lost all my files. Stay away!
1,I used two of these for a proxmox zpool raid 1 boot drive.  They failed within 6 months.  Beware.
1,Within 2 weeks of using this I plugged it in one day and it didn't work. Lost all my files.
1,body made of plastic? is this a joke? it came bent and doesn't fit the USB port. it has to be metal... you just can't do that...
1,Remove from the page of you don't have
2,Purchased 2 drives.  One for music in the car and a second for my laptop.  THe drives have no heat dissipation so any heavy user results in them melting themselves to failure.  Car drive failed first. (frequent reads)  Wen to remove drive and plastic thumb molding had melted and drive was stuck in card USB port.  Second drive failed less than a week later used only in my Macbook Pro for storing music.  (read heavy).  I would expect the heat if I was writing data but in both cases these were READ ONLY devices for music.  In both cases the drives became so hot that they housing melted and the drive failed.  Find something with a better heatsink or with metal housing.  These are not meant for heavy use.
1,This was supposed to be a 128gb memory stick and it turned out to be 32gb
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM..THEY ARE SELLING IT AS 128 GB FLASH DRIVE...WHEN ITS ONLY 114 GB....THAT'S 14 GIG THAT COULD STORE A TON STUFF.....VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE ITEM...
1,This a crappy product. It stopped working after a few months and I lost my data. STAY AWAY!
1,I have had 2 of these they last about a mount before they crap out.will never buy one again
1,When this happens there is no way to write to the drive again.
1,Worked on my laptop but got really hot...will not buy again
1,speed issues like many other one stars reviews mentioned... 30 minutes in Amazon chat and no resolution yet.
1,Bought 256GB. Showed 256GB. Used it to install windows to a different computer and it changed to 32GB.
1,Like other state it overheats and completely fails. data transfer rates slowly go to zero and then it fails
1,Failed after 2 months of use.  Unrecognized on either Windows or Mac OS.
1,its write protected. not able to use it and return it
1,Extremely slow keeps disconnecting poor build quality. Invest 10 more bucks and get a better flash drive.
1,I bought this to use in my dash cam. I end up with corrupt and 0 byte files because it is too slow
1,I bought this disk in September 2018 and it is now 5 months later and it does not work at all.
1,Not working anymoreNo no response to anythingDied for 6 months
1,Stopped working after 6 months. Computer locks up and nothing works while it's connected. Piece of crap.
1,I would not recommend this USB device as it is not reliable! I am now working with them to replace or refund.
1,The fout contact metal strips is too shallow.  There is no electrical contact with the USB slot of the PC.
1,DOESN'T FIT INTO IPHONE WHICH IS WHY I BOUGHT IT.
3,Since I use it for additional media storage on my MacBook I have kept the 256 GB drive plugged into the computer on a almost permanent basis. I recently ejected it and noticed that a piece of the plastic body had cracked off remained lodged in the computer's usb port. After a bit or work I was able to remove the piece in its entirety.Other than that the drive itself has been very reliable and is still functional. I presume the heat from the computer deteriorated the plastic housing on the drive.I'm now in need of more storage and I see Sandisk now has a 512 GB version available. That said I wouldn't risk purchasing it for fear that like the one I presently use part of it might break off in the port which I would be unable to remove.Sandisk appears to be the only company making the bodies of their low profile drives completely out of plastic. Other manufacturers use metal with a plastic grip.
1,Device has only 460 GB and not the advertised 512GB.
1,Worked great for first 5 months. Now cannot be read or be reformatted. Lost all data. Be warned
1,I've literally had this less than a day and it's already busted. Computer doesn't recognize it. Don't waste your money.
1,It detached on my first use.I returned it.
1,Transferred 8 gigs of data onto it and it died.  I couldn't even get the computers to see it so I could re-format it. Threw it in the trash
1,Stopped working after 6 weeks of use just long enough for return window to close.
1,Flimsy plastic. Broke after six weeks (missing the 30 day return window).
1,The USB connector was bent on arrival  rendering the device useless. Very disappointing! Amazon was great with an exchange.
1,Bought in January dead in March.  WIll not accept files or re-format.  Piece of junk
1,This new design is terrible.  The are cheaply made of plastic and break very easily.  When you go to remove them they snap.
1,Purchased this little drive to add some extra space for my laptop. Initially it worked fine but it stopped working abruptly after a month.
1,Stop working after return date. What a waste of money. Used for videos for children in my Escalade.
1,less than 6 months and amazon sez i can't return it! very poor quality product. What do i do now?
1,What else do you need to know?
1,Like many other reviewers I have issues sending files from this unit
1,Product was not the specified storage. Blatant lie on anything above 32GB.
1,Does not write to 4 MB p/s as advertised. I want a refund.
1,Wasn't recognized by my computer and did nothing but get very hot when plugged in.
1,Specifically for Tesla Model 3 Performance this cannot keep up with required write speeds.
1,An absolutely flimsy piece of crap. Never worked. Avoid at all costs.
1,Don't but it is so hot after moderate use
1,Not what I ordered at all. The picture shows a very small thumb drive and I got a large one.
1,Almost 6 months exactly and it failed already.  You get what you pay for I guess.
1,This was great and now not so great.
1,Quit working after a few months of working. 😡😡😡 What a piece of junk.
1,In addition to the plastic cracking it ran very slow (NOT 3.0) and failed within 8 months.
1,I had brought this for friend.....
1,The computer could not recognize the drive anymore after a month of use.
1,Only works for a couple of months then got alone overheating and never work back
1,I don’t recommend. Not easy to use!
1,Data transfer speed is very low. Incompatible with tesla3 requirements.
1,Paid for 256 GB flashdrive maximum storage is 233 GB on the unit I received that's a major difference.
1,It is only 120GB you will loss 8GB
1,It was supposed to a 128G. I got 114G of space. Not happy at all!!!
1,I bought a 256GB BUT WHEN I PLUG IN TO MY COMPUTER?  IT SAYS 31.9GB!!!  WTF SANDISK?  ARE YOU ROBBING ME??
1,Product died after 6 months. Was great until then.
1,No good. Less than two weeks. Now it’s writing super slow
1,This product isn't as advertise... it was supposed to be 128gb but only shows 30gb
1,Plugged it in and it thinks it's a DVD player asking to ck disk
1,What a waste of money $57.00 and all I got was 1 year
1,broken after 15 removal.... 4 months of use... see picture.
1,This product was dead on arrival.
4,The flash drive is more then good enough for what I want. Nice compact drive easy portability the 2 issues are related to size it gets rather warm and will slow down the other is harder to get out of my laptop not a big issue tho and is kinda expected.
1,Counterfeit?  I purchased 128GB and received on 32GB.
1,Failed completely within 1 month. First time a SanDisk product has ever failed. Quite disappointed.
1,The connection point is made of very thin plastic that breaks with the slightest bit of pressure.
1,Worked great until it died. Thankfully I back it up daily but won't be buying another one.
1,I have never had a failure of a SanDisk product.  I bought this 256Gbyte USB drive in February and it failed today.
1,Broke after 8 months of use in my car. Causes my computer to crash
1,Does not work for a PS4 buyer beware
2,Everything is pretty much as advertised so I can't give it one-star but what a bad design. It gets extraordinarily hot with basic use and the plastic shell is so prone to breaking mine didn't last 2 weeks without the top half breaking off.
1,Never worked not even once
1,Does not work after 2-4 time of it's use
1,It worked for three months and quit. Can’t rely on that.
1,Lamentable pesimo usado barato sin protección se calienta demasiado y quema el puerto USB no tiene los 128 GB solo tiene 114 ni una marca barata de china es tan mala como está.Esto es SanDisk y Amazon. Una vergüenza.
1,waste of money. failed after 2 months and runs extremely warm.
1,I finally got around to using it. And when I plugged it in it was 32GB.
1,Transfer speed is ridiculously slow. Unusable for anything. Returned it
1,Plastic construction caused drive to fail leaving it stuck in my computer
1,unrecognizable on windows and maccomplete waste of money and time
1,died recently and lost lots of data
5,AAA.......
1,Format doesnt work properly in my device
1,Less the one year stop working
1,Complete garbage. Failed after 6 months and lost all data. Do not buy.
1,Quit working 3 months after purchase.
1,Overheats when using in my car. Plastic usb connector. Returned.
1,229 GB available on a 256 GB thumb drive---before putting anything on it? NONSENSE. Another Western Digital flop piece of technology!
1,Flash drive failed after first use. Windows asked to reformat and only had option for 32GB.
1,After 6 months this pendrive dosen't work
1,Stop working in 2 month very  Disappointed
1,VERY slow writes. Cannot keep up.
1,Does not hold up
1,What was received was not what was advertised or what the package claimed.
1,Died after 2 weeks
1,Stopped working
1,Sold by: Amazon.com Services Inc Refused to change
1,it quit working
1,WILL NOT FORMAT TO NTFS!
1,I trusted SanDisk as a reliable brand and I am disappointed. All my data is gone.
1,stopped working after around 4 months of use in my nvidia shield tv
1,Wouldn't work with Mac OS 10.11 or 10.13.  Couldn't format with Mac Disk Utility.
1,USB locks into protected mode after usage. Unreliable!
1,Dead already after one month.
1,While the disk itself functions the storage is not adequate. See attached images.
1,Trash
1,Only works one month
1,This is by far the worst external device I have ever purchased!
3,I have an older Mac. It's 10 years old. I wanted to offload some photos to make room and it came to be about 140 GB. So i thought i would get one of these little USB things figuring it would be enough.It's SO SLOW!!!!!! I mean REALLY slow. To do this 140GB it took 15 hours. Not good enough to be honest.I should've just got an external HD thru FireWire. I think I will do that anyway.
1,sony will not recognize USB
1,Edit: only reading 63.6GB
1,Way too slow as storage for Nvidia Shield Tv!
1,Not actually 128gb. Counterfeit I guess.
5,I bought this USB specifically for its extremely small size — the USB is as small as a wireless mouse receiver which is around the size of a quarter. Although I wasn't getting phenomenal results from uploading and downloading (probably as a result of throttling due to excessive — and I mean EXCESSIVE — heat) it got the job done for storing small files. Comes with SanDisk Vault software like most of the brand's other USBs.
1,Most of it is plastic and it breaks was.
1,It has a capacity lower than 8 Gb.
1,Died after two months
1,Died within a few months
5,I like these little drives. I do not move them around much mainly an additional 100 gigs of fast storage each. I use one of them for maybe 10 gigs a day and have never had any problems with either of them.It is odd to see so many reviews that try to make something look bad. If something was truly bad I would shout it from the rooftops. I do not test to destruction I merely like the easy freedom they offer.A good buy from my viewpoint.
1,no llega aún el producto
1,COUNTERFEIT
1,Having problems on copying large amount of data.
5,It is so small like a tiny USB dangle. Works fine. Speed is slow compare to a SSD. Glad for backing up pics and files.
1,WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,really disappointed for a company like sandisk don't hav there items in packages
3,Haven't used this for files yet so I can't speak to performance but I'm not pleased with the thin and flimsyplastic used for the insert end.  I mean it will probably be ok if you are careful when plugging this drive in and out but it feels really cheap and doesn't inspire confidence in its durability. I have an older Ultra Fit flash drive by Sandisk made from metal and it's great. Was it really necessary to switch to a plastic casing? C'mon Sandisk what were you guys thinking?
5,Plug in and go. Not bulky and backup no matter where you are.
5,Bought it for my blink camera module... works great... love the small size!
1,Plastic connection easy to brake.
4,I just needed a general purpose flash drive and this was a good price. I actually bought two of them.What I noticed is the speeds are not very consistent. I think they must get rather hot when writing to them.In doing short benchmarks I can average about 126MB/s read and 46MB/s write. If using bigger sizes for benchmarks the scores are all over the place. Reads will be around 122Mb/s and write speeds about 16MB/s.  When transferring a 3GB video file from a fast and modern computer I can only write to it at about 26MB/s at first than slows to about 13MB/s. On the other flash drive same model it is about 10MB/s faster on the writes. But.... when transferring a 3GB video file from the flash drive they both get a very fast speed of about 260MB/s. These speeds are from a USb 3.1 gen 1 port. I used my USb 3.1 gen 2 port and for some reason the read speed from transferring the video file was at the rated 130MB/s. I don't know why it was slower on a USB 3.1 Gen 2 port. Anyways for the low price I still think this is a good deal if you need a decent and small flash drive.
5,Arrived on time works great and at a fantastic price!
4,It's teeny-tiny which is nice (I've got enough behemoths in my bag...).BlackMagic reports write speeds around 60MB/s and read speeds around 130MB/s on my 5k iMac.  The write speeds degrade a bit as you keep running write cycles on it but generally each cycle will get up around 60MB/s.It does get very hot when you write a bunch to it but the new composite material seems to help it cool down faster.  I do worry that the composite material might fail especially when plugging it into multiple hubs and I do wish SanDisk had continued to include the little sleeve that slid over the older metal ones (and no they don't fit on these).I suggest these more for "write occasionally read often operations".  I use them for storing music pictures & movies while traveling.  I also suggest you put a lanyard on it to help keep track of it and store it in a case of some sort to keep crumbs lint and such from getting into it.  That would muck it up in a hurry...
5,I use a 512gb one to store and play backwards compatible games on Xbox One as well as smaller simpler Xbox One games (games <10gb) and it has worked great can't even tell it's not running from the internal drive.
4,This device is small(the size of my thumb nail)  and there is no hole for attaching to key chain or tether.Might be easy to lose but is password protected.There is no LED to indicate data transfer as on some flash drives.
4,Got this for my Tesla Model 3. Very sleek looking and compact. Works great for the dash cam and sentry mode on the Tesla Model 3.It does have the option for securing the USB with encrypted password protection. I don’t use it for this purpose but is a good idea if you need that.
1,I stored a bunch of pictures I can't replace' in it to free up storage in a MacBook Air. I have tried to open the drive to retrieve a few pictures and it will not open. In fact it does not even show up on my Mac. I have sent 3 or 4 emails to SanDisk  to see what I can do and they haven't even replied. I even had Best Buy's Geek Squad try to open it and they said something must be faulty in the flash drive because it won't open for them either. Now I have several unreplaceable pictures on a faulty flash drive.Their customer service stinks. I guess once someone has purchased a product from them that doesn't work too bad. SanDisk? Never again.
4,I consistently get 60Mb/s writing and 130Mb/s reading. It is not fast as what USB 3 can supports (I can even get 130/130 out of seagate external hard drive and 300/300 from external SSD) but much more faster than USB 2.0 flash  drives that you may be fooled into buying if not paying attention to the fine print. I will use it mainly for music files to be played in my cars hence its plastic constructing may not be a big draw back.
1,Dangerously hot.  Never ever boot a raspberry pi off of this device.  It runs way too hot and seems to raise the raspi usb input structure above a safe temp. The San Disk plastic case definitively feels above threshold of pain 135F.  SanDisk did not respond to request for temp monitoring method.  It may not monitor its own temp.  This thing will never be connected to my raspi again.
4,I wanted something small that I could keep on my key-chain for easy use when needed. This fits the bill except for one issue. It comes with no ring to put on your key-chain. It would be nice if it was included. If even a small loop ring. Other than that a bit disappointed that it was plastic and not full metal. I haven't attempted it but with my other 3.1 drives when I transfer huge files I get some heat build up.
4,Material and durability are 4/5. It's the smallest flash drive i've ever owned so it's portable. I would probably only recommend this for a device you plan to leave this in for vs a flash drive you carry around with you since it can easily be lost given how small it is.In terms of performance excellent. Write speed is quick although it does take some time to and playing around with for my macbook to read it with an external usb-c extension.
1,My 128GB version came formatted exFAT which is fine for my purposes. It comes with a few hundred k of utilities. I started by copying four folders worth of large files using TeraCopy on Windows. The first thing I noticed was that it was painfully slow. I let it go.I've been trying to copy 96GB worth of large files of around 4-6GB each. After filesystem overhead the 114GB of available space should handle that right? Nope. It reached about 70GB copied and then stopped due to insufficient space on the target drive. Hm. I tried to copy a single smallish file (there was plenty of space available or there should have been) and no go. Not enough space. Using MiniTool Partition Wizard I checked the layout. There should be plenty of space.I tried wiping out the exFAT partition and tried a few other filesystems. All the same result. I tried it in several USB ports on different hubs. Eh. Forget it.I'm sure this isn't typical but I recommend avoiding this drive. I've had excellent results with similar models by Samsung & PNY.The copyAfter a long while
4,128 GB model:Writing 15+ GB starts at: 65 MB/s.  20 seconds in the transfer slowed to 30 MB/s then to 15 MB/s for the remainder of the write.Reading started at 128MB/Sec and only after 1 min dropped to 117MB/s.I included pictures from my Flir showing how the drive heats up so hot you can see it radiating through the USB hub.Note: Data transfer tests on Microsoft Surface Book II.
4,PROs:- Reasonable fast drive (about half as fast as my Sandisk Extreme-USB stick)- Cheap (about 1/3 the cost of the Extreme)- Tiny (1/8 the size of the extreme)CONs:- Cheap all-plastic construction makes it a poor choice for frequent use/carrying- Slowdowns reported on large transfersBest suited for:- Cheap fast USB boot drive (where it will remain largely untouched)- Cheap small archive storage
4,Bought two of these for use as media music file storage for my cars...they are small enough that the little USB cover flaps close and seal over the entire drive.  Both read at around 100MB/s on CrystalDisk 64 bit Windows 7 and write between 5-9MB/s sequential with a 500MB test.  I would have done a longer test but testing a 5MB/s read speed drive is painfully slow.
5,I never read any reviews on these Ultra Fit flash drives until today. I've purchased 5 128 GB and 3 256 GB over the past year. I have yet to have a single problem with any of them. I load them up with movies and pass them off to family and friends. I don't understand the negative comments about the speed. I have 2.0 64GB scandisk and these 3.1 are more than twice as fast. For instance I can load a 10 gb movie in about 20 mins. The 2.0 would take me a few hours. Is 10 GB in 15-20 minutes slow? maybe to me pretty fast. I like the fact that they are the size of a nickle. I can't tell you how many of those larger ones i broke because they are always in the way. You don't even know these ultra fit are plugged in. Very convenient if your tv usb port can't accommodate those big ones.
5,Small. Stays in tight fast has loop for keychain or what i did  you can see in photos i uploaded . I added a zipper extender there cheap and may go by another name. Makes it so i can use a latch in my laptop bag without it getring lost when not in use.  Im sick and didn't feel like looking for my wallet or coins so i used a lighter for size comparison. Im not well stomach issues and all treatment has me foggy so i hope this is understandable and not confusing. SanDisk has been hit or miss with me and about 4 months with this using it daily it seems fine. Take care and be safe during this pandemic everyone.
1,My old jump drive (a 64gb Kingston DataTraveler with a rugged rubber casing which has been one of my favorite and sturdiest jump drives) has recently started having the casing crack in the back and though it still works I have been looking into getting a new one for daily use in order to not risk the casing coming off completely. Since 128gb drives are only $20 about the same price as my 64gb drive when I bought it a few years ago I have been looking at 128gb drives. There's not too many capped drives available which I prefer and so my choices were either one of those drives where the connector was pushed out via a slide on top (something I had a number of years ago and found the connector eventually wouldn't stay out well enough for you to push it into a USB port) and a capless drive normally in a small form factor like this. I decided to try this capless drive and I quickly regretted it. There are three main reasons:1. I had read that these "low profile" drives can get very hot. According to the store associate this was only an issue when transferring very large amounts of files at once. However I found it getting quite hot after only spending a little bit of time in the USB port even if I wasn't using it or only transferring less than a gigabyte of data to it. And while I never intend to transfer 50gb+ to the drive at once I may be transferring 10-20gb at once and I didn't think it would hold up without overheating when it was getting so hot already with minimal work being done with it.2. I hadn't realized until I opened it once I got home but the USB connector is made out of plastic. I have seen bodies of USB drives made out of plastic but I can't remember ever owning a drive where the USB connector wasn't made out of metal. The plastic connector seemed very weak and I greatly worried about it breaking with frequently removing it from USB ports. I now know to avoid plastic USB connectors in the future.3. Lastly it seemed very difficult to insert it and remove it from USB ports. This was partly due to the fact that the plastic connector seemed very tight when inserting it into a USB port. This may have adjusted over time with more use of the drive but another part was due to the fact that it was so tiny. While it does curve up on the end presumably to give you a little handle to grip to help you remove the drive it is still much more difficult to remove than a regularly sized drive. I also sometimes use my drives with my PS4 and it was so short and the hook part so soon that the hook collided with the edges around the PS4's USB ports before the drive was fully inserted making it impossible to use with the PS4 and any other computers with a significant lip over the USB ports. Thus this drive seems impossible to insert on some computers and difficult to insert and remove on all others.Given these I was very unhappy with the drive so I took it back to the store and luckily I was able to return it still. I can't recommend this drive at all and after my experience with it for only a few days I will now be avoiding drives with plastic USB connectors as well as "low profile" drives. I recommend finding a full-sized drive with a metal USB connector even if it is a capless one (which after owning this drive I did find that some USB-A-to-USB-C connectors I had seemed to work well as "caps" for capless drives). I have purchased a 128gb PNY drive to replace this and while I am still debating about keeping it (the plastic body doesn't seem very durable and I think rubber and/or metal bodies for jump drives are better) I still greatly prefer it and find it much more durable than this drive. I recommend skipping this one and finding a larger sturdier drive.
3,but not multiple times. Also too small too use as portable.
4,Excelente al momento de usarlo la velocidad y la capacidad que tiene para su tamaño y precio es algo que se debe destacar. Solo hubo algo que no me agrada mucho y es que se calienta bastante a la hora de usarlo pero se puede usar con normalidad si no fuera por ese pequeño detalle le doy 5 estrellas.
2,Since it was recommended as a compatible model for Tesla dashcam I bough it for that purpose. After a couple of years it stopped working. As others have noted this device does not stand up to significant use. Dashcams and similar systems are constantly writing data and this drive isn't up to the the task long term.That said it's not especially expensive and it worked consistently until it suddenly failed. And I don't know of a model or brand that I'm sure would last longer. So maybe they just have to be treated as consumable (and make use of the 5-year warranty).
4,This key is working fine but I'm afraid to leave it in the port of the laptop for any length of time as it becomes very hot. Same thing occurs when I use it with another laptop and with my desktop. No idea if this is a design flaw manufacturing issue or something else.
4,It's a little USB with a lot of storage and it's a quality brand.....that's about it!!! The ONLY thing that may be an issue for some people is that it doesn't go into the usb port as flush as I thought it would. Still highly recommended though.
4,Was nervous after seeing pictures of melting in someone's computer however it never overheats in my MacBook Pro 2013. Because of its size you can just leave it plugged in unlike a regular USB drive that sticks out. It really feels like I upgraded my old MacBook Pro.
4,I got two of these at a great price and combined them into a 512GB backup drive using Apple's RAID software. $70 for a 512GB SSD is a great deal if you don't need it to be the fastest available.  They do run warm.
4,The price is good. Also when the flash drive is inserted into the USB port only about 1 cm of plastic sticks out. However this could be a disadvantage because it could get lost easily.Good flash drive for the price.
4,I bought this on prime day because it was very cheap. Looks good. My only concern is that the portion you insert into the computer is all plastic of some sort no metal. No issue so far just a concern.
4,Very small seems quite sturdy. However I'm finding it extremely hard to attach a keychain to it.  Is if the shape of the hole and it's small size. And I'm scared it'll get lost.
4,Great high quality and good shaped (small) USB flash drive with o lot of space. It could be perfect if writing speed was a bit faster. Anyways the best price-to-quality ratio I would say.
4,Great little flash drive. Transfers and read speeds are quick. The drive does get a little warm but nothing crazy. For the price and style its a great buy
4,Works as expected but it is really small - and easy to confuse with usb antenna devices. I put a unique mark on it to distinguish.
4,When attaching it to a port it would either be hard to put in or would get stuck in there.
5,High Storage needed in a small format. Even thou its short it is ok to pull out of slot. Even thou its plastic it doesn't get near as hot as the metal version. I do not go by data base info I go by how these load and unload on MY desktop. In this case its just below super fast which is not a bad thing. I have 1 other brand that are a little faster and 1 that is incredibly faster. But in smaller size. I am very happy with this flash drive It would be Perfect IF IT Had AN L E D Activity flashing bulb that is why they are called Flash Drives Right ? What Happened ?  I depend on the activity light so as not to overload anything. So with new ones without LEDs I have to count. Not fun nor is it precise. Please Bring Them Back !
4,Heats up too much but otherwise good product. I should’ve bought the metal version in hindsight
4,Very small but works great. Find a secure place to store it or it will get lost.
4,Adds a quick extra HDD. It ran a bit hot in my MacBook Air.
4,Good drive at a great price on prime day!
5,Mi Macbook tiene 128gb de memoria y eso me es insuficiente. Necesitaba espacio para alojar mi enorme biblioteca. Tenía varias opciones. Entre ellas aumentar la memoria interna o tenerla fuera. Pero la consulto siempre.Leyendo opiniones encontré esta pequeña unidad de memoria y he resuelto el problema. El programa lo tengo en la unidad de arranque. La biblioteca en la scandisc. Va muy bien es lo suficientemente rápida y es tan pequeña que permanece en la Macbook.Calienta un poco aunque no muchoMás adelante la cambiaré por un ade 256 ya que compré la de 128
4,Worked as expected
1,The item was shipped and sold by Amazon but it ended up in the trash where it belongs! It remained in its package for about two months and worked at first. However after moving some large files it would not work. I tried several tools and methods to get it working again. I was able to format it with a tool listed on a SanDisk support page and write some files but data is lost every time. SanDisk must be paying for the 80k global ratings to pad this listing.SanDisk lost a customer today.
1,That's not good enoughOnly 55 out of 64 GBDoesn't weigh Easy to loose..
5,I bought this for my 2018 Honda Civic and filled it with music.  Over 2K songs in different music category folders. Sure beats the hell out of paying for satellite radio or listening to all those commercials on free radio.  And I still have plenty of room to add more music.
5,I'm a video professional constantly sending huge amounts of footage to clients. Instead of waiting in line at the post office and paying $10+ to ship a hard drive I just format this Sandisk 128GB thumb drive for Mac copy my footage (usually 40-100GB) toss two stamps on an envelope and leave it for my mailman to pick up. Works great!PS - scotch tape this to a business card before you put it in an envelope so it doesn't get lost when your recipient opens it. And give them a heads up that it is TINY. I know from experience these are easy to lose!
5,Great storage capacity and easy to use.
5,Excelente
1,The decision to make the insertable part out of cheap plastic is mystifying.I damaged it just removing it from the (poorly designed tools required) packaging on Day 1.It flexes from light pressure. Doesn't even seem to be a durable plastic. Just why?Write speeds were 30-50 MB/s on a 3.0 port.Pick a better one if you want to use it more than a few times or you might stick it in your pocket or something.
5,I have no complaints about this tiny little drive. It does what I expected of it...and then some! I had accidentally left it in the pocket of my jeans which then went into the hamper then the washer then the dryer before it fell out and got caught at the lint trap before I found it. I just checked and the damn thing still works with ZERO DATA LOSS! That was quite a surprise.
5,I have one of these in every vehicle I drive.  They work great to load up all my music and connect to the USB port of the vehicle.  That way I always have my preferred music to listen to no matter the reception or what's on the radio.  I do have music on my phone who doesn't but this way I can still have music on no matter how I'm using my phone.I've never had a problem with any SanDisk product and don't expect to with these either.
5,This ultra fit size is a great sizeMy brother bought 3 and told me about the San Disk ultra fit flash driveHe said it was easy to use and don’t change the formatBought two for me and my husbandI added all my music library and have over hundreds of albums and hours of music. Price was great and don’t need To pay sirrus xm radio nowAlso has s super fast transfer tooThis is a must to getI am enjoying my new car with quality music 🎶
1,Over the years I have purchased many SanDisk drives and always considered them to be quality products at a fair price.  Saying that the newer SanDisk "Ultra Fit" all plastic drives are a mistake and should be withdrawn from production.I began purchasing "Ultra Fit" drives when they were first introduced and have three drives in 32GB 64GB and 256GB formats.  The 32GB and 64GB had metal connectors but the 256GB (like this one) had the all plastic construction.Recall when I purchased the 256GB in July 2019 that I was surprised with the plastic connector but assumed / trusted SanDisk knew what they were doing ... until it broke in April 2020.When I went back to research purchase date for warranty I pulled up the original listing and noticed many other users had experienced the exact same problem and posted similar photos to mine (Interesting that Amazon listed the 512GB separate from the other capacity sizes?).  Comments were the same...no stress no abuse and then one day when removing the Ultra Fit drive the thin top portion of the connector breaks usually left stuck inside the USB port.  And just like the others I had to use a small thin pick tool to remove the broken shard from the port.SanDisk was responsive in the RMA process emailing a prepaid mailing label...took about 3 weeks to complete the process of returning a new drive.  Bad news is that it is exactly the same as the one that broke meaning that it will likely break too.Fortunately I was still able to download the contents of the drive but who wants to risk losing that much data and going thru the time consuming (and tedium) hassle of moving / reloading to another device.  One other issue is possible damage to the USB port on the laptop.  I now have random problems with another USB drive "disconnecting" from the system when using that port.  Not sure if the problem is in the USB port or the flash drive???  Moved the drive to another port and problem seems solved.Regarding performance I wouldn't consider any of the "Ultra Fit" drives as being stellar but willing to accept for the convenience of the form factor.  Setting aside the all plastic construction the performance of the UltraFit 256GB raises even more questions regarding the usability of the product.Began reloading backup files to the UltraFit 256GB and noticed file transfer seemed exceedingly slow. It was a 25GB folder of large media files averaging 600 - 800MB each.  Although the copy process seemed to start OK the performance of the drive began degrading dramatically after a couple of minutes.  Watching the progress thru the Windows Explorer real time performance monitor there developed a cycle of rapid writes lasting 10 -15 sec perhaps 700-800MB which was then followed by a complete halt for perhaps a minute or more.  Believe this is the result of protective circuitry within the drive that monitors heat perhaps a safeguard required by the plastic construction.  The continuous writes of these long files heats up in the SanDisk drive (which does get hot) the SanDisk drive shuts itself down for a minute or so to cool then resumes the process  writing again for 10-15 seconds and then shuts down again 60-80 seconds repeating the cycle until finally completed (or possibly complete failure if larger data transfers are required).Out of curiosity performed the same file transfer again to the SanDisk UltraFit 256GB a Samsung "Fit Plus" 256GB USB drive (Samsung's offering for a “plug-and-stay” USB drive) and the older SanDisk UltraFit 64GB (probably around 5 years old with the metal connector).  Used the same 25GB folder same USB port with no other activity on the laptop (Win10 I7 CPU 16GB RAM 2TB hard drive).  Here are the timings:SanDisk UltraFit 256GB – 37+ minutes (same cycle of rapid writes then complete halt for 60+ sec)Samsung FitPlus” 256GB – 8.5 minutes – over 4X times fasterSanDisk UltraFit 64GB – 21 minutes – appx 76% fasterAll of this indicates that either the replacement is defective or the design of the all plastic UltraFit is bad.My opinion is that the 256GB or 512GB UltraFit drives are unsuitable for their intended purpose.  After all the reason for getting high capacity drives such as these is to move and manage large amounts of data in a reliable and efficient manner.  Then factor in the questionable build quality and do you really want to risk that much data on a product such as this?To wrap this up I cannot recommend the current SanDisk UltraFit drives especially the higher capacity drives.  I feel that SanDisk is doing its customers a disservice and will ultimately damage its own reputation.  These products need to be withdrawn and reworked.UPDATE 6/18/2020 - Just rec'd replacement of the replacement from SanDisk again took about 3 weeks.  Long story short...same erratic performance as the first.  Write speed is fine for a couple of minutes and then begins to slow down.  After another minute or so started repeating the same intermittent writing pattern of writing data for around 10 seconds and then would suspend operation for a minute or so assuming it is the thermal protective circuitry.  Yes the drive gets very hot after writing may be 4 or 5GB continuously.These might be OK in a 16GB capacity for short bursts of read/write activity for small file transfers but the larger capacity Ultra Fit flash drives are basically useless for storing and managing large amounts of data.  Then taking into account the flimsy construction you just have to shake your head and grit your teeth.  I truly regret buying the Ultra Fit USB flash drives maybe my worst purchase in 2019 .  SANDISK IS SELLING JUNK.
5,I love this ultra sleek flash drive! I bought a few for my Mac's for on the go stuff (Work School Personal). No need to remove as it doesn't get in the way of any thing Fits right into my Laptop Sleeve with no issues and sleek enough it doesn't get caught or bump on anything to damage it. I love this Flash Drive!
5,This thing is tiny! I mean it is perfect for storing a lot of information and just throw it on a keychain and go about your day.
5,Fantastic low profile small form factor USB drive perfect to live in the USB slot and not interfere with a sleeve.Quickly shipped and delivered.
5,I installed Ubuntu 19.04 onto this USB drive and have been using it as a portable system. The IO speeds are pretty sweet it's a very fast drive. It does get pretty hot. I believe this is just due to the small form factor combined with the transfer speeds. It's too soon to speak for its longevity.
5,Bought this to keep on me to back up any/all files off my phone from time to time. Use this via Android phones and Mac desktops without formatting no problems transferring large files.Extra storage is always good to have on handSide note this flash drive at this capacity works with my Pioneer AVH-X5800BHS Unit
5,I purchased this drive to leave plugged into a non powered hub on my work computer.  I have stored private files and music on the drive without any issues.  this computer does not power down much so if it was going to overheat then i would expect it to have already overheated.  there is no scrambling of data and the drive is always accessible.  I will probably buy another one for my laptop at home!
5,Bought this for my boyfriend upon his request. When I showed it to him and gave him the flash drive he told me that it was perfect and serves its purpose. This particular flash drive is SUPER tiny so my advice to everyone is to make sure you can keep track of it somehow because it looks easily misplaceable! Overall very useful and worth the price.
5,My son is attending the Virginia Military Institute and majoring in mechanical engineering and a minor in nuclear engineering. He has a brand new laptop and I wanted to make sure he had enough storage for all his projects and homework. I already use SanDisk SD cards in all my Canon DSLR's and my DJI Phantom and Inspire 1 drones so it was a no brainer to get my son a SanDisk flash drive for his laptop.
5,U can't go wrong with this sandisk i got it hooked up to my fire tv cube 4k.
1,Out of a total of 6 of these I used in a 24x7 but very low usage scenario 4 of them died within a few months. They don't degrade either they just up and fail and are completely unusable from that point onward. Reading reviews I'm not the only one with this problem.Regardless of the reason sometimes you get what you pay for - and this will last you for about as long as it takes you to earn the $9 to replace it.
5,Great little USB drive. It is tiny and works perfectly.
5,It is a good buy
5,Great product used for extra storage in Nivida Shield no issues works great.
5,This thing is tiny! I just leave it in my laptop! Super fast transfer speeds even though I haven't benchmarked it. I just filled it up with 100+ GB of pictures to go through and do basic edits on - and they load fast (unlike my mechanical external I was using)Only thought is maybe I should have bought the 256 :)
5,Plugged it in set it as expandable storage voila.  256gb of videos/music/photos.  Transfers over the wire fairly well. I'm not look for speed demon transfers.  Just set it and walk away.  Does what it's supposed to do.
5,Got this on a great deal and the drive has good performance
5,I liked the original one so much  that I ordered this one.
5,Small has good capacity and works well to backup my laptop
5,5 stars and two thumbs up Excellent
1,The plastic housing of the disc I bought cracked and I need to change it. My 256 Gig sandisk keeps disconnecting. I don't know what to do with it. I'm worried about my files
5,Ready to use but the plastic construction takes a little bit of getting used to. Includes application for securely saving files which isn't really a great user friendly application but does a good job for being a free app. Overall a decent product if you find it cheap.
5,Isn't technology amazing?  128 GBytes and this thing is so small I could easily lose it!I can remember when having 16 kBytes on my computer (a factor of 8 million less!) was a big deal!
5,Another great SanDisk product. It is really small and doesn’t come with a cap. I bought this to plug in to my router as a backup drive. Over a month and everything is running smooth. Speeds are fine and it works 24/7 without overheating.
5,I lost it the first day....
5,I am very happy with product Compact and high speed is what was important to me and this product provides both.
5,Small and fast enough heat a bit but not to be considered a problem. I love the size I can leave it plugged for days without it being in the way or worrying about it bending.
5,Can't beat the price for mp3 in a car this is more than enough. I paid more for a smaller size months ago. great deal on amazon
5,Small great for your car
5,So far so good. Formatted this to VFAT and using as cross platform storage and server storage. I can swap it around to/from my Mac and Windows machines then leave it in my Linux server without issue or reformat.
5,No issues with this rapid and easy uploads!
5,It's about the size of your thumb nail.. so I put a key chain on it as it'd be very easy to lose. But it's size make it very discrete...
5,I'm happy with this. In my experience these device are great up until they fail. I've had one for about a year and bought a 2nd about a month ago. Both are working fine and it gets moderately use.
5,I guess that's good for hiding it from snoopers. But if you aren't careful and keep it in something larger you might lose it easy. I put it in an old mints tin.
5,No problems so far. It reads and writes well and it seems cooler to the touch than the previous metal Ultra Fit. Very small profile allows for me to leave it in my laptop and take it  on the go.
5,This drive is tiny which means I can keep it plugged in all the time and not even notice it which effectively doubles the storage on my Macbook Air. Highly recommended.
5,Works great and holds lots of stuff. It is SUPER small which is good but be careful not to misplace it. I'm very happy with these and would buy them again...although I have not tested them over time yet.
5,Very nice and tiny USB drive that holds a lot! My only complaint is how it's made of thin plastic. I am worried if it possibly breaking so I am extra careful when plugging/unplugging it.
5,excelente inversión
5,Works perfect.  Exactly what I needed for my running out of storage laptop.  I plug in and it stays with my laptop securely.  If you need additional storage for your laptop this is an instant solution.
5,A tiny package but with a big storage. So small very convenient  with huge storage you can save almost anything in super small memory usb card.
5,I use this to backup my music so far less than 256gb. The drive is left plugged into my iMac and is always handy to add new music.
5,Love the amount of space on this thing I use it for my files/pictures. SanDisk never disappoints love their products.
5,Extremely compact. Transferred all my old SDs onto it and use it as extra storage on a microPC
5,Nice and slim/low profile drive. I can leave it attached to my laptop all the time if I do not want to unplug it.
5,Great form factor got it on sale. Write speeds are superb. It's a little warm (120°F~135°F) even in passive use though.
5,Writes much faster than i expected it to. Way faster than my laptop writes large files to my usb2 device. Incredibly tiny. Love it.
5,It really is tiny and light. Store plenty of pictures and video clips. I sometimes forget that is is being plugged in to my laptop.
5,Excelente calidad
5,This flash drive is amazing. Very compact size and extremely fast. I used this drive in my double din car stereo and it operates smoothly.
5,Good so far
5,Amazing flash drive with great speedBut very small  easy to loose it
5,I use this as an extra drive on my netbook. Works great.
5,Great small form factor thumb drive with a good sized capacity.
5,Great product! It’s so portable and it has so much memory! Totally pleased.
5,I like it. As described and trouble-free
5,Slim profile. Works well. Large storage capacity.Never had any heating issues with it plugged into my cars stock stereo.
3,I purchased 2 of these and both failed within a year.  I was using them in my Teslas to store dashcam video -- admittedly automotive environments are harsh and the SanDisk warranty excludes automotive use but I have overheat protection enabled in both of our cars which keeps the interior temperature from getting too extreme so this is not like a typical automotive environment.  I replaced with Samsung FIT Plus which is holding up fine so far.
5,It works very well Ive had no problems with it.
5,As described no issues.
5,......and plays flawlessly in my wife's Toyota Highlander sound system!!
5,As advertised.
5,great small package with huge 256G capacity.
5,Good products
5,Cute. Almost unnoticeable when attached to laptop.
5,Works great use ot for my OTG ubuntu system
5,Amazing 256gb in such a small form factor. Very pleased faster than expected delivery too.
5,Works great and its fast.
3,This is a USB 3.0 drive (256gb model) but file write is unreliable it starts copying (120 video files each around 170mb) at 60mb/s then couple of secs later it drops to 0 stays there a couple of seconds then climb to 15mb/s but can't retain there jumping up and down to 0 to 20 mb/s. If you just copy some files to the drive and let them stay there it serves that purpose. But if you plan to transfer your photos from the memory card of your camera to this card on the field you need to wait for a long time. I brought two of them to a photo trip but I ended up copying my files to a hard drive which allowed me to copy at 100mb/s consistently.
5,Nice small size for backups!
5,I love cheap storage!  And SanDisk is a great brand!
5,Works great as a storage expansion for my GPD Win 2.
5,Excellent
5,Perfect!! Small and lightweight
5,Works as it should.  Very small.
5,Práctica y de gran capacidad
5,Good price would buy again just as described.
5,So far working great
3,I love its compact design. Wanted something for the Pioneer deck in my car. It's easy to use can definitely hold all the songs I want but only one thing seriously disappoints me. The fact that the part you insert into the USB port (put an arrow just to make sure you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about) is PLASTIC. Would it have killed them to make something of a higher quality by making it metal instead? I'm sure it's gonna eventually crack and I'll have to look for another drive. I'll know better next time.
5,Handy easy to use backup.
5,Good Product!  Good Quality!  Great Price!
5,Good quality. Works great
5,Great portable fast
5,Excellent compact and works great
5,Great small profile.
5,Nice & fast
5,Good
2,I got one of this in March 2019 now the plastic housing is broken. Not recommended.
3,Good speed small. It heats up enough even on short usage to be painful to touch. Will look for another devide that doesn't suffer this issue.
1,This device is poorly designed. It is not low profile and sticks out of your device by ~1cm (between 9 and 10mm). Because it hangs out so far and has a big lip for a lanyard it is very easy to lose in the day-to-day (I had it pop out while removing my laptop from my bag). Furthermore the shape of the plastic is tapered instead of squared so if you drop your device and it lands on the drive the drive will ream into your USB port and kill it which happened to me today.SanDisk should make / you should buy a drive that has a square end on it. That way if your device is dropped the load of the fall is transferred to the device case instead of the USB port. If you look at the GALAXY of products there has to be a proper FIT.The form factor makes it both easy to lose and prone to breaking USB ports which are two critical end-points when it comes to the design of this type of product.
3,The indicated capacity is misleading. Even if we consider 1 GB = 1000000 bytes this drive has only 61 GB free space. Calculating with 1 GB = 1024 MB the real capacity is just a little over 57 GB.Otherwise it works fine but I expected to have 64000000 bytes space available not 3 GB less.
3,With all my other usb thumb drives the part that plugs in is metal - but this one is plastic. Every time I plug it in it 'feels' like it's going to break/crack/split as I'm plugging it in. I plan to only buy usb thumb drives with metal plug-in part in the future! (would not buy these again)
3,Picked one up recently to use instead of hauling around a portable SSD.The pros: It's tiny and holds data. It also doesn't get as hot as other devices.The cons: It's kinda slow and the plastic is flimsy.Great for storage and if you want to leave it in place. Not so great if you need to transfer files at super speeds or constantly plug/unplug the device.
3,These drives are 3.1 and 128gb.  But there is no writing on the unit saying so.  I prefer the metal ones much better.  They had laser inscribed on one side the size and speed.  These are just blank other than "Sandisk".  Sandisk please go back to the metal casings or inscribe some info on these.
3,I have no problem with the performance of these devices however if you attach it to a key ring as I did be very careful.  The plastic at the top can break and you could easily lose the device.  Luckily when mine broke it was in my pocket and I did not lose it.
3,Worked well together I lost it.....
2,As others have said this drive heats up quite a bit and is doing damage to the NAND chip. While this is a USB 3.1 UASP drive it gets so hot in the first 10 seconds of any writing that the transfer speed drops from 500MB/s to 100MB/s or lower effectively making the fact that this is a USB 3.1 UASP drive irrelevant. The housing is flimsy and cheap and will break easily enough over time. It is a good choice if you're looking just to store innocuous data for cheap but DO NOT use this drive if you are handling data that is sensitive or you cannot afford to lose. There is much better alternatives out there for relatively the same price.Overall for SanDisk this is not of the quality that SanDisk usually strives for and is very underwhelming compared to the competition in the same price range. I would recommend you select another drive because this one is going to fail on you very quickly.
3,Fast but gets really warm..UPDATE:Set it up as a virtual drive for a virtual machine. It got so hot it would crash. I guess I'll just use it for storage. Downgraded to 3 stars.
3,Not doing anything to the flash drive just being plugin still extremely hot however after unplugging the flash drive cool down really fast.Total disk space is 122991935488 bytes(122Gb) not really 128Gb
2,I bought one of these from Office Depot off eBay and was profoundly disappointed with the write speed performance.Speedwise this thing literally performs worse than my USB 2.0 Samsung Cruzer of the same storage capacity while writing. As I write this it is copying 100GB of MP3 files at rates ranging between 700KB/sec and 3.5MB/sec. The USB 2.0 Cruzer would consistently move closer to 5MB/sec. I began around 8pm and it won't be done before I go to bed tonight. Total estimated time is over 12 hours so by this math it would take you a whole entire 24 hour day to fill this drive with music.You might ask yourself if I'm using a 2.0 port but I assure you I'm not. Just this morning I was copying the exact same files from the exact same source in the exact same fashion to a Western Digital USB 3.0 HDD at 25MB/sec on the same port. I assumed from the product description that this would be faster but I was profoundly disappointed and you will be too.If you want to buy a cheap thumb drive buy a 2.0 drive for half the price. This thing is SLOW!Upside? It's small and has a high capacity. I have yet to determine reliability but I doubt Samsung would sell me something that corrupted my data like some cheap Chinese piece of garbage.
2,I have been a huge fan of the SanDisk Ultra Fit line for years. They are tiny and hardly noticeable in a laptop fast enough very easy to use and have always offered close to the max in terms of storage capacity.But the last generation is VERY fragile. When the first one broke I thought I'd been clumsy or gotten a defective one. I ordered a second one and it broke too. Now the third one just broke in exactly the same way!!! I do move them around a lot but I'm not rough on them and have in particular gone out of my way to be gentle with the third one.The metal version of this was amazing - I had one for years and it never broke.
2,I bought two of these to use for temporary storage and moving files between machines (sneaker net.) I left them plugged in for months and eventually they just stopped working one a couple of months after the other. Other reviews have talked about some safety mode and maybe that is what happened. They do get hot and without a metal housing the conduction of heat to the frame of the PC is minimal. I think I will stick to conventional thumb drives.
1,Completely stopped working after a couple months of use with sentry mode. I can’t even reformat it. It won’t show up on the computer. Pretty sure it’s fried.
1,Bought one of these for my wife to use in her new MacBook Air as it was much less expensive than springing for the larger internal storage. Big mistake. It was flaky from the first week but I could never put my finger on what was happening. On multiple occasions it would go into a read-only mode and only rebuilding the directory with a professional disk utility would "unlock" it only to have it get corrupted again a few days later. Finally noticed today after pulling it out of her laptop to put into my Mac Pro to rebuild the directory yet again that it was warm to the touch. Not unusual but when I held onto it for a little longer I noticed it was actually HOT to the point of nearly burning my skin. Let it cool down then rebuilt the directory. Started backing it up to another drive and it locked up again. Pulled it out and again it was dangerously hot. Seems like any even slightly prolonged data transfer will overheat it to the point of failure so I'll have to back up the files a few at a time. Have an RMA from SanDisk for it but I could never trust a replacement to not do the same thing so essentially it's $50 shot. You won't catch me buying SanDisk again. Lesson learned.UPDATE: I was finally able to complete backing up the contents by plugging it into a USB 2.0 port. Seems like USB 3.x is overtaxing it. Kinda defeats the purpose of having 3.x capabilities.
2,i bought the 256gb version of this.  didn't take long before the plastic housing cracked on top.  i now have to gingerly insert and remove the drive in the hope of not making it worse.  it's still functional for now but no doubt it will eventually break to where it's unusable.  i wrote customer support and they offered to evaluate it for replacement but you have to pack up your drive and send it in for evaluation before they make a choice to either send it back or give you a new one.  bottom line i will not be buying a sandisk drive anymore.  if you look at the samsung low-profile drives they are made with a metal housing.  that's what you want.
2,This flash drive appeared to have everything needed for use with the Tesla Dashcam and it worked great for a little while. Then 2 months in I started getting errors that the drive write speed was too slow. This would only appear intermittently. Finally 3 months in the drive failed completely. It no longer will be recognized in ANY device let alone the vehicle. I think this drive would have been ok for some basic file transportation on occasion but definitely does not work for high extended use like continually writing video files to it.
2,I have the 256gb. Not the most reliable. Already starting to fail. I transfer large video files to this USB to save storage on my laptop for video editing. When I tranfer large files it gets very hot and eventually stop transferring altogether. Now some of the folders are corrupted. I had a Samsung one before and it worked well. I think if you use this to store small files you should be fine.
1,I had the product 4 months when write protection was for some reason activated.  Its a "safety feature"  in case of possible damage the device will permanently write protect so you can recover the files.  But you cant delete either.  I have proprietary documents on mine that means even if they had some warranty i could not use it.  Kinda garbage if you ask me.  I take of making appropriate back ups myself dont lock a device in a forever state because something may be wrong.  It sat plugged into the same 3d prrinter raspberry pi the entire 4 months before magicaly locking up.Other than that it was fast had lots of space was cheap tiny and ran relatively cool.
2,Quality should be good because it is SanDisk. (Loss of data in a Samsung device is not a question of if but when). The picture looks so big and you get the impression you can manage to get this in a keychain ring. But you will be disappointed and it is so tiny. Tiny is good but not for use with keychain.
1,I'd seen other reviews where users indicated that their drive went bad but i chose to ignore them since SanDisk in general is the de facto standard in portable flash memory.  I thought this Ultra Fit was my ticket to expanding my Mac's internal 256GB SSD -- and I used it as such. Unfortunately not two months later I fired up the Mac and received a message that the disk could not be read and it asked to be initialized.  I chose to ignore the option to initialize but the drive never mounts.  I can't even run any disk recovery tools on it since it won't mount.  I loved it for a couple of months -- but now I'm hating life because I was using this external drive as my backup and unfortunately wasn't backing it up to the cloud.  I'd like to say "my bad" but I can't -- because I purchased this from San Disk and they have one job -- keep the data reliable.
2,This is amazingly small and for that reason only I will keep it but it falls 52GB short of stated capacity and it gets really hot without even being read or written too.  If you write to the drive at full USB 3.0 it heats up fast and being all plastic that's sketchy.  It works but I only use it as a read only drive in an all metal USB port for cooling.
1,Although reading from this drive was faster than previous devices writing to this drive resulted in a low unstable transfer rate. Most of the time it is well below 10MB/s.The initial formatting on this drive WILL cause problems on older devices. It caused my Wii to crash repeatedly. It looks like reformatting to FAT32 with guiformat solved that problem but I am still looking at a 7 hour wait to write 250GB of data.So USB 3.1 is blatant false advertising. Read times are barely 3.0 compliant and I get better write times on 5 year old devices.Writing at a very unstable 5-15 MB/s is just not acceptible for a current gen flash drive. Not sure if it is broken or just a bad design but it is going back and I am trying another brand.
2,It looks very cool and discreet since it’s so small. However since it’s so small it gets very extremely hot quick. You don’t even have to use it and it gets hot. And it’s a bit hard to unplug from my ps4 but im sure not everyone will use it for their ps4. I ordered two other usbs from San disk in order to see which is best
1,Drive failed after VERY light use. Backed up some music and home videos now says "drive write protected" and have tried multiple different methods (command line regedit etc) none work. Drive is locked. Garbage e-waste device.
1,Failed in 2 months with write protect error and even "diskpart > attributes disk clear readonly > clean" fails to fix it.  When it was working it was sooooo slow.  USB 2.0 speed slow.  Comes formatted in exFAT the slowest method that is compatible with all machines.  I suggest the first thing you do is reformat as NTFS.  Perhaps that may have prevented the failure.My second one failed within 2 months.  Although SanDisk is shown as works with home router for file sharing the SanDisk customer service stated it does not.  So I am using the flash drive in the computer and it gets sooooo hot.  I fear it will damage my laptop.  This is just a poorly designed flash drive and SanDisk should offer a better replacement.  You can't trust it to store your data.
2,The specified capacity of 256GB is not true. The actual capacity of the drive is less than that. My flash drive has total capacity of 249986547712 bytes. See the picture.
1,SanDisk was such a solid company that I always trusted and paid even more to be safe I don't understand how WD such a solid company can produce such garbage.  As soon as I got the flesh memory 128GB i tested it to see if indeed it is such a disaster. It is. I copied 50GB of files as back up to the flesh memory suddenly all directories disappeared except for one. So now I am stuck i can't return it as I can't see my files to delete them before returning the memory. But i can't use it as it is not a safe backup. How a good company like WD which I have great experience with their hard drive and cloud drives could do so badly with flesh memory they purchased from SanDisk. I am quite puzzled.
2,I can write much faster to my Scandisk 64GB Cruzer Fit (the previous version made of metal and has a plastic case covering it but the same size). I'm pretty disappointed with the speeds and the cheap plastic housing. By the previous version of the Fit.. this thing is junk.) 14 mins to copy 5 GB in exFAT what a joke. copied the same file to my external SATA in under 4 mins.
1,This seems like a pretty common problem in these reviews.  My drive experienced some kind of error and became read-only.  For me I formatted the drive to ExFat first on my Mac.  Then I tried to back up a few gigs the process took an unusually long time and eventually failed.  I unplugged and replugged my drive in only to find that the data is still available but I can no longer write to the drive.SanDisk seems to acknowledge this problem.  You can search "Write Protect Error on USB Flash Drives" in their support page and find a link to replace your drive.  You'll need a copy of your receipt though.  For me it was a gift so I have no receipt.  Looks like I'm out of luck.
1,File copy is fast for a short while then slows down tremendously. The circuits are overheating internally causing this.The other part of the heat issue is the cheap plastic housing. The heat breaks it down slowly. In a few months the drive literally splits in two and if you’re unlucky you have a chunk of plastic inside your laptop that can’t be pulled out.Terrible performance and physical design.
1,Died after just a few months in a almost read only usage.I was using it for storage of reference material and first noticed that several of my text files had changed to read only.Shortly after that it died taking my files with it.File manager just hangs on this drive.I have many flash drives and this is the first one that stabbed me.I am NOT happy
1,TL;DR - Poor quality drive got fully corrupted after only a month. A bunch of people seem to have the same problem in the reviews.I was hesitant to buy this product after reading a bunch of reviews where this drive failed on people after a short period of time but decided to buy it anyway. Unfortunately after only about 4 weeks the drive got corrupted while transferring over some files. I spent almost over an hour trying to fix this (including in the terminal) and nothing worked. The drive did get very hot when I was using it too but I don't know if that played a part in the drive failing. This is my 2nd SanDisk drive to fail on me in the past couple years causing me to lose everything on them. I hear they're a reputable brand which is why I gave them another shot but will avoid them in the future.
2,Looks like it could be a great product..... However it is not a standard size for a USB 3.1/3.0 port and does not work with any of my current devices that support USB 3.1/3.0.  The picture makes it look bigger than it is.  It is really tiny and not standard.  Maybe I should have known by the Ultra Fit.  It was an Amazon prime special and looked like a good price.  If only I had a device it worked with.  If you purchase this make sure you have one of these mini USB 3.0/3.1 ports.
1,The storage and price are great...if it lasts. Unfortunately mine didn't. After less than a year of regular use it has failed. I'll be attempting to have it replaced through the warranty but I would expect much better from this product and the hassle of warranty replacement isn't even worth it to most. Don't trust sensitive documents to this drive.
2,The speed on this gets slower and slower and it's already 5 times slower than the Samsung MUF-128AB/AM FIT Plus 128GB - 300MB/s USB 3.1 Flash Drive .I purchased this for a video game emulator and this drive takes forever and has greatly inconsistent speeds. I did not see this issue at all with the Samsung drive.
1,Great low profile.  Can leave in-port on my work laptop.  BUT because it's trash it appears and disappears every couple of milliseconds with Event 51 in system log.  Windows 10Pro issue?  Don't know.  Don't care.  This is the second iteration of the ultra fit to fail.  The previous one just physically came apart.  Jeeeez.And Sandisk likes to play games with RMA--"maybe we will maybe we won't"-type games.11/26.  Finally fixed by deleting trans logs and using fsutil--search online for solution.--nope. lasted all of 2 reboots.  oh well.
1,where to start not only does it get hot it rarely works. it does not mount frequently and when it does it is so slow it is useless. avoid it and get something better... you will spend over an hour to copy a 2G file... and then it will take several attempts to get it to mount... absolute junk... oh and here is the worst part... since it gets so hot the plastic gets weak and after only a month of having it using it only 3 times the case and male usb connector feels flimsy.
2,I used SanDisk Secure Access Vault and it permanently erased many of my files so be carefull if you use SanDisk Secure Access Vault. Make sure you back up your hard drives before you use the SanDisk Secure Access Vault feature.
2,Works great but I didn't realize that this new version was thin plastic. I own the USB 3.0 version which is made of metal and comes with a plastic cover for protection. Now I'm sorry that I fell for the USB 3.1 "upgrade."
1,I used this as a boot drive for a NAS system. All of the sudden the system stopped being able to recognize the drive. I tried other ports and computers but none could recognize it. Considering it remained plugged in to a desktop and did not have intense read/write operations this is disappointing.
1,I was using this flash drive for more than 10 months and suddenly it stopped working this morning. When I contacted Sandisk technical support they are asking to ship the flash drive back to them so that they can send new one which does not make any sense to me.Who in the seven world will send back a flash drive which they used for more than 10 months and have personal data.The customer support is complete non-senseI wont buy Sandisk products any more.
1,When I contacted them about the failure and requested an RMA for warranty replacement they delayed the process over and over again by asking the same questions and requesting the same photos.  I finally gave up and pitched it which is what I should have done when it failed.  A giant hassle for a miniature inexpensive product!
1,Sustained writes of as low as 12MB/second.  Abysmal.  Very disappointed.  Hope you have a lot of time on your hand to wait around for this thing.You will not move a movie to this drive in 30 seconds as they claim on their description.  You could however pretty much have time to watch a movie if you are transferring any large amount of files to this drive so I guess there is an upside to owning it.Edit - died after about 18 months. Was basically used as cold storage. Only wrote to the drive one time to back up a bunch of pictures and audio files.
2,I bought one of these to load music on for use in my vehicles. Neither vehicle would recognize it. It works fine in a computer though. I ended up buying two of a different brand for the vehicles. No problems with them.
1,Nice small size and sleek design.  But usability is very limited.  I use the 128GB model to transfer large video files (500MB - 8GB).  Writes are painfully slow down in the 8MB/s range.  It's going to take nearly half a day to transfer my data.  They really should be more up front with their write speeds.  Yes this can read over 100MB/s.  But if you need to constantly move files around this thumb drive isn't going to cut it.  I should have spent a few more dollars and purchased the Samsung instead.  Now I have no idea what i'm going to use this for.  Oh well.  Should have done more research before purchasing.
1,As others stated it comes with over 10gig less usable space than advertised. Also this keeps disconnecting from my laptop and its purpose was to always be available for my files to be backed up to it. I never had a problem like this for years using my verbatim thumb drive. This is useless for me as as I have to pull it out and put it back in for it to recognize the drive again - major PITA when my laptop is docked and stored away from my desk.
1,Do not buy sandisk any longer. Used to be good product but no longer.....I have returned two different sandisk's prior and it was recommended I purchase the newer sandisk Ultra Fit. I did but am sorry because of Sandisk product and Amazon service. As many returns as this product has .... once a product has x amount or % or returns or bad reviews Amazon should accept returns. Most retail stores would.... and SanDisk knows this product is questionable at best why still selling. I purchase two .....$30.00 is $30.00 dollars....... plus the added effort working to fix product problem....#1. works for a couple days then junk#2. heats up far to much....#3. will lock up become protected and then unchangeable.
1,A friend and I both got into Unraid last year and these Ultra Fits didn’t even last 6 months despite low use (Unraid stores data in RAM after boot).  For mine a separate windows box couldn’t even detect the capacity after it failed i.e. it was utterly toast.  I am a fan of Sandisk’s SD cards and their reliability but have to say these Ultra Fits are garbage.
1,I have purchased two of these ultrafits and tried them in three different laptops. They get hot from the laptops (as all plug-in drives do) but the difference in these being short is that the memory itself gets hot and they quit working every time they are plugged in. You have to remove them let them cool and put them back in and then they work for a short while until they get hot again. For me they are virtually useless.
1,This is my 2nd flash drive.  My first one's (128mb) also dead.  After casual used mainly to extend my mac hd for storing files pictures and whatnot this drive 256mb is dead.  Once it's dead you can't write to it anymore but you still can read the files.  Like others have mentioned this drive gets extremely hot while writing and reading files of it.  I plan on getting the Samsung 256mb and give that a try.
1,If you are planning to use it to move small files one by one its decent memory but if you need to transfer a big files or multiple files at once this thing will overheat causing extremely slow transfers and can damage your pc
1,Put into service as a storage expansion for my NVidia Shield TV.  Set as device storage.  3 months later?  Device is now locked READ-ONLY and can't be taken out of the mode in question.  I can tell you right now that it wasn't using it for video or anything other than app space expansion for my Shield TV- so there shouldn't have been any jump to read only mode.Sorry SanDisk you should hang your head in shame and cover it with a brown paper bag over this one.  It's worse than embarrassing.  I'll take my business to Samsung gang.  This is **BAD** and I will be hesitant to give you any further business even SD card business.
1,I  was excited about this affordable large and small profile USB drive. While it worked for a few months in my NVidia Shield TV it seems that there can come a point where it heats up so much that it damages the data on the drive and makes it unbelievably slow.  As an example a 300MB app took over 30 minutes to uninstall after the drive stopped working. When it was working fine the same size file would uninstall in under 30 seconds.
1,I was so excited to get this. It's ultra small high capacity lightweight. It is also 100% plastic. The part that would be metal on any other USB is flimsy plastic and after 3 or 4 uses the plastic housing has cracked. Use has been VERY LIGHT. It mainly rides around in my padded laptop bag. This is simply a bad design.
1,It's a new model and price is good. So I think maybe it's time to give Sandisk another chance. Well... it turns out disappoints me AGAIN! The 130MB/S is only READ speed. The write speed is about 35MB/S and if you write continuously due to the flash drive become extremely hot(It could burn your finger if you touch it) the write speed will drop to 13MB/S or even lower.
1,Literally took 30 minutes to create a bootable iso drive that was 3GB.So upon deciding on whether or not to purchase this flash drive read the reviews stating how falsely advertised the speeds are and how hot it gets. all true. I purchased this even after reading the reviews because I thought the other users experiences were just flukes as I have never had a bad experience with SanDisk's products. In short pass this one up.
1,Will Samsung and other USB flashdrive manufacturers ever make a flash key ring that doesn't break and you lose your drive?
1,This thing is all but useless.  I purchased the 128 GB version and put 8 gigs of music on it to transfer to my car.  When I went to take it out of my pc it was literally too hot to touch.  I had to turn the pc off and wait for it to cool off.  Then when adding the music to my cars hard drive the same thing happened.  Now I'm afraid to use it!
2,This USB flash drive is all plastic light materials feels very cheap does not seem like the plastic housing will last.
2,Great price but these run VERY VERY hot compared to other drives with the same capacity.
1,I bought this drive on Prime Day for some discount. I hate it. Here's why:1. It can't copy files without hiccups. Often hangs on copying fairly large files (~100mb). It would eject itself afterhanging for a long time.2. It gets EXTREMELY hot. The drive is tiny and all plastic. I'm afraid it may melt.I'd advise anyone NOT TO BUY!
1,EDIT: now 3/3 have failed under minimal usage. Both went into read-only mode. I would not recommend this product.I use this for my ProxMox server to store configuration files/OS. The first one went into read-only mode after 2 weeks and could not be recovered so I had to start over. SanDisk is sending a new one but I still don't trust this product.
1,This flash drive has a very flimsy shell. Mine cracked with very minimal use wound up getting lodged inside of the USB port in a surface pro I do not recommend this product unless they increase the durability of its shell
1,It gets EXTREMELY hot. In fact it even made my entire laptop over heat and made me worried I was causing damage to the internals. Ever since then I've moved it elsewhere to use and hopefully it won't cause anymore damage.
1,Tried to use in GM vehicle but not recognized.  I work in IT and tried all kinds of things including using diskpart to reinitialize.  Works ok in computer in any format but not in 2018 car.
1,Bought it 3 months ago. I used it hardly at all and it's already "bricked" - total failure. This is flimsy plastic so maybe it should not come as a surprise. Unlike some others here this was (briefly) a 256 GB Sandisk Fit drive... not a counterfeit. But it's still garbage.
1,Not happy with this one. Had it just a few weeks before noticing how slow it was going. Every time I'd try to use it (multiple computers) it just lagggggggeddddd so much.
1,Runs super hot in temperature and eventually breaks down. Waste of money.
1,These are going back to BBuy as they are running super hot and the read speed is ridiculous! Should have known by the size of this cheap plastic flash drive.
1,Gets really hot. Died after a month.
1,Honestly i use this for my tesla and it crapped  out so quickly. Ugh.
1,Stopped working after 2 days of use.I used on my Tesla
1,Used this drive for Tesla Sentry mode. It dies after a few months
1,Outside shell Made of plastic
1,It can't even write 10MB/sec when copying large files (movies etc) - sustained write speed is about 6MB/sec (?!?).And plastic case seems very flimsy. I missed return window otherwise it would have been returned for sure.
1,Just use few times then it is full of bad sector. Really bad quality.
1,If you have a lot of large files this drive is very very slow in write speed. Won't be buying anymore of these.
1,The read speeds are great USB 3.1 the write speeds are not. Takes 1h to write 100gb and a few minutes to read.Not happy !!!
1,Did not last more then 2 weeks in my shield tv who not but this brand again get a Samsung and stay away from Sandisk
1,Unbelievable slow writing speed on USB 3 older Samsung flash drive did the same 27GB files in less than half the time.
1,Had this for maybe a month. Already does not work.
4,FYI formatted capacity = 460GB. I understand how all the hard drive manufacturers flub the capacity of drives. It's still particularly annoying that some manufacturers like SanDisk don't bother to tell you what the actual formatted capacity will be on major operating systems.  The drive itself arrived in good condition and was readily recognized by Windows 10. It came formatted as exFAT. Speeds so far have been middle of the road and haven't exceeded the max speed of USB2 yet in my tests. The fastest write speed I've gotten in copying a bunch of files over to the drive has been ~40Mbps. On the bright side it's one of the physically smallest drives available and should fit the bill as a secondary storage drive for my laptop. I plan to leave it in the USB3 port.
2,I thought SanDisk was going to live up to it's name and history with me in terms of predictable reliability with this USB drive. In fact this particular one required way more work just to use it than the PNY one that I bought for my mom's cpu. Here's what happened:I inserted it into the USB port on my cpu and immediately opened the disk to see what was on it in File Explorer. It was the expected SecureAccess software which is not needed if you don't plan to lock your files in. I copied this to the desktop just in case I wanted to install it after formatting the drive. So - please know that USB drives come formatted in an exFAT32 structure which is the format for cameras and scanners but not the standard file system used with Windows --> that is NTFS. So you will need to format this drive from exFAT32 to NTFS. And that's where the horror begins.Typically you can format a disk directly from File Explorer by right clicking on it. I went ahead and told it to format the USB disk to NTFS and allowed it to do a Quick format. Windows 10 came back with an error that said it was unable to complete the format. What? Why? It didn't tell me. So I deselected the Quick format option and waited for it to complete the longer process. Same thing happened: Windows was unable to complete the format. Seriously? So I Googled what could be causing this and it came back with a physical error on the USB drive. But relying on the SanDisk reputation I was expecting this to not be the reason for the error here.So this was either going to be completed using Disk Manager or CMD. Staring with the simpler process I went into Disk Management which is a step up from File Explorer for formatting a disk.  Disk Management showed the USB disk and appeared to have no problem with formatting the USB drive. Until it did. At about 27% completed it simply stopped and kicked out the same error message that said Windows could not complete the format. Whaaat? This was unbelievable. At this point I was pretty sure the USB Disk may actually be damaged. But I figured I'd try formatting from the command line.What I did it (1) I typed CMD in the search box and selected Run as Administrator. (2) Type diskpart; (3) Type list disk and press enter. This will show the drives attached. You'll know the one you're looking for by size. as it's only going to list each one with a number; (4) Type select disk # (replace # with the appropriate number) and press enter; (5) Type clean and press enter - then wait for it to erase whatever is on the drive; (6) Type create partition primary and press enter; (7) Type format fs=ntfs and press enter -- this will take a while as this is the formatting process; (8) Finally type assign and the cpu will give your USB a drive letter. Then exit CMD and the drive is good to go. This  worked for me but I can't deny that the reliability factor is super sketchy now and I'm not sure that I trust the USB disk to hold anything.
1,I made the mistake of trusting the brand over minority reviews and product performance so I blame myself of having to go through a painstaking process of data recovery.It's a lesson learned and like a lot of reviews here I've had similar issue:runs extremely hot - compromising performance (if it has any)fails after use -  in my case not day to day unless you count 1I would have been smart to simply remove it and set a return after the 2nd time it wasn't recognized by windows and needed repair. It remained recognizable for a period of time after that and that's when I had already finished loading transfers onto it.Great job with quality control.
5,I have a collection of most sizes as they came out but this one helps me with my music collection (116 GB). I put one in my car and one in each of my two laptops. (Decadent? Probably but sometimes I want something obscure from the '50s or '60s.) I can easily update them on my tower and then just plug them in and leave them safe and out of the way. I was using 128 GBs but if I add a couple of albums I can now just do a full copy and tell it to skip the duplicates. With the 128s it would tell me there wasn't enough room left on the disk even though I only needed a tiny part of it. On my laptops I also use the extra space for backing up projects or storing a large photo outing and then transport it to my tower later.
5,I needed a USB flash drive that was tiny so as not to draw attention to it in case I left it behind in the computer by accident and large enough to hold disk images for 3 Dell OEM PCs as well as imaging software.  This unit is perfect.  It has 256GB of space USB 3.0 speeds and is about as big as my pinky fingernail.  I don't recommend for people with eye sight or depth perception issues or people who lack fine motor control in their fingers as it can be difficult to see use and/or insert into the computer in that case.  Unit worked for Windows and Linux right out of the case and zero issues.  I've used Sandisk products for years from SD cards USB flash drives and even their SSDs and I am very happy with their quality and would buy this again.
5,Wow! 256 GB on a tiny USB 3.0 device!! We are living in the future for sure!Only things I would say as cons would be that because it's so tiny it can be hard to remove from the USB slot and it could be easily lost if you don't tie a rope to it. I tied a lanyard on it so I had something to pull on when removing it. And it's made of thin plastic so it could be easily damaged. It's wicked tiny! But it works like a charm! Backed up 2 entire hard drives on it.
3,This is a nifty small 128 GB flash drive.  I have always trusted the SanDisk brand.  Sadly when I placed this flash drive into my computer to check that is was good and to scan it with my anti virus I noticed something.  The exe file was created in Nov 2016.  That means this flash drive is at least 4 years old.  With reliability of flash drives always in question I am not very happy with this issue.  I use external drives and the cloud etc. for my "real" backups.  But having a large flash drive to stores items temporarily was what I was seeking.  I have contacted SanDisk directly and asked them if I could have a replacement that was newer.  We'll see what they say.Bottom line.  Use caution and check your disk after purchase.
5,I ordered this 256GB because I have the identical 128GB still working fine after 6 months just needed more memory. This USB stays in my stereo receiver 99% of the time except when I am adding more music to it with the laptop. The small package blends in with the black stereo face and doesn't stick out far. It will get  warm when storing 140GB of files all at once but that is normal for this tiny of unit. It runs cool during normal playback or if I am just adding a few dozen music files. The small size is perfect for me. If you afraid of losing it then add a string or put it on a key ring.
1,I bought 3 drives each comes with free software Rescue Disk Pro Deluxe. Problem is that the product keys do not activate the product. So I contacted tech support only to be accused of not purchasing the products and was required to provide proof in the form of a photo of the disks and the packaging I assume contains the registration keys. They would not produce the activation keys. So I should return the disks being treated this way. I am also getting sick and tired of foreign product support. I await the activation keys. If not then a full refund.
4,I love how small this flash drive is - it goes great on a keychain; however it's a reasonable drawback that it doesn't come with some sort of string/thin cord that can be attached to it so that it can be attached to a keychain.  If you're buying this thinking it's "solid state" so it'll be as fast as the SSD in your computer/laptop think again - it's just a flash drive and is going to perform at flash drive speeds (which aren't bad but aren't SSD speeds).  Works with Mac/Windows/Linux.
5,This flash drive is super tiny. I bought 2 32gb versions to be able to quickly transfer data from my laptop to any public computers or a friends computer at any time. I keep one continuously plugged into my laptop so that it's always on me and I never have to worry about losing it and the other I have stored in a draw with a lanyard so that it's easy to find later in case I ever need a backup. These are super small though so be careful because they are super easy to lose!
5,You could put this on your PC as your OS drive (if you wanted to)  and still get all your other programs and data on this.  You could use it as a data drive in your PC/Mac if you wanted to.I love the storage for a drive of this size. You must store this in a very safe place so that you don't lose it because it can be very easily lost or thrown out (by mistake)  for a small size.
5,My wife uses this as storage on her Linux laptop as a safety I take it and copy it on a regular basis so that she has all of her stuff backed up in two separate locations so far so good I have never had a problem with with SanDisk thumbnails love them because they're so small they don't stick out and get caught on anything if you move your device
5,Bought to use with my Blink camera system. Plugs right into my hub. Auto stores daily. No cloud or fees. Am a happy camper.
5,I got this because I move around with my laptop from room to room every ~20 mins and I wanted to keep my progress saved on this stick as I move around without saving it onto the computer. I could forget this stick is even in there there is no piece that sticks out so much that I feel the stick will rip out or get damaged. The lip is curved allowing for easy insert and removal. Fits in like a keychain pill case so you can always keep your files on the go without even thinking about it.
3,These things are everywhere.  They're cheap so I keep buying them but the plastic on the USB housing is so thin its very easy to crush it.  Though they work well the other issue is that the small form factor can be hard to remove from tighter fitting USB slots due to not having much to grip.  But its cheap.
5,This is a great little flash drive! The reason I liked it so much is because it is so low profile. I do have a short lanyard attached to it because it's very easy to lose. I like the low profile of it because it's perfect for my laptop. I prefer a larger flash drive for my desktop tower computer but for the laptop it has to be something that doesn't stick out. Fantastic!
5,I load this with about 400 of my favorite tunes.  I plug it into the tech USB port of my car (not the charging USB port) and I have uninterrupted music through the car's stereo system.  This way I am not using the Bluetooth with my phone for music and I can use the phone for other matters.  The small overall size makes it best.
5,This drive has worked well for backing up the files from the desktop. We always try to keep an emergency backup that can be grabbed easily in an emergency. My only issue is how small it is. That's great if you leave it in the USB drive but not so easy if you want to take it out and put it away each time. Maybe it's just my hands. It does have a hooked end to grab hold of.
5,Amazing amount of digital storage in a unit the literal size of your thumbnail.  I use it with a USB input on a shelf stereo that only has less than an inch between the input and the top of the shelf so a short USB drive like this solves that little dilemma.
5,I have been using SanDisk devices for over 15 years. They work they work well and they never disappoint. I highly recommend SanDisk to all who need this type of device. They will not let you down.
5,Great way to overcome limitation of on-board soldered storage in laptop.  My laptop had only 256 GB storage now I have extended the storage capacity to 768 GB!!
5,It is plastic. It seems to function as expected. I cautiously gave it 5 stars but have seen a lot of reviews that it is not very durable. It stays in the car so I don't handle it much. I could see it eventually breaking if you handle it on a regular basis.
1,I bought 2 of these Plastic Ultra USB Drives.  One 128GB and one 256GB Ultrafit USB Drives.  The plastic wears thin and within a month the top layer just over the contacts breaks off and the drive no longer fits snugly into the USB slot.  You see here the 128 which is the one completely broken (the broken part lying next to it) and the 256 is cracked with all the way across with a small opening on the side closest to you (you can see the blue through the hole).  The crack extends to the other side and it's about ready to break in the same way the 128GB drive broke.  I also have a 128 that has a metal plug and the metal one works fine.  DON'T BUY THESE PLASTIC SANDISK ULTRA FIT USB DRIVES UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!!!
5,Barely visible with great capacity.  Keep it in my camera bag. Good for backing up files of any kind. Allows for transfer between travel laptop and desktop in a "flash". Economical as well.
4,I have a few of the previous USB 3.0 version of this drive which I love to use as OS boot drive. They can be left in the port of a laptop safely due to the size making them great for this and I bought this for the same purpose.  Performance is excellent but the USB connector itself is made from thin flimsy plastic.  In my personal opinion the material choice is garbage but performance is still great so how much that matters will depend on your use case.
5,I filled it with files for my wife's friends car. I recommend these shorty USB sticks rather than long ones for automobile applications this way they don't wiggle around when you hit bumps
1,Worked great... until it didn't. 60 days in it just pooped out. Unfortunate because I was using it to transfer dats from one PC to another and didn't have a good back up.
3,I have a former version of the drive as pictured and very like how it is compact. The one delivered in this order is Not the same as in the picture. It is significantly larger form factor which is disappointing.
4,This flash drive works fine but my one and only objection to it is its design. It makes it difficult to hold onto to insert and remove it from a USB receptacle.
5,I needed to be able to constantly backup my work quickly so I was looking for an unobtrusive flashdrive I could keep on my laptop all the time this did the job! I never take it out.
5,Great little thing however it is so small that I’m afraid to lose it all the time better to attach it to something.
5,Small size is a plus. I can carry more in my computer bag. Additionally I can leave them in the laptop when putting it away in the computer bag. Plus plus.
5,I love that it's so unobtrusive.  It's slower than my other USB 3 flash drives but they inevitably get bent and eventually fail while this one will not.
5,I needed something small that had storage space This fit the bill perfectly! Yes I would buy it again I  needed another one.
5,Lots of memory for the money.  i like that it is small i  can leave it plugged in the kids tv's in the car without them pulling it out or breaking it off in the unit.
5,Tiny USB drives with reliable flash for a cheap price. Perfect! They work very well they don't die after a few months use and they're fast and give the capacity they advertise. Nothing else you could ask for!
5,It’s a flash drive that works so what can I really says other than it’s a great price per GB from a trusted manufacturer. I would buy another one if needed.
5,This works like it should. Lot of storage and easy to remove and reinstall on my other laptops. Will buy again.
5,This works great and is barely noticeable when inserted in your computer. It does have a large enough of an opening to put on a key ring which I'd suggest if you're moving it around as it's easy to lose otherwise.
5,Nice size for the price. Using for security camera storage. Holds a lot of video system accepted it with no problems and reformatted. Fast enough. Size is great barely protrudes from the USB port.
5,Perfect for Raspberry Pi. These micro or nano-sized USB drives are great. Forget thumb drive more like thumbnail drive. 256G in something that only extends about half an inch after it's plugged in is amazing.
4,Good compact size for staying in the side USB port on a laptop
5,One of the most compact thumb drives I could find and for the best price. I bought two of them. They included instructions to encrypt data
5,Super small ultra fast. These are fantastic for adding storage space to small devices. I use them for my Amazon Fire Stick Rasberry PI and MPC Live.
5,I used this for external storage on my FireTV cube.  It took a little setup had to format it on my PC before it worked with FireTV.  Once it was configured correctly it has been working ever since.
5,Pretty much as the headline states no complaints. Product worked as described and had no issues. Good job!
5,Perfect amount of storage for pictures and videos.
5,The main selling point is the physical size. I have never tested the speeds because I just needed a tiny drive for music in my car. I dumped 180GB of music on it and have no problems using it daily.
5,GREAT PRICE simple and fast to load my data (I'm using to store music for my car).  ALL WORKS AS EXPECTED!
5,Super great deal for such a compact device with the added advantage of a free update for SanDisk 3.1 security
5,A good way to backup of stuff. And to add capacity to a laptop
5,I use this for my digital photo frame. Plenty of storage for a low price. It works easily with any media.
5,512GB smaller than your thumb; NICE!!! Can leave in the laptop for on the go... Doesn't get hot either... Be careful when inserting/removing; plastic casing is flimsy...
5,This flash drive is smaller than I anticipated! Seems to work so far. A good amount of storage.
5,Can never get enough of storage especially in a small form.  And the price per GB keeps going down.
5,Small and holds ALL of my music in a tiny chip that stays plugged into USB due to its form factor
5,We use this for Wifey's Roland Juno synth the low profile means we dont have to disconnect it when we pack the synth to tour.
5,Very nice drive.  A lot of storage in a small package. Careful very easy to loose.
4,I bought it for surface pro 4. It is very reliable and hot swappable (means you can pull it out without actually unmounting it).
4,Low profile and doesn't get in your way when plugged in.
5,Can someone post how to make it work on your firestick because I have no clue.  Please......
5,Worked fine. Saw some reviews about getting hot to touch. Have used for large files no unusual warmth.
5,Used for blink
5,It’s a very small footprint for on the go. Storage Capacity is as advertised. Plug and play on both my Mac and pc laptops.
5,I use it as my main active storage It is fast steady portable. Best one ever !

5,Works great! Using on HDML CLONER BOX PRO and did reformat it to FAT 32. No issues.
5,Very spacious and easy to get lost because of the size but very convenient and easy setup.
5,Fast and easy to use. High capacity storage for data or media.
5,Great product and I would buy it again! I recommend this items to everyone.
5,Of all the USB-A v2.2 mass storage devices out there this is one of them.
5,Works great!  Just what I needed.  Great size and capacity!
3,I own both a 64gb and 128gb version of these drives. The 128 has been working flawlessly so far. The 64gb version has crashed on me two or three times now. Each time I have to restart my PC in order to get it to be detected again. I like these drives for the size and speed but it looks like they can be a bit spotty when it comes to reliability.
5,I use it for a readtyboost drive in my Windows 10 laptop. Works great low profile is why I bought it.
5,Nice storage capacity fast transfer and sturdy!Doesn’t take much space in your pocket and with your keys.
5,Using  this tiny flash drive to back up my picture files

5,Super fast and small.
5,Great product
5,Would recommend it
5,Small and useful. A great keychain :)
5,Small and fast
1,Bought it because it has a small form factor for my Surface Book 2. Worked ok for 8 months and then failed.
5,Works
5,Use this for music storage on my Ram 1500. Super fast and stealthy. Love it.
5,I wanna buy more but the system wan't allow me to do...Would you mine to extend the the reach maximum product please or contact me. Thank you
5,Muy contento muy útil
1,While I normally use the metal framed Cruzer Fit sticks I purchased this for some reason - perhaps the handle. Whatever I was thinking this purchase was a mistake...It worked for several months then gave me a CRC read error - that takes me back to the (not so) good-old-days of MFM disks and constant reformatting due to drives losing alignment (If you don't understand the reference consider yourselves lucky!) The unit and data was unrecoverable.Since I only used it for mp3s in one of my cars I didn't lose any critical data but a failure in only six months is unacceptable! I'll *never* purchase one of these again.
5,Not too much needs to be said. San Disk has always been an awesome brand & their products work as advertised. My only complaint with this one is that I don't really like that it's plastic. My son broke his before & o was afraid a piece would get stuck in the port so I had to purchase a replacement & he hadn't had it very long at the time.
5,Absolutely perfect styling for in car audio use.  No matter where your port is they just don't stick out enough to be a problem.
5,works
4,Exactly what I needed.  It arrived as expected.  Worth every penny.  Will buy another if I need to. Product is as described.  Nice
4,Great product that shipped and arrived quickly
5,Works awesome for Blink module instead of paying for Blink Cloud monthly
5,I can't believe how small these are and how much data you can store on them.
5,Love it! Compact & fast! Sandisk is THE best!
5,I use this small flash drive on my Yamaha AVR to access over 300 CD FLAC level 5 music files. The Yamaha AVR USB port is behind the front panel and unlike a standard size flash drive this USB flash drive lets me close the front panel.
5,This thing is tiny!! I got this for my Sentry mode viewer in my Tesla as my sandisk  quit working. So far so good!!
4,It's fast and reliable just like any good brand. Nothing much to say.Delivery was misplaced initially but got it.
5,I purchased this to use with blink indoor/outdoor security cameras. This allows me record activities going on in and outside my home without paying for a monthly subscription in order to get to save pictures. This is working like a charm and saving me money!
5,works as specked tough easy to format to NTFS SMALL SIZE a real asset GREAT DRIVE!!
1,This 5-pack is not a retail product and looks used and unlicensed. Who knows what kind of malware or viruses could be on them? I'm afraid to even put them in my workstation computer.
5,This is a great USB drive it is priced well and performance is excellent as well it is low profile.
4,i used it to install Lubuntu Linux 20.10LTS.  Only used it that one time.  worked fine.  formatted it to remove built in security software.  No problems formatting.  I would buy it again if I needed a fresh flash drive.  Have not used it since the install.  Flash drive loses a star for not including a cover to keep out dust and debri.
5,Great item
5,My car as a plug and play USB port but it's located in the center console. Not wanting to risk damaging a traditional thumb drive or the port by having a large dongle hanging out of it and having it get bumped or snagged by things shifting around in the console I turned my attention to this little guy. Its low profile design means I don't have to worry about reaching in there and smacking it or anything slamming into it while I'm taking a curve. 128 Gigs isn't enough to house my entire music catalog but it's certainly enough for all my favorite driving music or my entire collection of audio books. It'll take me months to play through all the data this thing can hold. The only drawback is that there is so much data that it takes my car a few minutes to process the data and start playing music after firing up the car. Not a big deal though. Gives me a little quiet time to plot my course on the GPS before Axl Rose starts screaming at me.
5,I have used San Disk flash memory products for 20 years.  I have tried a few other brands but they never last over time.This 256gb solution is used on HP Chromebook.  It will permanently stay in the computer and can be used to share Linux files as well for this particular device.It is secure and doesn't slip.It can be a bit warm when using on a laptop.Download speeds were great for downloading an MP4 HD file from a media server on a wireless LAN  connection with a reasonable amount of time to download a 1 hour program.I still have the first 1gb flash drive model that San Disk release.  It is amazing how the size has shrunk over the years.I may have to switch it to the 512gb model soon.
5,Great Deal! Thanks!
5,Small footprint makes it great for storing and playing music using USB port in car.
5,el producto de excelente calidad
5,Pretty much a plug and play item
5,I had to reformat it and forgot to save the encryption software. Luckily I had another Sandisk flash drive I was able to copy it from. Just a reminder… if you have to reformat it take all the stuff off of you need it. Save it on your desktop and then put it back. That was a ME issue though nothing they could have done about that. But the flash drive is great. Small and light.
5,Using in a Blink camera hub. Seems to work fine.
5,No complaints
5,Small footprint makes it great for storing and playing music using USB port in car.
5,el producto de excelente calidad
5,Pretty much a plug and play item
5,Love the capacity compared to the size!!  No bigger than a wireless mouse adapter!
5,Very quick setup time. Super small and portable. Very good price for the storage.
4,Working fine.
5,I bought one of these for my car.  I like to keep my music on a USB drive instead of my phone so I wanted something compact with a lot of capacity.  This flash drive has worked great for that so far.
5,Like the small size and use it for recovery media.  Approx. dimensions .75x.5x.0625 in.  Might be easy to lose for some.
5,Fast transfer speeds and so tiny it’s crazy. Get a keychain holder for it as it is so small it is so easy to lose.
5,Love that it's not bunky. Is easy to lose. Have to keep your eye on it. Transfers to Mac and Windows easily without formatting. Good little device.
5,Needed a compact USB flash drive to fit into a space restricted area of my car and this was perfect!
5,Fast transfer speeds and so tiny it’s crazy. Get a keychain holder for it as it is so small it is so easy to lose.
5,works well
1,I failed after a few months of using it.
5,If you have an older laptop it makes it easy to back it up with time machine
5,Excelente velocidad de escritura.
5,This is so small! Only slightly bigger than the USB-A port it fits in. Ultra light. The housing is entirely plastic. I think that’s why the price is so incredibly low. That said it works really well so no complaints there.  Great price and a great value. What’s not to like?
1,Bad quality and low product support
4,Great by
5,This USB drive feels well made and actually a little sturdier than others I've bought.  The handle makes for easy removal.
5,Worked great for adding gamed to a PlayStation Classic.
5,So here we are with the third of our Amazon Fire TV Stick quality-of-life devices the SanDisk Ultra Fit 128GB flash drive. It definitely lives up to his name; it's TINY!As you can see it fits quite well into my new USB OTG hub (located here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083WML1XB ) that plugs into my Fire TV Stick along with my Ethernet adapter with one port spare! And the best part of all when connecting with a device that hangs off my TV it adds almost no weight to the device’s "installation footprint" in software terminology.But how does it work with the Fire TV Stick you ask? Well it's simple. After you plug the USB OTG hub into the fire TV stick and plugged the hub into an electric outlet thus allowing the hub to act as a power pass-through you plug the drive in and it should not look like it did anything but what you do is you go to the Settings select My Fire TV choose USB Drive choose "Format to Internal Storage" and wait a while.After that the drive will work to store certain apps that you download from the Fire TV's App Store (though apps that are already downloaded to the 5 GB space on the Fire TV Stick itself may need to be uninstalled and reinstalled in order to be able to work on the flash drive and to be able to establish the app’s data and cache on the flash drive with any confidence uninstallation and reinstallation is almost certainly a necessity) and probably also serve as a temporary caching location for the apps that are downloaded there. Who knows it may also serve as a general caching area for the Stick!In any case when combined with an ethernet adapter (seen here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0898C73ZZ ) both connected to the aforementioned USB OTG hub which I have also reviewed these devices will provide the largest boost of speed and efficiency that the Third-Generation Fire TV Stick can exhibit. Is the device now lightning fast? No but it is much faster than it came stock that's for sure.Check my profile for the reviews of the other three devices that have helped to improve my quality of life when using the Fire TV Stick third gen.
5,All kinds of storage... this is super dooper pooper.....  LOL
5,Thank you Scandisk for making the best I just hope you fight off the counterfeit people. I look to make sure I'm buying from the Scandisk store.
5,Perfect for video pinball machine
5,These micro USBs are the perfect size for automobiles that support USB media.  Kia Soul. 32 GB is the largest size I have found that the media system can address and index with decent speed. 64GB drags in loafing and seeking.
5,Great price for 3 high speed 32gb 3.1 flash drives. I use them with my roku smart tv and fire sticks on the simple tvs to pause and rewind live tv.
5,I used it in an amp for music I transfered to the SanDisk. They always work good. nice low profile. fast transfer too
5,Small size and large capacity.  Great for permanently attaching to a security system recorder.
5,perfect for my temporary laptop storage needs. Easy plug and play. Brand that you can trust.
5,It’s easy to use just a little hot
5,Perfect for local storage on Blink Sync Module for cameras.
1,Item is defective does not work. Writing is too slow or does not work at all specifically for Tesla dashcam. Which is a disappointment as it is advertised to write 15X faster than normal flash drives... would not recommend.
5,I use this in my car after loading a bizillion songs on it including audio books. It stays in the car and I don't have to worry about blue tooth and wire connection to phone. So easy.
5,As far as I can determine 64GB is the limit for my 2018 Nissan Leaf SV. Larger drives are not recognized properly while 64GB (keeping nesting to about level 2) seems to work pretty well. I've been using SanDisk for decades now and they are still great even after WD took over.
1,Whomever came up with that idea of using plastic as material for USB port should be fired. This is a portable device it is supposed to be carried in backpacks or key chain etc. where the flimsy plastic won’t survive. Sure this is $10 thing can easily be replaced but what about the precious data?It went back the very day day it arrived luckily I bought it from Amazon who honored free returns. Thank you Amazon!
4,set it up loaded it with coinops x for my arcade legends plugged it in and that's it. small size keeps it out-of-the-way and it works perfect. no need for me to constantly remove and plug it back in so no damage to drive. speed is fast enough for my use. quite happy with it for this purpose.if you need an indestructible drive that will be jangling around on your keys look elsewhere.
5,This is perfect for my Tesla Camera storage.  Fast and large capacity.  Easy to format
5,Good
5,This is for holding data from my cameras. Holds tons of video.
5,Works flawless great addition to my laptop. I just leave it in and forget about it. Using for documentation backup network shared.
5,An excellent choice at a rock bottom price.  This flash drive provides a capacity that seems impossible in such a compact size.  Fits low profile to expand storage on a portable device with a USB Type-A port without risking breaking off in transit.  This flash drive is also a good option to provide additional storage for a stationary piece of hardware like a computer Chromebook or Router.  Plastic loop on the device allows attaching a lanyard or keychain to secure the drive without risk of loss.  Transfer speed is lightning fast.  Good for running diagnostic utilities or as boot media when you want to keep an installed drive offline.  Another product from my most trusted name in storage.Integrate them into your 3-2-1 backup strategy for business or home.  Out of the box compatibility with all major operating systems.  Fill up a cloth bag with these drives and hear them clack clack like valuable gold pieces.
5,I use this USB drive for music and videos that I take when traveling. Just lots of fast storage for a very reasonable cost.
5,I purchased this drive to be a network drive on my router via its USB port. Works great on my Netgear Nighthawk RAX50.
5,It is working as it should so far. I'm using it for camera storage and will see how long it lasts.
5,I bought this for my surveillance camera system in order to store clips locally instead of paying subscription to the "cloud" storage.It works well and it's small in size but plenty of storage space.
5,Works as it should .
5,Great little item. It was delivered on time and as promised. Good job!
5,As a replacement for my last SanDisk flash drive it was great. I had the same size previous because of the small size but a large amount of storage. I enjoy the portability of the drive because the larger ones are easier to knock and break.
5,Until SanDisk or Samsung release faster USB flash drives this one is the #1 or #2 fastest USB 3.x 512GB Fit Flash drive at the moment. There is a Samsung that does read at a faster rate but write speeds seem to be the same…I actually use these as a secondary drive as they are almost flush to the USB port.To SanDisk a couple of thoughts (in case by some miracle someone at SanDisk product design reads real reviews of their products on Amazon):Please Make these in OTHER COLORS such as Red or Orange or Lime or phosphorescent…why?A couple of reasons:• With a handful of them of varying capacities unless I mount them I have no idea which has what on it. (I print tiny labels using 2-4pt fonts so At a glance I know what’s on each of these).• Somehow I keep losing them when it’s dark I’ve already lost 3 during various flights. I’ve resorted to applying bright nail polish colors to differentiate between them and to help find them if they drop.
5,Great little item. It was delivered on time and as promised. Good job!

5,I like that the stick covering is one piece. I had the last generation of Sandisk small high capacity sticks and one of them came apart. A 64 gig I had to glue back together. See the new 128 Gb and the older 64 Gb in the photo.
5,Works as expected
4,I put this tiny SanDisk 128GB Ultra-Fit in my kid's 14" HP Stream a terrible Windows "streambook" with just 32GB of built-in storage.. for Windows 10..I wanted to give my daughters junky laptop some extra storage without her needing an external USB drive bay. I also didn't want a big USB flash drive sticking out of her laptop which would have been accidentally snapped off in no time. This Ultra-Fit Sandisk is both small and rounded so I don't have to worry about it getting caught on something. Now my kid's laptop can actually run Windows Update! I also installed Minecraft on the USB and although it takes a bit of waiting for it to load it does run.The SanDisk 128GB Ultra-Fit gets pretty warm... and I don't like that the actual USB connector is plastic instead of metal. If the USB connector was metal it would transfer heat to the USB jack and not run so warm... Whatever it works for now. Will update this review if the USB stick ever fails!
5,I have several of these and try to grab them when they are sale based when I need more. You can’t go wrong with these if you need compact usb storage. Price was right!
4,I jump drive is a jump drive.  However there are a couple of issues with this one that shoppers should know about.  First because it's so small there isn't really any way to label it.  So if you want to put say Tesla Sentry videos on it you have room for maybe a letter or two written on the device in pencil.  You don't want to put a label on it because of the other issue: it gets HOT.  It would almost certainly melt the label glue and create a goopy mess if you put a labelmaker label on it.  The last issue is that it's so small you'd better have a good place to keep it because it will get lost easily.
4,Great product fast reading and writing speeds in PC and Mac. It’s tiny format makes it very convenient to have it permanently attached to a Laptop.However it is not compatible with Nintendo Wii if you want to play backups from FAT32 or NTFS (I tried all ways possible). It will only work if you make a WBFS partition.
5,This past year I ripped my entire 40 year CD collection to 320kbps mp3s and put it on a pair of these USB sticks; one for my office Windows machine and one for my studio's Mac. I backed that up on a pair of SATA hard drives and keep backing them up as I add new music to my collection. This "stick" is perfect for that application and will hold at least another decade worth of new music.
5,Tired of SD Cards crapping out Sandisk is great 256g gives plenty of storage. It's also seems much faster over all than the SD card option. I have not done any exhausting testing with software. I can see with my eyes how much smoother the boot processes is on my pi-400. Now using the pi-400 as day to day shop computer small machine shop.I would not recommended for file transfer between computers use the larger sandisk EDGE OR GUIDE Models. Reserve these small almost hidden in the USB slot for adding extra storage.I have been using the 32g models in my 3D print controllers rasp pi 3 for last 4 years no issues. the hold huge amount. .stl flies from years of projects.
5,It worked and fit in the socket in the armrest so it doesn't take up any room or project out to be hit.
5,Perfect for leaving in laptops and for car stereos that play music off the USB drive. Low profile and stays out of the way.
3,Hard to plug and unplug this device.
5,Got this for my wife’s car and it holds thousands of MP3s. Quick file transfer and simple to use and at a great price.
5,Easy to use
5,Bought this as a stop gap before I get my failed Seagate portable drive back from data recovery.Should have just bought a couple of these.Very fast. Using as file back up for projects.
5,Large capacity and is 3.1 like it should be. not a rip-off.
5,Very small compact and unintrusive.  Transfers data very fast!
5,Small and compact. But has all the storage space that it advertises. Could lose it easily so just keep track!
3,Good but its not sturdy
5,As advertised real 32 GB and relatively fast. And more importantly this is from SanDisk a major brand in USB storage so you can trust the device. The drives are really small and does not protrude too much from the computer or your car stereo etc. Definitely recommended
5,I prefer the micro sized usb for the storage devices I will most often use. I use the larger versions for easily identifiable and specific purposes....but the day to day use is always a micro. There are too many times when I have bumped a laptop while the usb was in the port...these micros dont damage the port like the large usb drives will do when bumped.These drives are generally fast and very very reliable even with repeated and heavy use over time.
5,Works well and good speed. Does get warm so when doing large backups do them in segments
5,It's so small I had to put a lanyard on it so I wouldn't swallow it. Just kidding.
5,It really shouldn't surprise anyone that a drive capable of running at these speeds with such a small form factor comes with some thermal...drawback. This isn't an issue with product but rather the form factor so it should be expected to happen if you ask me.I'm using this as a permanent boot drive for a tablet to act as a smart photo frame that's a little more robust than a store-bought alternative. If you plan on plugging this in and out of things a lot you need to either be very careful or find a different drive as this USB drive's enclosure is entirely thin plastic so it can and will crunch itself into being very difficult to plug in.
5,All of them formatted on the first try.  I use them for mp3s for my car audio system.
5,I use these to back up my downloaded programs I have on my pc. That includes Adobe Suite software.. so you know that's a big file! And there's still room to spare!
5,All this storage on a device so small you can just leave it in all the time.
5,Dios los bendiga a todos por su trabajo
5,Not all flash drives are made the same. If you want to ensure the info you save will always be there buy quality. Remember "you get what you paid for".
