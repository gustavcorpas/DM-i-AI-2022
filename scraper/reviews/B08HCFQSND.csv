5,The plastic frame to position the glass makes it much easier to position correctly than tape which is also included. Having a hole rather than a notch at the top seems to be more protective than the previous cover glass I used. Dust motes are almost impossible to elliminate 100% but that is  no different than others I have used and I was able to peel back and reclean twice as I noticed trapped dust as it attached from the top down. Really like the frame - good idea. I also used Zeiss lens cleaning wipes.
5,My family has been using this brand for our iPhones for many years now. Everyone is excellent and has protected the iPhone flawlessly - occasionally breaking instead of the iPhone as designed. With each new iPhone we come back to this brand for screen protectors. The package includes a plastic target that makes it easy to install correctly each time. Great product.
5,These are the best screen protectors I‚Äôve bought them five times over the past 2/3 years and I‚Äôll continue to buy them. I‚Äôve dropped my phone several times and the screen protector is the only thing that cracks. These keep my phone in the best condition no cracks or scratches anywhere.
5,This screen protector will last me a while. I bought it a couple months ago and have dropped my phone multiple times with that being said my screen protector is doing its thang ! No scratches or cracks ! I have a child who thinks my phone is a football so this screen protector is Saving my phones life ! Amazing !
5,Fits perfectly edge to edge with NO raised edges; blends in nicely with the iPhone 12 frame. With the included screen protector guide anyone can install these with NO bubbles.
4,The screen protectors are very nice and they all come in good packaging. However there was no tool to use to get rid of the air bubbles. The guide is a very smart idea and using my cellphone with the screen protector feels the same as if it were the bare screen. Good quality overall for the price!
5,Protector directions are easy to follow. Product get on with ease and no bubbles. Feels thicker than other name brands.
5,The installation frame included with this screen protector makes placing it on the phone properly very easy.  Air bubbles are easy to remove and the glass is fingerprint resistant.
4,
5,Of all the glass screen protectors I‚Äôve had in my life this one is the best I‚Äôve used so far. First it covers the entire screen almost edge to edge. Second the install tool that clips on to your phone makes it impossible to mess up your install giving a perfect fit. And you get three protectors for a great price.
4,I was looking for a full screen protector. I like that it makes it look like I don‚Äôt have anything on the screen. This is a great price. Though it Didn‚Äôt want to stick on one end when I first put it on. I had to really force it for the first day or two. My biggest issue is all the fingerprints that accumulate on the screen. But good price.
5,Great quality and easy to install. Covers entire surface.
5,Covers screen perfectly
5,Installation is breeze with the kit comes with. Quality is good. I used another protector which was also good quality but always peel in the corner  when I take off my phone case for cleaning . This one sticks together I tried many times take my case on and off looks like the installation kit helped to install  it perfect. Thumbs up üëç nice good quality one.
5,I‚Äôve gone through several screen protectors but I think this may be the best one yet!The screen protector itself feels super high quality and like glass. Then it comes with a plastic guide that snaps onto your phone which makes aligning it super easy. And finally I think the adhesive they use is great I always extra careful about any lint or dust so I clean the screen really well but sometimes the glue traps bubbles. With this one I cleaned it well and applied it with no issues at all. I thought I had some trapped bubbles but I think it was the glue slowly adhering to the screen because I kept going over them with a microfiber cloth and they all went away! The screen protector is on now with zero bubbles or issues which is pretty rare I think. Also I‚Äôve noticed no difference in touch sensitivity so far feels just like there‚Äôs no protector on it.All in all it was super easy to apply had an awesome snap on guide felt premium and was exactly what I was looking for!
4,Stood on my phone and the protector bore the brunt and protected my screen completely.  Was so glad to have another one of these protectors available for a quick and easy replacement.
5,this is a pretty awesome screen protector.  ‚Äúthe avengers‚Äù of phone screen protectors. I accidentally dropped my phone in the middle of a busy street. This protector is no joke. It protected my phone even after being ran over by cars. üì± üöó üí® ->  üì± ‚ò†Ô∏è. thought my phone was a goner but this product proved me wrong.  screen protector  took most of the damage while the phone itself received minimal damage. The screen protector went out like a true hero ü´° highly recommend this item it won‚Äôt disappoint. earth‚Äôs mightiest screen protector üåé üì± üî•
3,Let me start by saying I am uber OCD when it comes to screen protectors on my iPhone 12 Pro. That means I demand perfection from the protector itself and my installation.I want my screen protector to be invisible meaning no bubbles or dust underneath.I‚Äôve gotten really good at the installation part which involves creating as close to a clean room in my home that I can. I clean the vanity (work area) in our bathroom and then run a light shower of hot-only water (with bathroom door shut) to create a light steam to minimize airborne dust during installation.My last 6 or 8 installs (between the 3 family phones) over last several years have been home runs: no dust or bubbles to be seen.After receiving these TETHYS protectors today I set about replacing my existing protector that had a very small scratch (almost unnoticeable‚Ä¶I said I was OCD!).Ran through my usual procedure on the first one but ended up with a single small speck of dust. Probably could have let it ride but yeah OCD. Was bit surprised that I let dust in but nobody‚Äôs perfect.So attempt 2: took usual steps and this time two dust specs!I am 100% sure my phone screen was dust-free especially that second attempt! Now I‚Äôm thinking perhaps these screen protectors picked up some contaminates during the manufacturing or packaging process.Probably impossible to prove that though so‚Ä¶Everything looked to be good quality with this product and most people probably aren‚Äôt as critical as me with screen protectors but I will be trying a different brand next time (or a previous brand I‚Äôve used before if I can find them again).I‚Äôll try to get a little use out of this second install as long as the dust doesn‚Äôt drive me too crazy and I‚Äôll update my review if the third install goes as flawlessly as I know I‚Äôm capable of.
5,I‚Äôve ordered these about 3x already and for the price I absolutely love them. They are super easy to install. Packaging comes with screen protectors alcohol cleaning wipes installation frame that helps you align the screen protector which is a great help and so much more. 100% recommended!
5,It is a really well made screen protecter.
5,Took me some time to get a clean installation with 0 dust/bubble. Looking good now.
4,My glass protector on my phone had cracked and I needed a new one. After reading so many positive reviews and knowing it was dirt cheap compared to what I had paid for the cracked one going for it was a fairly easy decision.What I like about it:Easy installationPerfect fitNo issues with my case which also fits perfectlyWhat I disliked:Very reflective and creates a problem in bright lightThe notch at the top for the speaker is a problem as it gathers too much dirt and grime which remains in the recess and needs to be cleaned regularly.Because of the two reasons I would not be going for it in future again. No wonder the design is not very common (covering entire screen ) and leaving a hole in the middle. What others offer with a cutout based on the entire notch on the phone is more practical and a hygienic solution.I did not rate its durability as it is too early to tell.If you are on a very tight budget  can live with the high reflectivity of screen outdoors and last but not least willing to regularly clean the hole at the top you may go for it.
5,My favorite to order.  I drop my phone a lot and these are great! very durable. Super easy to put on.
5,Love the screen protectors they were very easy to install and would recommended
4,Very awesome protector. As close to full screen coverage as you can get at a great price. 4.5 out of 5.I knocked half a star off because it can be a challenge to get all the bubbles out. I still would highly recommend it though.
5,I just installed the screen protector and I love it. It does offer an edge to edge coverage which I believe to be very important. Purchased another brand that had amazing reviews but it didn‚Äôt cover all the edges of the phone leaving plenty of open spaces.This brand fits my iPhone 12 perfectly. It was VERY easy to install. I used the plastic that the screen comes attached to to spread the edges and to assure no air was trapped. It is not affecting the typing (touch screen) either.100% happy with it.
3,The fit off the screen protector was not correct. There is a slight variation in the size Which causes gabs around the phone. The provide a alignment guide does not also properly fit the screen protector. There is too much wiggle room for the screen protector to move around with the alignment plastic guide provided. Every single time the screen protector was installed in different angles when I tried it multiple time. Previously when I bought screen protector for iPhone XS from Tethys  it fit the phone really well
5,Was tired of spending $50 on belting protectors. Tried cheaper options but would get air bubbles very quickly. These have performed fantastically and very fair price.
3,Screen protector is easy to install but scratches too easily. My previous screen protector lasted a year before getting any scratches but I‚Äôm already using my second piece for this in less than a month.
5,Best glass! Includes template to set the glass perfect on iphone
5,It‚Äôs solid and easy to use
5,I don‚Äôt normally write screen protector reviews. These were good enough for me to get on here and write one. Easy to install and it looks super clean. I love that it covers the whole screen. Fits perfectly with my case too. Exactly as advertised.
5,Beveled edges edge to edge coverage and no notch at the top. What a wonderful product at a great price.
5,Great product easy install and perfect protection.
5,I had a small issue with the lower corners not providing full contact and showing a "bubble" I wasted two of the screen savers attempting to make it stick otherwise they seem to be good.
5,I have gotten this same brand for a few of my phones now and for my parents phones as well. They never disappoint. Quality is excellent and the ease of installing without all the misalignment bubbles and lint that manages to find its way in. I‚Äôve dropped my phone so much that this screen protector is exactly what it says it is and does. My phone is flawless. Touchscreen ability is still very reactive no hang ups. And the price for 3? Affordability 5 stars. Thanks for making great quality products that do what they are advertised to do!
5,What more could you ask for in a product. The screen protector went on easy with the included guide and makes the screen look even better in the process. My phone continues to operate without any issues as some screen protectors in the past have caused issues. I love how clean this looks and the fact that they are edge to edge with room for a case still. The fact that they included three protectors in case of a mishap is nice too as you never know when you will need it. As with any screen protector take your time with installation and make sure you complete the installation in a dust-free environment. I prefer to install mine in the bathroom.  I run the shower on hot for a few minutes to get any dust to settle because of the steam. After that installation is a breeze with the included guide.
3,The screen protectors come with this weird little installation guide track that you are supposed to pop on your phone for correct placement.I recommend not using it and just installing it with your phone case already on so that it aligns to how your phone case fits.With the track guide it was slightly off from my case which caused the bottom left corner to not adhere properly. This caused a very large bubble to constantly stay on my screen preventing me from typing without pushing firmly.Other than the weird fit issues it seems like it should provide adequate protection.I don‚Äôt have any weird glares like other people have mentioned.
5,super easy to install and good thickness to the screen protector. i‚Äôve gone through numerous screen protectors and i can def feel the quality on this one. works with the phone case i already had from before. would repurchase.
5,These exceeded expectations for quality ease of use and overall look. They are thin rounded edge with full frame coverage. A pack of 3 for this price is a steal. I used it on my iPhone 12 AND on my iPhone 11 with one to spare. Will definitely recommend this brand.
5,I‚Äôve been using this brand‚Äôs screen protector for 3 years now it never disappoints me! Very easy to install and fits on perfectly. I would recommend this product to all of other iPhone users :)
5,Great product! I‚Äôve used this for my iPhone XR and 12 pro really liked their quality! Easy to install! Saved me ALOT! It has the all screen protector so it‚Äôs great!
5,These screen protectors are affordable and work. I dropped my phone on concrete the other day and it only slight chipped the protector. It didn‚Äôt shatter like alot of screen protectors do. Worth it!
5,I have tried multiple brands of screen protectors. It is surprising that these do not cost more but are WAY better. The glass protector covers the top notch on the iPhone including camera and sensors. The biggest reason I have bought this brand multiple times now is that for whatever reason they don‚Äôt have bubbles under the screen after I put it on. I hate those air bubbles and idk why these prevent them but they do.
5,This screen protector is the best I've found. It applies easily and goes on neatly. It sticks well and looks great. You can't tell it's on there in that it doesn't block any of the ability to use the screen but it makes the screen safe. I can tell the difference in how protected the screen feels but it doesn't affect how sensitive any of the touch features are. I have no trouble being able to work the apps nor is there any trouble with typing/ texting or dialing. I've had trouble with other screen protectors taking away sensitivity but not this one yet it is protective of my screen. THIS is a great purchase. I recommend it to anyone who really wants to  protect their expensive investment known as an iPhone!!
5,Not all included guides actually work well but this one is precision cut so you get a perfect alignment every time. I like to replace my screen protector every couple months as they eventually get chipped or scratched so having the multi-pack is so convenient and cost-effective.
5,The screen protector is amazing. Easy to apply and will last ages if youre careful with your phone. It feels and looks amazing as if you dont even have a screen protector and dont worry it wont affect the quality of your front facing camera. Overall great product and will definitely recommend!
5,Good quality screen no finger prints. Easy to install. Don‚Äôt go for other brands just busy this. I am buying screen protectors for past 12 years and this is the best
4,Durable easy to install fits full screen corner to corner for full protection
5,This is the best screen protector I‚Äôve ever tried is super easy to install and is 100% worth it for the price. The screen protector is very resistant and really good materials that you can‚Äôt even notice is there but there‚Äôs two things about it that i loved the fact that includes a plastic that it helps you to do a perfect screen protector placement is sastifactory also include other materials like dust remover stickers that maakes a perfect instalation. The screen protector also covers one of the most important spots wich is the notch where is colocated the front camara and face Id that is one of the best part that majority of others screen protector on amazon are missing. In conclusion  10/10 Worth it
5,It‚Äôs easy to use & great condition.
5,Would happily buy again. So far I‚Äôve had my first screen on for almost a year. I‚Äôve dropped my phone quite a few times and I don‚Äôt have a single scratch dent nor has it shattered. Love the installation tool and how it helps to put on the screen as straight as possible and for the price you can‚Äôt beat it.
3,I used to love these screen protectors. However my last purchase was really not up to par. They seem to crack almost every time I drop my phone. Also the guide no longer fits my phone screen. Unfortunate but I also don‚Äôt have the newest phone anymore. Just know that the iPhone 11 doesn‚Äôt fit the guide so you need a steady hand! These protectors still get the job done but don‚Äôt expect too much.
3,I've installed many screen protectors and know most of the tricks to get them on spotless without any dust getting trapped. For some reason these screen protectors are not laying down 100% allowing small areas to look bad Even after letting them sit over night.  It's a shame because the packaging is very well done the glass has a nice feel on the finger and the design of the glass has a nice bezel.  I may have received a bad batch?
5,Item as described
5,Highly recommended.
5,The case used for iPhone 12 is a 2 part. Inner hard plastic two piece with a TPU outer. The internet clicks together but pushes in the edge of the protector so doesn‚Äôt sit properly and bubbles (see photos).  With a different style case would work fine. Installed 2 just to make sure wasn‚Äôt faulty. Probably just have to give up on the case. Last protectors had similar issue but were thinner so less pronounced.
4,they install easily but within a week or so I noticed a diagonal crack on it. obviously it's better to have it there than on my phone but I would be expecting a little bit longer longevity. i also notice a slight difference in screen sensitivity but nothing crazy.
4,The installation fixture centers the shield up perfectly and I like the way it surrounds the upper opening better than the one that Verizon sells. It was a little more difficult to get the air bubbles out than the one I replaced but eventually got it. I did ruin one on my first try by being to aggressive on pushing the air bubbles to the edge.
5,A few things set this item apart from other screen protectors. First it's thinner than comparable glass models. This thinness provided protection from an expensive screen repair while allowing undistorted use of the touch screen. The glass resists smudges and streaks much better than my previous screen. Installation is precise and easy with the included guide. Taking this product over the top is the price- roughly $2 per screen ($5.99 or 3 screens plus the template and cleaning items to install the screens) is much cheaper than products offering the same protection for my phone.
5,Just as promised.Thank you
2,Falls short of edge-to-edge by a good millimeter or two on all 4 sides. Also one of them came already cracked!
4,I received a broken screen protector. I usually never have a problem with Tethys. Must of just been the way the package was handled. But other then that I installed another screen pretty easily.
5,I purchased these screen protectors for my sons phone a year ago and again for my new IPhone 12 Pro recently.  My son is rough on his device and these protective screens have saved the underlying glass twice.  I was impressed enough with the performance that I trusted them for my new phone.  They are easy to install the price is right and if you end up cracking one you have two more waiting to replace it.  Great product!
5,Yery nice and inexpensive...
5,These are very durable and easy to install will purchase again when needed.
5,I've bought many other glass screen  protectors over the years for my various iPhones but this Tethys screen protector is by far the best - it's full screen and so very easy to apply with its frame to guide you as well as the fact it has a very thin bezel so the edges of the glass protector will not chip like those without a bezel. And my iPhone 12 case fit right over it like a glove with no problems at all.  The same with my husband's iPhone 12.  Quite pleased with this product as well as the price!
5,I always buy Tethy‚Äôs now!  These screen protectors cover 99% of the screen with the exception of the ear speaker goes edge to edge and is super easy to install.  Everything is packaged really well directions are easy and it takes minimal time.  And  I‚Äôm crazy for my screen protectors being lined up and straight so the guide/frame that they include is awesome.  Overall love these screen protectors and would buy them again and again.  Highly recommended!
4,I was impressed that the 3-pack came with cleaner dust remover and tools for easy application.  I still had more bubbles than when my local cell phone dealer applies the screen protector but paid less than half the cost to take it there.
4,Not really happy  1st protector has some indents that showed up so had to use another  2nd had 1 small indent but it‚Äôs ok  not sure why it happened but hopefully they will send a replacement
5,It does it‚Äôs job
5,It‚Äôs very nice quality fits with all my cases and I‚Äôve dropped my phone plenty of times and only my most recent drop (which was pretty bad) made a small crack in the protector. With my case on it looks like I don‚Äôt even have a screen protector on.
5,I decided to switch up the phone case shopping considering i wanted something for my upcoming trip outside the US. The shipment was pretty fast had it in less than 2 days. It was so easy to apply the screen saver even providing tools to make life simple. Cleaned my phone up and it looks amazing. Could not even tell I have a SS on the phone especially with the case. Highly recommend for anyone looking for the mall kiosk $45.00 to look here. Plus you get 3 cases!
5,Amazing will continue to buy
5,I‚Äôve used other brands before using this screen protector. This one is very durable and racy to install. Will continue to purchase this brand when others in the family need a new screen protector.
2,I have installed these screen protectors on three different phones. Over the past three weeks after the installation all three phones show different levels of chips at the edges. It appears the screen protectors are a bit too thin. Although they protect the phone they are chipping too easily without major drops.I would consider another product in the future. I had bought these protectors a couple years ago and they worked fine. This last box that I purchased without reception all screen protectors chipped too quickly.
5,Great product for a great price üëç
5,I always get air bubbles when I try and protect my screen. Phone places charge and I need protection. With it being user friendly (from the reviews) I let my teenager put it in and I feelSo much better! üòä Btw I purchased another brand 2 days ago. I was over it before the day ended and ordered these.
5,Can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs there‚Äôs perfect fit with protection
5,Overall pretty good screen protector. Easy to install and the newer style protective screen adhesive is much easier to use than the earlier models of phone screen protectors. The installation tool makes the alignment onto your phone very easy to install without worrying too much about installation at an angle or incorrect location. The price was also a good factor and considering you get three for the price of one I would likely purchase this again.
5,I've had iPhones from the very beginning and have always used third-party cases and screen protectors.  These screen protectors are by far the best I've used and the easiest to install.  The mounting template they provide makes the alignment easy simple and perfect.  No trial and error.  Once installed they stick well; no air bubbles or delaminaiting.  There is no impact to the sensitivity of the screen and fingerprints are non-existent.  Highly recommend!
5,Very good quality and easy to install I really recommend this product!!
5,I highly recommend this company since the service was very quick for both the times I ordered the screen protector. Great prices for all the items. I was very happy with the item I got it was very durable.
5,This is my third attempt at purchasing a quality screen protector and by far this brand has exceeded my expectation!  My first two purchases were more expensive and no matter how I applied them I could not remove the air bubble on the bottom right corner of my phone.  My son witnessed how disappointed I was and when I purchased this brand he offered to apply the screen protector for me.  And viola a perfect fit.  I'm completely happy with this product!!
5,I just love this screen protector. It fit edge to edge and got perfectly aligned to my Iphone 12 Prod screen space. It was so easy to install it and it didn't left any bubbles underneath. The glass screen protector looks completely transparent and invisible while working on phone. It seems to be very durable and I didn't found any issue working with this glass screen on. The touch functionality works absolutely fine.
5,This is my favorite glass screen protector because of two reasons ok actually 3. 1- it has a guide where you snap it on the phone and you put the glass on - really no hassle of alignment. 2 - it‚Äôs full edge protection with the black ring around the edge for continuity. 3 - the price. They will crack under pressure but I appreciate the glass protector cracking before the screen!It always fits with my cases.
5,This is by far the best and cheapest temper glass I have every purchase. The glass was cut perfectly to fit my iPhone 12pro and it came with a plastic guide which made installation super easy. For the price($6) and amount of items that comes in the box(3 temper glass) this is a steal!
4,Well made screen protector. It was a little tricky for me to install but overall really good quality and fits the phone well.
5,I only buy Tethys screen protector! I‚Äôve used them for my old iPhone XR and iPhone 11 and I‚Äôve never been disappointed! Every time my phone is dropped the glass is never broken only the protector. I know this one for iPhone 12 won‚Äôt let me down either! And the installation is so easy and looks flawless  I never have bubbles. Don't look any further you‚Äôve got the best right here.
3,Installation was so so. The glass does break easily and I‚Äôve had issues with the edges not completely adhering to the phone.
5,I've tried multiple screen protectors on various phones throughout the years and nearly all have the same Achilles heel. They are difficult to install or are not case friendly. This screen protector comes with am alignment bumper and everything you need for a stress-free install. The true test is how it reacts to the case. Happy to say the screen doesn't get pushed up in the corners and no bubbling occurs. For the prices hands down the best screen protector I've bought yet on Amazon.
5,Awesome product! Definitely would buy again super easy to install probably one of easiest screen protectors to put on and I like that it comes in a 3pack
5,The guide for putting the screen protector on is INGENIOUS and so easy to install! I am very particular about how my screen protectors go in my phone because I hate when they don‚Äôt line up exactly. This one I just had to line up the top/push it al the way to the edge and it lined up perfectly all the way around the phone! Have already recommended to my family and friends!
5,One of the best screen protectors I have purchased. Easy installation. One of the first times I was able to put on my screen protector without any bubbles. Each screen protector is carefully packaged individually and feel of very expensive packaging. I don‚Äôt see me using my second or third screen protector anytime soon. Definitely worth the money!
2,I normally purchase new screen protectors once a year as I never break them but they get a little scratched up. I bought these two months ago and I‚Äôve already went through all three screen protectors. Not once in my life if I broke three screen protectors in a two month period. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs bad luck or if these are just not the best quality.
5,Excellent purchase for my iPhone 12 it took my no less than 5 minutes to apply and install. The visual quality is outstanding at this price point plus it comes with two spares just in case it shatters (which means it did its job). Love how it covers 99% of the glass portion of the front display.
5,I have always loved their screen protectors! Every time I get a new iPhone I make sure to buy Tethys screen protectors always!!Pros:Great packagingComes with everything you needGreat qualityEasy to installNo air bubblesIt last forever even when I drop it constantly!!Other screen protectors crack on impact theses don‚ÄôtAnd I still have two more to goThanks happy customer üòÉ
5,Fit good easy to install. Screen stays clear no fingerprints!
5,This has by far been the best screen protector I‚Äôve purchased. I‚Äôm very clumsy and drop my phone constantly all the other protectors I‚Äôve tired has broken at the first drop. Not this one!!! Still lasting after a million drops.
5,I found the application to be super easy and when I was done it looked completely factory as if there wasn't anyone on. The touch responsiveness and feel is great as well.
5,Love the full screen design good quality!
5,These screen protectors are very easy to install. You can't go wrong with the guides that are provided. They do not hamper the touch of the screen or the visibility of the display. I like that you can use one size for multiple phones and if the size of the model of iPhone varies too greatly they provide an additional guide tool. I have bought them multiple times and will continue to!
5,Screen protectors fit great and go on smoothly. I‚Äôm normally pretty good at putting screen protectors on with no guide but used the one that came with these and worked great. Can‚Äôt say much for the durability just yet but it covers the whole screen and is crystal clear üëç at a great price too
5,I‚Äôve used Tethys protectors exclusively since 2017. I love the plastic guide that comes with each order. It makes installation goof proof. The protectors themselves have lasted 8-12 months for me. And I‚Äôm rough with my phones!Every time I upgrade my iPhone I order more Tethys screen protectors. Highly recommend.
5,The value you receive from $6 ‚Äî these screen protectors are full screen and heavy. The install was super simple and easy from the guide stickers and template to having the proper materials to clean your screen and ensure a seamless install. Would highly recommend!!!!
5,this screen protector saved me from buying another phone a few times. Is worth every penny. Love the product. Best protector in the market.
5,These glass screen protectors are top class. My family have used these over the past 2 years on various iPhone models. The quality of the product is very good and consistent. The glass is durable & I like the blacked out edge it makes the protector appear to be part of the phone. I also really enjoy the ease of application with the plastic phone specific alignment tool.
3,This product was less than <$7 for 3 so I cannot complain much. It was easy to install and I like the fact that it has a ‚Äúfull screen‚Äù design that covers even the notch (except for speakers).Only thing I notice was that it gets micro-scratches easily but I didn‚Äôt buy it for no scratches I bought it as basic protection for my screen which is good.
4,Easy to use and durable!!
5,I have purchased over 10 packs from this brand. For me personally it's the only brand I trust.  I highly recommend it.
5,These screen protectors are awesome.  After trying a few other brands that always seem to crack we are happy with this purchase.  They have a thicker edge as to prevent those cracks you tend to get from the edge.  The shipping was quick and the install was very simple thanks to the included guides.
5,This product is of very good quality easy to install.This product packaging is mind blowing and instructions on how to install are very helpful. This is value for money and offers great protection to phone. I got 3 screen guards in this pack along with cleaning wipes at this price which is impressive
5,super easy to put on. usually i can‚Äôt manage to get a screen protector straight but this made it really easy to get it on perfectly. these were so cheap and since they came with several i did a drop test and scratch test and they performed exactly how i would‚Äôve wanted them to!
5,I continue to use these screen protectors with every phone upgrade I make. I love them and they are fool proof to install do not crack easily and have a glass like crystal clear finish once installed. I won‚Äôt buy any other and will continue to use these in the future.
5,Work well and hold up pretty nice with normal use.
4,Good screen protector. Great price. Easy install.
5,I have heavy usage on my phone and use a screen protector to keep my phone scratch-free. This is a good quality screen protector. It is easy to install fits well and functions as desired. Good value and will buy again.
5,Fit like a glove on my I-Phone 12Pro. Cannot beat the price and efficacy. Highly recommend!
5,The guide Fran makes it really easy to install. You get three in a pack which makes them very affordable. The notch is also not there and it makes the screen protector harder to notice once it‚Äôs on. I always buy these protectors for my family‚Äôs iphones
5,This is the second time I‚Äôve used these screen savers! They are awesome and I have them on my entire family‚Äôs phones (4 total). When we traded our old phones in and took the screen savers off the phones looked brand new after removing the screen savers!
5,This is easy to install and pretty durable. Love that it covers the entire screen. Looks amazing!
5,I use this screen protector many years and I think it‚Äôs the best one
5,I‚Äôve had this on my phone for a month and it still looks brand new. Best protector I ever got
5,Better than the screen protectors from Verizon! I paid a lot of money for a liquid screen protector that easily scratched. I ended up back here to get the screen protector I‚Äôve had on many previous phones. Very satisfied. Just wish they had one that fit my husband‚Äôs iPhone 12 mini.
5,All I can say is what are you waiting for. This product  is soo easy to install. The glass screen protector fits my phone soo prefect. I will do a review a month to see how the glass protector is holding up!!!
5,One of the things I like about this product that it‚Äôs a durable screen protector. It has two screen guides that makes installing easier than other screen protectors I‚Äôve had in the past. The price isn‚Äôt too bad it‚Äôs worth the price I think.
5,Loved that this came with everything I needed to install the screen protector. It was super easy to install and very affordable!
5,Took my phone to the Apple store to get my screen cracked fixed without realizing the cover was on. This cover is excellent. Even the Apple technician was surprised! The screen cover saved my phone!
5,I use these screen protectors on all the phones I own for my whole family.They have consistently protected the phones from damage when dropped and when things drop on them. The phones look brand new and have been completely protected.
5,Easy to install. The guide makes it simple to align the protector.
5,Full screen protection. I used the same Glass protestor before on my iPhone XR for 3 years . Trade my old iPhone for a new iPhone 12 Pro and get top dollars due to the good shape of the phoneI will recommend the use of this screen protector
5,I like this screen protector it‚Äôs very easy to apply and The package includes all the necessary tools for you. Good value and glass seems very durable as well.

5,Best screen protector purchased. Even comes with a guide for installation.
5,This screen protectors claim are all true. I am constantly dropping my phone and did the other day‚Ä¶The protector cracked but phone glass did not. I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Just put a new one on!
2,Very hard to apply. Waisted two. Air bubbles and lint. Followed directions!
5,Great deal with applicator and high quality smudge coating‚Ä¶will be buying again for sure
5,I love this!!!! Easy installation and long-lasting. Definitely worth the buy.

5,I like the screen protector so much. It's a smart purchase. I love it. Easy to instala and high durability.
5,The installation frame made it so easy to apply to screen protector in the correct spot.
5,Love that it came with the guide to help the installation and also great quality. My phone looks so good cant even tell that theres a tempered glass it fits the phone perfectly!
5,The newer style protective screen adhesive is much easier to use than the earlier models of phone screen protectors. The installation tool makes the alignment onto your phone very easy to install.

5,These are the only kind of protectors I buy.
3,It is not that fully coverage and not 2.5D as well
5,PHONE SCREEN PROTECTION
2,I ALWAYS purchase Tethys full framed screen shields. I have had zero issues with them for my IPhone XS Max. I mean when I say I buy them a lot I‚Äôm really not kidding. I buy three every other month because of my job. They have protected my phones. But I just purchased the iPhone 12 Pro 6.1 inch. So again went to Tethys. Anyways They arrived today and I immediately went and got my phone to put the screen protector on and the case before I left my house with my phone. Well I‚Äôm a professional putting these things on. These didn‚Äôt last taking them off the protective backing and onto the screen. I was using the stickers you use for placement to lift up and place and these things just cracked. Maybe a bad batch again I have never had this happen before. I‚Äôm EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.
5,This is a wonderful screen protector. I‚Äôve had it on my phone for a week now and I have no complaints. Very smooth application and an all-around great product.
5,Exactly as described! These are a great value and easy to install with the accompanied tools and instructions. They adhere really nicely to the phone. No bubbles! Very happy with my purchase!
5,I love these screen protectors they work great because they feel like the normal screen and they are very easy to install not to mention how good and sleek they look on my phone

5,Have been using Tethys for awhile now. Won‚Äôt use anything else! Has protected our phones many times! Highly recommend!
5,works great
5,I‚Äôve broken my share of phone screens but I‚Äôm super confident now that I have this. Super easy to install and there‚Äôs zero effect to the clarity of or responsiveness of the screen.

5,Really strong material and very easy to install i would definitely buy again.
3,Slightly smaller then the screen of my iphone 12 pro. And the sensitive is off. Not responsive
5,Very easy to install!! Scratch resistant too seeing as how my grandson immediately threw the phone down and it both protected the phone AND there weren‚Äôt any scratches!
5,I love the quality of these screen protectors. I will continue to buy from this brand.
5,i would buy again. very affordable and durable
5,I have been buying these screen protectors for years. BESTTTT ones yet I have dropped my phone many times and I haven‚Äôt had it crack. Wont regret it.
5,very good quality. 3 pies  really good price .
5,Great product. Edge to edge protection. Easy instructions to make you place the screen protector perfectly. Packaging looks high end and if great quality.
3,Good for the price. Threw away the first one kept getting dust all underneath. Did the second one and impossible to get all the bubbles out
5,Edge to edge coverage. Excellent product. Worth every penny. iPhone 12 is not cheap so well worth it protection for it‚Ä¶comes in expensive packaging üëè
5,The kits comes with an easy assembly and the screen protector itself is strong and reliable.
5,I‚Äôd definitely order this brand again. It was so easy to install and a great value for the money.

5,3 screen protectors for a reasonable price
5,Easy to put on phone!
5,Easy to install and feels great!
2,The first one I installed had two large bubbles‚Ä¶ Ended up tossing that one and trying again. Every protective screen I‚Äôve ever installed had a small cleaning cloth as the final step before laying the screen this does not. I cleaned the screen again and finished with the cleaning cloth for my sunglasses.  Still one tiny bubble which I will tolerate for as long as I can before trying the third time and ordering a different brand. I did like the frame concept to ensure the screen was straight but other brands I‚Äôve used seem to ‚Äúsuck‚Äù to the screen better.
5,Nice screen protector. Easy to install. Installation frame was easy to use. Definitely recommend!
5,The product comes with an easy setup tool and everything you need. For the price this product is excellent.
5,Very Easy to install product

5,It‚Äôs a great buy. It‚Äôs worth the money
5,High quality screen protector. Will buy more if needed.
1,When looking at the reviews these screens protectors were rated among the highest. My wife and I had them on our phone for about a month before they cracked from being dropped. Our phones were not dropped from a high distance at all. I am very disappointed in the quality of the screen protector!!!
5,Easiest screen I‚Äôve installed so far
5,Love this GLASS screen protector üíé
5,It‚Äôs a great product
5,Easy to install
5,Easy to install and works great.
5,Loved it thanks
5,Great product
5,easy to install
5,Good stuff
5,Easy to install
2,One of the screen protectors has a deep scratch right out of the box. Which was only visible after the install. Doesn‚Äôt feel like a 9H hardness glass. The guidance frame is good plus. Makes it easy to install.
2,Now this company has been amazing for my iPhone 11 Pro Max I never had an issue. But with my iPhone 12 Pro Max I had two out of three break within a week. And I‚Äôm in retail so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm at construction sites or what-have-you. But maybe it was just a fluke? Idk.
1,Broke SO EASY. Broke while I was putting it on and once I got a non-broken one on it doesn‚Äôt fully sit
2,Wasted 2 of these trying to make it fit the 12 the 12 pro and 12 are not the same size although it may seem that way. The 12 has beveled edges.
1,I got these a week ago and I‚Äôm already on the last one in the pack because they just crack without your phone being dropped. Horrible quality.
2,I‚Äôve gone thru 4 different screen shields from this company. The glass is very delicate. It‚Äôs broken 3 times in my pocket alone! No tight jeans and no back pockets. Time to try another brand.
1,Read the product description and thought it will last. Unfortunately now down to the last protector.
2,We put these on our phones and after just one week 2 of the 3 started coming off on one of the corners creating big air bubbles.
1,I tried with 2 of the sreen protectorFew hours last perfectThen they peel off from different corners
1,Much more complicated to install than others on the market. I meticulously went through the process of cleaning and inspecting all of the parts three times and still somehow ended up with dust bubbles or a crooked screen. Contacted Tethys regarding their guarantee (printed on the box) and they wouldn‚Äôt honor it since I bought them on Amazon. Frustrating experience all around. Ended up buying otter box brand from my local Walmart and it installed perfectly on the first try.
1,Easy to install touchscreen and good adhesive But it does not fit iPhone 12
1,Poor quality. I installed one Friday afternoon and it‚Äôs already scratched. Not durable or hard. Easy to install with the guide but it doesn‚Äôt hold up.
1,Left a dozen bubbles on the edge of phone screen
1,Simply horrible. Don‚Äôt waste your money/time
1,i went through all 3 of them and nun of them stuck onto my phone all of them as bubbles that wouldn‚Äôt go away
1,I purchased this screen protector put it on and not even 24 hours later the screen protector cracked and chipped it‚Äôs not a good screen protector and does not last
1,Every single one of these the corner lifts immediately after installation.  I‚Äôve never had a problem with a screen protector before.  It is not the case either.
1,Cracks very easily whit any drop definitely no buy it again
1,I put this on and it cracked after 2 days! I didn‚Äôt drop my phone or hit it against anything but somehow it still cracked! You get what you pay for these are cheap garbage.
1,i used two already and they are very brittle.. breaks easily.
1,No matter how careful I was I got air bubbles I couldn't get out and dust under the glass. so frustrating. I'm ordering different one today.
1,Cracks very easy
1,I‚Äôm not sure if I had gotten a good batch or not but I ordered two sets and one of the sets that I got bubbled up on the edges and continued to peel as it seemed like it was just a little too big so it interfered with the case.
1,The screen does not stick properly. I‚Äôve used all 3 protectors and they lifted within a few days. I‚Äôm surprised because I‚Äôve purchased this brand before without issue
1,Got the package and it has slimy sticky substances On it
1,I had it for three days and I dropped my phone from about 2 feet corners cracked and pieces of it started chipping off so it‚Äôs very sharp and jagged.
1,I‚Äôve dropped my phone (with a case on it) twice from a seated position and two of the screen protectors have cracked completely. Not durable. Look elsewhere.
1,This screen protector does NOT fit the iPhone pro 13! The whole for the speaker is not positioned correctly. Do not buy!!!
1,ive never had ANY screen protector haze over 24hrs after install.  complete garbage.  spend more for spigen or ESR ..this is a waste
1,Junk. Doesn‚Äôt protect and takes nothing to make cracks
1,Got an used one.. it was missing one protector as well..
1,It would break in one drop.Very bad quality
1,I received only two screen  protectors
1,Not good
1,Screen protector is not durable
1,Screen covers came with glass shattered. Unusable.
5,The screen protectors are great and I would recommend it to anyone.
3,Had trouble installing #1. Wierd spot on it. Then it broke trying to rid that spot.#2 went on without a problem.Very happy with how easy use of phone screen & protection.
5,I‚Äôm on my 4th screen protector after 4 months. I‚Äôm rough with my things but that‚Äôs why I bought this product they do exactly what they say they protect your screen The screen protector has broken when I have dropped it or been rough with it or if I place it inside of my carry bag and there‚Äôs something else in there for it to bang up against but overall it has done its job and it has kept my screen intact on my iPhone 12. These are cheap and I guess at the end of the day you get what you pay for it but you also get a protected phone screen think about that.
5,Have ordered these for each of our phones. Good quality great price look good and work great.
5,Super easy to install on my iPhone XR and was very durable however I tried to use on iPhone 12 and it lifts up whenever I try to put the phone case on. Not sure if it‚Äôs because of the edges of my case so not taking stars off for that.
5,I always buy this one because it cover all the screen
5,Great quality. Came with multiple which was nice. And now I can rest assured that I have backup.
5,I love how the prouduct came with a guide so you can put on the screen perfectly and it also came with wipes so you can clean the finger prints before you put the screen protector on.
5,This product is great and very useful I don‚Äôt have to worry about having to go to a phone repair company again!
5,Worked well easy to install
5,Was able to fit it right on my wife‚Äôs phone! With ease and glad we have a couple left just in case
5,Easy to install good quality.
5,Super easy to put on. There‚Äôs stickers and guides to help but I found it easy enough to use without.Make sure to use the wipes to clean and the dust absorber to clean the phone properly. Can‚Äôt even tell it is there and love the added protection
5,As an IT person I have had experience with several different brands of tempered glass companies. This company and its products outweigh the competition by far. The plastic guide makes a huge difference between having the glass be correct or slightly to the side. At this price point you cannot go wrong. I have been purchasing their products for two years and will continue to do so.
2,One day I dropped my phone on the floor and after I picked it up the shattered screen protector cut my finger. It hurt like hell. It was a small cut but I think bit of pieces went into my skin. I wanted to examine my finger that day but too bad I was running late for work. I could only put a band aid on it. I wish I would have gone to urgent care or something. And I also wish I took pictures for proof of my injury. I‚Äôm just putting out there that when the screen breaks the plastic glass is sharp.
5,I have purchased many screen protectors in my lifetime of owning smart phones.  After trying them all I finally found one that is above the others.  The guide to install the screen protector makes a huge difference.  And the price for 3 of them beats the prices I‚Äôve found elsewhere.  These are the best.  (NOTE: There have been a few instances where there seemed to be an air pocket in the middle of the screen that I couldn‚Äôt get rid of.  When I checked the following morning it had resolved itself.)
5,The only glass protectors to buy. Fit perfect no bubbles easy to install and last for a long time.
5,I have been using this screen protector on my IPHONE 12 for over a week.  This product is comparable to other name brands out there.  It came with instructions and was easy to install.  In the box you will find 3 protectors a cleaning cloth and dry wipe cloth.  I definitely would recommend this product at this price and for anyone who has families who have more than one IPHONE 12.
5,I absolutely love this product. Install difficulty had always been my top concern but this is very easy to install. I am absolutely a rookie for this type of thing but there is no bubble after I try installing it. My phone was accidentally dropped on the floor very hard and the screen took the entire damage and there was no scratch or crack on my phone screen. So I changed the protection screen and easy to install again. And later on it was accidentally dropped on the floor again and still no scratch to the screen of my phone. What a savior and this is one of the best products I have bought.
5,These screens protectors are a lot better than ones from AT&T and other phone stores as they cost a fraction of what ones you get at the stores! Love the easy to follow install instructions and the thickness of the protector!
5,I‚Äôve purchased these screen protectors a few times already. I find them superior to the ones you purchase near the register of most stores and the price is right.
5,This is the 4th set of screen protectors I‚Äôve bought from Tethys. Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ they just work. Everyone I know with an iPhone has received a set of protectors because they simply work and protect your phone. That‚Äôs what matters! I‚Äôve replaced mine 3 times so far after damaging them with my keys drops etc. and I‚Äôll keep buying this brand.
2,I always buy inexpensive screen protectors off amazon and I've never had a problem with them before I bought these. I went through all three just trying to get them to securely adhere to my phone without bubbles. They didn't secure around the edges they bubble up and peel. There were bubbles under the screen protector that I couldn't get out. And this is after using the cleaning wipes and the dust removing stickers and using the guide provided. On my third try I didn't use the plastic guide used to position it correctly and it worked well enough to leave it on my phone until I could order something else.
5,Great product. This was my second order from this brand and I would definitely order more when the time comes.
5,Just put this on my phone so not sure yet about durability but it was super easy to put on. Great price for a three pack!
5,Very quick and easy installation.
4,Packaged well. Comes with everything required to self install the screen protector. The frame that came in the package could have been better though as it wasn‚Äôt the perfect fit for the screen protector. I ended up not using the frame. Good value for money otherwise.
5,Easy to install in my iPhone 12 Pro to protect screen. Great material.
5,Strong
5,This my 2nd time buying the screen protector for my iPhone 12 Pro and it‚Äôs proven to me that this protector is the best I bought in the market and the added bonus that it come 3 in a pack . Definitely recommend this screen protector! Price is great for a good quality screen Protector.
5,I used this brand for my iPhone X so when I upgraded to the iPhone 12 Pro I didn‚Äôt hesitate to get the same brand. I love the full coverage and durability!
5,Easy installation. Screen is clear and looking good.
5,Its cheap its literally the same as the other brand name glass protectors. What is there to complain about? Its great!
5,Easy to use and install. Have kept all my phone screens protected.  So far it‚Äôs a good product.
5,Excellent
5,The screen protector is easy to install with the provided frame.Just clean well your phone screen before applying the screen protector.
5,i have used this product and i am very happy with it because its easy to install and durable at the same time
5,I was able to apply this screen in under 2 minutes. Love it
5,Easiest application out of all the screen protectorsI have bought. Also was easy to get the bubbles out only tooks me a few mins to clean and apply.
5,Very good fit for iPhone 12pro
5,This broke in one day but I kept it on for about a week and by the end of the week it was totally shattered and glass was coming off of it.
5,Easy to install and very sturdy! Love it and great price!
5,I was incredibly surprised at how easy this was to install. I always get nervous about bubbles being left on the screen but the durability of this product prevented that from happening. It feels like I don't even have a protector on. The screen reacts to my touch perfectly and so far the screen has been clear and hasn't had a streak or a mark on it. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their screen!!
5,One of the best screen protector I‚Äôve use and easy to install.
5,Easy to install seems sturdy and cover screen perfectly.
5,Easy to use & durable with full screen
5,My iPhone's screen is probably defective. The last 5 or so screen protectors started peeling off at the upper right corner within a couple of days. This one's holding up so far and its been three weeks since I installed it.
5,What a bargain. These screen protectors are perfect. Easy and flawless installation thanks to the plastic guides included. Case friendly too!
5,Quick clean install and doesn't effect usability.
5,I always buy this brand of screen protector when I change my phone. It has saved 3 of my iPhones from cracks. This screen protector lets me rest easy. I live a very busy life constantly on the move and my phone has fallen countless times. The screen is always good. I‚Äôll always buy screen protectors from this brand.  Installation is also ridiculously easy with the plastic guide they provide.
5,Very easy to install and the most durable screen protector I‚Äôve ever seen yet.
5,Simply perfect price can‚Äôt be beat and quality is bar none.  Very impressed install was a breeze and ended up perfect no bubbles never happens to me.  I really like the black borders on the glass ties right into my otterbox commuter.  I don‚Äôt know what else to say there are many options here on amazon and at first I was uncertain which to purchase.  For the price of these I thought oh well all I can say is I won‚Äôt be looking anywhere else.  Awesome super satisfied.
5,The guidance frame that comes with these screen protectors makes the install process so easy! I‚Äôve used three other screen protector brands and always had an issue with getting air bubbles out not the case here! Super quick easy and no bubbles!
5,Pretty good packaging really sleek with extra accessories
5,I loved the guide that is included with the screen protectors. We had no problems with bubbles or alignment. Highly recommended.
5,Very friendly designed product easy to apply with the included guide no bubble with just a little push hopefully thick enough to sustain a hit.
5,Install was simple and actually worked the first time.  I really appreciated the plastic guide that came with the protector to make the install simple. The best glass protector I‚Äôve owned so far.
5,This was one of the cheaper screen protectors on Amazon so I was worried it would feel cheap or somehow sub-par. I went ahead and bought it anyway because of all the positive reviews. It‚Äôs great! It was easy to install and feels as nice as the more expensive ones I‚Äôve bought in the past! Hopefully it stands the rest of time!
5,Came in a pack of 3 screen protectors for iPhone 12 Pro along with all the supplies (wipes stickers and a guide of where to put the screen). The installation was really easy. My screen is completely protected and fits well in my case!
5,Very easy to install.
5,It's easy to install and very cheap
5,I‚Äôve used other screen protectors and this was the by far the easiest one to apply. It‚Äôs clear responsive and fits well with my case. It‚Äôs also cost effective. Thanks!
5,Very easy to install! And came very fast in the mail so far very durable. I like it
5,Quick and easy insulation. Like the black lining the screen protector blinds in with the black around the screen. Touch screen works as well as Face ID. Just put it on so I can‚Äôt comment about durability.
5,I keep coming back to this product after trying several others. These are by far the best was screen cover that works the first time and lasts a long time
5,Overall a great screen protector and its easy to install. Good edge to edge protection. No complaints
5,This is my favorite screen protector. I‚Äôve used this one on my past two phones and it has protected them flawlessly! Super easy to install and protects your screen from damage. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more!
5,I have never had such a durable and solid screen protector. Looks really good as well. Looks like it is the actual screen.
5,Easy to put on and sturdy. Highly recommend

5,It exceeded my expectations. Great value all around. Seems to be the perfect balance of being easy to work with and offering needed protection.
5,Very easy to install
5,Thick protector for my screen!! Love love !!! Even came with 3 !!!!
5,I've used this company for several different cellphones and they always fit and work as designed. Easy to install and remove to replace as necessary. A good value as well.
5,Quality product. The allotment bracket is the game changer.
5,Great product. Easy to install. Very thick glass.
5,Screen Protector is easy to install with the frame and clear instructions. One of the best value and quality screen protectors I have used so far.
5,Love how this screen protector comes with everything you need to ensure an easy install. Comes with a plastic frame to help you align it perfectly. I like the full coverage on my screen as well - so it's less obvious that you have a screen protector on your phone.
2,little crack already
5,As described. Best value I could find
5,Great case easy to install
5,I began to buy these screen protectors with my iPhone 11 and fell in love with them instantly. The quality is wonderful! I have small children who drop my phone all the time and these do exactly what they‚Äôre supposed to. With as many times my phone falls these protectors don‚Äôt break easily. I have recommended them many many times to friends and family. I love the quality and how it covers your screen from edge to edge! Oh! And just bc the prices seems low don‚Äôt sleep on them. The best screen protectors ever !!!
5,I love how sturdy it feels. No problems what so ever with the touch screen as you can see I used one already and real easy to install and so far the durability it‚Äôs great ! Comes with everything you need to install also comes with a manual.
5,The included piece that helps you install the shield correctly the first time is so important. In the past I‚Äôve had to peel the screen protector off several times to get it in the correct position and they would lose their stickiness and bubbles would form under the shield. This was so simple to install and a quality product.
5,Easy to apply and durable.
5,Completely covers the iPhone12 screen. The case did not interfere with the screen protector.  Really light weight and makes iPhone feel like an iPhone.
5,I bought this brand because I was familiar with it from a previous phone. I like how easy it is to install with the provided guide. Just align the top well and the rest falls into place. My only gripe with this brand would be the durability‚Ä¶ I recall on my previous phone that they can crack fairly easily so I‚Äôd definitely apply for the warranty. Other than that it looks nice and is priced right.
5,Make sure screen is dust free. They provide everything to get job done. Alignment frame is very useful for positioning glass protection. Can‚Äôt even notice it‚Äôs there because of edge to edge fitting.
5,this is a good screen protector protects my phone very well.
5,I love that these come in packs of three I am very rough on my phone and it is too expensive of an investment to not protect it. I used to be a Zagg or nah for all my screens. I would go in and have them apply it and they are guaranteed for life so I would go in and get the replacements. This is a far better deal and super easy to apply well my husband does it :) comes with protection for the cameras not as great they crack super easy comes with three as well. Gave me funky pictures for a bit until I realized the same camera protection had a crack. My case has a good ridge of camera protection!
5,These screen protectors are amazing!! It was really easy to install and I‚Äôve had no issues with putting my cases on my phone. The full coverage definitely a plus!!
5,The screen protector guidance tool is really nice. Makes aligning and installing very easy.
5,Bonito y economico
5,Protecci√≥n de mi telefono
5,Easy to install. Doesn‚Äôt effect the use of the phone features.
5,This brand is my go to for screen protectors. The glass seems thicker and more durable. Plus they throw in 2 extra screens and all the tools you need to do it.
5,I really liked the screen protector guide that comes with the product it really helps get it on straight and easily. The different items that come with the protectors such as the dust stickers and guide stickers help as well as it can be difficult to not get dust or hair on the underside of the protector without them. I really enjoy this product and definitely would buy it again!
5,Easy to use and comes with everything you need! Love the tool they give to help with placement. Only protector i use on my phones!
5,The price and easy to install
5,This is a great screen protector as far as I can tell. The fit from edge to edge is perfect and the included frame makes it easy to line up. The instructions state to align the top of the protector first and then tack down the rest of it. This may have led to some bubbles in my installation or it may have been simple user error. I‚Äôve witnessed several occasions where ‚Äúexperts‚Äù have ended up with the same results after installing significantly more expensive protectors. The bubble may settle and if they do I will append my review. As usual with these things it‚Äôs a small gripe because it doesn‚Äôt impact the image much if at all when the screen is lit up. The edge to edge fit makes it much easier to select things at the very edge of the screen so that‚Äôs a win in my book. And the value is amazing. 3 protectors for $7? You can pay a bundle more for identical quality. And obviously I‚Äôm not going to drop my phone to test this out so I will reserve the right to update my review if the protector fails to protect. But so far very happy with it.EDIT: As I suspected the application bubbles disappeared after a day or two. Now it looks almost perfect. One bubble remains but that‚Äôs because I let a piece of dust get in there. So you know‚Ä¶ user error.
5,Very easy to use! Holds up great
5,Fit perfectly and almost can‚Äôt tell this is even on once installed. Also since the edges are blacked out you don‚Äôt get the rainbow light bleed like other glass protectors. Would buy again!
5,With a handful of smartphone purchases throughout the recent years I would have to say Tethys Glass Screen Protector has to be the best screen protector out there! For starters the quality of each glass protector that are individually wrapped feels of high quality. I have bought many screen protectors and you can tell Tethys took the time to make sure that consumers will be satisfied with packaging and product. I was able to install my screen protector in a matter of minutes and for the first time ever with NO bubbles on my screen! I was able to install it so perfectly you can‚Äôt even tell I have one installed. You get 3 protectors in a box and unless something happens to my screen protector / phone it doesn‚Äôt look like I will be changing out my screen protector any time soon. I‚Äôm sure these protectors will be lasting me a very very long time. Go with this product!
5,Amazing screen protector! I was a little hesitant to buy it because of how cheap it is but it has definitely surprised the heck out of me. Also a definite bonus that it comes with 3 and everything you need to properly put it on. I love it and will definitely buy again!
5,Great quality and extremely easy to install with no air bubbles...I was amazed with the output for the price. Good purchase!
5,No observable touch screen degradation. Not hard to install
5,Easy to install with the provided guide.
5,This was super easy to install and fits perfectly. I‚Äôve dropped my phone numerous times and it hasn‚Äôt cracked or chipped. It‚Äôs been on almost 6 months.
5,Truly edge to edge screen saver. I dropped my phone face down on cement. The screen saver cracked but not my screen.
5,Serves its purpose of keeping the screen free of damage and is easy to apply.
5,This is perfect fit for iphone 12. Its easy to install because it comes with the setting frame. Hopefully it strong enough to protect my phone.
5,Screen protector is relatively easy to apply and works effectively. Have dropped it a couple of times on hardwood with no visible damage.
5,The screen protector was very easy to apply and seems to work well. I haven‚Äôt dropped my phone yet but I‚Äôm fairly confident that it would protect the phone
5,Easy to install and is touch receptive. Provides full coverage. Works with 12 and 12pro
5,A few things set this item apart from other screen protectors.  First it's thinner than comparable glass models.  This thinness provided protection from an expensive screen repair while allowing undistorted use of the touch screen.  The glass resists smudges and streaks much better than my previous screen.  Installation is precise and easy with the included guide.  Taking this product over the top is the price- roughly $2 per screen ($5.99 or 3 screens plus the template and cleaning items to install the screens) is much cheaper than products offering the same protection for my phone.
5,Super easy to install easy instructions gives step by step and all the tools you need. Looks great and can barley tell it‚Äôs there. I drop my phone constantly and the protector is still intact. Would recommend especially for the price!!!
4,my previous one was edge to edge. this has a little gaps.
5,Works great! We‚Äôll worth it
5,Didn‚Äôt have any trouble installing it.
5,I have purchased from this company multiple times for our iPhones. Always easy to install. It has a plastic frame that guides application like similar products. The difference is that once the screen protector is laid on top of the phone it does most of the work! You see it adhering and just finish up with some pressing of your own. Very happy with this product.
5,these protectors work great!!!!
5,This screen protector comes with everything you need to apply to your phone!Follow the directions and it will be perfect!!!  easy to understand directions.
5,Esa√∫ to install and looks amazing feels good and doesn‚Äôt interfiere with touch.

5,I have used other TETHYS screen protectors before.  They are easy to install look great once installed and it doesn't interfere with the touch screen.  The same goes for this one on my iPhone 12.  It's super easy to install and the box they ship has everything you need to install.  All you have to do is clean the screen install the plastic installation frame use one of the dust stickers to make sure you don't get any bubbles from super tiny dust particles and line up the screen protector and slowly lower it onto the phone.  Practically installs itself after that.  I love these and they work great!  Thanks TETHYS for another great product.
5,Awesome product: went on easy and no bubbles!
5,Great
4,Tethys glass is the greatest thing for your phone to protect!!
5,The screen protector itself is extremely high quality and installation tools provided are actually useful. Highly recommend this product. Also do not purchase the rhidon branded ones‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre trash
5,Came in super fast these protectors always last me a long time!
5,Very Easy to install. Very pleased with purchase.
5,This is the best one so far for the price.
5,In an age where phones are our extended assitant The average person doesnt have the time to replace a shattered screen. This product acts as an added security measure for your latest iPhone Device. All the needed accessories are included with this kit to assure your added protection. Would reccomend to anyone!
5,It comes with the frame which makes the application of screen protector easier without leaving any air bubbles.
5,Love this product. Easy to install; protects my phone. You get 3 sets inside. Love it.
1,All 3 protectors were cracked in the upper right corner.  Seem rather flimsy.
5,It‚Äôs quality is good. It has three pieces and only costs 6.95 Usd. Easy installation.
5,I found this easy to get on my device without lifting or bubbles. It comes with everything you need to place it correctly on your phone. It's one of those glass screen protectors so I'm confident that if I were to do something that might crack my screen it would just crack the protector (or nothing at all!).
5,excellent quality I have already had this brand of protectors and they are the best I have had a very high clarity like no other
5,Compared to other options this was so easy to apply to my phone. The frame makes it soooo effortless.
5,Very easy to install! Touch screen works magnificently. And it was inexpensive! Super glad I found this product!
4,It can protects my phone good quality.
5,These are the absolute best tempered glass screen protectors for your iPhone! I have purchased others because they were ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù but they were garbage. These are simple to install have superior clarity and does the job of you drop your phone.
5,These are the best we have used that don‚Äôt leave bubbles under the cover
5,Like this product. Easy to use.
5,Great Quality!! I‚Äôm super impressed. Very easy to install and comes with a 1year Warranty. Highly recommend.

5,Best screen protector I‚Äôve ever came across Thanks
5,Great product! Works really well with the iPhone 12. Everything you need to apply screen is in the box. It‚Äôs easy to apply and no air bubbles.  I am very satisfied with the screen protector and it is better than the others I have purchased in the past.
5,I‚Äôve used this brand for years and it‚Äôs by far the best screen protector out there. The outline makes it easy to install and it‚Äôs good quality for the price. I used this same brand on my XR until I got this new phone and it‚Äôs the only brand i will ever buy.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Very easy to install super affordable and great quality.
5,I've used this brand of glass screen protectors for several years now.  They have saved my phone so many times!  The display is still crystal clear and responsive to touch.  The screens are protective but don't feel like added bulk.  I have had the screen protector get scratched or cracked but peel it off and my phone screen was still in perfect shape.  These are easy to install and I'd recommend!
5,Easy to install
5,By far one of the best products.Easy to install
5,10/10 recommended! Super easy to install with the guide it‚Äôs basically foolproof! I love the edge to edge protector and it doesn‚Äôt even look like there‚Äôs a screen protector on the phone!
5,Great product. Easy application and the glass quality is great. Would definitely recommend.
5,I liked.
5,I received this item next day that was fast. It came with everything needed to put the protector screen properly on my iPhone. This will hopefully help protect my phone when I put in my pocket with my keys from scratching the screen. It came three screen protectors in the box so I will switch out even if one gets damaged. Great price for three screen protectors.
5,Unlike some glass screen savers TETHYS goes right to the edge of the screen. I use these exclusively for my kids iPhone 12 Pros. The jig kit makes the installation a snap. Everything is included for even the beginner to create a professional installation!
4,It‚Äôs a good product but I didn't like the black border
5,Easy to install. Covers entire screen. Front camera seems clear.
5,I‚Äôve tried several screen protectors and they al seem to break easily or start peeling off around the edges. This one has been great so far! It‚Äôs durable and provides good coverage yet doesn‚Äôt affect the functionality of the phone. Also easy to install. Glad I found this one.
5,Helpful frames for install
5,Very easy to install I‚Äôve already installed this on 4 off my family members phones. It looks great. Well it looks like you have nothing at all aligned perfectly when you follow directions make sure you start from top edge. How durable is it? Time will tell but I can say it feels good to have this glass protector on the screen of the phone.
