5,Works perfect for my Mac Air
5,My old dongle another cheaper brand failed.  Bought this one and it is working great. It could be better with a few more ports.
5,I have not used that much so far.  But during my initial test it seems to be fine.  Exactly as described.
5,Needed a hub for my new MacBook Pro. Wanted a device that I could trust. This came through. All the usb devices I have tried work the hdmi drives my monitor and I can easily attach and detach my notebook now. Doesn’t get hot and is detected each time. Secures well. I would recommend this hub as a light and portable hub that will last!
5,I’m editing this review. I figured out my HDMI issue and now everything is working perfectly. Excellent product for writing/reading microSD and driving a second monitor.
4,I orderd this for a Superdrive I purchased for the M1 Mac Pro. It  DID NOT power the drive and I still had to purchase the Apple brand attachment.I kept this because the Sd card portion does work and I use it to read my USB flashdrives.
3,Attempts to connect power through this adapter haven’t worked.
5,Came very quickly and much cheaper than other models.
5,Working great so far! Easy way to connect USBs to my new laptop that only has USB-C ports. I don't think it's supposed to be a charger but I do think my phone was charging when I last used it.
4,This unit has a lot for the price and having blown the more generic brand in the past I was only considering an adapter that would be sure to perform well. I do wish it had a USBC power port like the Belkin Ethernet adapter has but it is a good solid piece!
5,I am so very glad I purchased this belkin hdmi/usb hub. I recently purchased a Mac Mini last month and I also purchased 2 monitors. I watched a few set up videos on Youtube for 2 monitors on a Mac and came across the Belkin hub. I connected the 2nd hdmi and both monitors were connected with extended display. Im so very happy. Great purchase and very inexpensive. You wont regret it.
4,Works perfectly as an USB-C hub with charging support. The only catch is all windows' position in external monitor would be reset after my laptop is locked. It doesn't happen when I was plugging the HDMI to laptop directly.
5,Even though I haven’t tested all the ports I’m very happy with this hub. The newest Macs only have USB-C ports so to connect your USB-A devices you really need a hub. I didn’t notice it heating up the times I’ve used it and I trust Belkin products. I did a lot of research before deciding on this particular hub.
5,Functioning well lightweight compatible with M1 MacBook Air with a pretty solid data transfer rate. Only downside is that the USB ports are only on one side of the device would be more convenient to perhaps have them on both. Would have liked to have a display port or mini display port option as well but that's asking for a lot! Great product.
5,Ports all seem to work on a dell xps13Unless there is some hidden windows setting…it appears the headphone jack replaces the laptops built in headphone jack.  My laptop will not output to both at the same time.  Not a deal breaker.
5,Allows access to operating a broken screen phone by useing hdmi cable (optional piece of equipment) to view screen information on a hdmi television.  Inputs into the USB-c phone/data /charge port. Gives you 1x  hdmi and 2x USB ports.  Plug in the tv and a usb mouse then fully operate the damaged screen phone. Now the broken phone can be unlocked and data transferred to a new phone via Samsung wifi "smart switch ".
5,Has passthrough charging for MacBook Pro so you don’t lose a port and you can connect to two monitors by using usb-c cable for one and HDMI for the other.
4,This is the second USB C peripheral dock I tried with my M1 MacBook Air.  The previous non-name brand dock would not reconnect the mouse connected via the dock and the audio output on the dock had the left and right channels reversed.  This Belkin dock fixed all those ills: the mouse wakes up reliably when I open the MacBook Air lid and the audio output is correctly oriented on the dock's speaker output.  Passthrough USB C charging is flawless.I haven't had a chance to try the HDMI output or the other USB jacks on the dock.  I will reserve comments on those to others.
5,I've used this device to access my Samsung phone with screen that doesn't work (can't see or operate).  Connected the dock to my phone and mouse and keyboard and then to HDMI monitor.  I was able to control my phone enough to get everything I needed.  Now I'm using it to connect my chromebook to keyboard/mouse/monitor.  I also use it for my work laptop.... its just perfect.
5,Compact size saves buying new peripherals for your new computer.  Add plug and play to your phone is OK also.
3,It works as it’s supposed to. HDMI and sd card reader works perfectly fine. One huge complaint is the cord length and design.1) The design is backwards. I get it’s meant to be portable but if you are using it at your desk and have the hdmi cable plugged in it means you’ll have to have the hub facing backwards and which means you’ll have to move it around to plug something in. God help you if what you’re connecting has a cable because it means the cable will be bent forward.2) Cord is super short and annoying every time I move my laptop around on my desk. It’s already scratched my brand new desk.3) Gets very very hot.
5,Love this product-- easy to use and the adaptor is great to swap between computers too. Classy look and feel and it let's me plug in all my cables and discs when working. Glad I got this one!
2,While this adaptor looks to be sturdy and useful it cannot charge iPad Pro 11 inch 2nd gen through USB-C PD port when using the supplied USB-C iPad charging brick.  Essentially useless for my iPad to expand port capability.  I wanted to be able to use my wired headset or external portable drive or upload photos and charge the iPad at the same time.  Or at least not drain my iPad battery.  Unfortunately this won't do the trick.
5,Does what it is supposed to do and seems to be good quality so far
5,Works well with the new Apple computers
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               El unboxing fue genial y la funcionalidad con mi nuevo MacBook M1 pro es genial!
5,Durable elegant looking and does the job perfectly!
2,Needed USB ports for older peripherals on a new MacBook. Price-wise this seemed middle of the pack and the performance has matched. It was fine for a couple months. Now it gets really hot when plugged in and it can't power the same two USB devices at the same time that it initially could. So it works-ish. Expected better from Belkin.
5,Perfect for my needs. Know that it has a short cord as pictured.
5,This works great and light weight. Tried and all ports working fine. Since in Belkin Hopefully it lasts longer than other no name brands.
5,This is perfect to have in you're laptop bag. Great value. No questions asked
5,Great product
5,Worked exactly how I expected!
5,Usefull
5,I can put multiply gadget on the laptop
3,I use this primarily to view photos from SD or micro SD cards.  It works fine for that purpose but I notice it runs hot so I remove it after each use.
5,Muy fácil de utilizar se conecta y ya está disponible
2,Copying from the SD card slot to a drive connected on one of the USB ports fails. It errors saying corrupt media. If I copy from an SD card reader on the the other USB port - it works. If I copy from the SD card slot to the computer's drive it works. Connected to a 2020 MacBook Air M1.
5,Adequate number of port for meGood specification.
1,I've had since May but it's only worked for a month or two and then only part of the time.  Now it cannot be returned or replaced so will try for a refund.  Very disappointing.
2,It works fine but it overheats so much I don't want it to damage my components. Returning it.
2,Bought this to work with my IPad Pro. Description says that it supports pass thru charging for MacBook Pro Air iPad Pro XPS and More. I can verify that it does not support pass thru charging on a 2018 IPad Pro. Should have read more reviews before purchasing
2,Pretty expensive for what it is. Feels cheap and scratches very easily. Doesn't comes with a protector or anything to protect.
2,Never had these corrupted screens in years of use until a week or two after starting with this hub. I may try to return it shortly.
1,SD cards do not mount with the SD card reader. I have to plug my old USB card reader into the hub and then the card mounts immediately. I looked long and hard to find a good hub to be compatible with my M1 MacBook Air chose this one for being a known brand that is also sold by Apple but it is not functional.
1,This product did not work.
1,I tried several laptops and HDMI doesn't work on any of them.
1,This unit does not pass through fast charging my tablet so the tablet while being used drained to zero battery.  Another adapter I have does work but this one is useless.
1,HDMI port only works when it wants to. Which is hardly ever. Buy something higher quality.
4,The first unit wouldn't work even 50% of the time but it was quickly replaced by Amazon or the seller and the new one works 100% of the time. So maybe a one-off issue. Works as intended build quality is fair-decent.
4,USB C hubs can be really confusing for the average person who doesn’t know much about computer technology you have products like this that cost less than $40 and other products that uses Thunderbolt 3/4 and cost 5-10x as much as this does. This is basically a standard USB C (not Thunderbolt) hub/multiport adapter it allows you to use connect this to a MacBook or something similar and it lets you use standard flash drives Micro SD/SD cards and connect to a monitor with HDMI. It doesn’t have any high-end features like Power Delivery passthrough charging high speed data transfer (10Gbps and up) or additional video output ports like DisplayPort/VGA. But that’s ok because most people don’t need that and would be better off with something simple like this adapter. It is still very well made the whole thing is aluminum alloy and feels very sturdy and durable.Belkin makes really good accessories for products in the Apple ecosystem I think this was intended to be used with MacBooks because it matches the space gray color. It is compatible with ANY USB C device though you could use this with a Samsung Galaxy S21 or Windows laptop or even a Chromebook. One important thing to remember in order to use the HDMI port on this adapter the device in question must be able to support video output over its USB C port. I am mentioning this because not all devices do flagship Android phones and midrange or higher laptops normally do support this and it is becoming more common. Cheaper Chromebooks even tend to support USB C video if they have been released in the last 3-4 years. If you have something like a $300 windows laptop it probably won’t have this feature but you can still use the USB ports and the card reader slots.This is a dependable durable adapter that you can throw in your bag for when you need to use SD cards or USB flash drives with your laptop. It’s good enough to last a long time but not so expensive that you couldn’t replace it (relatively) easily if you lost it or someone stole it or whatever. If you find that you need a multiport adapter with more ports or features you could always upgrade to something more “Pro” later on.Pros+Durable design thanks to an aluminum alloy exteriorAffordableFrom a trustworthy brand that supports their products and honors their warrantiesSmall easy to carry with youCons-No USB C Power Delivery passthrough chargingNo USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps data transfer speeds) or USB C data portsHDMI is 1.4 (4k 30Hz max)
4,I picked this up to use with my mini laptop when I go on trips. I wanted a small dock/hub that would let me plug in my external HDD wireless keyboard/mouse and plug the laptop into the TV (HDMI) in the hotel. When I picked this up it originally looked like a good idea however after using it I realized that it isn't powered and draws its power from the USB-C port. So since it doesn't support PD pass-through or an external PD for power; each device draws power directly from the USB-C port on the laptop. Which causes the battery of my laptop to die pretty quickly. As far as 4K HDMI support; this obviously is based on whether or not the laptop supports it.All in all I ended up putting this back in the box since I couldn't handle my laptop dying quickly when plugged into this hub.
5,My Nikon still uses a regular SD card... only problem laptops and computers no longer come with the attachment built in to read them. This was the perfect solution. I just plug it into my computer and I am able to instantly transfer my photos. I would highly recommend.
4,Belkin has been one of my trusted brands for years. So after my old dock stopped working I got this Belkin 5 in 1 MultiPort Adapter Dock to use with my 2016 MacBook Pro. The dock is plug and use directly from the box and does everything I need it to perfectly. I use the HDMI port daily to dual screen my MacBook to a second HP monitor or my TV. I’ve also tried using the USB-A ports for my Logi Webcam mouse and keyboard and had no issues with any of them. The dock is the perfect size and weight to carry in my work bag or bring along when I’m traveling. The aluminum casing gives it a sleek look and adds a bit more protection compared to a plastic casing. The only downside is the cable is a little short so when I have my laptop on a stand the dock is hanging from the USB C slot instead of resting on the desk. If you’re looking for an affordable dock from a reputable brand this Belkin hub is a great option.
4,Very durable and good quality dock with aluminum casing. I have a MacBook Pro that only has USB-C ports so when I want to connect any other cables and devices I have to use adapters. This multiport adapter is great to have by my computer to be able to plug in multiple devices at once. This adapter was made to be connected to USB-C ports like the ones on my laptop. This 5 in 1 multiport adapter also comes with a microSD card slot and an SD card slot. There are 2 USB-A ports and an HDMI port which is more than enough for my uses.
4,I have a MacBook Pro and I needed a multiport adapter for my external storage. I just do not want to get just any brand to connect to my MacBook Pro.  I received Belkin USB C Hub 5-in-1 MultiPort Adapter Dock with 4K HDMI 2x USB  A 3.1 SD Card Slot and micro SD. I love that it is compact and I can take it anywhere when I need to the storage. Also it can access high-definition resolutions up to 4K. It is very easy to transfer my pics and videos.  This helps me save a lot of time because I can hook up additional devices to it. This will be used almost daily. Love it!
4,I keep things organized on several flash drives and this has been very helpful to me after getting my MacBook Pro 16 that only has thunderbolt ports.  The cord is short which is nice for this type of device.  It stays close to the computer and functions just as needed.  I haven't had any issues with it reading and of my flash drives so far.
5,This works extremely well with the latest iPad mini which uses USB-C instead of lighting.However to charge an iPad while using this hub; you’ll need a USB-C charger that can output more than 40w of power.  I’ve been using a spare Dell USB-C laptop charger and it works fine.  I also use that same charger to charge my iPad even without the USB-C hub.
5,I got this multiport in order to connect my new MacBook to some older devices in my church. This hub allows for connections to HDMI and USB devices seamlessly. I also use the SD card reader for uploading and transferring from one device to another. haven't had a problem yet. I know the price is a little high but the brand is a reliable one.
5,I got this hub mainly to use with an external monitor that has an HDMI port.  This hub works great!  Just plug in the hub plug your monitor into the hub and start using your second screen.  Image quality on the external monitor is great.  I played YouTube videos as well and they looked great.The USB ports worked well too.  Very fast.  I also tested the SD card slot and it worked as advertised.  I did not have a microSD card to test so cannot say anything about that feature.The only negative I have is it would be more convenient to have the HDMI port on the end of the hub opposite the cable.  Having it at a right angle to the attached cord is a little awkward arranging things on the desk.Note that other hubs advertise being compatible with Pixelbooks but they may not work with the Pixelbook Go.  I tried others and some did not work with my Pixelbook Go.  This one definitely does!
5,I got this Belkin hub because it is USB C and  self powered. It has two regular USB slots HDMI port and a micro SD and SD slot. I have to transfer a lot of data from a micro SD card for work on the go and so I wanted something a bit more durable rather then flimsy. This one does have a durable thick cable that goes to the USB C and it seems to be about 7 inches of cable. Kinda short but it's fine since the USB C port is on the side of my laptop. The speeds are really fast on the USB slots and they can also charge my phone with no issues. I can't speak for the HDMI slot because I don't need use it. The case for the hub has some heft to it so it seems durable. I use Windows 10 and it automatically found the drivers and installed them on its own with no issues. Overall I was due for a new SD card reader as for my old plastic "el cheapo" model was being held together with scotch tape.
5,Well made well designed solid products at a reasonable price. I bought a new Mac Mini to replace an older slower version and I love it. However for reasons unknown they put 2 fewer USB ports on the newest model. I have dual monitors  a webcam  wired keyboard and a light attached to the computer. Thank god I have a bluetooth mouse (Logitech really like that too.Enter Belkin. In a small form factor it incorporates 2 USB ports an HDMI port (4K @ 30 FPS)  and an SD card reader. It basically adds anything not on the Mac Mini and includes the adapter for the second monitor. I had an adapter but it had an old lightning connector Apple now uses USB C ports one of which can be video.Go figure. So basically this little adapter solved all the problems I had getting my new desktop up and running .Cool.
4,This works fine maybe nothing special but it does its job. I am happier to have this than the cheaper one I previously bought just because it's Belkin and I trust Belkin.
5,Nice multiplier unit. It works fine and fast. I expect all devices start to switch to USB-C connection by time and the USB-C ports to take over other ports on Laptops. They are faster have far more functions not one sided smaller can provide more power etc. However until that transition happens this device really helps a lot to multiply available ports on a computer. Even then it will be very useful to be used as an adapter for your old devices with USB connection ports.It is a Belkin and I loved how fast it is. It is aluminum and very light. It is tiny as well and easy to carry in a laptop case. It is well made and especially useful for computers which do not have a HDMI port.  Highly recommended.
5,If you are on the go a lot for work and need to be able to quickly extend the use of your laptop then this is simply a must. Built by one of the best brands in the industry it offers a lot of features lacking from the latest MacBook pro. The 4k HDMI out is perfect is you need to stream your computer to your television and the usb A slots (not included on the new mac)  are perfect to quickly download your camera's and video and still files (again not in the factory setup of the new Macbook Pro). Highly recommended!
5,This dongle has worked flawlessly so far! My only complaint is its lack of a USB-C input. The computer only has 2 inputs so when this is being used you are reduced down to only one (minus the USB-A inputs on the dongle of course). I primarily use this to download GoPro video from a MicroSD card but have also used it with a flash drive and portable CD/DVD player. It truly is "Plug & Play" as I have not had to do anything except plug it in and it just works; did not have to download drivers or anything. I'm pretty impressed so far and I'd definitely recommend purchasing one if you need some additional inputs for your MacBook!
3,This dongle hub was pretty lightweight and felt pretty flimsy but it had all the ports I need (minus 1 on a single occasion). Would have probably preferred it had at least one more USB slot.
5,This is a nice and portable USB-C hub with all of the bells and whistles. Belkin has always been known for their quality and they definitely did a good job on this USB-C Hub. I've had other hubs that lagged on the SD card connection but this one was able to detect the SD card from my Canon 5D IV DSLR camera the fastest. Makes a great "dongle" for anyone in the Apple ecosystem with Thunderbold 3 or 4 ports and also anyone with a device permitting USB-C connectivity. All of the main ports are there: HDMI 2 USB A ports a microSD slot and an SD card slot. This is more than enough for my needs as a photographer and videographer who is always on the go! The exterior of the hub isn't fully plastic which is a huge plus for heat dissipation and it works fine with my Windows OS'd HP Omen 15 Gaming laptop and Apple M1 MacBook Air 13-inch laptop.
5,Nifty device that extends functionality of whatever device you're hooking it up to. It connects via USB-C and provides a 4K (30 Hz) HDMI port 2 USB A 3.1 ports an SD card slot and a microSD card slot. I've only tested the microSD card slot so far but it works just as it should transfer speed was solid. I could see this being super useful for anyone who needs to work from home and needs to get some more functionality out of their work laptop (assuming your work laptop has a USB-C port).Build quality is great and it has a nice aluminum finish on the outside. You're getting a solid Belkin made hub here if you order this!
5,I've always had good experience with Belkin and this is no different. Unlike some other hubs I've gotten from no-name companies this has worked consistently and flawlessly (no plug and unplug no jiggle no start and restart etc.) with my 16" MacBookPro and my iPad Pro.  Has worked with data transfer power transfer and connecting to several different brand projectors.  Gets warm but not abnormally so is relatively small and as noted has a good history as far as my own experience with Belkin. I pulled out my no-name from my backpack and have them as a last resort backup. Very pleased.
5,I have an iMac and all the USBs and SD card slot are in the back. This little guy is so helpful. I can now easily plug into something front-facing. I also love that there is an SD card slot. I take a lot of photos and have been avoiding using the SD card slot in the back which means I've been avoiding using my Nikon D90. I can now get back to it using the DSL. Excellent product!
5,Didn't really have any doubts as Belkin usually makes some of the highest quality products and this hub was not exception.I usually use this for travel to save files and is pretty fast in transferring data.  My computer picked up this hub pretty fast and was pretty much plug and play.This thing is durable and actually did surpass an expectation regarding the construction.  It is made with an aluminum casing; perfect for travel.
5,I needed an easier way to transfer images to my MacBook Pro from my Canon camera and this is the best way to do it and still have other functionality. I wish it also included a Type-C port to replace the one it's using as that's how I connect my monitor and charger but all-in-all a great dongle.
5,I am so happy with this.  I needed to be able to plug in other things to my mac and it's frustrating.  This extra helper gave me all the help I needed and It WORKS!
5,This little gadget is exactly what I needed. When I have to work at home I now have only one plug to put in. I have my monitor headphones and mouse plugged into the Belkin!
5,I needed a good hub with my Macbook and this is the perfect one. I use it when I travel and it offers me just enough extra space with USB ports and simplifies my mobile desk!
2,Lack of product details on Amazon.This multiport adapter is Not compatible  with Lenova Tablets.
3,I admit that I missed the fact that this 5-in-1 didn't include a USB C output port.  That seriously limits the usefulness for me especially compared to the 8 (or potentially 9-in-1) similar device that I have been using.  I had hoped to possibly replace that device because it tends to get warmer than I would otherwise like. It works but again it tends to get warm and worries me a bit about just how warm it does get.This device is fine for what it is intended to do basically convert a USB C port into a couple of USB 3.1 ports along with the HDMI port and SD card / Micro SD card reader ports.  It works but again leaves me wishing for the extra ports that would force me to buying one of the higher end models of the same type of products from this manufacturer.  I might do that eventually and if so I might come back and be leaving a higher rating but for now this device becomes one that gets more limited usage (for me) than I otherwise had hoped.3 Solid stars from this reviewer.
5,I have tried other USB-C hubs with my tablet and some worked and some didn't.  I was looking for one that also had 3.5mm audio jack because there's no headphone jack on the tablet.  Everything worked on both devices: HDMI monitor audio USB keyboard PD charging etc.Some also got VERY hot but this one got warm but not very hot.
5,This is a nice sized portable USB hub.  It allows USB 3 port expansion and an HDMI output for machines either lacking or needed an extra video out port.  It also has readers for standard and micro-SD cards. The cards insert upside-down which seems a bit odd but otherwise the readers work great.  Transfer speeds are on par with my built-in SD reader and I like that it has separate dedicated slots for both SD card sizes. The aluminum encased body is small lightweight and easy to tote along.  For what it is I have no complaints.  It’s a basic hub with basic features.  I have more advanced hubs for more specialized power use.  As a basic tote-along hub or even as an everyday stationary hub on a machine with limited ports and no SD reader it’s more than sufficient.
5,The build of this product seems to be well made and it is very lightweight. Ordered this for my new MacBook Air but also work for my iPad Pro! Great product.
5,Bought this so that I could use my usb mouse and hdmi cable with my MacBook work pretty well and stable no issues with multiple cable plugging in at the same time. Heard that it’s authorized by apple and I’m pretty happy with it so far. Would consider getting other accessories from the same brand if needed.
5,Lightweight and portable. Perfect for someone on the go.
5,Easy to use great quality. I’ve used other hubs and this one is by far the best one yet.
5,The versatility comes in handy.  Recommended to a co-worked and they bought it also.
5,Works great and looks good
5,I bought a couple of brands for my new MacBook Pro. This one was the only one that worked.
5,This looks like it was made by Apple! It’s got same exterior as my MacBook the color matches perfectly and feels so durable! I have only had a couple days and haven’t tested every port but so far it’s perfect!Highly recommend
5,Después de hacer un poco de investigación y leer reseñas donde usuarios notaban que muchas de las otras marcas presentaban interferencia con la laptop o sobrecalentado del producto me di cuenta que en la tienda Apple Belkin es la marca que te venden. Di por concluido que era la marca que Apple recomendaba para usar con sus productos. Hasta el momento ha funcionado muy bien con mi MacBook Air 2020 M1 y no ha presentado fallas calentamiento o interferencia.
5,Como la mayoría de los productos Belkin este HUB es el complemento ideal para las MacBook con puertos USB-C.El adaptador funciona muy bien para todo tipo de dispositivos USB la conexión es rápida y estable según la versión del protocolo que se use. La salida HDMI y el lector de tarjetas SD también funcionan correctamente. Un gran detalle es que el color del HUB es exactamente igual al Space Grey de las MacBook.El HUB eventualmente se calienta un poco pero es algo normal.
2,I just received this and it did not come in its retail packaging. The box is not even sealed. Device is placed in a small piece of bubble wrap with some product docimentatio  inside this makeshift box. Its supposed to be 'new' but this could be refurbished. Product works ok though but don't know for how long. Sold by Amazon US.
5,Great product.
2,El adaptador se calienta muchísimo con tan solo un HDMI conectado. Con USB's y discos externos se pone tan caliente que te quemaría tocarlo. Esto no puede ser bueno para ninguno de los componentes... Creo que lo tendré que regresar.
4,Funciona muy bien!
5,Estoy muy contento con este adaptador funciona excelente en mi MacBook Air del 2020 :D recomendadisimo
5,Works well. Tested on a hp elitebook 830 with thunderbolt c plugged in usb tongle for mouse and power pass allowed fast charging of laptop too. Nice product.
3,El producto lo recibí el día 13 de abril como siempre amazon con los envíos muy puntual y en este caso hasta un día antes se entregó ya que viene de EEUU.Respecto al producto apenas ví la caja es como las de marca genéricas de origen chino el material de la carcasa luce resistente.Sin embargo apenas lo conecté con el HDMI de una macbook pro A2338 se calentó el adaptador.Por el precio $702 me parece justo sin embargo creo que se puede conseguir algo con más características por ese precio o menos.Pensé que por la marca sería algo mejor pero hasta ahora es regular.Gracias
5,Compact lightweight device. Wirks well with my Apple laptop and PC.
5,Bought this because I needed it for my MacBook Air 2020 and it does the work !It does get warm and only warm not hot does not make the thunderbolt port hot on my Mac !it's simply good !!
5,Principalmente lo uso para conectar un 2o monitor a FHD en una mac min con M1 y funciona de maravilla se calienta muy poco y complementa perfecto las opciones de conexión de la mac.100% recomendable!
4,Looks nice but was a little warm quite quickly (after about 5 mins of testing only). Seems to be able to take multiple ports in use at the same time.
1,This product doesn't work with iPad Pro or a normal USB-C power supply. Only works with laptops and laptop USB-C power supplies. Product description is misleading.
1,Wit working with iPad Pro less than a day
5,Se calienta un poco pero general es muy bueno y se acopla muy fácil con cualquier dispositivo
5,7-in-1 hub works as expected so far. My usage is limited  to a 34” monitor and couple usb connections. Compact in size for travel and reasonable build quality for the price. Value deal on Amazon.
5,No se desconecta la pantalla como con otros
5,Exactly What I Wanted.
4,La compré para mi macbook air chip m1 13” y funciona bien .
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Excelente hub. En los comentarios leí que se calentaba pero creo es cuando conectas el power cable en el que es el USB C PD. Yo el cable lo tengo conectado directo mejor a la Mac y así no se calienta el HUB. Ahora bien si ocupas conectarlo en el hub para abrir espacio al C hay que checar lo del calentamiento por qué también lo he hecho y no se calienta tanto. Si se siente caliente pero no en exceso.
5,Color igual al gris espacial no se calienta y los puertos sirven de maravilla excelente compatibilidad con MacBook Pro M1
3,Ok
5,Yo corrí con la mala suerte de que a los dos meses de que la compré una de las entradas de USB ya no leía. Pero fuera de eso muy buena compra
2,Nous l’avons retourné
5,I bought this for my wife for her home workstation along with a 65W USB-C PD power adapter. It is a competent one-plug solution for her - 4K monitor keyboard and webcam - and it has not failed to connect and work as it should over the past 3 months. She has the ($$$$$) Surface Dock at her office and I didn't want to buy another one as those are really expensive. She kind of sneered at this at first because it's not nearly as attractive or slick as that unit and has a shorter connection cable so not as elegant but it's entirely functional which is exactly what I hoped for at this price point.
5,Todo bien muy compacto
4,je suis satisfait du produit
5,Es eficiente y soluciona la necesidad de otros puertos básicos.
5,Caro para lo que es pero cumple su función. No viene en la caja típica de Belkin. Se calienta un poco pero nada alarmante.
