4,I’ve been using this projector for just over a year now and I really like it. I bought it because initially I had limited space for the projector and wanted an ultrashort projector and this item was slightly cheaper than VAVA and other brands. I should say the brand is kind of confusing because although it says WeMax almost nowhere else you’ll see that brand and you’ll see Huawi are over the place. The operating system is Google OS which I have conflicting feelings toward it (don’t really like it but it’s easy to use I personally use my Roku). The setup is relatively straightforward keystone and focus corrections are easy and pretty user-friendly 8/10 . I have thrown the picture over a huge white wall and on a screen both had very good qualities but in bright sunlight the screen is much better. I haven’t bought a fancy screen yet and therefore unfortunately there’s some wavyness on the screen which is the downside of laser projectors 7/10. As far as picture quality I haven’t compared it to other ultrashort projectors but comparing to conventional projectors it’s definitely far better and almost identical to a real movie theatre 9/10.  Sound quality is excellent it’s quite deep and loud but it’s not Dolby and obviously you’d need a home theatre for that 8/10. The ability to use it as a Bluetooth speaker is a plus. Overall although this projector is expensive but I’d recommend it if you’re a cinephile 8/10.
5,I decided to go cheaper and buy a different projector not researching how big the picture would be. I have a 150 inch screen and this projector is nothing but AMAZING!!!  The picture is incredible and my kids LOVE playing Xbox games. The speakers are incredible!  I bought a soundbar for the other projector but the speakers on this projector BLOW me away!  I live in a condo so the sound is perfect!!Con:  the only thing that was frustrating is the limited information in the owners manual about setting up the focus and picture. It took me a lot of trial and error to figure it out.I would HIGHLY recommend this projector. It’s well worth the money
5,This is the best projector available for home in US market. You do not need a TV. The compact ultra short throw form factor makes it so much practical for home use. You do not need to hustle through to mount it on the ceiling. A TV unit suffices. The picture quality is amazing. Even during a bright sunny day just lowering the blinds makes it enough dark for this projector to start making its magic.A must buy.
5,This projector does have its quarks at 150". There is a screen issue where the edge line at the top is not straight and nothing can be done. I tried 2 of them and same thing. Google TV a bit slow and switching to Chromecast all the time is annoying. Doesn't save where you left off. Can't find a way to see a picture resolution when you stream video.However with a good screen frame the edge issue cannot be seen. I have it mounted on the ceiling for my 150 inch screen. The quality is great for games and movies. Do need to make sure to set the projector to the right mode to get the right quality. Movies vs gaming mode is a night and day. 150" sitting 8 ft away. People are blown away with the quality. Compared it to $5k Sony top of the pine unit. If you are not a picture buff you will barely be able to tell a difference and there are not many projectors that can support 150" picture.
5,If your setting up a movie room/theater then this is the projector for you.
4,Had no idea these existed when I started searching for a projector last year.  I wanted something bigger in a TV but the 85" TVs can be up there in price.  So since my wall can fit a 100" screen I started researching.  The UST design fit my needs perfectly cause I had no desire to install one on the ceiling and our living room faces West with a covered patio so not much sun glare.Would like to have seen more customization in the main screen.  I don't use the smart features on the projector so I have to (after I've waited for the screen to appear it takes a little longer now with the update) click up twice then click right 5 times enter click down once and finally enter.  Wish it either remembered my last selection (the same one I use every time) or worked with my universal remote.Never owned a OLED so no comparison there.  But yes the screen is dim in the daytime but it pops when the sun goes down.  I don't have an ALR screen cause of the price and a regular one worked fine enough since our room doesn't get that bright.Can definitely tell it's a DLP because with the last Sony DLP TV we had my wife never saw the rainbow effect but with this one she does.  Nothing bad just the usual when you turn your head from time to time.I bought it when it was on sale so was the perfect price to jump in.  Now that laser projectors are becoming more popular I might upgrade in 5 years.  Then eventually upgrade when panels come down in price but that's a long way way.  I do like having a 100" screen no regrets there.  It's not the biggest and best out there but it'll do.  I've never been one to jump on the latest tech my wallet won't let me.
5,Buying this projector is my best purchase decision in 2021 hands down!  My family is loving it our dog Stitch drools at it and there is no going back to our 60” Samsung TV.If you are looking for a TV equivalent best color/brightness under $3500 and have your own streaming stick/box this is the projector to buy.  I did my research for weeks so here is my summary.1. 4K Ultra Short Throw (UST) projector and 4k ALR projector screen is the way to go for TV replacement.  Forget about the standard throw or short throw projector that requires ceiling mount and shoot lasers across the living room.  The UST projector only needs ~6 inch from the screen to display up to 120 inch of 4k resolution.  Works great with my original TV stand.Did I mention I installed both projector and screen by myself?  An 80”+ TV will require 2 adults to carry and professionals to wall mount.2. Most brands of UST projectors are white labeled from the same manufacturer. They all have similar looks. WeMax is made by the reputable Formovie manufacturer that has the most advanced laser UST technology with the most patents.  I compared a few UST projectors side by side at home and Nova is the clear winner. It is the brightest and has the most vibrant colors. Specification wise they are similar but the visual difference is similar to seeing Samsung TV versus other no name brands at Costco.Also don’t expect to see anything good from projecting 4k on a wall. It gives the bacon effect and the glare makes it hard to see in day time. Projector and projection screen goes hand in hand so go buy a good 4k ALR screen. After installing the ALR screen the image looks bright and sharp in my living room even during day time. Personally I like the fixed frame screen because the scrollable reminds me too much of a classroom or conference room.3. Nova came with Android TV and that just doesn’t cut it for me. The native Netflix HBO Max Amazon Prime etc app all can only do 1080p altho this is no fault of WeMax. These content providers only enable 4k for the big players such as Samsung Apple TV Roku Amazon Fire etc. The user interface and experience is also too basic.I plug in my trustworthy Amazon Fire stick and from there I can stream 4k contents from Netflix HBO Max Amazon Prime etc from the Fire stick HDMI input to projector no problem.Hope you find the time I took to write this review useful. Happy TV/Projector hunting.
5,Much better than I expected! Great picture and easy set up
5,Had this projector for about a week now. Let me get this out of the way first I LOVE this projector! With that said here are my notes for considering the WeMax Nova:1. SETUP PROCESS: The Nova itself is very easy to setup and prompted guide helps you tune the specs.  It is easy to "fine tune" the picture using the keystone correction in the menu.2. IMAGE QUALITY: The picture is excellent contrast is very good colors are vibrant and image is crisp & sharp. With any laser projector you should expect deeper colors but the Nova is very even across a wide color spectrum. You definitely get darker darks whiter whites and it lends well for a crisp image quality.3. SOUND QUALITY: The Nova comes with an excellent soundbar and sounds significantly better than previous TVs i've owned. I'll admit I only listened to it for a few minutes before plugging in my surround sound system.4. FAN NOISE: In standard picture mode the fans run at a very low speed - I don't really notice them at all. When I set picture brightness to "high" the fans spin up and are a little more noticeable but not excessively like it's about to take off. If you're watching anything even at low volume it's not going to be noticeable.SUGGESTIONS/IMPROVEMENTS:A. REMOTE CONTROL: The Nova comes with a bluetooth remote which is just fine for me and works as you'd expect. I'd like for it to be integrated with smarthome devices like Alexa and Google Home. This would be preferred because of how I've setup my home - so this critique may only apply to me. I'm still researching what solutions are out there.B. INPUT MODE: The Nova has an input  option in settings which allows us to select Five TV or other contents input. However  it resets  once turned off. So every time you power the Nova "on" you need to go to settings and select  again.CONCLUSION: As stated overall this projector has exceeded expectations and comes highly recommended. Compared to other brands the Nova is definitely a better bargain for the quality of projector that you are getting. The only one that comes close to performance is maybe the Optoma but also comes at a greater cost. Upgrading to a laser projector is definitely an investment but you likely have some idea of what you're getting yourself into. The difference between a standard LED TV and this projector is night and day. If you're looking to make that leap this is definitely the projector you want to choose...and a screen is highly recommended!
5,This was a big purchase for our family and so far has been totally worth it. Highly recommended.We were hoping to get an ultra short throw projector for under $2000 but we realized that if we wanted a projector with our required amenities along with a 4K picture quality we would need to spend $2000-3000. This is a fairly new product and there aren't many reviews out there but it did have all the options we wanted. We are so happy with this. While we are not hardcore visualphiles the image quality is great. We've been watching Marvel movies on Disney+ in 4K and I am actually noticing details I haven't seen before when watching on my HDTV. Daytime viewing is pretty good too we have some blackout blinds near the screen but we can't make the whole room dark but the degree of brightness has not been an issue.It took me about 15-20 minutes to set up the image adjust the keystones focus and start watching a movie. We have a 92" screen and the projector is about 10 inches from the wall. We have a pretty good router so all our streaming has been pretty flawless so far.We needed a projector with bluetooth so we could hook up our soundbar wirelessly and it was easy to do. We do need to "pair" every time we turn it on it doesn't happen automatically but this is no big deal for us. The internal speakers are pretty good too so I wouldn't say you need external speakers unless you need the full theater experience. The baseline apps that come with it are fine but it does not come with Netflix or Amazon Prime so we also got the Roku Streaming Stick.  If you plan on getting this projector plan on getting a streaming stick also. HOWEVER you need to change the HDMI to 2.0 to get 4K quality. We didn't realize this and all the images were pixelated and glitchy at first. Once I read some reviews I changed it to 2.0 and now our streaming and image quality are spot on. But now we have 2 remotes one to turn on the project and set the input to "roku" and then the roku remote.We are not an android family we have iPhones and Macbooks so we have not been able to screen mirror. I heard you can hook up iPhones to the projector via bluetooth. I tried to once it never paired and I haven't tried it again but honestly I haven't really needed to.So far this projector has been great and fulfills all our home-viewing needs (sports movies shows).  Haven't tried gaming yet.
5,Overall this is an exceptional short throw projector for those that have the space and are thinking of getting rid of their TV. Straight out of the box product quality is clear to see. It feels like a high-end piece of equipment which for $2000+ it is but in the land of ultra short throws it really isn't. I've never had a VAVA to compare it to but I know it's more compact and a nicer looking box. Everything feels quality.One small thing is I wish it had a source button on the remote so that I didn't have to access my Fire TV through the menus.I used this on a plain white wall and I have to say picture quality was excellent. You do get a wave at the top though if you have  any imperfections in your wall. No way near as unwatchable and scary as people led me to believe with these delicate lasers though. My wall is very uneven and the picture was still exceptional. Colors pop brightness really good. It's nowhere near as bright as the Bomaker Polaris but that thing is like the sun when it starts up - practically blinds you.  Sound through my soundbar was good also and plenty good enough without.Make no mistake this is an excellent projector and generally available for at least $500 less than the VAVA so I think it's the better buy.The real thing that tips it over the edge though is the customer service. OUTSTANDING!Unlike Bomaker who never replied to my messages the guys and girls at Wemax are just on it.They reply super fast are extremely knowledgable and hunt down answers to questions they don't know like their lives depended on it. Honestly I've never been more impressed with customer service than this one. Which is a huge concern when buying high-tech equipment. VAVA responded to my questions too but nothing like these guys. They were superheroes. It's also great to know that were something to go wrong I can send it off to them in the US (I believe California) and they will repair it and ship it back free of charge. No sending it over to China to get it fixed no uncertainty no costs. That's huge.In short a few little nitpicky things. The remote as I said woulda been nice to have a few more customisable options in terms of picture settings.But for sheer plug-in and play this thing is a beast.You won't be disappointed!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The picture quality was quite impressive for the price. Did a comparison between this and the vava short throw. To be honest most people will be happy with either one. The only difference showed when they were set up side by side.Picture quality.Both are excellent. The image quality of the wemax was slightly cleared. But the colors on the vava were more vivid. The colors could be adjusted to match if you want to take the time to do so. I did not. The unit I had wouldn't focus the upper left corner of the screen. It was minimal but that was where the title showed up and the blurry annoyed me. Otherwise the contrast was good. We were casting on a painted wall for the comparison.SoundThe vava was way better in this area. The wemax was good enough. For our use it will have external audio. So sound didn't matter. The wemax speak is more than enough for most basements or living rooms.SizeThe vava is bigger and heavier by far. We need a unit for ceiling mount. The vava is considerably bigger and heavier not just a little.RemoteIt works. Directional pad and a couple buttons. I like that it's bluetooth to no need to find an ir receiver.InterfaceWemax has android over whatever they are calling the software on the vava. However in true android bugginess we were not able to get to the onscreen menu after it did an update. That was very annoying. It's kind of hard to adjust the screen colors if it turns off the picture to show you the adjustments. They aside. It was android tv so it did the job of housing your apps and allowing you to cast to it.WarrantyOnly has a 1 year limit while vava is offering a 2 year repair / replace warranty.Customer serviceI'm not sure who to fault for this. We tried to exchange the unit due to the unfocused upper left corner I mentioned earlier. Amazon said no exchanges so we had to return in. It took weeks of calls to amazon to get our money back. We were never directed to contact the seller so I really can't put this on them. Because of the hassle we are apprehensive about buying another especially since it only has a 1 year warranty.
4,I bought this projector and was a bit wary about the new brand. However the projector overall was great and I have no complaints about the Picture quality.Some downsides:It doesn't come with Netflix and you can't add Netflix to the pre-installed Android TV that comes with it but I had a Chromecast Google TV so it wasn't too bad.The sound wasn't too bad either but it wasn't great. Although imo if you're getting a projector I assume you'd also want to set up your own (better) sound system - which I did.I will say the best this about this purchase is the support team. I had some sound issues with the first order and they quickly helped me to resolve it. They even gave me a replacement. I had multiple questions ranging from CEC compatibility to turning on the HDMI 2.0 setting and they always responded to me within a day - sometimes multiples times in a day if I also replied quickly.I'd definitely recommend this projector.
4,Update...  Have had it a few weeks now and we are still very pleased.  I did have some sound issues and the ARC pass through.  Sometimes it would pass through a usable signal that my Sonos would decode as ATMOS and sometimes with the same show it would not give sound at all.  Never had that issue with prior LG CX tv.  We fixed it by buying the HDFury Arcana eARC bypass.Original...The lighter picture is with the window blind open.  The similar picture that is darker is with the blinds 75% closed.  These ultra short throw projectors REQUIRE an ALR/CLR screen to look their best.  Ignore the reviews that claim quality issues due to wavy projection on a wall...  walls are never perfectly flat!  You must get a proper screen.  That said this is wonderful.  The UI is not perfect but its good.  The remote lacks an input button and you have to navigate to the input each time you turn it on.  It appears to be 4k but it would be nice if it said so when you started a new source.  The keystone and focus is perfect.  Exceptionally easy to get tuned IF you buy the proper screen!!
5,This is the fourth projector I have owned over the past 6 years and the Nova out ranks all of them as the best of all of them.Pros:25000 laser life – this is absolutely a godsend for heavy use. Most people don’t realize how much of a pain it is to replace bulbs every year and Nova's laser life span is truly above the mark.The ultra short throw makes installation a lot more clean and convenient. Not to mention you don't have the clutter of a large TV.The sound quality is really quite good for an integrated setup but I have a high end system already.Pciture Quality - Absolutely beautiful. The colors are very vivid even in lower power setting which looks great to the typical user but might be a bit over saturated for people who prefer a more realistic images. You have the option to tweak with the settings for a more realistic tone.Big time wow factor right out of the box.Cons:Many of the apps are those I haven't heard of and typing on the remote can become somewhat of a pain. A streaming device like Apple TV or Fire TV is highly recommended - which you'll need if you want Netflix. I get netflix from my cable box so it doesn't bother me but it might to some.Summary:As I mentioned this is a very good projector out of the many I've owned. From Optima to Anker (this is the second laser projector) this is by far and large miles ahead of all others. The picture quality you will be getting is like moving up from a 4 cylinder to a V12 engine.
5,So glad I purchased it. It is better than I expected. Really pleased
4,Really love every aspect of this projector except for one: The built-in Google TV. If I'm spending this amount of money on a projector you can be sure that I have my own input device. Instead I have to do 11 clicks of their remote to change the input before I can use my own remote and begin to watch. *EVERY TIME*. It doesn't remember your preferred input it makes you select it through their Google TV interface. This is so annoying and a frustrating one on an otherwise stellar device.
4,I bought this after much analysis and comparison. I know it falls short compare to vava and optoma. But apparently the price also was low to compensate that. I bought on a deal price from Amazon which I felt a good buy.It felt really good quality unpacking and the product is quite compact compared to other projectors. The picture quality is good yes you may lack the punch for brightness and color with light in the room but that gets better as the room darkens. The ultra short throw distance is also very good and felt freedom after setting this up to walk freely while watching. Speaker may not be great but still does the job if you have no alternates. I hook it to my Bose sound bar that compensates well.Overall a good projector that got me into the UST category and definitely steered me away for good spending anymore on big screen TVs that is costly and high maintenance.
5,The only con I've found so far is that you can't install Netflix directly on the projector even though it runs Android TV. Apparently Netflix makes money on both subscriptions and on device licensing which is expensive. So you'll need a fire stick or Roku type device to use Netflix.  Everyt else I tried works fine.The picture quality is FANtastic.  I put the projector on my living room wall next to my 65" Samsung QLED 4k tv and was instantly disappointed in the TV picture.  That's not even with a screen behind it.I mostly use it outdoors on a simple 120" elite screens yard master 2 screen (white non ALR fabric) and we love it. I'm sure with a higher quality screen it would be even better.I looked at the Vava but the operating system on the Wemax is far superior.The built in speakers are pretty decent for indoors but are pretty quiet for an outdoor space.  I use a Samsung q700a soundbar which works great with the projector. HDMI ARC controls the soundbar with no additional config necessary.Overall we're very pleased with the purchase. I'd highly recommend picking one of these up.

2,I use this in a audio studio attached to a Mac Pro. I wanted a 4K short throw projector and in that regard this does what it says on the tin. The picture quality is clear bright and stable.But man Android TV is a steaming pile of garbage and that's why this review is 2 stars.First there is no way for the projector to turn on and go immediately into a particular HDMI input. This means that every time I turn it on I have to walk my through all the crummy Google advertisements for services I don't care about (and never will) to open the input menu and select my Mac.Second the software only recognizes the Mac's HDMI output about 50% of the time. If I catch it at the right moment that the Mac is waking up it usually works. But many times the projector sees the input but says it "unexpectedly disconnected" and I have to reboot my Mac to make it work.Third the projector software UI is just... bad. The menus load slow the font changes on items as you page around it stutters constantly. I realize that the projector manufacturer saved themselves some trouble by leveraging Android TV so the fault here is Google but it's a rotten user experience for a decent piece of hardware.
5,I bought this projector to replace my old 60” TV and did A LOT of research prior to purchase. This being my first projector I wasn’t sure how much of a difference 400 lumens would make between this one and the other I was comparing to. I ultimately decided on the Nova because of the good reviews. Here are the pros and cons as I see it.Pros:-4K UHD resolution is everything they claim (night and day difference from old LED tv)-Vivid and bright colors no washout (adjust RGB to your preference)-FPS rate is OK for gaming – testing on PS5 (die hard gamers might disagree)-Relatively easy to setup-Voice command remote is nice for streaming-Not bulky saves space (short throw needs to be at least 5” from wall)-Lots of streaming options via Android TVCons:-Lack of Netflix streaming (Apparently Netflix is stingy about licensing rights. Support says to use Fire TV or Apple TV)-Soundbar is OK (I have a sound system so it’s not a big issue for me)-Remote does not come with batteries (trivial but annoying for the price)Overall I have very minor complaints about this purchase – I would buy it again in a heartbeat. I bought it for the picture quality and it blew away my expectations. I do recommend purchasing a GOOD projector screen to get the most out of your picture quality but it will all be worth it once setup. Compared to the other projectors I was looking at I’m convinced I got the best one for the price👍🏻
1,Do not buy this projector for use on a PC. I was attracted by the low latency numbers but everything about this projector is a perennial headache. Tech support promised me a fix to their 'default input' setting back in Sept of 2021 (the projector does not remember what input you prefer after power off you must manually navigate with the remote control every time you power up back to your preferred input). It's almost August of 2022 with zero hint of a fix in their pipeline. They also promised a fix to the input timeout issue where a 'no signal' on your screen for more than ~5 seconds hijacks your projector back to the main menu then you have to grab the remote and click your way back to the input menu (one of the worst 'smart' features I've ever seen in any product ever.. P.S. I'm an electrical engineer); no fix yet. You'd think that might not be a big issue however even with a fiber optic 8k cable the projector *never* recognizes my PC on power up. I'm forced to physically disconnect the cable from my computer and plug it back in then cross my fingers the projector finds the signal (GTX 1070 GPU: over-spec'd for this projector capable of 8k resolution). The projector *frequently* requires *many* disconnect/reconnect attempts before finally recognizing the signal (up to 5 minutes of constant attempts while battling the projector input timeout problem). Finally when the projector eventually cooperates the screen has slight pixelation somewhere between 720p and 1080p. I've spent probably 12 or more hours trying to fine tune my height distance focus etc with the 'help' of their tech support - unfixable blurriness 4k is a sad fantasy at this point. Just all around a headache of a product I wish I could afford a better projector because this thing is highly unpleasant to operate. Tech support has all but started to ignore my emails. BUYER BEWARE!
3,The projector brightness is very good in night.  On the wall during the day (with curtains drawn) the picture looks  good  and even better in the night. The issue i see which made me to return it is the warp on the top. I tried  for few hours with keystone projection and found no way to remove the curve/warp on the top. seems this is a common issue across reviews form others too. I had to return this finally.
5,Replaced the LG short throw that wasnt 4K (but still a fantastic project IMHO) and we are so impressed with this upgrade.  Its used in our living room where the wall is professionally prepared with real projector paint and a full 7-channel Onkyo surround system with Dolby Atmos.  We have Amazon Fire and Xbox hooked up both which supply 4K.  The pic is great; its crystal clear bright enough for day time watching with the shades halfway down (or else direct sunlight in the room).  The Android OS is fully loaded except for Netflix. However we run everything through the Fire cube so I havent used any of the native Android apps.  Remote works well and isnt too big.  If I have one complaint its that the projector lense doesnt have a cover. To keep it dust free I just cover it with the lense wipe that came with the projector.  We've had zero issues and setup was a breeze.  Probably took 10 minutes from unbox to turning it on and using it.  Its a keeper!
5,I was skeptical ordering such an expensive projector with not many reviews. Looking at all the positive reviews and product info I decided to bite the bullet...Pros:Value for your money. I'd argue similar technology/products would be double the cost of NOVA.The Ultra Short Throw saves your $ in running wires and set up cost. I'll never again have a projector hanging from the ceiling.The fan sound is noticeable only during low volume.Solid/quality construction and the Projector is actually a decently heavy but kids can still push it if they really try or there's two of them.With the added sound output it has actually pretty decent equal to a small sound bar. Though I plan to get surround sound system.Remote is simple and UI easy to navigate. Bluetooth based so you don't need to point it to operate the remote. Plus it has voice command.The focus calibration and Keystone correction a plus. Helps give it a borderless look.Cons:Operating System could be better. For isntance it does come with lots of apps but is missing Netflix. This can be easily overcome if you connect a 4K Firestick or Roku which very inexpensive.
5,Waited for the price to drop and purchased the projector. At first I was impressed with the quality and did not have any complaints but noticed a dark spot at lower left corner of the picture with wavy image there so opted for the best solution to get it replaced. But when I contacted both Amazon and Wemax support they asked me to return and buy it again which means I have to buy it at regular price. What is the point of having Prime day then ? to sell defective products to customers and then make them return to make them buy again and regular price ? Very disappointed with the level of customer support and absolutely nothing done by Wemax for customer satisfaction.[Update] : The Wemax customer support was nice enough to contact me and give me the product at a cheaper price than what I bought for the prime day. Their responses are very quick and is always willing to help. Will provide an update after a period of usage but the initial look of the projector looks excellent and totally satisfied with it so far
5,The first search result when I looked for a projector was the vava. We were ready to pull the trigger but my wife insisted we keep looking for a better price.. Once again she was right! We read through the reviews and someone else said they also were comparing the two. The specs are exactly the same and they even look the same. This one was cheaper but the vava had lots of good reviews.Like the review we were reading we decided to go with the nova. Right out of the box the nova was super easy to setup. We watched Titanic (wifes fav movie) and the picture quality was stunning!! The colors are really vivid and picture very detailed. It has speakers at the front which was a very clever design detail are also really good. It doesn't have netflix which is a major drawback for us. But as the only negative we could find with this product we're fine with it. Other people here mention getting a streaming device which we're fine with. We were thinking of getting apple tv anyways. Overall this projector has earned a 5/5 rating. Great product!
5,It’s been a tough year and I’ve been home a lot so I decided to gift myself a new television this holiday. After doing some research I realized 'Bigger is Better' and a laser projector would work best in my house. I looked at the vava 4k LG HU80KA Optima GT1090HDR and the WeMax Nova. Ultimately I settled on the Nova because it was the best combination of features and price.Out of the box it took me all of maybe 15 minutes to setup. There is a guided setup tutorial that helps a ton. The picture quality is impressive definitely better than the 4K Sony in my bedroom. I tested a 4K HDR movie and was really pleased with the vividness and color – it’s a really sharp image. I also tested the FPS rate as claimed by playing on my Playstation – no complaints there. It comes with Android TV but was surprised Netflix wasn’t a native app. After contacting support they mentioned you just need a Fire TV stick or similar product. I added that and I’m good to go.Usually I am a pretty tough critic and I’m struggling to find a fault with this projector. I would say the lack of Netflix is one drawback but I can’t find a similar product that says it DOES have it. Bottom line this is a quality 4K projector.
5,I have done many research and read a lot of reviews eventually settled on buying the WeMax Nova projector. We wanted to watch a movie in a bigger screen and play video games. This projector fits these requirements and the sound while watching a movie from the projector is quite immersive like having a theater at home. The picture quality is very good even with a semi-bright room during the day. The instructions are easy to follow we did not have any difficulty setting up the projector the first time.  The only thing we had trouble is positioning the projector at the correct distance from the wall so that it’s not too big and still ‘see’ everything. I am beyond satisfied with this purchase! It’s worth every cent I paid for this projector. So far I haven’t got any problems with it since I read that it’s a new product on the market. I would recommend this to my friends. It’s specially good for entertaining a crowd at home.
5,Remote is a little sensitive if accidentally bumped.
5,This is my first purchase for a 4k Laser Projector I've always been a "TV Guy" with the opinion that there is no way for a projector to match the picture quality of a TV but I wanted a bigger screen for my Basement Home Theater so I decided to give the 4k Laser Projector a shot.I was looking at the VAVA Bomaker Optoma or WeMax. After much research I decided on the WeMax and I couldn't be happier!!!The packaging was great and the setup was very easy to do. The keystone correction options for this projector is 10 of 10 the remote is easy to use!But the thing that blew me away was the picture quality it is absolutely stunning and clear. I have a 110" Elite Screen and it is everything I was looking for in a projector.I will be using a surround sound system but the sound on the projector wasn't terrible.I would highly recommend buying this item!
5,Previously I had the optoma gt5500+ projector and i gotta say this one blows it out the water in just about every single category. I play video games a lot so finding a low latency projector was my goal. This one is probably the best from the projector category. As I tested and confirmed with their customer service team 40ms lag at game mode...not bad at all for a projector.The image quality is very bright it actually looks good both in day light and in the dark - but i recommend find a good screen. The audio output is top shelf but some might prefer to hook up a surround sound syste. The user interface is very sleek and well thoughtout. I'm using it at 120 inch but can go up to 150. The 8 point image keystone adjustment is a must that gives that borderless/inifinity look. This is a very good projector i'd argue the best you can get at this price.
5,good quality and price
3,I wanted to replace my old Optoma UHD 51A with WeMax Nova UST projector. I returned it after a week due to an issue that I couldn't resolve.Compared to my UHD 51A the picture quality is very good. Better than UHD 51A primarily because of it being brighter. Surprisingly the sound quality improved dramatically as well. I have a sound bar that can decode most of sound codec natively. My UHD 51A is connected via 50ft optical HDMI vs 6ft HDMI 2.0 cable on WeMax. Since my shield TV is connected directly to the soundbar I did not expect any changes in the sound quality. I don't know why but it is better.Nonetheless I had to send it back due to a frequent signal loss experienced while using the shield TV.  I tried different port and cable but I was still experiencing signal loss. The unit was updated to the latest version. I don't know if it is due to a defect or not. If you don't run into any issue it is a keeper.
5,Easy to setup o have it in my home theater. I setup works well with my Denon and Firetv. Had some issues with the Nvidea Shield but found that that was due to the Shield so it was returned. Projector is nice looking smaller than other Ultra Short throws I have it about 13 inches from the wall where the 120 inch screen is it looks terrific. My room is 10x14 with 4 seated with full Dolby atmos setup. I couldn’t ask for a better projector to this point.
3,Without vertical lens shift you can not get this projector to fit the screen unless you manually manipulate the distance the projector is from the screen either by lower or raising the projector or screen.  Now I have to buy an adjustable stand to get the projector the correct distance.  Picture quality is good though.
4,Man what a picture! Replacing an Epson projector about 5 years old that has served us well. Didn’t realize what we were missing! Setup was easy and was able to fit image perfectly within my screen. Down side it all the Google bloat you have to deal with. Some may find it useful but we use a receiver to switch between the multitude of devices we have (and of course receiver drives speakers so not using built in speaker). All we needed is a single HDMI connection. Having to navigate away from the google services to the HDMI 1 port each startup is just a pain and annoying. Otherwise happy with the picture.
5,This thing is as advertised. For the price u can’t do any better. As far as the noise I only experienced it once. Turns off and back on and it was gone. U will need a dark room to maximize the colors and quality for movies. I have a 65” lg oled and decided to go big 120” so I had to give up something. If you have f u movie I say get the biggest oled u can get with great sound. I wanted great sound with great picture quality. I can live without the deep blacks oled offers. If watching sports it still looks good with lights on. If you are about budget this is perfect.
1,I really wanted to like this projector. I had a JVC DLA-X30 prior to this so I'm not new to video projection technology. JVC produces an exceptional 1080p device in the X30 but I wantred to upgrade to 4k HDR and also was intrigued by Ultra Short Throw technolgy. The unit arrived over a week later than I expected. I was hoping this was not portending things to come. The unit was well packaged and installation instructions were adequate. It was up and running with Google TV in short order. Configuring the unit with my Denon AVR-750h was another story. Configuration options and explanations of the options are nonexistant. Both devices support ARC and CEC. Wemax did nothing to explain how to set up their unit to support it. Wemax's tech support is a joke. If you call their main number you are informed that they can't take your call because they are busy with other calls. You submit a request via email and you get a response in a couple of days or not at all. Their response to my ARC/CEC configuration issue was to contact Denon. BTW ARC/CEC worked great when connected to my JVC. My current issue is that when one views 4k source material with HDR the HDR logo should appear in the upper right hand corner for a brief period of time at the beginning of the video. This does not happen on the Wemax Nova when viewing HDR video from Disney + Paramount + or from a Sony  UDP X700 which supports 4k and HDR. This all leads me to believe that Wemax Nova does not support HDR which if true is a vast misrepresentation of their product which clearly states that it does. I can't find out for certain because they refuse to respond to my emails with an answer to the question or even acknowledge that they received the question. It appears that I'm going to be forced to return this unit and purchase another product. Again too bad because I had high hopes for it.
5,I'm extremely satisfied with this projector! Having watched several videos on this device and others like it my choice seemed clear. For the price you get a quality device with solid performance. I purchased to connect my existing devices to it (appleTV Xbox Series X Nintendo Switch) but the built in Android TV software is great too. This is important for anyone buying a projector: These devices are technologically complex so do not get discouraged if you have issues with the first one you buy. I had to return my first purchase but have no issues with my second. Some reviewers mentioned that this is common with laser projectors so don't get discouraged. The picture quality is fantastic and I am so happy I made this purchase.
3,This is a really solid perhaps the best value in UST projectors.  Even better that the Vava 4k which is probably it's direct competitor in terms of features and price.I ordered mine on sale for about $2300 after tax and I love just about everything about it but upon setting it up there was a significantly noticeable "wave" on the top have of the image that simply couldn't be gotten rid of with any settings/image correction options (I spent quite a while trying to).  While I wasn't using a screen I moved the unit to display in multiple walls and the wave effect was unchanged.For $2300 it was too much of a compromise so I'm going to return it.  I actually tried to exchange it because had that "wave" effect not been there I think this is by far the best value in USTs out there but for whatever reason the only option is to return.
4,Remote not recognized by Amazon stick controller
5,The projector was very easu to set up.  Been loving it.
4,After hunting for UST projectors I finally settled in wemax nova. Very happy about the purchase.Costumer service is very quick in replying to the email.I feel there should be multiple display modes other than 'view' and 'highlight'. There is no visible difference I can see between these.
5,This projector is really intuitive. It uses android tv. Mine came with Netflix but no Prime video. Besides that there’s plenty of other streaming apps that it uses. The projector is simple to adjust once you adjust it on the wall. All the focus and lens adjustments are done digitally in the setting. As far as 4K and HDR content It’s amazing. Just make sure you toggle the HDMI source to receive HDMI 2.0. If you don’t then your external sources will be set to 1080p. I’ve owned dlp projectors and I must say the picture quality of laser is just phenomenal. Hopefully it will last as stated 30k hours and 10 years of operation. Only time will tell. Besides that amazing product for the price.
5,I normally dont write reviews but after just now I decided I had too. The Nova was delivered about a week ago and I've just been in awe of how great the picture quality is - absorbing into my couch. I don't get a lot of sunlight in my living room and the washout during the day is actually really minimal. I'm not a tech nerd who can explain what the difference between 1080p and 4K is but I can't stop raving about how good the picture quality is. I did also purchased the Elite screen at the same time which was not cheap. But I would definitely recommend purchasing a good screen...Definitely better in overall performance!
5,It is very good quality one of newest laser projectors. Manufactured in China September 2020. Difficult to find rewiew of this product however I took a chance and am very pleased.I am using 100" projection screen the image is excellent especially in 4K resolution just stunning.One of great futures is the Keystone Correction so the image on the screen is geometrically perfect even though the position of projector is not perfect in relation to the screen. In my case I didn't need to buy a new furniture piece for the projector just used my credenza and tilted the projector using adjustable screws in the back.The sound system is ok could use more adjustment options not just volume control.
2,Based on the positive reviews I decided to buy WeMax Nova for my home theater.  For testing purposes I projected the image on the wall during setup and immediately noticed two things:  The lens has a major flaw that results in the top edge of the image being wavy; no amount of keystone correction could fix that.  In addition there are two dirt spots that are permanently displayed on the screen.  Cleaning the lens with the provided lens cloth did not fix this issue suggesting the dirt spots are on the inside of the lens.  I have moved the projector from wall to wall to eliminate the possibility of the wall being the culprit and got the same result each time.It is a shame because the colors the projector produces are really good and the quality of the built-in sound system is respectable.  If you are lucky enough to get a good unit free from defects you might be fine.  On the other hand a piece of equipment that costs almost $2000 should not have these types of basic quality control issues.  My unit goes back to Amazon and I will be buying another brand.
5,Easy to set up (you could plug it in and go without issue if you already have your screen hind). Needs to be 12” off the wall so you need at least a 24-26 inch deep cabinet or entertainment stand to set it on but it is great and can ceiling mount as well which is a cool option. But overall it’s got all the same apps you would find on a fire stick (including the ability to download the free movie apps)
5,Watched a 4k HDR movie and was very pleased with picture quality on a 120" screen. The sound is great as well though I plan to connect to a receiver for surround sound. One suggestion which would be awesome if I could use the built in sound bar in the projector as the center channel of my 5.1 system but I realize that may not be possible as powered speakers are not compatible with amplified speaker wire. I would have purchased a model without a speaker if that was an option.
3,This is a nice projector but not sure the picture is better than the eight year old 46” Vizio tv it replaced and not much better than my 13 year old Sony Bravia projector. Looks decent in bright light and pretty good in a dark room. Speaker is adequate but nothing special I have a Bose sound bar I was using with my old tv but the optical cable doesn’t seem to work with this projector. Remote doesn’t come with batteries and there is no real up/down adjustment like on most projectors. Overall it throws a nice big picture with a decent picture quality  and adequate sound.
3,The projector brightness is fantastic. On the wall during the day (with curtains drawn) the picture looks great and even better in the night. The colors are true (I compared on different TVs and devices) and I expect it to get better on a good screen. I compared across three 4k projectors and this picture stood out as the best.The issue that's going to lead me to return it is the warp on the top. I played a lot with keystone projection and found no way to remove the curve/warp on the top. Considering the same issue across different reviews I imagine it's a defect in the lenses or prisms.
3,Internet connectivity was hit or miss (even w really strong WiFi) and then one day it just shut off and haven’t been able to get it back working.
5,I have this in my basement with a "Silver Screen" I have had it for 3 weeks now and can't find anything I don't like about it. We love the picture quality the sound quality and the Android TV operations. Has everything we need at a much better rate than others.
5,This is the my first Home Theater Projector and so far the best investment I've made on Amazon. It works great with my Kodi box PlayStation and Direct TV. I purchased a 100" size screen with my NOVA Short Throw Projector. My wife loves the audio and the picture size. She jokes that we dont need to go to the movies anymore.I would recommend this NOVA Projector to anyone looking to have an easy to use and simple to setup home theater system. 5 stars
1,I don't know if it was a one off or a recurring issue. I really wanted to like this product sounded too good to be true.right out of the box I was testing it and I had the left side of the screen with white vertical lines from top to bottom of the screen. I thought there must have been a sticker or something that is messing up the picture but I realized it is not. I restarted the whole thing and reset it a couple of times and it just is messed up right out of the box. I'm in the process of returning it now and spend the extra $$ on a reputable brand that actually has a customer service phone number!It's too big of an investment to throw at an unknown brand in my opinion.
5,I had a Xgimi portable projector(1080p) that’s super easy to use and looks good at night. However it was nothing compared to this laser tv projector for both it’s brightness and picture quality. It’s not a fair comparison for both price (500 vs 2000) and product features (portable 1080 vs stationary 4K). This is a much high end product that meets its price if you want to replace traditional tv with a close-to-wall projector or maybe for your basement home theatre.
5,I and my family just moved into a new home. After research I end up picked this one for it is great price and good feature comparing to Vava Anker. I never had a VAVA one before but this one works extremely good with my home theater system the optical audio gave it perfect sound. The light is strong enough even during day time and great color I am very impressed especially at this price my another good buy.
5,So great for kids games and cartoons. A very nice high quality made movie with bright colors will look amazing. Not so much with people movies nice but sometimes they look washed. The darker the better the image
5,I'm only 24 hours in but I am absolutely stunned by the clarity sharpness and crisp colors with this projector.  Buying a projector online is never easy but I am blown away that this isn't at the same price point as a couple more known/popular models.  Buying this during Prime Day was a steal!!  Setup was very easy and I am now all set for football season!
3,This unit was an older model manufactured by Fengmi(formovie). A typical drawback with 1chip DLP is its the rainbow effect! I can see it easily if I move my eyeball just a little fast. The annoying thing is once you see the rainbow then you can never unsee it!  The brightness is also not high enough so the picture is dark even with ALR screen. The remote is poorly designed very anti intuitive for serval function key location. Not recommended!
5,Love this projector. Paired it with a Nakamichi Shockwafe Ultra 9.2.4 system on a 150in Silver Ticket screen and have an amazing home theater. The resolution setup could be a little more user friendly and the fact that you can’t choose a default input device is a little annoying but I wouldn’t trade the projector for another. The picture quality is outstanding. Highly recommend.
5,This is one awesome piece of equipment. Very easy to set up. I would recommend anybody looking for an ultra short throw laser to make sure that it has the eight point correction which makes a huge difference. Video and sound are perfect. Processor is fast. Very satisfied.
2,Top of screen is blurry (Mostly text) and cant get it to focus. HDMI does not function properly as a movie starts the unit says display unexpectedly stopped working and have to back out to the main menu and go back to the HDMI input several times.Working on getting a replacement and will update this if I do.Pros:4K sources look sharp and crisp.Very BRIGHT!!!!!!!Colors are vibrant favoring blue the most. Like seeing a cop car with its light flashing down the street in a night scene or blue energy shooting across the screen looks amazing.Blacks are dark and rich for a projector in dark scenes. But! are also crushed and with some settings made better but still lose detail in dark scenes. Like in a horror movie there was a creature in the shadows and could not even see it there but on my OLED it was clearly there.
2,Advertised as 4K but felt as if it's 720p and major warping on the upper portion of the area of projection. I did everything I could to straighten out the edges using the keystone correction but in the end it's just a poor quality projector. Again the quality did not seem like 4K even with the video settings set to 4K. For over $2400 I'd rather get myself an 85" 4K TV for much less. For comparison I borrowed my friend's projector (longthrow 1080p projector with only 600 lumens) and had super straight boundaries and a sharper projected image. The ultrashort throw idea is nice but at this point just save your money. Hopefully there will be high demand for ultrashort throw projectors that will allow for more variety with better quality.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This 4K laser projector has very competitive specifications compared to other $4k+ products and the video quality is pretty decent. the UI is Android TV native which is exact same to my Sony TV and was able to install external android apps.So far I was pretty happy with this projector and also recommended to my friends.
5,The quality is perfect
3,Great picture but like previous buyers comments the upper right side has a major image shift from the lens. If you are using it on a smaller screen 125” or smaller you can adjust it out but on larger screens its knowing you can do. That is the reason for my 3 star rating. Ending up returning it and just paying more for a LG Cinebeam projector.
3,probably mine came faulty but something internally makes a very high pitch sound. this sound can be unhear if you place the volume all way up but even with that in all movies there's a no sound section which brings back that horrible sound.  Besides that the picture quality was awesome and the stock android (8) was great.
2,For this price they should have standard quality.  Speakers are decent and remote is nice.  brightness is average.  The borders of the screen are wavy and have very large bulges in random areas. I tried on a flat wall various projection screens.  I tried moving the unit in ALL dimensions tilting/orientation. nothing will fix the wavy bulges.  I ordered a replacement because I though I maybe just got a bad unit.  The replacement was even worse.  Lots of wasted time and definitely NOT worth the price.  If this was a $500 unit it might have gotten 3 stars.  No thanks.
2,The projector i received was definitely not new as described even already had someone's gmail account still in there and missing battery with cut wrappings. The color and lighting seemed off so i don't know why they would send me an open unit that seems to have issue. All the reviews i saw and images relative to what i received definitely shows an issue with the product i received shameful of the seller WeMax to send a defective unit even a functioning open box as new.The QA/QC for supposedly a local provider should be better than to pawn off a bad product on to the customer.
5,Bought this to replace my 70 inch screen TV! This projector is awesome.  super easy set up and now i can watch movie everywhere in my house. A screen is recommended for best movie experience
5,This is amazing in a dark room super bright but it's got to be super low to the ground for the biggest screen size I love it got mine on prime day for 1600 great deal
1,You cannot put it on a ceiling because it does not have lens  shift even $50 projectors has that feature. if you have a TV stand that’s higher than 14 inches the image is going to be on the ceiling and since it doesn’t have lens shift the only thing you could do is to Keystone correction but then it makes your image distorted and The picture gets wavy on the top left corner. And if you’re the type of person that likes to change the picture quality like warmtheatergame mode etc. you’re out of luck because the projector has a pathetic excuse for the settings page also The remote control doesn’t come with batteries and I know it might sounds like I’m nitpicking but when you pay $2100 for a projector you should expect it to come with batteries overall I am extremely dissatisfied with the product and the company just another Chinese knock off I would not pay more than $400 for this projector.
5,using it to watch tv for several month totally worth it. Especially watching sports and movie the enjoyable are higher than my expectation. The included speaker is also good enough for me.
5,Very nice picture quality.  For standard height stands make sure the wall is at least 10ft high.  I got a lower stand as my wall was only 9ft high and it looks great!
3,Great picture quality and sound  but the top part of the screen is super distorted.  Sending this back...
5,Is really enjoying this projector Is all around good stuff
5,Quick setup. Didn’t play very nice with an xbox series x but with some help from customer support we were able to get the 4K up and running
5,Had no problems with set up...android google operating system annoying! I want my own apps on this thing!!!
5,Excellent quality picture and sound.
1,The projector functions just as described. Easy to setup install apps and stream videos. Decent sound. However the projected screens border had the top border wavy. It was straight it wasn't curved. Wavy. There was no fixing it by adjusting the screen. The bottom left and right sides also had slight angles that no adjusting the screen would fix. The bottom border also had a slight curve.I saw other people having issues with just one corner. Thought I'd try my luck.I decided to return it for this reason and the fact that for something to be over 2000 dollars the screen shouldn't look terrible.
2,Disappointing quality for the price. Sadly quality issues in manufacturing lead to a warp in the picture from a warp in the lens over the laser. No amount of keystone adjustment will fix it. Defective out the gate and massively disappointing.
1,Speakers failing within four months with heavy distortion under half volume. Can never get a fully in focus picture which seems to be a trait of UST projectors. (One top corner is always blurred.) Often get rainbow effects which seems to be a DLP trait. Remote sucks with no source button. Projector can't boot straight to source and kicks out to ad filled home screen. No Netflix support. Motion blur/chop even in game mode.
5,It was very bright
5,Very good
1,It worked great for about a week and then I started having problems with the projector losing internet connection. Turning on and off solves the issue for about 3 minutes before projector loses internet connection again. This happens every single time I turn it on. Yes I checked my internet connection and no other connected device has ever had this issue. This thing is going back. Save your money and buy something else.
1,This product does not support Amazon prime video and Netflix also HDMI ARC is not supported .Either 5.1 or 7.1 sound does not supported.Difficult to adjust the screen with short through laserI don’t recommend at all and I’m totally dissatisfied
2,Difficult to get picture right.  Quality of picture was good though.
1,This was my dream come true until it wasn't. I couldn't get the top left corner to keystone right and after I reset it it got worse. To add insult to injury now I have to play email tag with because custom service # send you to the  support email. Only had it 6 days. 😡
1,Is not bright enough
2,Bead connectin to HDIM
5,This thing is amazing! Highly recommended. You should get a wemax 100” ALR screen too to make this thing pop. Only cons in my opinion are the lack of 3D and HDR doesn’t look good but the SDR is perfect. Hard to go back to a 65” OLED when you have this. Wish they made 150” ALR screens. Compare this to other 4k USTs and I think you’ll see for the price it is hard to beat.
1,Remote has no mute button but that was fixed by the projector ceasing to turn on leaving me with a brick after 60 days. Tried calling and one number is dead and the other one has a message saying to go online and contact them via an app I had to download. All in all I spent $168 shipping the unit back for a refund. I simply do not trust this company. I’m buying a known brand that I trust will work for more money.
1,We purchased the WeMax Nova brand new directly from Amazon (prime) which at first glance was working good. Good picture and brightness. We were satisfied even if the projector settings/options are very simple and very basic (and very similar to a $200 projector. Actually our $250 Yaber options seem better than a $25k Wemax projector!)But we didn't let the appearance influence our opinion until the projector started to have power issues.PROBLEM: the projector worked for 2 days. They 3rd day it won't turn on. It takes several tries to turn it on which is concerning. When we plug the projector even different outlets it takes a while before the power kicks in. No lights at all.THE WARRANTY (we couldn't register even after 1 week of back and forth emails with customer support)The options are very simple there aren't that many options to choose from. Unable to set the default HDMI input.Why is the registration a joke? 1) to register they ask to use their 'contact us ' form there isn't a professional warranty registration form. 2) they won't reply to confirming the warranty (they said that our warranty request was never received. 3) we tried contacting them directly to their support email and we provided our serial number and other info and they never reply acknoledging the warranty. Their last words where " We will check the system and will reply you soon！". Which isn't reassuring. Are they waiting for the 30 days to expire? They can try but we won't.  4) We'll be returning this projector ASAP before the Amazon 30 days policy because this company doesn't seem reliable nor trustworthy. We don't want to loose $2k.We'll invest the money into another projector using a more reliable brand that stands behind their products. Even if we need to spend extra money. We never heard of WeMax we gave them a chance and they failed to provide a satisfying customer support.At this point even if WeMax contact us for a replacement we won't trust to ship the projector back and wait for a replacement or refund. We'll return it directly to Amazon.
1,Had 10 pixel burn out in the first six months.  25 in the first year.Avoid this thing like the plague.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 After I received the product I couldn't wait to turn on the advanced projector to experience it. However after the machine was turned on a high frequency and very sharp noise was generated. Although the volume was not large it was always there. I've updated the software update to the latest version but it doesn't work. So I think it's a hardware problem. I tried to contact customer service for a replacement but WEMAX's phone support on the seller's page went unanswered and I was frustrated that I couldn't contact the seller directly on the order page. I believe the product quality may be very high end but the customer service and after-sales service experience is really terrible!
5,Caveat for my review - I am still waiting for my screen to arrive so my review is based on my inability to wait.  I decided to unbox and test the system before my screen arrives to complete my setup.  The unit came with a great box and plenty of foam protection for the actual unit.  The setup was so very easy simply plug the sucker in and turn it on boom! done. The remote is very nice takes two AAA batteries. I immediately went through the configuration for focus and keystone correction.  I was aware that I could have a little bacon effect until I project to my new screen but even then the border was pretty flat as you can see in my screenshot projecting to my textured wall.  I did have to perform a update right out of the gate but it was pretty simple to connect to my home network and let it finish.  It did disconnect once but it could've been my home internet not 100% sure.  If you re expecting a small little unit guess again you can't get a laser projector in a pint size unit.  This thing is about as big a stereo receiver but just not as thick (tall).  See the Coke can next to it in one of the pictures I shared to help you envision its size.  And best of all my last picture I let me son hook up his Nintendo switch to it and play Fortnite and wow it was awesome no noticeable lag.  My true setup will have an Xbox running to it.It will look great on my console table once I have it all ready to go with the screen...can't wait.  I'm only going 100" which is plenty large for our media room.  I'll try and repost updated images once I am all setup.
5,Buy this projector. It is rated #3 in best projectors. The #2and #1 projectors will cost you double and triple the cost of this one. I didn’t believe that this would project a up to 150” picture in 4K with any clarity but mines at 93” right now and clear as a sunny day. Pretty bright too during the day with blinds open but better at night. A little temperamental to set up you have to think a little backwards with distance and focus but once you get it right it’s well worth it. I am on a limited budget but I would buy this again anytime. It’s made by Xiomi in the spirit of their Mi projector. Won all kinds of awards. You just can’t get a better laser projector for this price. Believe me I did my homework before I bought it.
5,OK full disclosure I am not super picky when it comes to high quality sound or graphics. I bought the Nova so I wouldn’t have a projector in the middle of my living room or hanging from the ceiling. Right now we are just projecting against the wall but now looking to get a projector screen. Even though our wall is textured the picture brightness and clarity is so infinitely better than our old Anker projector that it is like putting glasses on for the first time when you didn’t even know you needed them! Also the sound is excellent for our purposes. Set up was very easy. Not sure we've fully explored all the functionality range just yet but we got the basics going in under 20 minutes. I will say I was surprised by how big it is. It's hefty and not exactly subtle but as far as a big box goes it's aesthetically pleasing enough to not dominate the room.
5,Excellent product!Best Gaming UST projector now (sep 2021)Easy to use.Once you setup everything properly the image is stunning.Be aware:-Tricky to set up  the distance & height from the screen. you'll have to figure out your media furniture distribution (or the lack of it)-No 3D capabilities (WEMAX: would be nice a future system/firmware update with it)-Every time you turn it on is set up in the Android projector’s main screen would be nice it remembers the last setting or video input. (WEMAX: Maybe in a future system update/firmware?)My most important recommendation: use a Projector screen specially designed for UST projector trust me is a game changer.
4,Really good quality picture. Though my 4K HDR roku keeps re-authenticating using HDCP 2.2 on all HDMI 2.0 ports which is necessary for 4k playback resulting in periodic snow screen.My 4k HDR roku works fine on other 4k TVs so looks like some inter-operability issue. I hope this is just a software issue and they fix it in next software update.No such issue when I used FireTV 4K HDR. So I'm good for now. Audio and video quality looks great with nice HDR colors. Full screen focus was spot on no blurry edges/corners.Make sure screen/wall is texture free and absolutely flat otherwise it may look wavy/bendy.
5,slightly more brightness and contrast are lacking in image quality settings
5,I did a lot of research before making my purchase. Ultimately the VAVa and NOVA fell in the price range I wanted to spend and the specs I wanted. The VAVA does have a little more lumens but other than that they’re basically the same projector. At 2100 lumens I wasn’t convinced an extra 400 lumens was worth the additional $400. So I decided to take a gamble on the lesser known NOVA and used the savings towards a high-end projector screen.That decision proved to be the correct one (I believe) because the projector screen absolutely makes a difference.The NOVA is actually a very good projector when it comes to light output color and contrast ratios sound and has some impressive features like the voice command remote. Sometimes brands are overly boastful in their claims but that’s not true here. They claim to have 4K UHD projection and the eye test tells me that is absolutely true. I’ve tested a few 4K movies played with the settings a little and the projector lived up to that billing. During the day there is some color wash but not by a whole lot - likely not anymore than an LED TV.The sound is OK. I would recommend to anyone with a large room to invest in some quality speakers. But if your living room is under 400 sq ft you’re probably fine. Some people complained that NOVA doesn’t have netflix. To me this wasn’t a big deal because I was planning to use an Apple TV anyways so that bypasses that issue. User interface is actually done very well it’s sleek and easy to use.Overall I am beyond pleased with my purchase. I got (both projector + screen) what I wanted at a good price and you can’t complain about that!
1,1st of all there's absolutely no warranty nor support for this projector. There's no US-based representation of the brand so if it brakes you'll end up with a paperweight. I tried emailing support multiple times but never got a reply. The chipset inside this projector is cheap Cortex A-53 which explains why motion is handled soo poorly. The ethernet port is an obsolete slow 100Mbps! Netflix is not installed nor available on the Store as it is not licensed for this unit so you have to side-load it from the internet as an apk file.This projector is "Fengmi" brand not WeMax and you can find various similar models on Alibaba and AliExpress much cheaper. The biggest problem is in the optics. It's distorted and you can't perfectly focus the entire screen area as it leaves areas blurry. I made sure the unit is perfectly leveled and I'm projecting on a perfectly flat and smooth fixed-frame projector screen. There's no dedicated input button or shortcut so every time you need to switch to an input you have to go inside menu options. I returned this projector today and ordered the Samsung premier for $570 more but it uses three lasers (RGB) so there is no spinning color wheel which brings better colors and eliminates rainbow effects for those sensitive to it. Again I could probably live with some drawbacks but not having a warranty is a big NO. I can't play 2K lottery with this company and hope that they will back up their Fengmi re-branded projector. No wonder there is no logo anywhere indicating its name.
5,Great projector picture quality is great the sound from the projector is unbelievable loud and good quality. My projector is just a few inches from the wall and I don’t have to worry about all the cables in the sealing or anything. Really good projector and great price for a short throw projector.
4,I just got my projector love every bit of it only downside is no native support for Netflix and Amazon Prime titles. Seeing "something went wrong" message for Amazon Prime. Hoping this will be resolved  with fire stick.Wondering if Android 10 supports Netflix & Amazon prime.
5,#1 I like this projector  very much....
5,This is an amazing short throw projector. The nova has everything you’d expect from one of the more expensive brands (upwards of $9000). The picture is vivid and bright even in a room with all the lights on. We did a lot of research before settling on this one. After reading all the great reviews we decided to take a chance on it. I am really happy and impressed with the quality of the product all around. It comes with a stylish and easy to use remote control - which just realized has a voice control feature! This projector can turn your home into your own private theater. We’re really happy we took a chance on this one!
5,I reviewed every UST projector on the market and deliberated over my decision for months I wanted to get it right as this is my first every projector. Let me say this I'm 100% happy with the choice I made. Screen quality is superb (even with ambient light) the sound is phenomenal from the unit (even though I have surround sound) the set-up is easy the option on the screen are superb and easy to use.Buy this one over the competitors!!
5,We upgraded big time and we couldn't be more happy with what we received. This ultra short throw is hands down the top of the line projectors.
4,This is a very good projector.  The color is superb brightness is very good.  It sits 9 inches away from my 100 inch screen.  I would buy it again and I will give it five stars but it's kind of a stupid machine...- It doesn't seem to realize it's your new TV and it doesn't do some basic things you need a TV to do.  There is no bright/contrast/color picture adjustment which isn't really a problem because the picture is perfect.  But there's no way to switch 4:3 16:9 or zoom on the picture so when your local channel or DVD player screws it up you can't fix it. It has a mute function but there is no mute button.  (If you tell Google to mute it on the microphone in the remote it will do it so I know it can do it.)- It loses internet connections in the middle of a movie and you have to reconnect or reboot and then go back and find the movie. (Update; solved by plugging in Cat8 Ethernet cable instead of WiFi.  WiFi very dependable for other streaming but projector never drops out now that it's plugged in.- It won't stay on an input.  I use HDMI1 for the cable box but every time I turn on the projector it's in the Android operating system and takes about six key presses to get to the INPUTS and set to HDMI1 again. A real TV would wake up on the same channel/input as it was using when it was turned off.---- These problems are kind of annoying but I would buy this projector again if only for the price.  Actually for the incredible picture.  But I suppose other laser projectors look about as good.  Best Buy has projectors this good for 6 to 10 thousand dollars.  BenQ has a new one this good for $3600.  For well under $2500 this is a deal.  I just hope some day there's an OS update that fixes some of these goofy problems.I couldn't really figure out who made this; Wava was the brand I bought ForMovie was the brand I got.  No brand at all on the unit just the box and included paper.  Maj. something when you try to log in on WiFi or Bluetooth.  And I've heard that the company is Xiaome or something like that.  So when I damaged my remote I wondered if I'd even be able to find who to contact.  Well I sent an email to customer service and they responded within an hour or two.  I've written several times and they respond right away.  I offered to buy a new remote and they're sending one free.  They're very nice very responsive.I had a really good 52 inch TV beautiful picture.  I wondered if I'd ever find a projector that could be good enough that I could live with it.  Turns out this is better.  The picture from this unit on a gray ALR screen is amazing just as good (IMO) as 35mm film.
