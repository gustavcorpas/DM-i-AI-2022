5,The transaction was very smooth. Thanks for that.I saved $35 on the device over local prices.The player made my "not so smart" older 65" LED TV into a "current" streaming machine!Wifi runs smooth no lag no buffering.It's a WIN Baby!
5,Shipping was quick. Item was as described.Bought this to replace a Samsung BluRay 3D player that took an early dump on me. This unit is small - about the size of a PS4 but half as thick. Simple set up. The 3D playback works well. Good visual and sound playback on 3Ds and BluRay discs. Simple remote.Quite satisfied.
5,After researching several Blue Ray players this unit was the best in the price range for upscaling players. The next level is in the high 200’s- 300’s
5,This dvd player is much smaller than my old one but does so much more. Being that it's a Sony tells me it top quality. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this unit if I was still looking.
5,I haven't used the DVD player yet but I'm sure it'll be okay but I was amazed at the delivery I had it at my front door at 7:00 in the morning Amazon said they would deliver it between 4:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. so when I woke up my package was my front door unbelievable fantastic delivery service I wish I could get everything like this I'm sure the DVD player will stand up to it's to its reputation as a Sony product I'm not concerned looks good packed well everything was included I'm sure it'll be easy to install and it'll have great sound and picture as with all Sony products that I have found or purchased in the past thank you Amazon I can't believe I got it delivered so fast !!!!!
4,Remote control unit is slightly too small and buttons aren’t easy to use but it is not bad equipment overall
4,I am very satisfied with the product.
5,Ease of using dvd player.
3,I got this to use with an older (not smart) TV. It’s definitely a step up from the ancient dvd player we were using and I had no trouble connecting it to the tv or wifi. I love that the remote will also power up the tv and adjust the volume so I don’t have to deal with two remote controls. I was disappointed to realize that I can only get Netflix and Prime through this but Hulu Disney+ and any other streaming service is not useable. I cannot get it to connect to Bluetooth or do the  screen mirroring thing. It also decides not to work at least every other time I try to use it. Fortunately I have discovered that unplugging and re plugging gets it back up. I only use this with the small tv in the bedroom and am content to be limited in my options on streaming services. However if you want to access all of your streaming options you should consider a different product.
4,Easy pairing
4,Limited on playback options no A-B Repeat and only 1 slow setting
4,If you have an analog sound system for your TV you're going to have issues with this Player.  The picture quality is very good.  It is extremely lightweight and surprisingly small with only three connections on it: one HDMI one Digital coaxial (RCA) plug-in and and LAN connection.  I have only been using it for a week or so so I can't comment on durability.  Because of my analog electronics it took a long time to get it to work.
3,The machine sent to me in South Africa was manufactured for American use. America use Reion A or 1 machines and South Africa Region B or 2 machines. Make sure the correct Region machine is purchased.
3,Al poner mi 4k Ultra hd CD en el dvd player no quiere leer el formato. Lo intente varias veces con varias películas y nada. Dis que el formato no es reconocido.
5,I like the size I watch a lot of DVD’s
3,Can' t watch firestick  when I have Dvd player plug in and you can't add some of my appps that are on my firestick.
5,Very nice
5,A little bare-bones but small and tight. Remote and device are very responsive.
5,Easy to set up takes up very little space works great and is versatile. Nice player and worth the price.
5,I needed to update my DVD player technology and my purpose with this Bluray Player was to play my existing DVD's and be able to purchase Bluray movies. I don't currently have wi-fi but I thought having a player capable for that might be wise for the future.Reasons I purchased this particular player:#1) the customer reviews were all good; better then on anything else reporting the device as quiet and easy to use.#2) It is quiet and picture and sound is impressive on regular DVD's which is all we have as yet.#3) It does have a power-on indicator light#4) I liked that it came with everything. It included the cable and a cleaning disc two things I didn't have to worry about hunting for and buying separately.#5)  The player was super simple to set up and the remote worked as soon as the player was plugged in. No need for adding code. You click Home to select your function and it's also simple. The Sony directions do include directions for how to connect to a selection of TV Brands with Sony being default so your remote will run both if you want that.#6) The player is small in size perfect to fit on the shelf on my entertainment center next to my cable box with space leftover. Nice.#7) The player package arrived in good condition well-packaged and 3 days earlier then originally scheduled. Plus the seller made it a package deal including everything I need to set up and care for the player making it so much more convenient for me. I have nothing but praise Hot Deals Electronics.
5,IT HAS A GREAT PICTURE FOR 3D AS WELL AS REGULAR VIDEO AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT I CAN ALSO SURF THE WEB AS WELL AS NETFLIX AND SUCH THROUGH THE UNIT.
4,We have purchased Sony Blu-Ray players since the internet feature became a big part of Blu-Ray players. Now most new TV sets have that feature built in but our older TVs do not and still work great so we need that feature in a couple of our Blu-Ray players.Sadly every Sony unit we have owned has had a problem with locking up requiring it be unplugged to restart it. We went to Sam units which also had some minor problems but at least allowed us to adjust the volume on our Sam TV sets. They have their own set of problems plus are no longer available at a price we want to pay.So after a few years and many new models we decided Sony must have fixed the locking up problem. Nope....but admittedly it has only done it once and I haven't lost all confidence in it.Nice picture features easy to navigate. Fingers crossed.
5,Was happily surprised at how compact the unit is. Delighted to have all the accessories I need to get it up and running. Set up was SUPER easy.I see with this unit there’s no reason to go out and replace my non-smart TVs… this DVD player has all the smart bells and whistles I’m going to need.Extremely satisfied with this purchase!!!
5,Set it up in the WFH office. It hardly takes up any space. It plays cds and dvds. It even played an old concert on a Video CD. Very happy with it.
5,Great Blu Ray/DVD player.  Great picture easy to install and to use.
5,I've had this Blu-Ray for three days so I can really only speak to the out of the box experience which has been excellent. Plugged it in turned it on and all seemed to work.It has built in Spotify and I have an account so I was immediately able to connect to the Blu Ray from my PC and Android phone with no configuration on the PC or phone. The Spotify sound is excellent. I was also able to "cast" to the BDP-6700 from Windows Media Player again with no PC side configuration an unexpected bonus which made me very happy since I have an extensive library of downloaded music. (nothing in the materials suggested that this would work!)I own very few Blu-ray discs and the one I have been playing may not have been shot in high def to begin with so the picture quality is not awesome but the colors are quite vivid. The sound of the Blu-ray is excellent. A friend once told me that I would really like Blu-ray for the sound more than the picture and I think he was right. This Blu-ray is a concert recording and plays in DTS-HD. Great definition on all instruments.Hope it lasts!
5,Sprained wrist. While walking dog we went in opposite directions - dog was not hurt. Went on-line to Amazon found right size wrist brace. Came in package of two and was pink color. Best of all it arrived in "next day delivery". Not only avoided trip to ER (20-mile round trip) saved gas money too - really big deal. Thanks Amazon - Merry Christmas & Happy New Year!!
3,First the picture quality is excellent and the remote is fairly intuitive. From the standpoint of the DVD / Blu-ray player it is very good. My disappointment in the reason for the three star rating just because you cannot download additional apps. There's a fairly limited number of apps pre-installed on the DVD player. Missing amongst them is Hulu sling TV and a number of other apps that we frequently watch. TV. Sony no longer supports the site where you could download additional apps. I guess those the 300 plus additional apps that you can download that are no longer available. I selected the more expensive Blu-ray player so I wouldn't have to get another Roku device but now I guess I will. The description from Sony should really be updated oh it's very deceptive.
5,This player upscales regular DVD's to higher quality. I looked in Best Buy and PC Richards first and no one helped me at their stores so when I came home I went right to Amazon to find what I was looking for and ordered it right away. Easy to hook up immediately with a supplied HDMI cable. It replaces a regular DVD player that I have had for a while and is so much better. I have hundreds of DVD's in my collection that will play better on this Blu-Ray.
3,I am happy to have a DVD player since I own several bookcases of dvd’s.  I was hoping that this had an app for Disney+ but it does not.  In the description it says you can stream  Disney+. This has been too complicated to do.  Plus I can’t get the Bluetooth to hook up to any of the devices.  Extremely frustrating.
3,Player likes to lock up a lot . . . at least by resetting the power always fixes it.
3,It does work as intended. However it is noisy and the remote is small easy to use IF you have small fingers and the remote is easy to get lost. It sounds like an old computer fan wearing out. The picture is (to me) is the same as non "Upscaled". But then again I don't really see a difference between Disc and Blueray.
4,A decent player.  Slightly above average picture with my BlueRay DVD's.  Remote control is tiny - this has been commented on before.  Uses AAA batteries.  The "Xtech Blu-ray Maintenance Pack" is simply a piece of micro-cloth enclosed in plastic which isn't even re-sealable.  Impossible to know how much extra they charged for this.  Set-up for connection to wireless wi-fi was quick and easy.  This changes the 'home page' of the player to a screen full of the apps in full color.  The icon to play a DVD is seemingly grayed-out along the bottom of the display but click on it to start to play a DVD.The player is much smaller than any other player I've seen - only slight less that twice the size of the DVD tray itself.  I hope this doesn't impact the reliability of the player.  Time will tell.
3,Picture quality is Good but the player has a mind of its own a lot of freezing pictures.
5,The controll takes some time getting used to but once you do it's super easy to use...even in the dark
3,What I needed was the DVD/VCR Componation.
5,How can you beat a Sony product?
5,I think this was a great buy… haven’t noticed too much in the upscaling dept. I have this on a 75 inch 4K tv… but it works great and is small…
5,I have several Sony players and they have always been wonderful.
3,The unit frequently locks up and needs to be un-plugged and re-plugged back in and when plugging back in the brace point in the front of the unit is where the power button is. Also the buttons are too small for average hands.
4,Not much to say Sony is reliable.  Easy to connect to TV remote is basic and easy to use.  Plays Blu Ray DVD's and music CDs.  Compact size is nice.
3,The product is the Sony DVD Blu-ray player but the description said it came with HDMI cable and cleaning cloth. When we opened it it didn't have either of those things and there was a DVD Movie already inside. The unit appears to work but we are disappointed it wasn't as described and it was clearly at least an open box.
4,Speedy delivery even without Prime. Careful competent packaging with all expected parts extras and straight forward instructions. Was surprised but also grateful for the small footprint of the unit. Quick and easy set-up with an older Vizio TV. Unfortunately this was one brand not  controllable with the player's remote. Connecting to Wi-Fi network and pairing with Blue tooth headphones was just as quick and easy. After the  initial operational setup It was a bit more involved  finding the various adjustment and changes for specific viewing and audio options and while that's true with any new device it's not all intuitive but may become so after a while. So far I've only watched older DVD films (House of Flying Daggers) and listened to music files on a USB stick and am happy with both the upgraded picture quality and the stereo/surround sound transfer with this unit.  Will see how online streaming functions and actual bluray films look soon enough.
3,Sony needs to update this Blu-Ray player only a couple built-in apps YouTube and Netflix and no way to update it for yourself.
1,I've had this product for a little over a month now and it was working great. The picture was good it connected to my internet easily remote was simple and easy to use. Now for the last week it started with Prime video it started to freeze the player now Youtube won't buffer so I can't even stream youtube on this 200+$$$ dollar thing what the hell? I could have just bought an Xbox S with a blueray or ps4 (Even though I already have both still would have been better) and it plays games for this price instead I got a player that won't even play youtube.......... what a joke and of course I'm out of the return window. I've factory reset the device reset my router unpluged the unit pluged it back in uninstalled and reinstalled the Apps nothing works and I can't return it. Go with an Xbox or ps4 its the same price but you get way more.Update: I'm changing my review to a 4/5 instead of 2 because they sent out an update the other day that fixed all the problems I was having. Still think a playstation or Xbox S is a better value though.Edit: Just keep having problems with freezing apps just stop working player isnt saving my playback spots in movies if I pause a movie more than 5 min the player will just shut off then it doesn't save my spot and I have to watch previews/FBI warning which you can't fast forward through again. This player has been a pain in the rear I've had nothing but problems with it since I got the thing. When it works its great but it has way too many and too frequent glitchs/bugs.If I could do it all over again I wouldn't buy it and I'm kind of pissed honestly.Edit/Update: Player is still a hunk of garbage one of the worst 100+ $$$$ things I've ever bought now it ejects the Dvd tray every time I turn it on for no reason and it freezes and crashs every single day I use it at least 1 time.I'll never buy a Sony branded Dvd player ever again this thing has brought me a LOT OF FRASTRATION!!!! I'm actually angry at Sony for selling such a hunk of TRASH.
4,Replacing my old Sony Blue Ray player since it no longer supported Amazon Prime streaming. I have only use the new one for a few minutes (during setup); but was very easy to setup (3 minutes); and then making sure Netflix and Amazon would come up over Wifi. Both were fine; although when trying to setup HULU; it said HULU was not supported by this device (although you do get the logo on the screen). Can't believe you can buy a new device and it does not support all streaming services. Have not played a DVD yet; but unless something is wrong - I expect it should be fine (and if not - i will update my review).
5,Great features and works well!
5,It replaced my 13-year Sony player the new one is half the size half the weight. wireless WiFi smart 4K. and at a great price price. Awesome Great Technology
5,I brought my sister this one because I own 2 of the same. For it to be so little this dvd player has a lot to offer. Capabilities to add to streaming apps and so much more. The remote is easy to use and has many options.
2,Had to return this since despite the prominent reference to 4K in the description it DOES NOT play 4K Ultra High definition DVDs.  Not exactly false advertising and the model number and price should have set off red flags but I think t should be super clear in the description that this plays blue-ray discs (and does it really well see below.)  I bought the player specifically to enjoy 4K discs on my new 4K TV but when I finally got my hands on a 4K disc the player revealed it's little secret.THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COINI was actually a little sad to return this impostor because when I played a regular DVD and a Blu-Ray DVD on it the images and sound were FAR superior to my previous (Panasonic) Blu-ray player. I was  convinced that when I put a UHD disc in this machine it would blow me away. Alas no because it cannot play 4K UHD discs at all.  If you want a really good Blu-Ray player that does a great job of playing regular DVDs and Blu-Ray DVDs this fits the be bill very nicely...but....THE THIRD SIDE OF THE COINI just ordered the Sony UBP X700 (used) from Amazon to replace this return and it was only a few dollars more than this unit.  And based on my experience with this unit I expect it will do a very excellent job with ALL types of DVDs!
5,Love this product! It's too good to be true. I'm able to excess the internet without buying a smart tv. Easy setup good picture quality.  Good purchase!
3,The physical ‘on device’ as well as the  remote eject dvd buttons will not open if it sits. Need to reboot system.
4,Picture quality good not enough quality apps ..remote too small
5,The DVD Player was smaller than expected.
3,When you pay full price for a product updating it to the newest firmware should not turn it in to an add machine now the default front screen is mostly taken up with unneeded and at least in my use case unwanted apps most that can not either be uninstalled or removed from the main screen.A blue-ray player should on the main screen be at least mostly dedicated to blue-ray player functions not add on crap.  With the amount of adds/apps being pushed on the main screen the price should reflect this.
5,Our old Toshiba 5 DVD player died after many years of faithful service.  We picked this up for a reasonable price and it works satisfactorily.  There are a lot of bells and whistles I'm not sure we're going to use but it will work correctly with the small remote that comes with it.  If you ever lose or damage the remote you're out of business.  HDMI connection only but a nice unit overall.  Works well with my Sony TV and Sony receiver.
3,The only working think is the DVD  Netflix and you tube . Nothing more
4,The unit is well built and easy to use. Everything works fine except I cannot now make it control the TV sound. I have to use the TV remote to do that. My old Samsung player worked to control the TV sound.Also the unit arrived in a box that had been roughly  handled. The box had torn open. There was no packing in the shipping box.
5,N/A
5,The unit was compact and simple to use fits on a shelf easily with limited space. Only tested one store bought DVD in it for a few minutes to make sure it operated so It does not have much play time to comment on features.
5,Great little unit .. should have paired with a Sony TV for more Seamless Remote use
4,So the picture quality is good for both Blu-ray and regular DVDs. But the availability of apps is overrated. I bought this to avoid the heavy electric bill for my PS4 but it does NOT include Disney + or Hulu. Was disappointed in that. I don’t understand why all “smart” devices don’t include all apps but whatever. Allows me to play older Disney DVDs for grandkids.
5,Great product
5,I recently bought a 4k flat-screen and wanted a DVD player that would work best with it.  This is the perfect compliment and the price was decent.
3,The Blu Ray / DVD player works well but I was specifically looking for a player that also played VHS tapes. The description described it as Blu Ray DVD and VCR. It does NOT have the VHS capability.
5,After reviewing several models I chose this player for it's features and easy set-up. It didn't disappoint. The player is very unassuming small and doesn't have all the distracting lights in the front to advertise there's something in the tv cabinet below. Setup took less than 5 minutes and the picture is great. For a "simple" device it offers bluetooth mirroring and also plays CDs. This is a perfect little player that packs a punch!
4,My husband's decade-old Blu Ray player took 5 minutes to load up discs and seemingly another 5 to load the video itself. This thing is half the size and load time from power on to play is maybe 15 seconds.The apps are probably pretty helpful for those without a smart TV or some other streaming device but I don't need them so it'd be nice if a list of the recommended apps didn't take up a third of the home screen. Otherwise it's just what I needed!
5,I love this DVD player. I was worried I would not be able to set it up being technically challenged but it worked like a charm.
5,Simple to install and plays right away.
5,I bought this DVD player largely for its internet access capabilities. Several reviewers had mentioned that this unit had the HULU app/access built-in.While the unit does indeed have most of the "standard" apps you'd expect (Netflix Amazon Prime YouTube) it does NOT provide access to HULU. (Though several previous reviews said that it did the unit I purchased June 2020 does not.)Other than that it is a solid performer. Picture quality is excellent and its remote also works great with the Sony TV it's hooked up to. I'm pleased.
5,It's a nice picture easy setup and remote is simple. Wifi works
2,If you have regular blue rays you are fine to watch but it does not play 4K. AT. ALL.Tried multiple. No 4k!! Believe the reviews!Most of what I have is regular blu ray or DVD. But I can’t watch any 4K Blu rays.What a worthless piece of crap to advertise that its a 4K Ultra player.
5,This is a really nice Blu-Ray/Streaming device.We had an older machine that only had access to YouTube Netflix and Vudu. YouTube stopped supporting that old device over a year ago and then recently it just flat-out stopped working. Not even the Blu-Ray player would work. I decided to get this device after reading the other reviews and we were NOT disappointed. It's really compact easy to setup has Wireless (which was an unexpected bonus) and by default it is setup to handle pretty much every major streaming service we could want. It also has some nice Quality of Life stuff like it automatically remembered which profile we watched Netflix under last session so it had that person's profile already highlighted when we started Netflix.For the money this is fantastic. Definitely worth it. And the picture quality is great.
5,Easy to set up good picture
5,Works great easy to program and use.
5,To replace an out dated player
3,The "4K upscaling" is deceptive as it will not play 4K DVD's only standard and blu-ray DVD's and then upscale the output for a 4K TV. At a 4K TV already does the upscaling as do most AV receivers there is not much need for a DVD player to do this with standard DVD's.The remote control is so small that there is little room for the buttons that need to be pushed. If I had kept the player I would have bought a third party remote that was larger and easier to use in the dark as this one has no backlighting for the tiny buttons.
5,Easy set up and works great!
4,very good dvd -blu ray player
5,All good hope it continues to deliver !
5,Sister bought me one
3,It would have been really nice to know that you can only get a few apps (some of which are so obscure that I have no clue who actually uses them).  Apparently Sony ‘broke up’ with some of the most popular apps and therefore you can’t get them.  This is simply a very expensive DVD player.  So if you want an overpriced DVD player then this may be for you.  But if you are purchasing this to use with an older TV to use as a wireless streaming device then don’t do it.
5,It seem with older DVD's the picture can be grainy other wise it's a good value.
5,Would recommend
5,Great product for the price!
5,Came super quick.. hook up was very easy wifi set up easy picture is great and all the apps set up was a breeze.  It is really small and light (technology has come a long way!) Works with Amazon Prime Netflix and others and app set up for Pandora and Sirius.. ALL worked since I had accounts with all above. UPDATE: 1 week in and I have to unplug- plug back in to get it to do anything.  Remote/front on/off... doesn't work.  picture is good when it works but if it keeps up... RETURN very possible.
4,I bought this player primarily for streaming Prime Video movies and TV shows on my TV  via Wifi (and for playing DVDs of course) and it works great. I wish the remote control was bigger. Also the controls on the remote aren't always as responsive as they could be.I like being able to use the remote to control the TV and switch input sources without using two remotes. Also when you power on the Bru-ray player it automatically switches the input source on the TV to the HDMI jack the player is on even if it was set elsewhere before.
5,Very happy so far. Replaced an LG Blu-ray that quit playing discs and had a dongle for wifi that we lost a long time ago. Connected this Sony last night and played DVD and Blu-ray the way it should and connected to Netflix and streamed no problem. Lots of other apps I have not explored yet. Only negative is the remote does not light up but still a good deal for the price
5,Our DVD player died.  I was looking into getting a replacement and after many reviews found this unit.  There was a lot of information and some of it I understood.Once I hooked it up to our old "not smart" TV I noticed that I could pick up my streaming abilities from our modem.Once that was made we were able to use the old tv just like any of the new TVs that connect to the internet.we are very happy with this unit and would recommend it for anyone who wants to upgrade their video system without having to purchase the an expensive TV.
1,Every time I would power down and repower up it was like I was starting the unit the first time. I was constantly entering my password to my Wi-Fi network and it was a tremendous hassle. I returned it the next day.
1,I had bought 2 Sony players.  I brought M mainly to stream Netflix Amazon movies and YouTube The 1st one did not have that app or Amazon movies and can not be added. Too much time had passed to return it. So I brought another one. This when did have the Amazon app. Did have a little problem setting up but after I got it working it seemed to be OK for about 2 months.  Then it started dropping the Wi-Fi signal. And then it was a pain cause everything had to be set up again including the passwords for Amazon and Netflix as well as YouTube. Saw this in other reviews but decided to take a chance hoping the others maybe had a weak Wi-Fi signal.  Beware because I do not have a week Wi-Fi signal. The unit shows is getting full bar signal. It seems to be getting worse as time goes by. I just leave it on all the time now hoping for the best but sometimes it locks up in has to be unplugef and reset. Who wants to do this after working hard all day and wanting to come home and relax and enjoy a movie or watch some things on YouTube.NOT ME !!  I will try to return it but I have the feeling I'm just out of a $150... Buy at your own risk. Shame on Sony for producing such junk...
3,Wanted apps not available with this player.
4,I was skeptical about the "easy to install" sales promise; my skepticism was unwarranted.  Hook up was very straight forward; the brochure provided with the player was user friendly and helpful.  The player did "freeze up" after I read the User Agreement when I clicked on the "I Accept" button.  I went on line with Sony Technical Support and after a simple chat session with Ryan I rebooted the player and it has worked fine since.  I am very satisfied with this product.
3,Nice little unit..Was a little smaller than expected. I was replacing my Sony Blue Ray I've had for a long time..The unit was easy to set up..Has Apps and features but I don't usually do "apps" from my Sony player. I'm not a big fan of DC power supplies..I was replacing something with an AC cord..I had to re-think my power strip use due to the space needed for an AC to DC 12V dc converter. Plus the power connection can come loose if I move the unit some for cleaning and dusting. Last..I didn't receive an HDMI cable or a cleaning cloth as advertised..No big deal I have cords cables and cloths at home. I reused my HDMI cable feeding off my Smart TV..So everthing seem to be good for me..I only gave 3 starts due to the missing items..But I do like the unit..and the DC converter really isn't that big a deal to me..Mave
5,Came with batteries great price and great addition to our rv.
5,Used this device on my home office desktop as a DVD player for a television. I like the small footprint the unit uses on my desk.
5,We had a few DVDS that would not play all the way through and as luck would have it old player died a couple months later.  So we thought we would see if “bad” DVDs would work - not only did they work picture quality was fantastic.  Can I say this player will last no idea as we just set it up.  But so far so good.
5,I am SO happy I bought this. I haven't had an updated DVD player in a very long time. It wouldn't work with my smart t.v. BUT this one does and I LOVE it.
5,It plays BlueRay  and DVD how great is that!
1,Doesnt play pal region.Cant understand why it happens in 2022.why it ahould be region dependable?And how i am supposed to know that i should check it before i make order
3,I bought this boy-ray player because I had another one that was an older model of this one that I got several years ago that eventually broke. It used to include an app to watch Hulu but Sony has since REMOVED that function. While it includes a lot of apps most of them are useless and show up on my main screen when I don’t want them there. And worse the only major streaming services this machine includes are Netflix and Amazon Prime. It does NOT INCLUDE any way to watch Hulu Disney+ or CBS All Access. Profoundly disappointing!
5,This is an incredible blu-ray DVD player. It was very easy to install and I like that it is much smaller. I really like the smaller remote as we have too many that take up too much space. It is perfect for us. Some people have complained that it stopped working and it seemed stuck once for me but I think it was our Comcast as I just unplugged everything and it started up perfectly again and never did it again. Comcast gets stuck or has to be updated often in our area. Great product by Sony! I highly recommend it.
5,Nothing
5,Easy set-up and easy use.  Looked far and wide to find a DVD player I could pair with my wireless headphones.  I was even told that that capability does not exist. Very satisfied with my purchase.
1,I hooked this up and tried to log onto Amazon Prime.  A message on the screen informed me that there was a problem with my credentials and I needed to call the number on the screen.  Keep in mind that I was connecting through the app on the DVD player.  I called and they talked about me having too many devices attached and had me go to Amazon and set a couple gaming gift cards up for purchase.  I have been a system developer for a couple decades and even though my wife was telling me to stop I believed I was talking to Amazon.  They got about $80 out of me before I came to my senses.  I tried to contact Amazon but nobody ever returned my calls and my credit card company could not stop payment so I was just screwed.  I still have not had a response from a single person at Amazon.  Good luck if you order this.  The malware has to be embedded in the DVD’s firmware but nobody seems to care.
5,Easy setup and great picture quality
4,It started off fine but 9 months in the unit started freezing.  The only way to get it to work is to unplug the unit for a second.  The motor started getting noisy about the same time.
5,I had no idea how awful my old Blu-ray player was until I hooked this new one up. I ordered it on Saturday and received it on Monday. I set it up in 5 minutes and then loaded a few DVD's that my last player couldn't (or wouldn't) play properly. I couldn't believe how great the picture looked and how easily everything booted up. The unit is very small which for me is a plus. The remote is small but plenty big enough to do the job. If you're looking for a reliable and hassle-free Blu-ray player that won't give you headaches this is a winner.
5,Easiest Setup great quality picture easy to use. Command response is very quick from device to TV. Very satisfied with price vs quality.
1,UPDATE: This arrived Saturday and stopped working Sunday night. First I couldn’t log into YouTube because it said I had no internet connection I checked the settings and I was online with great reception now the apps won’t open it’s stuck on the menu. Don’t waste your money.I thought I’d be able to download hulu and Disney+ to my apps but you can’t and they have about twenty random unknown streaming services available and a few well known apps (YouTube & Netflix) but you can’t download other known streaming apps. Works otherwise a bit disappointed.
5,this drove me crazy till i figured it out. if you have started to watch a video and then turn the unit back off then on you will be left at the main menu. if you press the button in the middle of the arrows at the top of the remote the DVD will  start over again instead of resuming where you left off.to resume press the 'play' button.
5,I use this player for watching DVDs and some paid channels. I had a similar one from 2009 but wanted to upgrade to this one to get the Bluetooth connectivity. I enjoy lots of music off YouTube and with this player I can transmit to a Bluetooth speaker and take it with me as I’m busy around the house! Works well and has a small remote I like because of arthritis in my hands. A winner for reasonable price!
3,I have no complaints about this as a blu ray player. It plays blu ray and dvd just fine. The fact is I got this as an all in one for streaming services as well as media playback. It has a very limited number of apps. Very disappointing!I just ordered a Roku that I honestly didn't think I would need but turns out I do. If all you use is Netflix YouTube and Amazon Prime chances are you will love it.
5,I purchased this when my older dvd stopped functioning.  I didn't know what to expect but it works great and the upscaling feature on this player makes my regular dvd's look like a blue ray on my 4k tv.  I would recommend buying this.
4,I like the wifi a lot it’s strong easy to setup picture quality is that of an upscale I would rate it “over average”
5,100000 % worth every penny for someone who is not tech savvy i was able to set it up quickly and effectively. I absolutely love that I can use mirror link from my phone to t.v  with my android to have my kids watch disney plus and anything else I'd like to stream! That also was an easy setup !
4,This DVD player works and we hope it lasts since streaming is replacing DVDs.  Interesting in our recent trip to New Zealand they still have DVD rental stores cloths lines in backyards and other things we used to have.
5,This is a high quality player and the 4k quality of picture is phenomenal. Hooking it up was simple and straightforward. Easy to use.
4,Easy to set up and use. Use it mainly to watch my Blu-ray DVDs  It also has a lot of apps like YouTubeNetflix etc.
1,I often discount negative reviews because they are usually too idiosyncratic to be helpful in my purchase decisions. I should have taken to heart the negative reviews on this Sony DVD player.Out of the box the tray would not fully close because it would catch on the dust cover. With its odd packaging I suspected the seller of selling a re-conditioned unit as new. DVDs will simply freeze. Every single time.Then there are the cheap design features. If paused for more than a few minutes it will turn off and will not then resume the move where it was stopped.Others have written about design flaws. I will not repeat them. But they give Sony a bad name. I will never trust this third-party seller again.I made a bad choice. I will not do it again.ADDENDUM. Two months after purchasing the player it has now stopped playing
5,This is an outstanding Blu-ray DVD player and has already provided many hours of viewing. I’m not tech savvy and will never use all of it’s features. I had a little bit of a learning curve. Another great item from Amazons gallery of choices to aid in selection. Thanx!
2,We had an older model of this exact brand.  But when suddenly received a notice while watching our Hulu app on the device it said this device no longer supports Hulu.  So we thought that since we had our Blu Ray for over 6 years and technology is always advancing so fast that we assumed it was time for a replacement unit even though our current one was running fine.  We chose this because it specifically said it supports Hulu one of the only reasons why we made the purchase.  Other than that the unit is great.  Can someone tell us why we cannot get Hulu?  Why is the Hulu app still on the device?  It shouldn't be there if it isn't part of it.  Also we thought we could search and get the Hulu app and add it.  This device doesn't even allow us to do that.  We wasted money getting this.  It isn't worth our time to disconnect and return for a refund.  Very disappointed.
5,This is my 3rd player and since it is the newest it is quicker and is more updated than my previous players. The oldest is a little barebones player....took forever to get ready to play and a Philips which took almost as long. Now I don't doze waiting for the player. So far very happy with it. The price was right and quality is good so No complaints. My seller Hot Deals Electronics provided the service and additional baubles as stated in a very efficient and timely manner. 4 Thumbs up!
5,Sets up easy works great. Wish you could add more apps.
1,I bought this as a gift and unfortunately he waited too long to use it and then it couldn't be returned. No Blurays or DVDs will work. I've gone through the manual made sure the software was updated etc. Nothing has worked. It's useless and I'm out $145. :-(
4,Like it but remote will not work sometime and you have to plug and unplug power then it works for a few days then again plug and unplug .......
5,Thanks great product
5,Not much to say.  I put a video disk in hit the ply icon and watche.  Works great as you might expect
3,I've had the device for a few weeks now but there are a couple of call outs...Prime Video app is present but it always fails at the start or a few minutes into the movie or episode You Tube and NetFlix run very well on the device. It's an ok device but I expected to use Prime video but it never gets through a full movie or episode with out failing.
5,I was tempted to buy an new TV so I would be able to connect to Amazon Prime You Tube and so on. New TVs in my price range may be smart but the quality was not up to the old TV. So I bought this and it connects me to the internet with a super fast and high resolution. Gives me a much better picture than the smart T Vs I tried. And the DVD-Blue Ray picture is also superior to that of my old player. Very satisfied.
5,Very easy to install and get on with Amazon prime
5,I purchased this BluRay DVD player to replace my old Sony DVD player.  I am not using any of the more sophisticated functions.  My hope was that I would be able to plug the player into an electrical socket attach the included HDMI cable and play a disc - and it was just this easy to do.  Up and running in very short order.  I very much appreciated that the HDMI cable was included in the box and I'm very pleased with the purchase.
1,I've owned this for a couple months now and all I can say is this is the last Sony product I will every buy. I had a Sony dvd player which always gives problems but chalked it up to buying a cheap model. So figured would give Sony another chance by buying another upgraded model. It is used on the living room tv and has problems EVERY day - freezing while watching dvds bluerays or streaming on any app. The only solution is to unplug it. And restarting is not fast. Then you need to restart whatever you were doing which takes even longer - and hopefully doesn't freeze again while resuming. And if it freezes after putting in a disc there is no way sure way to get the disc back out. No eject buttons work and there is 'emergency eject' (such as the little hole for a paperclip). After unplugging it and restarting have at best a 50/50 chance it will remain frozen with a black screen and no way to get to the main menu until unplug again - rinse and repeat - with disc still stuck inside. Also just today I signed up for Hulu. I go to this players Main Menu screen and select the Hulu app and get the message 'This app is no longer supported by this player.' Once I find a replacement I'm going to 'Office Space copier' this POS...
5,Compared to my old Sony DVD player this is super fast. Setting up via HDMI is a snap. It turns on fast and doesn't turn off after you leave it it goes into standby. This means it's back in an instant. My old player would not play DVDs after a few months. This I hope will last a long time.
5,Works great. I haven't used the smart functions much because I have a smart TV. However the player works well and it even works in sync to change input from the player to cable TV on its own with a Samsung smart tv
2,Edit: We’ve now had this player about a month and it’s required us to do 3 system updates. Each time it’s a process requiring it to “try” to connect to the internet which takes several attempts until it’s successful. We have a strong internet connect btw. Once it finally connects the update takes about 5-10 mins. The issue I have with this is that the player is unusable until it does this update. The paperwork sent with the player even states that an update is required roughly every 2 months. If your internet connection is even remotely weak good luck! You do have the option to go online and use a USB to download it and then install but this is kind of a pain to have to repeat in my option.So far we’re very pleased with this Blu-Ray player. It arrived the next day was packaged well and literally took 2-3 mins. to set up. We’ve used it non-stop since then and the picture is beautiful it’s quiet and easy to use. I love that it plays DVD’s and Blu-rays and has Netflix etc. available too.
2,When I took it out the box I was shocked at how small it was. First I thought they must have sent me the wrong item but no that was it. It's extremely lightweight and feels flimsy. The remote is crude and not intuitive. Unfortunately you cannot speak into the remote like you can with Alexa or Amazon Fire stick which I love. This seems to be a device that has been altered. The internet is very slow to upload. It takes a couple of minutes for the machine to register the internet every time you turn it on. I feel I spent way too much money on this product. And I do not recommend it I wish I had never bought it
5,Excellent picture and easy to use.
5,The DVD Blueray was easy to install and picture quality is great.
5,Setup is 3 minutes (if you're slow like me!)  HDMI cable included - plug in to TV and DVD player. Attach power cord - you're in business.  Unit practically links to WIFI by itself - just enter your WIFI pass code.  Was watching "Sergent York" in 5 minutes.  So far no glitches or hang ups found.  Solid unit - good Sony product.
2,This wasn’t quite what I thought it was.Amazon returned it no questions asked.This is why I love shopping Amazon because the confidence of being able to return things don’t work out.
5,Super easy setup. All I needed was my wireless password streaming passwords for the Apps and in less than 10 min I had set up the remote to control the TV watched Netflix and a Blu-ray DVD. It’s a small unit but works great.
5,Very easy to install and good picture quality
3,Expected better from SONY. Unit OK in all respects except one: sound sometimes cuts in & out when sound gets loud. Occasional rather than constant just enough to be annoying.
4,Ok DVD/blue-ray player. Have had no problems with this unit. Streams Amazon Prime items ok. Satisfied with the unit for the price we paid.
4,Works well with a great picture.  Only problem with the item is that other apps. can not be added to the programing which is not good.
5,Playback quality of Blu-ray disc is superb.  Extremely simple to set  with WiFi and all the most common apps pre-loaded.  Would certainly buy again if I needed another and do recommend same to anyone looking for a solid player.(This model had excellent reviews on the internet when I was researching new Blu-ray players.  Seller sent it well packaged and everything that was supposed to arrive did when it was promised.)
5,While I'm generally a brand loyal kind of person I bought this Sony player because we've had 3 LG's flake out right after the warranty expired. It has worked perfectly  and was easy to set up. Picture quality is excellent and I would recommend this player to anyone looking for something with similar specs.
5,I wanted to upgrade my bluray/dvd player so after reading a lot of reviews on several players I chose this one. The quality of picture and even sound is amazing. Set up was very easy the instructions clear and easy to understand. I usually have my son help but I wanted to try it first. I even set up the wifi with no problem. It works great I'm so glad I chose this one. Also good customer service. Thank you.
5,Bought it for my RV. Easy set up.
5,Works great thank you!
5,Nice dvd player . Good picture quality . Easy set-up .
5,Bought to replace a much older Sony Blu-Ray player which finally gave up the ghost....is working well with no problems to date...with all the streaming devices available for less money might have gone a different way but still have lots of DVD's and Blu-Ray discs and need the play capability...
5,Nice Machine no issues
5,I bought this to replace my existing Blue-ray DVD player that did not have bluetooth capability.  Now I can watch DVD's day and night without bothering anyone else when I use my bluetooth earphones.
5,Wanted to replace/upgrade on a 10 year old Sony player and ran upon this model.  It arrived in a couple of days easy to set up and the remote so easy to use.
5,Works great!  Use to stream Amazon Prime which it does.  I almost didn't purchase because of reviews saying Sony no longer supported Amazon Prime but I had no problem.
5,Very happy with this blue ray/dvd player. Easy to install.
4,It's a good unit at a very good price.
5,Small perfect size
4,I like it but it doesn’t support a lot of apps. It no longer supports Hulu which was disappointing but it does support Netflix.
5,I really enjoy this player-great picture quality. Only thing I’m not crazy about is the remote-could be made a little stronger-especially the keypad when it comes to typing-otherwise I recommend it
5,Works great! Great price. Easy to use. Small box. Remote is perfect.
4,Blu ray seems to loose place when turned off.  Works well though
5,Perfect addition to my daughters room...ability to watch Netflix and YouTube too!
4,Very easy to setup and it works well.  It is quite a bit smaller than the player it replaced
1,Sigh.... I'm sad to say that this blu ray player randomly stops working and will not respond to remote control. I have to get out of my bed walk to the blu ray player and literally unplug it counting to 30 plug it back up and then manually turn it back on before I can use the remote again. It's disappointing and annoying. I waited too late to return it. Do you think if I went directly to Sony that they'd help me out with this?
4,quality was a bit cheap.
4,The only reason for 4 stars overall is because it is mot Hulu compatible. Otherwise a great device!
5,Been using this player for one week now and have been enjoying every minute of it.Player arrived within 48 hours and was extremely easy to set up.
5,Plug and play. That is how it should be right?
5,Replacing Samsung which will no longer "accept" Blue Ray DVD's or streaming.  Very pleased with Sony though instructions were confusing and hard to follow....
5,I've been wanting  to get myself one for my front room tv that plays DVDs too. I've enjoyed this product since I got it. Very easy to use.
5,I didn't know this picticular unit would not play 4k uhd disks. As soon as my refund is put back on my credit card I'm going to buy another DVD player.. Already have it in cart on Amazon.. AMAZON IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Good product works very well great picture quality sound and with HD clarity. Enjoying my movies more.
5,Small easy to use and fantastic up-scaling. Overall great picture.
3,Unit turned off/on TV while playing DVD. Worked fine playing BluRay. Spent three hours on phone with Sony trying to determine problem. Final advice from Sony was to contact LG to defeat signal line from Sony player. Tried a second Sony unit with identical result. Bought a SamSung unit and it works perfectly.
5,I've only played 4-5 movies so far but it's quick to bring up the movies menu and works well.  The remote is small but not too small like some I'd even say a good fit.  Picture and sound are excellent.  So far I'm really happy with it.
2,Its 'ok' but I have some issues.1.  My 4k tv and it just don't match up with voice and video over an HDMI and I'm limited on audio out options for this player.  The video actually is ahead of the voice so the AV Sync option only allows for slower video to voice instead of the issue I have where the video is faster than the voice.  Therefore I have to just deal with every movie I play from the blu-ray being slightly out of sync like a bad kung fu movie.2.  Why would they not put an optical audio output on this? Everything else I have has optical audio ports but not this player.  That would probably fix my previously mentioned issue.
5,I got fed up with our (cheaper) Sony Blu-ray but wanted to stay with the brand.  I am SO pleased with this product.  It is sturdy and is very very quiet (our cheaper one was noisy and so flimsy that the eject button finally quit working).  Installation was a breeze!I'm very happy with this product!
5,for my local firefighters.  Their DVD player had died over a month ago so I wanted to do something nice for the guys that protect my home and come to help me whenever I need them.  I can't rate the quality but knowing it's a Sony I trust the brand as I have a Sony TV and Blue-Ray myself.
1,Junk waste ofMoney I should get a few years out of one of these now doesn’t work 150.00 dollars later I still need a player for occasional movie night cheap crap expensive price
5,I really can't tell details about this DVD.  I bought it as a Christmas gift for my sister in Ohio.  She says is great an works great.  Thats all I can tell you.
5,Was looking for a newer DVD player/Blu-ray player to work with my Vizeo. I was also in the market for a Fire Stick or something similar because my smart TV no longer supports Hulu. This little gizmo covered all the bases. Love it. The built in WiFi lets it update software with little effort.
5,I love this blu-ray player and I've also wanted to have one. The 4k upscaling is the best feature because it plays DVDs in better quality. I wish there were more apps available for the home screen but everything else is just wonderful!
5,The player was easy to set up using the HDMI connection from my TV. Very straightforward hook-up and excellent picture quality for both Blu-Rays and DVD's.
3,Like the unit and SONY products but so far the unit has shut down while watching a movie. I'm not ready to give up yet but will try to work through and hope to correct.
5,Our old DVD player had been acting up for a awhile and we finally decided it was time to get a replacement.  WOW what a difference!  The speed in connecting is so much quicker picture is great. It is about half the size of our old one.  We love it.
5,Does exactly what the add information says it helps a plain tv be a smart tv in my estimation.Delivery was on time and no damage.
4,Easy set up and use.  Far superior to cheaper model of this type I bought and returned.
5,Had it for a few months now no complaints.
5,Sometimes the remote control does not work properly and it’s hard to turn off the Blu-ray player.  But overall good quality product
5,Awesome Blu-Ray player.  I especially appreciate the excellent wi-fi connectivity.  It’s a huge improvement over my very expensive Samsung smart TV.  I can now watch Netflix and other services via this player.  Setup was a breeze and the picture quality is excellent.  Great value for very affordable price.  Highly recommended.
5,When it can I could not believe how small the box was. Nice compact unit. Takes a few minutes after turning on before it is functional but works great
1,Trash. Broke in fewer than 3 months & is a doorstop.
2,According to Sony this player has not been setup to play in the United States.
5,Wasn't hard to set up. Very fast as in loading up an app like Netflix or A prime. My old Panasonic was often difficult in this area. Seems a very good choice so far. I would recommend it with no hesitation.
5,Great player also has easy screencasting from your phone.
5,so far so good.planning to buy another for the bedroom. I use it for my RV.
5,So far so good. Very easy to set up. I am NOT good with electronics and even I could do it.
5,Doesn’t have wifi
5,I love the quality and ease of hook up. I used the wi-fi feature hookup. The preloaded apps are also very nice. The remote even has a netflicks button which I find very useful.  I feel like this is a great product and a great value for the money.
5,Great Picture.  Works well has an on/off light so you know if is on.  Good controller.
1,Lasted for exactly one year and 5 days. Now it gives us a disc error even when no disc is in the drive.Not worth it don't buy.While it worked it was easy to use and gad a good image quality. Kinda moot now.
5,Everything works.  Only problem was I was not able to get remote to work with Samsung tv.
5,Quality of item was great. No problems noted.
2,Supposed to play DVDs and Blu-ray.  So far no issues with Blu-ray but it will not play "all" regular DVDs.  The machine will play some DVDs but mostly not.
5,Works pretty good but nothing to brag about.
4,Seems to work as advertised.
1,Perhaps the worst piece of junk Sony Blu Ray player I;ve ever bought.  The last one lasted me 1.5 yrs before it quit after a gfi switch fault caused by a nearby lightening strike. I have never had a blu ray player play two inputs at once. Seems not possible to me but it did! Perhaps something got broken during the shipping process. Amazon sent it to me in a thin plastic envelope with zero bubble wrap and no air bubbles. Unbelievable. Now after returning it to Amazon I’m still waiting for my refund. Bad experience. Bad blue ray. Don’t buy it!!!
5,This DVD player replaced an old one in the bedroom. The player works great and was very easy to set up. The shipping was fast and the deal was tremendous. I am very pleased with this company and would buy from this seller again!
5,Excelente producto muchas gracias
5,Very pleased with this product. It works perfectly with my Vizio TV and remote
5,I love the smart features of this DVD player such as streaming Netflix if you don't have a Smart TV.  Also the image crisp and clear.  Such a lightweight design compared to my old blue ray player.  Great product!
5,This was a gift for my parents. It was delivered quickly and works fine!
5,Worth every penny! Super easy to install. Love that u can easily hook up to internet and watch anything you want. Plays dvds and screen mirroring is cherry on top.
5,This Blu-ray DVD player works well and came with everything you need to hook it up. Excellent picture and sound. Really good match with my Sony tv.
5,For the money this Blue ray player works better that many more expensive models.
5,Wonderful Blu Ray player. Picture is sharp and crisp. Have found no issues and happy with product!
5,So far so good.  was easy to install and seems to be working fine.  Just installed so can't comment on longevity.  I wanted something that would allow me to play dvds see Netflix and Amazon videos and this fit the bill.
5,Incredibly small “smart” DVD player.  I can watch YouTube Amazon Prime Netflix and others through it.
3,Seems to be working fine however makes a grinding sound at the start of DVD
5,This DVD player works great with our tv. It also looks nice. The picture on the tv improved when we hooked this up. Very easy to hook-up.
4,Built in WiFi and ease of installation/set-up are positive attributes of this product.  Product is functioning as expected
5,The Blu-Ray player was easy to set up using the HDMI connection from my TV.  Very straightforward hook-up and excellent picture quality for both Blu-Rays and DVD's.I haven't used it's streaming features but am very satisfied with what I use it for.
4,Very disappointed the HDMI cord was not included.
1,Unfortunately I can't give a meaningful review as I couldn't even get started using the product. I carefully followed the hookup instructions in the skimpy instruction manual included with the player but couldn't get any signal at all to the TV so I was unable to even get started on the setup procedure. I tried a different HDMI cable and different HDMI ports on the TV. The ports on the TV worked with other devices so I don't see any problem there.  I even downloaded the more robust (48 page) on-line manual for this unit and went through the troubleshooting procedures in that manual with no success. I realize that a defective unit can occur with the best of products but needless to say I am very disappointed. I am returning the player for replacement with another. The most positive thing I can say is that the return process was handled quickly efficiently and politely and I am very happy with that.
5,This product is awesome. My den is far from my wifi unit. No bluray ever worked in there. UNTIL NOW. This bluray is the BOMB. If t\you have connection problems buy it. It is so fast too. Happy in Tulsa
5,It works great I had problems with it once in two weeks I just unplugged it and re-Booted it and it works fine
5,The player is easy to use and has great features. The seller was great.
5,Super fast shipping and a nice follow up email to make sure I was satisfied. Good job by this seller.The player itself is very nice. user friendly controls. Easy hookup to Wi-Fi. Good apps installed easy menu navigation.
4,Works as described
5,I lost all my electronics in a flood back in October of 2018. I've always used Sony products. I always prefer the personal touch Joe. I also like dealing with smaller guy's like you. Thank you RWH
5,This is a great DVD player. Very small and compact. I would recommend it and will probably get one or two more for other tv’s in my house.
5,Easy to install and sync with out internet service. We can access Netflix and amazon Prime video as well as many others.
5,As advertised will package easy to install works well learning about all the features.
5,Good unit easy set up good quality and got here quick.
1,This player stopped working in 3 months! Had it looked and and repairman said the circuits were bad. Cheap components that didn't last long.
5,I am very pleased with the Sony Flat screen and the DVD player. The price was great. Delivery was as promised.
4,Easy set up nice DVD/Blu Ray picture quality and easy to use.
1,I bought this item 2 months ago and now it has developed a black line running across the middle of my screen. It does not matter if its DVD or streaming  still the black line. I only had 1 month time frame to return it. Also you have to turn the sound way up when you are streaming and then way back down if you put in a DVD. This is an awful product I do not recommend buying it unless you have $150 to burn.
5,I purchased this for my personal use. It arrived very quickly  and I set it up and put in a movie right away. I love everything about it and I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
5,We love our DVD player. My husband couldn't believe how tiny it was but it delivered a BIG punch!
5,Arrived promptly and well packaged.  Easy to set up.  No problems so far.  Great picture.  Watch a movie every night and continue to use this player.  Happy shopper!
5,Great device. Replaced the 💩 Samsung. Finally a product I can relly on.Bought a second one in used great condition on Amazon for more than half the cost as well.
5,Easy set up. Plays disks well.
5,I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of images through this. I knew I was spending more than I planned at first but this has proven to be well worth it.
5,I was expecting installation to be complicated but even though I messed up my password I was able to go back and figure out how to redo it. It works great.
3,works ok sometimes the on off button doesn't respond so you have to use the remote. also it makes a lot of noise but you can stop that by placing something heavy on top of it.....
5,Used in my living room. Easy to use with great picture quality.
5,We're very happy with our new Blu-ray player so far - it does everything as advertised. Very easy setup beautiful picture.
5,We wanted an inexpensive player for our bedroom.  It was easy to hook up - less than five minutes.  Picture is crisp.
3,I bought this because it was reported to play 4K movies.  It does not.  It does play blue-ray beautifully.
5,I love the picture and high definition I get now that I have the Sony Blue Ray.  I'm thinking about purchasing a second one for my other TV.
5,The Blu-ray player came with everything needed to get set up for streaming and viewing disc. Set up was super easy and took only minutes. I am satisfied so far.
5,It was exactly what we wanted.
2,Bluetooth did not work with my iPhone.
5,I really like this “smart” DVD.  It’s easy to use and let’s me watch different apps such as YouTube Hulu etc.
5,This makes my older model VIZIO look amazingly sharp
5,Easy set up right out of the box it's for my parents who don't have WiFi so it works exactly like it should for a regular Blu Ray player. Thanks!
4,The remote keeps needing to be rebooted.
5,Very cute unit. Much smaller than expected. Husband had it set up and working in no time and we have an older TV!Highly recommended for the money.
5,Easy setup small footprint
5,Love this Blu-ray player ! Easy to set up and makes the picture look so much better also the sound is clearer .. well worth the money
3,I can not add the Disney + app and that was the reason I chose this unit.
3,The tray for the disk doesn't open using the remote easily. It takes several tries.
5,Love it.  Very easy to set up.  I am 65 years old and didn't even have to get a child to help get it going!!!!
5,Has surpassed my expectations!
5,Love this blue ray player! Brand new works great and it linked up to my worked with no problems.  I'm very satisfied with the purchase!
5,I love the easy to use and it has a light to let you know it's on.
5,I like the much smaller size than my previous DVD player. Compact and efficient
5,The picture is amazing. Just an FYI you need a high speed hdmi cable or your TV might say no signal after the initial Blu-Ray splash screen.
1,Bought the player so the wife didn’t have to try and use the PS4 to watch Hulu but there is no Hulu app on this player and it’s been updated so it was a big waste of money.
5,The best Blue Ray player for the price
5,love how easy was to connect
1,This player only worked one time would not recommend this to anyone. Would like to get my money back  stay clear of this unit
5,Works well and easy to set up.

5,Great value!  This was easy to set-up and so far this hasn't frozen up on me like with my old dvd player.
5,So easy to set up.
5,The great thing about this purchase is that it is a complete package. WiFi dvd blu Ray cleaning materials cables. It has it all.

5,Was a very good dvd
2,We bought ours in June of 2020 started having issues with it freezing up not ejecting disks etc. Called Sony had to go through a reset process.... working for now...would not buy another.
5,This a great blue ray player. Easy to install and the maker is great to deal with. Would highly recommend this. Great purchase.
4,Disliked not on thing
5,Nice and small. So far it is great
5,Remote buttons too small. Buttons should  be backlit.
5,Works great for blue ray and standard dvds expensive
5,Great product. It integrated easy with my Sony sound system.
5,For the price it is an excellent picture and set up easily.  Hopefully it will continue to work well and for a long time.
5,It was easy to install and set up.  We were using in within 5 minutes!  The price was great!
5,Outstanding player for streaming
5,Hard to beat a Sony product and this is one of them....It actually replaced a Sony Blu-ray that was over ten years old
5,Works as advertised
5,Works great been using for two months and I love it
5,The Blu-Ray player was easy to set up. It has a great picture and sound. I am very happy with the player
2,Only lasted just past the warranty of 1 year.
5,My grandson loves his own player!He’s sleeping in his room more now.
1,You need to be a "TECHIE" to use it for more than a basic DVD Player which I am not and having read the instructions I AM surprised  that I even got the DVD Play to work.!!!!!!
5,The small remote control is less than convenient
1,Does not play standard DVDs contrary to item specs and description. Thought the item was defective but returned and received a replacement with the same problem. Returning both and looking for other options.
5,Great player with more features than you need.
5,Works well not hard to figure out. I’d buy again.
5,I got this for my son. He loves it. Easy to operate/set up. Sound and picture quality is great.
1,I bought this player as a replacement for a currently working blu ray player with the understanding that it supported streaming services beyond Amazon & Netflix together with some trash services. It does not. If you are trying to add HBO Max or the other majors it is impossible with this player.
5,To say I was pleased with this purchase would be a gross understatement. This is a 10 star product.
1,Remote worked very poorly. Sony Tech said it and/or unit was defective when I had him on phone.
5,Got this for my granddaughter and she loves it said it was easy to set up.
5,Easy to install. Works great. Everything listed that this bundle would have was there. Exactly what I looking for.
5,Works great. Like all the additional apps.
5,Was just the product I was looking for. Had Wifi and Miracast capabilites. Great Product for a great price.
5,Perfect
5,A perfect match with my Sony big screen
5,The wireless network connectivity is stronger and more stable than older versions of this BluRay disk player.
1,I purchased this one to replace the one I bought for $58 at Walmart. It lasted 5 years. This one has already failed. I was mainly using it to watch YouTube videos.  When I went to use it recently I kept getting an error message that it could not read the disk. The message referred to fingerprints or an unfinished disk. I've tried several DVDs including a nearly brand new one.  And even washed a DVD...
5,Great bluray player. Much better than the Samsung we had previously. Decided to buy another for our neighbors for Christmas!
5,Easy install easy to use works on my digital tv even though it is not 4K.
3,Set up was very easy picture was great. Unfortunately it doesn’t stream Hulu.
5,Works beautifully
5,It works great with my Sony spark TV.
5,Great little wifi blueray player!  Super fast delivery and easy to set up with my home wifi.
5,It was super easy to setup and play. The features even enhanced my tv picture. I love it.
5,Easy to set up which is awesome!  ESy tomuse even better.  This is my second one!
5,Great DVD player and easy to use.
5,Love it.
5,I didn't realize it was so small but that's a good thing it doesn't take up too much room.
5,easy  to set up but I'm only using it as a Blu-Ray/DVD player other features are beyond my capabilities.
2,can't download were apps.
5,Nothing
2,I replaced my old sony br because it kelp dropping especially amazon prime video...had to unplug and plugin it was such a hassle. I bought this "upgrade" and it played prime videos for about 1 hour and....IT DROPPED TOO!  I returned it has not received refund yet but it's only been a couple of days. I went to Wal Mart and bought a Roku.
5,Everything is great with this product
5,Apps are easy to find and download
5,Best one I have ever had
5,Easy to use. Good quality. I use it for my grandkids to watch videos
5,Excellant product.Works great beautiful video.
5,Great little player just what we needed for our bedroom. Priced well and shipped fast!
5,Hand controller easy to use and has a lot of options.
5,This is the 1st player I've bought that didn't break in the first month.
5,Product arrived well packed. Easiest setup ever. Works perfectly with my Sumsung smart TV. Very satisfied.
5,easy to hook up - comes with everything - easy to use -
1,Item description specifically references supporting Hulu and Disney+ however upon hooking up the DVD player I discover this is not the case. These were integral elements in my decision to purchase this specific unit and I am beyond frustrated that the description blatantly lied.
1,This was first thing listed under 4k dvd players even though it's only a blue ray player was a big disappointment and now having trouble with ups picking it back up for return
1,This player does not play 4k DVD’s in California USA!!!
5,Easy to set up.
5,Fast shipment.  Easy set up and operation
5,Good purchase. Unit is as described. Replacement for an older model. Would buy again.
5,GREAT product & very easy set up!!! Ordered a second one to replace older technology!
5,ease of set up and use
1,I've had this player about a year and only used it a handful of times.  It's been some time since I used it but it now does not work. I can't even get the disk to eject or turn off the power with or without the remote.  I can't think of anything that might have happed to it to cause this problem (it's always been in a cabinet and is secure since I got it).Therefore in my opinion it's a piece of junk.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS DVD/Blue Ray player.
5,Very easy to setup and use and has great features such as wifi
2,Bought it to upscale turned it on to watch Hulu only to find Hulu was no longer supported. Sent it back after getting return approval Oct 10 After multiple emails to the vendor re: refund and a dvd left in the player no word and t’s now 11/8...no refund yet.
5,This Sony Blu-ray is Far better than the Samsung that it replaced!
5,Easy to set up - easy to use.  Love the access to Netflix!!
5,Everything worked properly and I am fully satisfied with the unit.
1,So as a blu ray player it is exceptional.  As a smart media box it sucks eggs hard.  The software is out of date and will not updates over the internet.  Hulu and Pandora are not supported but their titles are in the menu.  It consistently loses its IP from the wired router and won't load any web content.  I am sorely disappointed in this Sony device.  Apparently all the quality and reliability in the brand goes into cameras and game consoles.  Stay away from this device.
5,Great picture quality installed without a hitch and you can't beat the price.
1,A major movie ap cannot be played or is supported by this player so if you want to watch amazon  prime videos stay away from this player.  In this day and age where the major video channels are netflix and amazon and this player will no play one of them..... go elsewhere.
5,Quick Set up easy to use and the remote is great!
3,Difficult to navagate
5,Beautiful picture easy to install excellent choice
5,Works as it should. Only negative is that you cannot download additional apps.
2,Can't comment on the overall product cuz I can't use it did not come with the high speed HDMI ethernet cable also did not come with a cleaning cloth no big deal there but it did not arrive with everything that was in the description very disappointed
5,Good product!
5,Awesome unit. Easily synched with my Wi-Fi network and a great picture
1,This is the third Blue Ray player I've bought but the first one I have gotten from Amazon. Just like the others it goes back. It claims to support all the common apps but when you set it up it won't support Hulu and in Sept no Amazon prime. It was the same with the two I got at other places.Be carful which one you get. This one claims to support these apps right on the box but until you get to the setup you don't know if that's true
2,The picture is ok but the connection drops frequently so that we cannot use this item. I would like to send it back
5,Thrilled with this product
5,Very happy with this product. Does as described and intended use.
2,This piece of 💩😵 worked 1 time. The only it played was great.
2,Does not support Hulu and periodically makes clicking sounds on certain audio channels. Bit of a waste of money.
3,It worked well for 3 months then stopped working. Past warranty.
1,The only reason I bought this player was the growing number of Region 2 DVDs I owned and the even greater number of the Region 2 DVDs I did not buy because I could only play them  on my laptop. To my great disappointment the Sony player did not play those DVDs either.I called SONY and was told categorically that that model was only meant to play Region 1 DVDs.Two days after receiving it I returned the player. I am still looking for a player for Region 2.
5,Good equipment sharp picture
5,Enjoy this DVD player easy up set up. Great picture.
1,The DVD player works fine but you can't download your apps.  It didn't even give an option for Youtube TV one for the major options out there. No Disney plus. No common fitness options. Comes with maybe 20 preloaded apps.  Whats the point of paying for all these options if you can't use your subscriptions?  Just buy the plain $30 DVD/blu-ray on amazon.
5,Good quality and easy to use
5,works well
5,Good product
1,4K DVDs do not work with this player
5,Works good. Quality product from Sony.
5,Easy to set up.
5,PERFECT
5,Dependable electronics for blu ray discs and Netflix
5,Bought for my daughter for Christmas.  Loves it
1,i have nvr hooked it up it is still in the box
5,Arrived on time and works perfectly. Very satisfied.
1,We have had nothing but problems from this blu-ray player:  Constantly freezing up not turning off not turning on not loading the DVDs.  Accessibility to the most of popular apps has been removed.  The only good ones left are Netflix Vudu and Amazon Prime.  This blu-ray player cannot mirror Apple products either.
5,Received timely and no issues with the product.
3,Freezes Mirror does not work.
1,doesn't work
5,Nice
1,Problems getting Amazon Prime video.Problems simply working.  Freezes up.  Just stops working altogether.Totally unresponsive.  Rebooting is aggravating  since have to set up access to netflix from scratch with the clunky remote control interface.Please Sony  get it to work before you offer it for sale.
5,Works great with Netflix and pandora
1,After almost 6 months this Blu Ray player is starting to turn off freeze or not even turn on. It has to be unplugged multiple times to even get it to turn on.  I am highly disappointed in this Sony product and will not buy another one of their products again.
5,works like expected. Good item for the money.
5,Awesome device and super easy to connect.
5,Excellent picture and tons of features. Thanks
1,Got the product delivered hooked it up does not work pictures of sparkly no sound and having trouble returning it to Amazon. I've uploaded for snapshots of my receipt now they're saying that it's not the proper receipt bad experience. Stay away from this product. I guess I bought $130 Blu Ray pick up there that I have to hold onto now because I can't return it to Amazon bad experience horrible.
2,I bought this for it's wireless Smart capability. The damn thing will not update. Connected to my internet but not to network? WTF. I would stay away buy local this is heading for a bust.
5,very pleased with quality and value
5,It was excellent!
5,we love it!
5,I am very satisfied with product
5,Dependent on having a working remote.
1,It for my granddaughter....
5,Easy install! Fast shipping! Recommend.......
1,This looked like a great blu ray player and made by Sony a favorite brand of mine too bad it didn’t work!  Had returned one because the remote wouldn’t work.  Thought it was just bad luck so exchanged it for another.  The second one didn’t work either.  Without the remote it’s useless.  A real disappointment
2,This Blu-Ray device initially worked great for DVDs and video streaming but after six months use it frequently freezes up while streaming video. Now impossible to watch very long without re-booting after device freezes.
1,Do not purchase this player. I have had this player less than ten months and it resets itself numerous times per day. When it resets itself you have to set up everything from your internet and streaming accounts. I have contacted Sony and they do not have in my experience good customer service.
5,Prompt service.  Great product!!
2,Noticed after a few months that it wouldnt open unless you unplugged it. Then it wouldnt turn off. Then it wouldnt turn on.
5,It works fine
1,I used to get Sony and know it was of some quality.  the last 3 or 4 dvd players I've gotten have all been sony - each worse than the last.  The final one is so horrid it is worse than all the others - I get NOTHING while waiting for the basic functions..  I wish there were more alternatives.
1,Sony can’t seem to bring it’s products to support Vizio television sets? What a piece of crap. I will never buy a Sony product again. I am very disappointed.
1,I was really hoping that I wouldn’t have any issues with this but a few months into having it (and only using it a few times) it doesn’t seem to work anymore. I tried unplugging it and everything and didn’t seem to help. Really unhappy with this product. I might just go buy a PS4 instead.
5,There cheaper one available
5,and it plugs right in
1,The extra items advertised by the seller  were not included in the package. This was an open box obviously a return that was resold/reshipped again. Very disappointing.
1,I bought this 4K DVD player and it will play any 4K dvd’s at all. It will play a Blue Ray dvd just fine. However I bought this player to play 4K movies on my 4K TV. I ended up buying a Samsung 4K player and it works just for. I would never suggest that anyone consider buying this dvd played.
2,Sonny DVD player will not play 4K UHD movies only Blue Ray and regular DVD movies.  Sonny need to remove 4K UHD off the box.
1,Consistently freezes and requires a power reset. Or it will lose memory of the apps login such as Amazon Prime and then I have to re-sync the device to my Amazon account. This happens on a weekly sometimes daily basis.NOT RECOMMENDED
2,Nothing spectacular. Just over one month in and when a dvd is playing the motor is distractingly loud.  Amazon’s return window is already closed so I’m stuck with it.
1,Less than a year after purchasing it stopped working completely. All I get is a black screen with the blu-ray disc logo. It won't power off unless you unplug it the eject button doesn't work nothing on this unit works. Don't waste your money. Blu-rays players should definitely work longer than a year.
5,Great sound!
1,Features are great and picture quality was amazing.After 2 months the cd tray no longer ejects. Sony isn't what it used to be. Buy a cheaper player; I have two cheapo LG walmart ones that have their quirks but are still going strong years later.
5,nothing to dislike
2,When it works it’s great some of the features listed do not work without WiFi and it freezes up frequently.
1,I thought this as a VHS player.  I don’t need any other CD player
1,Worked fine for 4 months. Now I have to do a whole new set-up every single time I use it. I have to sign back in to my Wi-Fi and every service (Amazon Netflix) I want to use. Of course it's too late to return it so I'm stuck with a piece of garbage.
5,Good product.
1,One of the few times I am writing a review on a product I have bought here.This player stopped working outright after a few months.  Does not turn on at all.Stay away from purchasing this.  Very disappointed customer.
1,This product has been a disappointment. It constantly freezes and has to have power unhooked and wait a while to reset. Now it will only play dvds for about 5 minutes then freezes. Do not recommend at all.
1,Worked for a month then seized my dvd and died. Piece of poop! Dont waste your money.
1,This unit is trash. Started freezing and had to be powered off to play after freezing. Eventually it ate a disc and was unresponsive.
1,Device initially worked fine for a week or two then soon after experienced intermittent issues where it wouldn't turn on until a full power cycle was performed. Now five months later the device is permanently frozen/stuck and doesn't function at all. Not recommended in the slightest.
1,Only worked for 2 months
2,Disliked - returned it
1,I'm not impressed with this player. i've had issues with it playing brand new discs and i don't like that there's only a power and eject button on the player itself as my family tends to lose remotes. I won't buy something like this online again.
1,The worst purchase I ever made. Really?!! I paid a total of $146 to use it for less than 6 months?!!!!
1,This blu-ray player was purchased in June and as of December it does not work anymore.  Waste of money.
1,Have always owned a Sony DVD player but this is the last time.  2 Months and quit operating  Would hesitate to turn on then quit playing any disc.  Adios Sony
1,It will not keep network connection no matter what is done.  I have had people check it and they can't figure it out either.  So aggravating.
1,I bought this because it supports 300 apps. Only app i wanted was Hulu. Really it is not available? Don't care why they have to figure that one out.
1,I purchased this product a little over a year and a half ago and it stopped working!  Never will I buy a piece of junk like this!
1,Software seemed messed up. powered off random;y wouldn't connect to internet wouldn't retain sign in info. Worthless -- and I missed the 30-DAY return window
1,While watching a dvd it goes to a black screen for a few minutes over and over. Switched dvd still the same problem. I am returning it.
1,The Sony DVD player is unresponsive. Won’t power-off. Totally frozen. Does not respond to the system reset commands.
1,This blue ray player stopped working in 3 months.
1,Nothing will work with the remote. Also the player will only shut down if you unplug it.
1,Couldn’t download new apps on it
1,Almost exactly 8 months it quit working.
1,Does not support Hulu like advertised.
1,These are garbage. It worked for two weeks maybe
1,This product is very deceiving. Says 4k uhd on the box yet it does not play 4k dvds. That is the only reason i bought this unit and its completely useless to me. I did not notice it said upscale on it. What it claims it does is take blu ray or regular dvd and makes it close to 4k. It will not play 4k dvds. So if thats what i want it for dont. Just buy a 40 dollar one itll do the same as this
5,The unit was a little balky at setup but our talented daughter got through it. In terms of performance although our TV is only two years old it occasionally has trouble communicating with this unit. But the Blue Ray player pushes our TV to its limit with an eye-popping picture.
5,I'm not too tech savvy so someone else set it up but its been easy for me to use. Good clear picture too!
5,Very easy to set up
4,My PS4 which was used died and getting it fixed would be to much I believed. After some searching I purchased this S6700 Sony Blu-ray player. The uses was streaming DVD/ Blu-ray play back. This player is fast loaded the amazon app and plays all my discs with out issue. I am a strong believer in using PS4 for media and DVD and Blu-ray viewing if the budget allows. I do suggest installing a SSD in the PS4 this will increase the speed of this system a bit. This unit is the second option.  In general I been seeing a decline in quality of devices of this natural seems to be not improving either. More expensive players have the same issues I have with another older unit amazon video will hang at times when loading the Show I selected. So far though on S6700 this has not happened.
5,The Sony BDPS3700 Streaming Blu-Ray Disc Player was a good choice to replace my prior Sony system. This player was easy to hook up and is very small so it fits anywhere. Apparently this player has a number of features available from the home screen but I only use it to play DVDs and Blu-Rays and it works well for that.This is the best DVD player I've ever owned and it is exactly what I needed and very functional for the price.I am also very pleased with this accessory bundle it is very high quality and the best part is that the bundle comes with the cable so i didn't have to go out and buy one.
5,Works great.easy to use.
5,Good compact player for the price. The tray could be more sturdy and I wish it had a counter.Customer service is awesome.
1,I can't rate this package so this review is only about the Sony BDP-S6500 player itself.  The player will play DVDs just fine but you put a 4K UHD (which this unit is supposed to be able to UPSCALE AND ALL YOU GET IS NO DISC!  Sound quality between this player and a Song Bravia TV is crap.  You'd think Sony would make devices that play well together but they don't so don't worry about buying some other brand because Sony to Sony is not any better.  Sorry Sony you failed miserably with this POS.
2,Unfortunately after 3 hours of trying to troubleshoot the player would not work correctly. There was a flickering picture - when used with both of our TVs. Too bad since it took me 9 months to pick a model to purchase - based on reviews.
1,COULD NOT PLUG IT IN FOR IT ONLY MEETS NTCS FORMAT THIS IS NOT FOR WORLD WIDE FORMATS. THERE IS NO MENTION OF THIS IN THE MAIN CAPTION OR DETAILS SO HOW DOES ONE KNOW?  EU ORDERING MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT  ON AMAZON.COM!!!!! . I DID NOT KNOW THIS AND I ORDERED WHAT LOOKS LIKE A VERY LOVELY SONY DVD THAT I COULD NOT HOOK UP????? I SENT IT BACK £5 OUT OF POCKET FOR I HAD TO PAY EXTRA TO MAKE SURE I GET AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT!  AMAZON UK PICKS UP AND DELIVERS AT THEIR EXPENSE!!!!
2,Bought this product with hopes to use the online streaming capabilities.  It does work but keeps losing the setting and reverts back to factory settings.  Sony doesn't offer any insight into the problem and it appears that many folks have the same or similar issues.
1,Tried it twice.  Would be great is it worked..
5,Everything you could want in a Blu-ray player. Great clean pictures fast WiFi connection.
5,I bought this for use in my RV after the built-in DVD player on my tv quit working. I wanted a simple player that played both DVDs and blu-Ray. This fit the bill perfectly. Powering the led tv and DVD player from a 400 watt sine-wave inverter Only draws about 2 amps. I can watch for hours without running down my batteries. And it even came with HDMI cable!
5,This actually let's you place apps on your TV as long as you have WiFi. It's an awesome feature!
5,Great
5,Works great
5,Small and compact this player does it all.
5,Installed in minutes.  Easy to learn/use.  Exceptional picture!
5,Best picture of all.
5,This my second Sony DVR and it's a pretty good product. Easy to install and I get all the Apps!!
4,What does it mean by wifi ? So does that mean it already comes with wifi included or do you have to have internet ?
5,A great player with good picture and sound quality. Easy to use and hook up to TV
5,This Blue Ray machine really surprised me of its versatility and quality of picture. This thing does everything from play DVD's to tune into your favorite media / music source. Really neat.
5,This is a great little player Blue-Ray DVD CD.The remote is IR.
5,Great blu ray player
5,It's a great DVD player as it plays Blue Ray and conventional DVD's.
5,Title says it all.
5,Yeah I can watch Netflex and Prime shows
1,DVD kept locking frames while streaming & then permanently locked on a frame & wouldn't even turn off after 2-3 weeks of use. The only way I could turn it off was just to unplug the whole system! I would swear this was a badly refurbished unit being sold as new. Don't waste your money!
5,We love the remote control. Had to buy 3 machines before getting the right one. Thanks Sony!
5,Better than one previously purchased
5,Little tough for not tech savvy people to link phone to fully but works as stated
5,Nothing to dislike! It’s great!
1,Awful… advertises popular streaming services right on the box in the description says over 300 apps and services including DisneyPlus HBOMax etc… even mentions Roku?? DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THESE!! Please don’t waste your money I’m so disappointed that we can’t get the streaming services that we need.
5,Up and watching online movies with an hour.
1,I bought three two work great one the DVD drawer does not open
5,Easy to use and very nice! No problems at all!
5,I love my product  !!!👍
5,Sometimes the thing that's important is the simple detail others miss.  For example the Samsung player we had before did not have a light to indicate when the unit was on or off and the response from the remote was slow.  So you could never tell if the unit was getting the commands from the remote or not.This player has a power light.  Of course everything else works great.  The remote works for both the TV and the player so I only need one remote now.  So far I'm happy with it.  The Samsung unit only lasted a couple of years before the board failed and it went into endless cycle of unloading and re-loading the disc.  We'll have to see what the life expectancy of this one is.
5,Set up was easy and works great on our smart tv in our RV
5,Good quality DVD player. Easy to use and easy to set up.
5,Easy to install.
5,Works fine. Great quality .
5,Easy to set up just have your wifi password ready and have a DVD to play when on the apps page-select the circle in lower row bang your off to the races.
1,We got this and it does have all the apps they said it would have. 300 apps not even close. Very disappointed in it. Plus at one point while watching a show on Netflix the sound quit and I couldn’t get any other apps to work. Twice I had to unplug it to get it to reset. We have had it for a little over a week and the problems started.
4,I like the ease of use and the compact size. I have found only one video that it would not play but that is probably not extraordinary. I feel I'm getting what I paid for.
3,Does not allow you to get Apps such as Hulu or Disney Plus.
5,The remote is very simple as well!
5,Works great. Easy to set up
4,Easy setup good picture
4,Excellent product and easy set up
5,Easy to use.  Works well.
5,Arrived early well packaged very easy to install and useThanks
5,This unit is PERFECT!I have a 75" Samsung 8k TV and this Sony DVD player upscales to 4k and the TV upscales that to 8K and the DVD looks unbelievable!  Even my oldest first-generation DVD's look like the very best DVD ever made!  No kidding; It's really unbelievable!
5,Love it
5,Easy to set up options. Great picture. Light weight.
5,This is a simple single disc player that was easy to use and install and it fits in my small TV cabinet.  I chose a Blueray player since they will pay regular movie DVDs as well as music CDs.  There are very few discs it will not play.
5,I liked the easy setup Nd quality of the picture.  I play my older Dvds and have more intense colors clarity.
4,Small footprint
5,Does what it’s supposed to.
