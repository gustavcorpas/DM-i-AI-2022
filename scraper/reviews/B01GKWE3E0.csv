5,good quality cords
2,UPDATE 12/21/20So the last 2 orders I got of these charging cords was complete crap. Every single one of 24 cords was useless after just one or two uses. The small clamps that hold onto the device when inserted to charge bent inward after 1 or 2 charges which means that they no longer stay in my cell phone or tablets and fall out instead of charging. This is WITHOUT any kind of abuse or misuse on my part. Previous cords would last 30 or 40 times longer with regular abuse and carelessness from my kids. I'm hoping I just got some lemons and that they didn't change the quality of this product cause if they did then these cords are now less than useless and it might be time to take my business elsewhere. Because of this latest experience I've changed my rating from 5 stars to 2.ORIGINAL REVIEW:So I originally bought these out of frustration that most cords don't last more than a few days at my house. On the rare instances that I wanna charge my Bluetooth earphones or something none of the cables I spent lots of money on work after my kids use them a few times. So I decided to buy these in bulk since they are far cheaper in total than buying them one or two at a time. I was pleasantly surprised. These cables seem to last longer than most in my house with a few bonuses.PROS:LOGENTIVITY: I expected these USB charging cords to last less than the ones I normally purchase but since I'm getting 12 in a pack and they're fairly cheap in price that should even things out. Instead they're fairly resilient and don't loose their grip easily. So far I've only had to get rid of 2 of them since they don't seem to stay plugged in anymore but that's after my toddler savagely ripped them out of his tablets 50 or 60 times. With proper use they would surely have lasted longer. Even so they still charge but unfortunately have a tendency to fall out of the device they're supposed to be charging.FAST SPEED CHARGING: Amazingly these cables charge at high speed with the high speed plug. They charge both my Galaxy Note and my wife's Galaxy S7 at "Fast Charge" speeds. This was unexpected since that's not actually advertised for these cables. Multiple times I've purchased other charging cables specifically for the fast charge supposed capabilities and they would only slow charge instead. These babies work excellent.BUILT: These cables are thicker than others I've owned before. I think this is why they fast charge and why they are quite resilient when my kids mishandle them.BONUS: Strangely these cables connect  my phone to my PC and I'm able to transfer data with them. While this might seem like no big deal believe me it is. For some reason my phone always disconnects from all my laptops and all other storage devices I've tried it on. It seems to work slightly better if I have an OEM Samsung charging cable and even with that it still disconnects about every 2-3 mins until eventually the USB port on the laptop no longer recognizes my phone. With these cables the connection was stable and remained without any drops until I was done transferring all my data on multiple occasions. Weird but I love it.CONS: Only con would be cable length. I wish they were at least 5 or 6 feet but it's not a deal breaker. So much so that I bought 2 more packs of 12.Buy some. Well worth it.
5,After cleaning around the house I realized between the wife and I we have a buttload of tablets. Not wanting to gang up on a power strip I decided to pick up these and a dedicated ubs charging box.These cables are just the right length for my use. I only using them to charge multiple tablets so I can't day anything about data transfer.
4,They are decent charge fine just not the best. Overall decent.
5,Well worth your money and time and patient
5,Work good
5,The product was as advertised and was excellent quality and the price was perfect.
5,Well this is a hot-off-the-presses review in early August 2018.  I'll update if things change.My cords are 6' long.  Yes double what they say.  Mistake?  I don't know but it works for me.  Longer is almost always better.Yes they do support fast charging.No all cords do not.  I have had many cords that did not support fast changing out of the box and I've had many fail after some time.  They will still charge but not fast charge.Overall good quality cords that are ridiculously cheap.  Throw in the extra 3' on each one and I'm peachy.UPDATE Nov. 2019.  Worked great.  A few got stepped on and bent a few got lost a few got rolled on by chairs and so on.  Time for a new batch.  Great value.
4,These cords worked decent. The hook parts that go in the electronic device ended up bending to where you have to position it a certain way to charge. But as long as you keep them perfectly straight I guess they would be ok.
5,The best thing a product can be is do what it is supposed to and this does this well! How long this lasts will depend on how rough you are installing and mostly removing it from your device!
5,As advertised
5,Good quality micro USB cables get the job done for a good price
5,I didn't get 6' long cables just the 3' long ones that I ordered. They work great and if I remember i will come back and report on how long they last since I guess I'm very rough on cables.  I drive a cab and I do plug and unplug it a lot. I got exact what was advertised and so far they're working fabulously.8/13/19Okay its almost been a year and after giving away probably 6 I still have 3 cords left. So in a year I used 3 cords.  That's pretty good i think!  So definitely 5 stars for these chargers.
5,These are a good deal on micro cables.  We still seem to find products that need them.
5,Charging my a6400 batteries working as they should.
2,They don't always work. They work for 3 or 4 chargers then stop charging your device.
5,I would recommend these cable to any as they are very good and they are fast charging
5,Purchased to use for some LED lighting and they have worked perfectly. Will be buying more!
4,These work great for charging but aren't sync cables so I wasn't able to use them as expected in my car.... but for such a great price extra charging cables aren't a bad thing.
5,This should keep me in micro-usb charging cords for my phone a while. I go through them at quite a clip.
2,Maybe it was just a bad batch but the micro USB connector didn't fit my phone right. There was a lot more resistance than expected when pressing it in and it didn't have that "feel" of a completed connection when it was all the way in. I noticed the open slot in the middle of the micro USB was smaller than my other cables and *I think* the retainer clips on the wider end did not have adequate room to move.
5,Average length and one for every outlet in your house and work.  That's the idea.
5,i like having extra's of these laying arpound
5,firm connection work as intended works for quick charging I couldn't find a better price
3,Some were unusable see picture. That's how they arrived. 3 of 12. So what's the point of returning.
5,Exactly what I needed at the right price! Will update review.
5,Micro USB cables are known for braking I got a bulk order of these to have replacements on hand but TBH these have been a lot more reliable than expected. I'd happily recommend these anyone who needs micro USB cables.
5,I couldn't pass on the price. I seem to go through so many cables. the trick I've found is to pull AT the plug not on the wire. It separates the wire from the plug. So I could probably save on cables if I had the patience to pull at the plug not on the wire.
5,My kid was destroying every cable in the house. I dont know how but many didn't last 24 hours even. I bought these hoping to at least get a week or two out of them. They are super tough! I have yet to toss one! They are flexible rubber with sturdy ends Great product.
5,Great quality and great priceWill buy again.
5,Bought it for work. We use them every night to charge our work equipment and they work perfectly. I did a lot of searching too and they are great for their price as well
2,Purchase these cords because I thought I was getting a good deal fooled me.  They only last a couple of charges and after that it charges it slow.  Buy quality!
5,Despite the lack of reviews I proceeded to buy this because it was incredibly cheap. I'm glad I did because they all worked fine all in good condition and the best thing was that the cables did not have any writings on them (I use it as an add-on to my own business). Will buy again.
5,Haven't had any of them break yet after 4 months. The rubberized coating feels nice if that's what you like in a cable. And they're dirt cheap. No complaints here.
3,They are pretty much what we expected. We needed to have a bunch of charging cords because my daughter breaks them frequently. They have loose connections at both ends but they are inexpensive and serve their purpose.
5,Wow. The box they came in was jankey but these cables are great! I bought them since my kid keeps tearing his up and they are holding up better than their "brand name" counterparts. A quality product at a ridiculously good price. I will be buying more!
5,Yep... it's a lot of phone chargers. Not very scientific stuff just lots of phone chargers
4,Cheap and strudyWorks fine for me
5,Nothing much to say as they are as described.  Nice cables that I'm using to power multiple raspberry pi units.
2,Some cable worked while others didnt.
3,Cheap cord.  Works ok.  Connection at end of cord is cheaply made.
4,A little stiff but nice cables.
1,These little guys are a great deal if you're not doing quick charge. If you need to use them for high amperage (2+). Look somewhere else. Literally killed three of them today charging my nexus 6. But they work great on my other devices. Lock in well and the light guage won't make them pop out.**Update**The few cables o have left won't even charge my phone above 500ma. Different cable charges at 900 on the same usb port on the same 1.5A charger. Not cool.
5,Good buy for anyone who has too many devices and a lot of people using the cords and breaking or losing them. I recommend.
5,Good value
5,They fit my wives Otter box case which has limited access. Working as expected nice to have them available as others have disappeared or broken over the years. Will update with a quality report.
4,Lots of cords for every device. I already broke one.
5,Best micro usb pack ever All worked good all good quality don't question it just buy it I've been using mine for over a year now
5,Exactly as advertised.  Thanks.
5,Worked really well.
5,cheap in the sense of bulk of what you get because how fast a cord or this type becomes loose.
5,Very good quality and great product fast shipping
5,Nice pack
5,Best cords I've found so far and definitely the best value.
5,What's not to love inexpensive and they worked great
1,some fast charge for only a day or 2 some not even once. then all reduce to slow charge inferior materials or design
5,Items are of good quality and capable of quick charge / fast charge which is amazing for this price point.
5,Good for the money
1,These cords do not charge the devices. The battery life goes down with these cords. We have tried multiple devices and outlets. I would not recommend.
5,Was skeptical about these cords because of the price.  They are awesome!!!
5,They are still working fine! Months later and no problems!
5,Way better than your standard break in week cables.
5,i will buy more great product high quality
5,Nice batch of MUSBs. Good quality cables with solid fittings.
2,2 broke in an hour
5,Needed a large number of USB cables. These were all perfectly serviceable at a good price.
2,Cheap qualityNot the worst i've seen but the plugs become loose so quick i'll b out of them in less than 2 months :(
5,I bought them and was surprised that all 12 worked.
2,Over half of them didnt work
1,Don't buy. I tried six of ten and none of them would charge my phone. Bought a $4 local one and it works fine. You get what you pay for.
5,Possibly best cables I've EVER Bought.
1,Crap!  didnt charge well on any device using any power source I tried font waste your money
1,Low speed cables break after a week
1,Disappointing 12 of 12 cables failed within 1 days of use micro USB connector  outer pins bend too easily.
5,I bought 2 packs of 12 we had a mass exodus of functioning cables in a short span of time. Each one has been tested and works (though admittedly testing 24 cables is rather tedious)! The maximum charging speed seems to be 1600maH which would certainly qualify for "fast charging" on phones.  I was hesitant initially when the price worked out to $1/cable but am happily impressed! This will cover our replacement needs for a while so I'm hoping no need for a reorder soon but I certainly would recommend them if you're like us (have lots of devices to charge and welcome spares).
5,As cheap as these were I expected them to be mediocre at best.  But I was pleasantly surprised to discover that these are really great cables!  They fit snugly in the phone and charge nice and fast.  They all worked great for me and I gave them to the whole family.  Great value and a great product all around!
5,The cable looks like the basic black charger cable that comes with new phones and I find it is just as durable.The connection ends are basic sizes and the micro connector at the phone end is a bit longer than other cables. That means no problem with phone cases even those snug built on cases you find on water proof phones.The obvious biggie is that this cable is CHEEEAP! Usually with bulk cheap cables you expect some duds. I have sold 100s of these cables. So far no reports of duds. I just received an order of 300 more cables.The biggest surprise is this cable's performance. With the set of cheap bulk cables I used before they would only charge at <0.5amp suitable only for low draw devices like head sets and game controllers. These Smays Micro USB Cables charge at a consistent 2.1amp. Hello 5in 6in smart phones tablets and Gooloo Vehicle Jump Starter Booster Power Packs!Price Durability Flexibility Performance hands down the best USB Micro Cable.
5,I was very excited when I received the 12 pack of wires I was looking for a bulk pack because my baby ruins all my wires so I was looking for a bulk cheap pack from wires this was perfect and great price
5,Got tired of having multiple charge wires getting shorts so I bought this bulk pack.  Product seems good and sturdy so far.  Can't beat the price either.
5,Good deal!!!Great price!!!
5,work perfectly
5,Great product!
4,The cable work well for being bulk cables. Down side is 2 out of the 12 cables did not work at all. Other than that they are ok.
5,I needed these for work after someone stole the box containing our cordsThese were an amazing price and the length was perfect for keeping phones charged near the laptops our workers useI even took some home to use on older electronics and they keep things charged and they charge quicklyThese bulk charging cables were an amazing value. Glad I found them
5,It does exactly as it claims.  Good thing this day and age.
5,Worked great except soon after I bought them we upgraded our phones to ones with usb-c.
4,Perfect size for the kid's devices.... they can no longer trip or step on the cables
