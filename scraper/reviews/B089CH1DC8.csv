4,I got this in yesterday and found it plugs into the tv using an Optical plug. My tv didn't have one of those. So while in search of some way to connect the two devices I couldn't find any RCA to Optical connectors and instead of driving all over the place I just bought a new Samsung flat screen that had the Optical plug and was hoping it would play nice with the new TV. I plugged them together and turned on the TV and got instant nice sound. I bought the soundbar so I could hear dialogue better on my tv. Now my new tv. I didn't quite understand the simple instruction book that came with the sound bar. I was trying to use the remote and learning new remotes is always a pain for me. I could turn it on and off and right under the power button I found the button with an arrow pointing at the square and that got the sound to come on. I'm still going to figure out what the different colored lights me but I got it to working and I'm happy. I like Samsung stuff. I can figure it all out eventually.
4,Aesthetic: The soundbar looks beautiful and compliments the room very well. Probably the best looking sound bar I've ever had. Soft round edges are very welcoming.Performance: So far the performance has been a great. Listening to music fills a pretty large room and kitchen. It get's loud and the bass is noticeable. I'm very satisfied with the performance considering the price I paid ($270). I'm not an audiophile but I do enjoy having high quality speakers and this sound bar doesn't disappoint.Connectivity: I've read reviews about connectivity issues but I haven't experienced any. The soundbar is super easy to set up through the Samsung app and I haven't had a problem connecting through spotify or any other platform.
4,I'm pleasently surprised with the performance of this unit. (The s50-a) It's not a replacement for an actual surround system with rear speakers and a subwoofer by any means but on it's own in a small to medium sized room it creates some very impressive sound and surround effects.Having a dedicated third channel (it's a 3.0 in other words) for dialogue and effects makes all the difference. Voices are clear and movies come alive with sound effects that seem to be coming from everywhere bouncing off the walls in all directions. It's quite the immersive experience.Speaking of which what sold me on this model was the DTS Virtual X setting uncommon at this price point. But as it turns out the "adaptive sound" setting works the best. At least in my room.Now to the cons: Support is a disappointment. The available Samsung apps do not work with this model so you must rely on the included remote which leaves a lot to be desired. To adjust treble bass etc you have to rely on the lights that flash on top of the bar and you have to be standing over it to see them. This soundbar needs some tweaking to arrive at it's optimal performance and that's quite a hassle. Also the included directions are vague and incomplete. You'll need to download the PDF manual available online to access the complete information. Are these deal breakers ? Not at all just letting you know what to expect.Finally I ordered a refurbished model listed as ' very good' and it arrived in pristine condition with all the original packaging in tact. It looked as if it was brand new. That reduced the price considerably from it's already low cost.To sum things up this Samsung sounds great rivaling models that cost hundreds more and I highly recommend it. It's just a shame that there's no app available to make adjustments more intuitively.UPDATE: After downloading the PDF online of the complete instructions ( a must ) I've discovered a few features in the unit that aren't for some reason even mentioned in the manual that came with it. For one there's a six band graphic equalizer hidden in the remote control etc.But most importantly the download suggested to set your TV's audio output to Dolby Digital instead of passthrough or auto or PCM or whatever. This makes all the difference !! Dolby Virtual X comes alive with room filling wonder. I couldn't believe my ears. Make sure to follow this advice.
5,Heavy duty soundbar always goes with the living room TV but this soundbar is perfect for the bedroom television. Great sound great for the price. Can’t complain
5,On its own its gorgeous. Covered in a cross Grey fabric with hidden lights and stylish controls right on top as apposed to hard black plastic. The virtual immersing sound fills the room with a punch that comes from everywhere. Along with the vocal clarity of the center speaker and flawlessly paired with the s9100 wirelessly paired rear speakers and you are covered in virtual dtx sound. Yea ... that's not the one I got. Mine had to have the power plug removed for 5 seconds then reinstalled to get the unit to see the HDMI-ARC connection that had the be performed every time the unit turned on. Pairing to the rear speakersbwas automatic but the advertised control of rear speakers didn't happen. There were just too many glitches to justify keeping such a sweet sounding piece of art. Perfect for a mid size livingroom or bedroom. Remote is straight forward. It will also control libraries of music and i believe samsung TVs. But the unit glitched controli g rear dpeakers ad advertised. Samsung support tried with a firmware update but did not provide the cure to the problem so I reluctantly returned it and stepped up the ladder to the HW-A650. With luck it will perform as advertised without problems.So...affordable impressive sounding system that looks gorgeous with plenty of volume to immerse you in beautiful sound I hope to be specific to my glitch but after that it was heaven.
5,Very easy to install …
4,I bought this to replace a TCL Alto 8i I'd purchased recently as I was fed up with the TCL soundbar's aggressive power-saving mode that regularly cut off dialog. Overall I'm glad I purchased the Samsung S60A S Series soundbar even if some aspects of it don't quite measure up to those of the TCL soundbar.The S60A does feature a power-saving mode but it doesn't kick in until 18 minutes have passed with no sound passing through the device at which point it turns off. In that respect it's pretty reasonable.I have a Samsung KS8000 TV and I was initially using the S60A soundbar through HDMI 4 which supports ARC. I eventually ended up switching to optical as I was experiencing periodic HDMI issues and my TV would sometimes switch back to its own internal speakers without me noticing it. How did I not notice you you may ask? Well while the soundbar DOES sound better than my TV's internal speakers to some extent it's hard to tell the difference when the volume is low especially since this soundbar simply lacks the "punch" of the TCL soundbar.One thing you WILL notice this S60A soundbar probably has over your TV's speakers is that it has a dedicated center channel for dialog which allows dialog to stand out more without forcing you to rely on a dedicated balancing mode for dialog. Unfortunately the soundbar lacks any such balancing mode which means you're out of luck if you want normalized audio.Speaking of audio volume when plugged into the ARC port of my Samsung KS8000 TV I was pleased to see that the volume level for the soundbar was reflected on screen when I used my TV's remote to adjust the volume. Oddly the same wasn't true when I used the soundbar's remote to adjust volume and it certainly wasn't true when I switched over to optical.Given the fact that you can adjust the volume from 0 to 100 I find the lack of volume indicator on the soundbar itself really unfortunate especially since it clearly has LEDs that animate when you adjust the volume but only to indicate that the volume is changing.By the way if you have your TV mounted high such as over a fireplace or something then you may want to seek out a different soundbar as this one doesn't seem to pick up the signal from the remove from positions that're much lower than that of the soundbar itself.Overall this is a good soundbar though I definitely suggest seeking out something else if you want something with some bass as this soundbar simply doesn't deliver in that respect.
5,This is hooked up to my TV.
5,easy to install and operate
4,or at least I can't figure that out.
5,was great
5,everything was smooth and nice for the price it costs this soundbar is definitely a good purchase you won’t be disappointed.
5,The sound quality is very good and it’s easy to place anywhere. Nice sleek design.
5,It connected to my Samsung TV via bluetooth and now it's an fully integrated part of the TV. I forget it's there other than the fact that it sounds so much better!
3,This will be my last purchase from Samsung but that may not be a good indicator of this product's worth. Hear me out. This year I've upgraded all of my Samsung devices; TV phone soundbar etc. And with all of them the device has been relatively good with a few bugs and tech support hiccups. The main reason I'm done with Samsung is their awful customer service. I ordered this soundbar twice from Samsung's direct website and was sent the wrong item both times and it was because of the customer service employees I spoke to who gave me bad information and made promises that they didn't keep so I eventually just bought it from here on Amazon.  Likewise any technical support issue I've had with them has been much much much more difficult than it needs to be. I hate to be that guy but it's just very evident that they don't speak English very well. There's a definite language barrier and it shows.So here's the kicker though after all of that hassle Samsung customer service put me through and the various technical issues that have been an enormous pain in the neck I still was able to look at the specs of this device and make an objective judgment that this was a good value for the money. It was $199.00 for a 5.0 Ch speaker with side tweeters Bluetooth and wifi connectivity and a built in Alexa assistant. You're just not going to find a deal like that from a reputable manufacturer very often. And while I'm definitely buying a Sony tv next time and an iPhone for my next upgrades I don't know that I'll ever need to replace this soundbar because it's everything I need. The sound is awesome for just a standalone soundbar and it gets very loud without sacrificing audio quality. It's also very sleek and modern and takes up much less space than our old 2.0 Ch speaker. The punch that this soundbar packs is very good for its size and it delivers just about as well as I'd hoped.So one caveat is that I had a difficult time setting up the built in Alexa and the tech support was terrible once again but I eventually figured it out on my own. I had to unplug the soundbar and install a firmware update for it in the smart things app. So once again I'd say that the specs of this device are just a great deal for next to $200 but you're buying from a company that doesn't care enough about your needs to provide decent customer service and tech support. That could lead to headaches like buying a product 3 times from 2 different websites until you get the right one or being on the phone for 2 hours to fix a 5 minute problem etc. So that's what you've gotta judge for yourself. Is it worth the risk and potential headache? In the case of this particular device I'd argue that it is as long as the price is right. 👍
5,Many thanks to Walts Tv.  The replacement unit was successfully installed in 15 minutes.  A great example of exemplary customer service.  The sound bar performs even better than expected it slaves to our TV remote transparently.  Ease of setup and initialization remarkable.
5,
4,The soundbar provides high quality sound.  Helps to hear conversations on movies and TV programs over the background sound. Has nice features to work with.  Not too happy with remote control on handling volume levels.  Initially was able to adjust volume but has problems later.  Had to contact company to get new replacement.  You Can use your cell phone via SmartThings app to control volume levels and other features.  Also easy to setup with TV.
4,Still figuring out some of the functions but so far so good.
5,Bought a new TV and the sound on it wasn’t long enough but now I can blast out my tunes I’m sure my neighbors aren’t happy 😃
5,Pairs with my 32" Samsung TV.
4,At last...Now I can actually hear everything that is going on during the movie. Great sounds bar
4,Works just fine with my Samsung tv
4,Tap Tap Bluetooth is nice. Good quality that you expect from Samsung.
5,Paired with Samsung 43" 8000 Series TV.  The TV remote controls the volume on the soundbar while Bluetooth connected.  Paired my phone to it to test "multi connection" and what that means is up to 8 devices in the memory but only 2 active.  Active means you don't have to reconnect the device but only audio from 1 of the active devices can play at once.  This would ideally serve the purpose of playing audio from the TV when watching something or when the TV is off play audio from mobile device.  Highly recommend this for a spare TV or primary if you don't have a high-end complex setup when you'd want a 7.1 audio device
4,A good unit..just not as impressive as I had hoped.
4,The audio quality of too many streamed movies is simply awful. The SAMSUNG 5.0ch S60A S Series Soundbar makes a world of difference when connecting via the HDMI/ARC connector. Using the supplied remote you can adjust bass mids and highs and you can adjust the center channel which I find especially useful.Unfortunately the remote resembles my Samsung TV's remote almost exactly so we had to place stickers on one remote. And unfortunately we have to use both remotes. The sound bar's remote to power on the sound bar and adjust the audio. The TV remote to power the TV and to raise and lower the audio level which can be done with the sound bar remote but you won't see the audio levels displayed on the TV. The sound bar remote has no effect on the TV just the audio fed to the sound bar.I wish the sound bar had a bluetooth output. I'd give it five stars for that.
3,I find the volume control on the remote very hard to adjust
5,Is amazing sounds I like so much
5,I love it for the most of part. Only thing I don't really like is that I wanted to disconnect the power for tv and sound bar when I'm not using them which is literally most of the days but when I do that it feels like I have to go through initial setup all over again every time. So I just leave them plugged them in now
5,I can't get the remote to work even after changing batteries..
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It went perfectly with the new smart TV
5,This samsung soundbar HW-S60A is smaller compare to other soundbar and this has more speakers than the usual soundbar.5 channels including dedicated center speaker for voices when watching TV and movies.I find this soundbar to be great for what I want. This is perfect for rooms and small living room.The base is good enough but not explosive depending on the music the bass will be much more present.The details that this soundbar is great because I can hear additional instruments in music and hear outside noises when watching movies. This is due to the 5 channels adding additional imagery and wider sound.Here are my recommendations.There is no sound mode level indiciator (treblebass and etc) but I counted 12 levels.I would put treble at zero or level 1 and put bass on level 5 or 6 depending on your preference.Also keep it at adaptive sound for brighter sound and better clarity. Adaptive sound is great that will automatically switch setting if it detects movies music or TV.Positive1. When going through sound mode there is a voice that will tell you if it's treble or bass which is great so no need to look at the soundbar.2. Great sound and clarity due to more than just 3 speakers.3. Good enough bass.4. Small size5. Clear and concise remoteNegative1. No levels or indicator for volume and settings.2. if you need more bass then this will not please you but it can be connected to a samsung subwoofer wireless.3. The soundbar is priced fair at $300 but do not buy it more than that.Overall this soundbar brings clarity details and a wide sound for rooms and small living room. While it lacks explosive bass it makes up by being smaller and engaging sound due to the multiple sest of speakers in the soundbar.
3,I bought this to use with my computer setup.Plus- looks excellentPlus- Sound quality- great mid-range and high reproduction and reasonable bass from a sounderPlus- size very compact which was importantMinus- I have to use the Digital Optical input TOSLINK and the soundbar shuts off after 15 minutes and has to be turned back on ( I have found a ridiculous workaround rebooting the sounder by pressing the volume minus and plus at the same time each use)Minus- Tech support- spent 2 hours on the phone on above matter to no resolution and was told a engineer would contact me- never happened ( 3 weeks ago)It is working for me it was on sale and despite the issue I like it. I deducted 2 stars for a flaw that they are aware of and their horrible tech support. Samsung you're a big company with resources.....do better!
4,I really like this soundbar but it does have one frustration for me. I am using it with a Samsung TV and have it connected with the eArc cable  but it will occasionally and randomly disconnect and I have to reconnect it.Also sometime the Dolby sound doesn't always blow me away. I will be upgrading in the future but this is better than I had before and if you aren't super picky this is a decent soundbar.
3,I've about had it with Samsung products especially their remote controls. I have a Samsung Q80 tv and their low end all in one soundbar. The remote fried and the batteries super heated and melted. I decided to order a better all in one soundbar so I ordered this one. Really easy to set up except the remote doesn't work at all. I took out the batteries that came with it put in new Duracell and it still won't work. The tv remote works with it but the tv remote doesn't let you adjust the sound quality etc. Just the volume through the tv. It sounds great though I sure would like to adjust it to see how the other options sound. Second issue is you can't see the controls on the sound bar unless you are standing over it. The soundbar is wall mountable so if you wall mount it you can see the controls and lights but I am not wall mounting it. It sits in front of my tv. its rounded so it doesn't sit on its side very well. so that sucks. I'm no electronics genius and I'm thinking I must've done something wrong. It never would connect to my SmartThings app either. I tried to contact Samsung customer service but was on hold forever. Maybe I should just return it. I can't believe they would really design something this poorly.
4,My husband has hearing issues so we thought that a sound bar might help.  After checking with Consumer Reports we purchased this item.  What a difference.  Really easy to install and vastly improved the sound from our TV.  Would recommend.
3,Works great but the voice guide is annoying. I connected the soundbar to my desktop and every time I turn on my desktop the narrator will say "digital audio in" and it's SUPER LOUD! I can't find a way to disable her voice nor can I adjust the volume. I even tried adjusting the volume on my computer before I turn it off but no luck. The sound is amazing but of course you can't expect too much from a soundbar under $200 versus those that cost $600 plus. Another thing I dislike about it is that the settings will not display on my monitor. So whenever I use the remote I just listen to the voice guide until I get my correct settings. Speaking of remote! This remote is a huge flaw! I still can't open the back cover using the normal method. I looked up videos and forums and turns out many people had the same issue. I warmed up the remote with the stove (you can also use hairdryer) and couldn't push the cover out so I had to use a knife. Given I did use my nails a razor AND a knife for 2 hours trying to open from the sides before warming it yes this is indeed frustrating! It's one of the most dumbest design ever and whoever designed it is just so very unintelligent. So hear me out after I got the cover opened I installed the 2 batteries and closed it. I tried to open the cover again but failed to do so. I guess I'll have to use the alternative method and let's hope the battery will last a while. (note: I used Duracell batteries just in case the ones that come with it don't last long -- can save me some frustration)Update: voice guide/narrator volume is controlled by the soundbar remote. So BEFORE you turn off the soundbar make sure you reduce the volume. Otherwise the next time you turn it on the narrator/voice guide's volume is based on the last setting (and it can be very loud).
3,I tried for a few hours to get it to work with alexa I'm a professional technician and work with AV equipment for a living but this configuration was beyond me.Samsung product experts were absolutely no help. Basically the unit would be connected to the internet in the samsung app and I did manage to connect it to alexa but in alexa app it said the unit was not connected to the internet but it was. I tried all the normal stuff like updating the firmware etc. It was just not happening after three hours of trying I returned it. My experience with samsung has pretty much been this  great hardware but not great software / constant connectivity issues.I got a yamaha sound bar it took about 20 min of firmware updating and plugging / unplugging and now it works perfectly participates in speaker groups etc. So it is possible to have full alexa functionality with a non amazon device just not a samsung apparently.If you don't need / want the alexa functionality then this product is great the sound was excellent and it looks nice. HDMI/ARC worked perfectly without trouble.
5,I got this soundbar to replace some old logitech 5.1 speakers. I am using it for sound on my PC and have it connected via optical. The setup did take a minute to get it to work but since it has been flawless. At first the sound was cutting out but I did get that resolved on my own with a little dabbling. The price has gone up significantly since I bought it but at the time the value for the money was good (148 vs 248$). I have even considered getting another for my tv but I will wait mostly because I am cheap and my current one still works well. Only downside is no volume level display just light indicators for it changing or to indicate if it is maxed. I am certainly not an audio person but it sounds great to me and I also like the look aesthetically.
5,Quality sound is great.
3,Nice design and decent sound. The sound bar would randomly turn off while I was watching television. I had to return it.
4,Turn the device off.  The use the remote to press and hold the source button until it turns back on.  DONE.  No more yelling.
5,We added this to our outdoor TV and as on the more inexpensive side because it’s outside  I was surprised it sounded this good. Great value for the money compared to Bose
3,I bought this sound bar to go with my new Samsung TV.  It looks nice and sounds good.  I am only giving it three stars because of some frustrations I've had with it.Connected via HDMI it integrates pretty well but does not keep the sound mode setting after turning the TV off and on again.  It took several chats with Samsung support to learn that's just the way it works.  I expected the two Samsung devices would work better together.  I was also unable to update the firmware even after getting an absurd micro-USB adaptor for it.  I can play MP3 audio from the USB so I don't know what the matter is with the firmware update.  Finally the sound bar does not have a display so you have to rely on obscure light patterns and sometimes a recorded voice to know what it's doing.
4,Excellent sound bar for the money and I would recommend it to anyone. I did have to give up trying to connect it wirelessly through Bluetooth though because of the lag between mouth movement on screen and the sound out of it. I used an HDMI chord instead and it’s working great. As an aside I called Samsung support several times to help with this issue and they were excellent.
3,Doesn’t pair with my subwoofer
5,It's not often I'm completely satisfied with a particular product especially electronic equipment however this sound bar suited every one of my needs exceeded my expectations and shows none of the reported flaws I've read in other reviews. Admittedly it's not in a large room but that's what I bought it for and the adaptive sound quality is so surreal I often have trouble distinguishing from sound bar rain or TV background chatter or whether it's actually raining or there's people outside 😅 The setup was particular easy with HDMI. I bought it for better center sound when watching Netflix or other 4k streaming and while stand alone it's just what I needed I'm probably going to add a wireless sub woofer just to hear the difference. About the only thing I haven't done yet is add it to my Alexa device chain yet but I imagine there won't be any issues. If so I'll update this review but definitely  this is a good buy.
4,Really easy to mount but the remote is trash why not put numerals on the remote?  I'm scrolling up and down so much my fingers cramp up. The sound is great  the picture is great the one connect is the invention of the century technically confusing  trying to switch the artwork is so frustrating but all in all a great beautiful tv system
5,This soundbar has excellent sound and has a remote. This is a great alternative to a full sound system without all the mess of wires and speakers.
2,Hey AmazoniansI purchased this on a great deal to replace an older wired bulky 7.1 system which is too loud for apartment life. The sound is fantastic. The bass drivers allow a full sound with some boom without vibrating the floor and walls and upsetting the neighbors.The unit is very good in looks footprint and sound. But it looks like I got a defective unit. I'm currently working with support and will update when I have a fix.The soundbar worked PERFECTLY for the first 3 weeks it was hooked up. It is "smart" it automatically linked with my TV for using only the cable remote. It was one of the easiest device setups I've had. But then suddenly it has started turning itself off every 15-50 minutes. No hands near a remote no changes of any sort to cause it no signal interference that should be happening but completely random. To help with this issue I attempted to register the device on Samsung Smart Things to see if there are any firmware updates or other ways to resolve. I then found out that the unit will NOT register. It fails on the registration after spinning for 2 minutes. I went through its steps reset my modem/router even updated my wifi password (which kicked all my devices off the network) and it failed continually.Overall it worked long enough to make me like it only to start screwing up and make it hate it. Hopefully Samsung will have a fix and I will update this review. Otherwise I'd issue caution but I likely just got a bad unit. How the issue is fixed will determine what happens next.
1,Update: 6 months in and unit has stopped working completely without much use.As far as soundbars go this thing is a horrible choice. It has decent sound quality but about 6 months into having it im already starting to hear some distortion. My biggest complaints though are the volume and bluetooth settings. The bluetooth works fine but when using in this mode it will scream bluetooth at max volume everytime you turn it on even if its set at a low volume. Since it automatically turns off after maybe 20 mins with no sound even if the computer doesnt turn off this occurs a lot. It is especially annoying when you usually turn your computer on at 5 am for work and everyone in the house WAS sleeping. Then the volume setting in general is just dumb. There is no actual number or bar that fills and empties as you turn it up or down. Instead you just get some lights that wave one way or the other and leave you with no idead how close to min or max volume you are. If you are a set it and forget it person that wouldnt matter but I seem to have to adjust  it a lot for different meetings movies games etc. It would be nice not to have to guess what the volume is at. This thing will work but there are options out there with far better features in the same price range.
5,Our tv is so old!!! But it works great and is compatible.
4,I bought this to use with a new Samsung smart TV.  I could not get the bar to connect using bluetooth but it did work ok with the supplied hdmi cable.  It does have good sound but the adjustments to the sound are limited.
4,Good value & sound!  … but the set up is not plug and play for amateurs.  if you have a smart TV  borrow a teenager or tech friendly person to set up and coordinate that dialogue.
5,I have a Samsung TV that was paired to a Visio Sound Bar. Like many I experienced volume control problems whether I connected optically or through bluetooth.  This is a common Samsung TV problem (google it). I got this sound bar figuring if there was any proprietary compatibility problem the same make of sound bar should resolve it.  It did.  The Sound bar also gives a nice 'full' sound so I can hear the TV even at low volume.  The bluetoot as is the case with all sound bars I've seen only works for listening to a bluetooth device. You can't use it for phone calls (no microphone).  The bluetooth does work quite well though for listening.  Yes as noted in other reviews it announces what mode it is in when you turn it on. I don't find this annoying. I do wish though the led lights showing the settings were visible on the side of the bar and not just on top.  This is because I have it located in a spot where I can't see the lights on top while it is in operation.  ...Good sound quality.  Excellent compatibility with a Samsung TV.  The 'Smart' sound setting especially works well.
5,This wasn't a purchase I was wanting to have but with my new Samsung TV I was having to turn up the volume to 50 just to hear and was still having trouble understanding the dialog. I saw this soundbar at BestBuy but purchased it thru Amazon. It is a nice compact size made for Samsung easy set up and wow what a difference !  It has a special feature that separates the dialog making it much easier to understand the speaking portion of the program.  I now only turn up the volume to around 16 or lower !  There is a more expensive soundbar made for Samsung around $100 more but I had no need for the woofers etc.  I would recommend this soundbar !
5,When I buy a TV set I choose it together.
3,The bar is gray. Not even close to white.
4,Only draw back was its not white...its light grey and I was looking for a white 1. But other than that great sound bar for the price
2,Sound is great/it looks beautiful - when it works. I bought this to work with my Samsung Frame tv. Setup was easy and seemingly seamless until in the middle of the night I hear ‘ Network is Disconnected’ blaring from the living room. I consider myself fairly tech savvy but this is the beginning of the endless saga of this Soundbar. Endless hours on the phone with tech support disconnecting it from Alexa disconnecting it from Samsungs App I hardwired the soundbar using Arc I sent the soundbar back to Samsung they said nothing was wrong reaching out to Reddit for help…. Now it just sits on the mantle off because I can’t stand the randomness of the Network is disconnected screeching.
5,I had a different brand soundbar prior to this one and then my friends convinced me to go with the same brand as my TV.  It is much better easily connected.  I have had no issues and its been really great.
5,There’s nothing not to like. GoodColor. Great sound. Looks great under tv
3,After hooking it up and testing it I think I'll really like this sound bar.But keep reading. The remote looks sleek and attractive but almost led me to return everything. Very challenging to insert batteries because you can't open it easily. I watched 2 youtube videos from very helpful people and finally had success. (Thousands have watched those videos)!  Not purposefully I made a tiny chip on the edge with the sharp end of a pin. That allowed me to slip something else in to pry the case open. Batteries went in and it snapped right back together just like Fort Knox.  Shouldn't have to be this hard.
3,When I first got it I could hear it really well but after a couple months now I have to turn it up to almost 50 and I'm no more than 8 feet from it.
3,This soundbar significantly improved the audio quality of my LGCX OLED TV.  I am in an apartment currently so its easy to control the sound level.  If you are in a private home and enjoy quality audio do not buy a sound bar.  Save up and get a proper 5.1 system.  A good sound bar for my current situation though.3 stars because the bass treble and mid levels are near impossible to customize with this device.  Why include these features if they are going to be incredibly difficult to interact with?  It's not intuitive at all. Makes no sense.  Samsung do better next time.  MUCH better.
5,Can understand what is being said. Very happy with this purchase
3,This soundbar compliments our Samsung 55" curved TV. Adjustments sometimes conflict with what the set will allow to happen. Auto sound no longer functions and the software prefers PCM over bitstream. I'm finding it difficult to get the balance of voice and background noise which often overwhelms the vocals.  My primary reason for adding the soundbar. No doubt the sound is richer but the lack of any screen info is frustrating when attempting to tweak the system.
5,Tv
5,Was hesitant about getting this at first. But I absolutely love it! The center speaker for dialogue makes a world of difference. The sound really fills up our bedroom. I have samsung products so I also love how you can just tap your device to automatically connect to the speaker.
5,Samsung has always been a favorite definitely didn't disappoint this time either. Very easy integration with other electronics no extras needed either. Has wifi and Bluetooth built in if you decide not to go wireless it also has HDMI cable included. I bought a mounting bracket as well just to find out there is one included. Only upsetting thing I found was with Digital Optic Cable hooked up there is no volume control with the TV and it requires the remote. Also Dolby Surround is only available when WiFi is synced with the TV. Smart Things is a useful app as well helps alot!
2,I wanted to like this soundbar since I recently purchased a Samsung TV and my Vizio soundbar sounds good when watching cable TV but the volume goes up and down when streaming. The Samsung soundbar is sleek and very easy to set-up. I had NO issues setting it up with the optical cable or with Bluetooth. My Samsung Class tu7000 led 4k UHD Smart Tizen TV is compatible with this soundbar and I was able to watch TV while connected to Bluetooth (no cable connected to the TV).The Cons do outweigh the Pros. I didn’t like the fact that the lights are on top so you don’t know if your settings are sticking unless your standing over it. The remote control was a pain in the behind to open. I don’t understand why I had to google and watch a video on how to open the back of a remote control! That’s ridiculous! The last gripe I have was that the extremely loud voice of the “Samsung chick” announcing every single time you change a setting on the soundbar! OMG! You can’t control the volume of the Samsung chick or turn it off. She scared my beautiful fur baby and that’s when I knew that I needed to return it.
3,Sound was marginally better than the internal TV speaker (40" Samsung LED HD 2017 edition). Connection instructions suitable only for mating to Samsung current model TV's. Samsung Tech Service provided no real insights into how to best connect these two specific  components. Using HDMI cables could not change Volume (fixed too loud). Using Digital Optics Cable could not consistently adjust volume. Had to use Sound Bar Remote AND DirecTV remote so did not have good synchronization. Using Blue Tooth coupled with HDMI cable gained some what better interface. Sound Bar design had very flat bass boost (could not fine tune with either remote) -- Might have more stereo separation with external sub-woofer but that accessory cost as much as the Sound Bar adding up to more than a newer larger Samsung TV!  No Instructions for ApplePlay II and Lexis features.
3,Very nice looking and pairs easily with the Samsung TV.  Also the Samsung TV's remote can be used to control the volume of the soundbar which is very convenient.What I do not like is the sound quality.  Voices are very hard to hear sometime.  And when you turn up the volume to hear when the scene changes to something of action the sound is now overbearing and you are reaching for the remote to turn it down.  I have a Yamaha sound bar on another TV that works very well.  I purchased this because I just wanted a simple soundbar. The Yamaha can be expanded to 2.1 which I do have in the livingroom TV and sounds excellent.I have gone to Samsung's forum to see if there is anything that can be done with this and there is nothing there. I am disappointed for the money I spent on this which was just a little less than the Yamaha.  I was hoping that going with a Samsung soundbar with a Samsung TV this would not be an issue.
5,
3,Nice soundbar but every so often the audio will literally slow down and the voices will get deeper and go out of sync with the picture. I have to turn off the soundbar to get it working again.
5,Good sound enhancement for a second TV can’t compare to the living room with JBL and Bose surround sound system!
2,Hooked it up to my TV and desktop computer via bluetooth which was so spotty that I switched my TV to digital audio.  Had to keep connecting and even pairing the 2 devices that I wanted to use it with.  Watching TV just now and the damn thing just turned itself off.  Over it.  Worst Samsung product I've ever had and my house is full of them.
5,Our son bought us a sound bar one year so when we bought a winter condo the tv there needed better speakers than the ones on the tv. This sound bar suits our living room without disturbing the neighbors and gives enhanced bass and treble.
2,Sound quality is pretty good music will fill a room movie volume is weak. SB is always up full volume controlled through playback App (VLC) or blue tooth device. Tried all settings and connected to different devices in the house. Just not loud enough for movies. The BIGGEST complaint is...Power on your SB & digital voice states (Digital Audio In) or (Conn via Blue Tooth). The playback is at whatever volume your SB was at last use. So if your SB was up full volume last use power on & the voice is soo loud I jump every time & anxiously try to hold the Vol down in hopes it doesn't wake the wife or whole house but the volume adjustment through the remote is ridiculously slow. Takes a really long time to go from low to high or vice versa. - 1 star for Movie Volume - 2 stars for screaming voice and slow Vol adjust.
4,No user manual included
2,The audio quality of the soundbar is really good and the build quality is awesome. But the support for this soundbar by Samsung is the POOREST I've ever seen for a product.Bluetooth:You can't control this product after connecting it to SmartThings app because this model (HW-S50A) is not supported by the app. You can connect this via Bluetooth only and use it as a "glorified Bluetooth speaker".Equalizer settings:Samsung has an "Audio Remote" app for it's soundbars and that app is the most worst and cheap looking app ever for a brand like Samsung. The Air Remote app won't connect to this soundbar too!!! So you have no way to adjust the equalizer settings visually for this soundbar over Bluetooth. The only way you can adjust the equalizer settings is by using it's remote but you don't have the visual aspect for these settings so you have to tune it until it "feels right".HDMI and Optical Audio:These aspects of the soundbar are okayish and the audio through these is good and controls are straightforward.Overall if you are looking for a simple soundbar with decent HDMI connection this one is for you. But please know that the support for this soundbar is almost nil.
3,This is an upgrade  from a 75 inch samsung 4 k TV.  But not by much
4,My only con is on the auto sound mode the volume tens to waver. Not badly but noticeable.
5,First the supplier and Amazon delivered the Samsung Soundbar 2days early! Thank you both!I then plugged in my new soundbar and turned it on and turned on my Samsung TV with it's own remote.I pushed the little button on top of the soundbar and sound came on! Now my tv was already set for the optical cable input. My tv remote worked the volume up and down just great. Sounds come out really nice.The optical cable came with this model of soundbar. Life is a little bit nicer now! Thank you again!
5,Had surround sound (Onkyo) and wasn’t really happy with it.  Took a chance with this sound bar and I love it.  Hearing things I’ve never heard before.  Levels are perfect.  Using with Samsung 7000 tv.
5,I love the look of the sound at and the quality of sound that it produces.  I did have some issues getting it to connect to my TV via Bluetooth but hardwired it and have had no issues.
3,controls are not well designed there is no Atmos. Amazon is misleading on that
5,An excellent product if you’re looking for quality sound that doesn’t require multiple speakers The direct sound input or bluetooth connection give any smart tv an excellent addition to overall viewing quality.
3,Install/hookup was very easy and took only minutes.  Sound quality (especially base) is quite disappointing.  Not many adjustments on treble/base.  Would not purchase again.
2,This soundbar works fine as a sound bar.  Good quality and good price.It's unacceptable as an Alexa device.  It will not balance the volume of the TV output with that of Alexa.  In short Alexa ends up screaming when you have the TV volume up to only 12-15 (on my Samsung TV).  It also doesn't know how to do somethings my echo devices can (like call my phone).I chatted with Samsung support on this 3 times on-line and talked with them twice.  There is no fix for this.  It's the design that there's no way to balance the volume of these two things.  In responding to a previous review Samsung just tried to whitewash the issue stating to contact support.  I did many times.
5,I used an hdmi cord from the speaker into the smart hub and it worked. Done. Good sound.
5,It increases the volume of the TV a significant amount and makes everything sound way better than using the TV speakers. It only comes with a optical audio port and wire. No HDMI connector. And can be connected with Bluetooth for wireless. No issues either way but I prefer the Wired optical connection. The only issue I have is that when I first turn the TV on in the morning the voice prompt says "DIGITAL AUDIO IN" very loud and I have no idea how to turn that off. But that's a minor inconvenience. If you have a bigger space then maybe get something with a sub-woofer and more speakers but for an apartment this is excellent for such a low price.
5,This soundbar looks as described and was very easy to setup!
1,This soundbar has a problem with the auto shuts off power festure. It was supposed to be designed to only happen when there is no signal to it for a time but that is the flaw.  It shuts off every 20 minutes while watching tv thinking there was no signal.  What is worse is that Samsung knows about the flaw and keeps selling them believing the customer will know how to load a new controller whenever they fix it. A better case for a class action i’ve never seen.  Many of the Samsung sound bars have this flaw.  I plan to return it and as usual that will be a real pain since it has been unboxed before i found the problem.  The fixes published do not sustain for long and all are different depending on the sound bar but this model is terrible. You have to hold sound up and down for 15 seconds but that has to be done daily.  I can’t believe they can get away with selling a product with a problem like this auto shut off defect.
2,Could not Remove the cover of the remote to install batteries so I could  install and configure the soundbar.  Ended up having to pry the case to slide it off.  This broke the case and had to purchase a replacement.  broke the case of the remote from prying.  Had to purchase a replacement remote.Recurring loud announements that eminate from the soundbar are very annoying.  "Digital Audio In" is the most common one.  Have to install a new version of firmware so I can eliminate these announcemnts.  No instructions on how to connect soundbar to router so I can update the firware online.  Have to download the new firmware to thumb drive and plug it into service port on soundbar.Very sorry I have passed the return window else this would be going back.Roger Hilton
4,Easy to install and operate.
5,Hooked up easy. Voices are clearer for my dad whose 93. Turn TV on/off and sound bar goes on/off simultaneously with tv.
5,This soundbar is super easy to set up and sounds great with watching movies or listening to music!  Looks great too.
3,Sound is ok. What's not ok is the voice saying "Audio input in" every hour in the middle of the night super loud. Will be returning
5,I have a samsung 82" TV. the speakers are on the back.  I have a bad time hearing dialog do to some hearing damage. This bar seems to be helping with that problem.  One note your samsung TV remote will control this bar volume level so you don't have to have yet another remote laying around.  For me it only started controlling the soundbar after I turned the TV off and back on so that it noticed the soundbar was connected.  Also I'm using the optical cable.
2,Got this to upgrade my Samsung TV audio and I was extremely disappointed. It sounds a litter better than the TV speakers. My old Vizio sb200 sound bar sounds much better af far as mids highs and lows go. This sounds no better than the onn sound bar at Walmart for 50. If you want decent sound look elsewhere.
4,Overall very easy to set-up it connected to my Samsung Smart TV almost instantly. The sound quality is decent but I wish for the price point it came with a port to plug in your own sub-woofer.
5,I used the optic interface with an older Samsung TV so pay no attention if your setup is different.  The nice part is that it is trivial to set up so that the TV powers up and switches to the sound bar whenever the TV is turned on.  I use an Apple TV with automatic switch-on for the Samsung TV (usually works) so I'm getting one touch turn-on.  Sound is much better than the TV speakers and provides decent stereo separation at distances of 1 to 2 meters.
3,Great sound for small rooms but wait for sale at $200 or below.  Only sub option is the over priced $300 Bluetooth SWA-W500 (5in).
2,We got this soundbar yesterday and right after setting it up everything seemed great. The sound quality was really nice and we were enjoying using it as an Alexa controller.When we were watching TV later that night we kept hearing odd noises like we had said "Alexa" when we hadn't.Also it seemed like turning up the TV volume to a reasonable level made Alexa responses incredibly loud.This morning we couldn't even use Alexa at all it just said "Network Disconnected" over and over again.I followed a bunch of online steps and basically re-setup every one of my Samsung smart devices and it is now working again but honestly if it breaks again I think I will return this product.
3,sound is very good but remote does not pair well with tv remote and has frequent breaks.
3,Alittle disappointed.  No displays for setting levels or modes.  Bass is pretty good but treble tinny.  I've had a Polk sound bar and same complaint.  Our Bose sound bar for LR is awesome... too expensive.  Will keep this as for large bedroom and don't need blast the house down sound.  Still don't know how to turn some of the settings on and customer service stinks...hard to understand too.
5,Love this sound bar.
5,My Entrainment center limits the size of my TV at 32".  This sound bar fit well in my space provided.  While not surround sound as a stereo would provide I was really impressed. It is a vast improvement to the television sound.  I purchased this as it had very good ratings and I have a Samsung TV.  Easy installation.  A plug for the sound bar and the supplied digital audio cable (never heard of that) worked pretty easy.
5,Amazing 3D sound effect. Don't know how to use alexa with it.
5,Very easy setup. Great sound quality.
3,Started out with good volume butI now have to up the volume to get the same sound.  Am very dissappointed since it was $100.00 more.  I need a speaker with good sound.
5,Sleek design. Great material. Sharp look. Awesome sound.
2,Everything works as expected except two functions with the Alexa app.First this speaker is not compatible with Alexa Groups. So if you plan on making a group of speakers using Alexa (“Alexa play music in all rooms”) the Soundbar can’t be included. Second if you use the speaker’s built-in Alexa to stream you have to reconnect the speaker output settings on the TV back to the Soundbar every time. It’s annoying.I’m returning it for a more Alexa-compatible Soundbar. I thought it was a little misleading to call it Alexa enabled when it’s not recognized as a speaker by Alexa.
3,It sounds great just an average sound bar. One huge annoying quirk - every time it’s turned on the device voice says “DIGITAL AUDIO IN” which is really annoying if you forget to turn the volume down the night before. If you’re forgetful you’ll be spilling your coffee the next morning as the speaker shouts at you. No way to turn this off. The Bluetooth doesn’t work well or at all with older Samsung TVs so I had to hard wire it. I have another older Samsung 4K TV and older Samsung sound bar that works seamlessly on Bluetooth. Looks like Samsung has regressed here.
5,I got this for my husband and he loves it! Great buy and great gift!
5,It's a good looking speaker sounds great and it's easy to connect.
1,It seemed to work well the first time I used it.  After that it was downhill from there.  If I wanted to adjust the volume I had to do that directly on the soundbar.  I contacted the seller and I was told that they cannot assist me and I should contact Amazon.  It is still within the return period.  I will return it.
3,I love Samsung products but this is underwhelming! It’s not as loud as I thought it would be and the Sound is not what I expected I expected more out of Samsung products. I should’ve bought the Bose
2,I liked the looks but as other reviews have stated you can't see the "status" lights for volume etc. which are placed on top while the unit lays "flat" on your mantle (or whatever).  The volume control on the remote only muted the volume never found a way to increase/decrease the volume.  The overall volume of the unit was VERY weak especially compared to my old Vizo S4251W soundbar.  I am returning it.
3,Buena para ver TV y sobre todo películas mal si le quieren dar uso para música el sonido es fatal en el modo música predeterminado me gusta todo en sonido Standard la mejor configuración a mi gusto la conectividad esta bien.  3 estrellas por el buen sonido para películas
5,I feel like I wasted $130.
5,Overall this is an good sound bar for the price.  I'm a little disappointed in the bass sound - perhaps we're not doing the adjustments like we should but we've tried everything we can think of.  I just prefer a deeper bass sound.  Others (like my husband) may think it's perfectly acceptable.
2,I really like the sound quality it's crisp and has decent bass. I haven't tried to put it as loud as it'll go so I can't comment on that. It took me a while to get it reconnected to the internet. It took 3 phone calls and about an hour and a half of my time to get it fixed. But it did happen and I'm very pleased. Update: is only been a week or so and now I get no sound from it
5,A great soundbar especially if paired with the new Samsung smart tv’s. A very good understated contemporary design that is less obtrusive than many other sound bars.
4,What I did not appreciate or like was the product being lowered $50 in price after I ordered but beforeit was delivered. I almost cancelled it and reordered but did not. Product is fine better value now.
2,Looks amazing but it continues to annoy mePros: Great sound permeates throughout the entire room and even into the kitchenCons:  Randomly turns off every 20 minutes or soDoesn't have a way to show the current volume level
5,Bought this to go with our new Samsung tv. Followed the instructions and it connected it right up. Sound is great.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             For a cheap soundbar it isn't bad quality. I absolutely 100% do not recommend anyone buy this though. The interface is made so that every time you turn on your tv it picks up at the last volume you were at saying "DIGITAL AUDIO IN."There's no way to turn off the audio interface as there is no display. The device voice is slightly louder than anything else and the sound quality is simply not worth the hassle. You can do better.
5,I was devoid about buying this because I read reviews of this not connecting to Samsung TVs. Well mine worked perfectly. The sound quality is amazing and vibrant. And it looks so since on my entertainment center. If you are looking to amplify the sound in your home this a must have. Worth every penny!
1,This soundbar has had connection issues from day 1 and is extremely clunky when it comes to voice assistants. When i ask alexa to play music from spotify it says "this device does not support spotify playback" and yet I can play music if I connect through the spotify app on my phone. What a joke. And apparently this is an issue with ALL samsung soundbars
5,Not very expensive and super easy for tech challenged people.  I was able to set it up in 10 minutes!  Love the sound too!
5,Very good quality this bar with the SWA-W500 subwoofer is a bomb it produces a clear enveloping wide and very detailed sound which is available here on Amazon for under $ 600 both I have tried many bars and this one has me  impressed of course with the wireless SWA-W500.
4,No HDMI port. I have a older Samsung smart TV with a digital audio in port and I used that to connect and I'm happy with that. I'm older and don't hear certain ranges of sound and this helps a lot.
2,Sound quality is good.But If you are trying to use this soundbar for wireless device just leave it alone.Serious delay problem and there is no way to solve when the soundbar connected with wifi or bluetooth device i used my laptop iphone or android to test and there is no Sync setting for wireless connectionI am suffering for this. And i asked Samsung support for help and nothing they can do. I hope it can be fixed in the future firmware update.
5,Installation was very easy and quick.  Vastly improves sound versus TV speakers.  Worth every penny when watching concerts on the TV.  Nice full sound with ability to adjust treble and base.
5,I got this soundbar to replace a brand new Yamaha soundbar that all the features would not work!  This Samsung is great.  It is easy to setup and all the features work great!
5,Tv
5,Great price and great sound.  The set-up was very easy.
4,Great for the $$$$. Does it’s job.
5,This product looks great and sounds fantastic
2,Decent for the price. Works as expected with a Samsung smart TV. The remote is enough to warrant 1 or 2 stars. It is impossible to open. Once we got it open it appears to have been glued shut. It pretty much disintegrated once we got the battery compartment open.
4,Have had intermittent audio dropouts with optical connection and unable to figure out how to fix it.
3,This soundbar DOES NOT pair with Alexa devices – Samsung says Echo is a speaker and you can't pair a speaker to a speaker (!?!) Wow. Also Samsung's own website can't find this model serial number if you try to 'register' it. ALSO!!!! Samsungs so-called 'Smart Things' app can not find this device. So almost everything I bought this for does not work properly. Screw this.
4,Works pretty well but I found that the speech clarity is less than perfect. I can't understand everything Homer Simpson says.
3,5 channel bar but really sounds like 2.0. Very bad dialogue mode- voices to high pitched. Night mode is joke. App lets you change some EQ settings but  it’s not well enough. Automatic adaptive sound - glitches.
2,The toggle button on the remote is not easy or good to raise or lower the volume. They should have up and down buttons. Plus there is no volume level indicator on the unit. All you see is the black front. There should be a volume level number you see when you change volume.
4,I'd like more inputs. Only ones on this are USB and optical. Can't plug my turntable in.
5,They both work fine
1,Soundbar took 7 hours and 10 to 15 calls to Samsung to work as designed. I have a Samsung tv that supports this soundbar. The next day I find the soundbar has to be unplugged for 30 seconds every morning or is doesn't work. Four additional calls and the best suggestion was to plug the sound bar into a wall outlet rather than a surge protector still no help. With the exception of two tech reps the samsung customer service is a joke.Two tech reps didn't like the quality of my phone call generated from my new Samsung cell phone. The phone was on a stand not hand held so I could perform the opertions requested by the rep.Is the soundbar defective? Would I have better results If I returned it for a replacement? I might but I think it may just be a problem with this model. If you have a Samsung tv try a higher end model.On the plus side hook up to Alexa was easy using the SmartThings app.
5,hard hearing...total one ear
3,The sound is good!  I was just looking for something basic and easy to hook up.  However after the unit is shut it off it wakes up every hour and say's "DIGITAL AUDIO IN"It's really annoying.  I've tried the fixes and it didn't work for me.  I will be returning it for something else.
3,Sound quality is good and it is well made. There is a problem with this soundbar. When your tv is turned off the soundbar will voice fairly loudly “digital audio in”. I’ve tried to fix this with Samsung and it seems to be an issue with the firmware or something. If this doesn’t bother you then I would suggest this item.
2,Worked well for about an hour then shuts itself off. over the first 3 weeks of ownership unit would power off while in use intermittently. Sent it back for new replacement hopefully new one will stay on. Sounds very good while it's working.
2,Volume can not be controlled on universal Samsung TV remote while using an optical cable. Description TITLE says with Dolby Atmos and it does not have Dolby Atmos!
5,Awesome sound for an awesome price. Music and movies sound great through this. Haven’t tried connecting to the tv via Bluetooth. I just go direct in. I live in a small space and the soundbar fills the room beautifully. Great purchase 10/10 recommend.
3,Firmware update process doesn’t work.  Hope the device itself works better.
5,This thing packs a punch! Great sound. Great bass for the size. My only complaint would be the volume level announcement of turning on. Really not needed.
5,Love these speakers. I also love that the subwoofer is built inside so I don’t have too many things around my console. It’s sounds amazing!
4,Good quality for bedroom setup.
1,This thing is awful. Turns off after 20 minutes of connectivity and sent back to Samsung TWICE to get fixed and it’s still not working properly. BUY ANYTHING ELSE.
1,it did not come with mounting kit as promised and came silver instead of black
2,Really like the sound quality the color and look of it but within two weeks of getting it we’re experiencing the sound lapsing for two or three seconds every few minutes. Really ruins the experience of movies & tv not sure what to do with this now
2,I got this primarily as a Bluetooth speaker for the den. Connectivity is not an issue but the sound is: flat next to no bass. There are better options out there at that price point.
4,works well
5,I love everything
1,No tenía el sonido que esperaba el control no se conecta al tv (a pesar de ser la misma marca) no puedes ver cuando subes o bajas en volumen ya que no lo permite el televisor tienes que usar dos controles uno para subir y bajar el volumen y otro para cambiar los canales y si tienes Fire tv tres controles no lo recomiendo
1,It was great for first week. After one week the volume continually turned itself down to zero. You could turn it up on remote control but then it would immediately be turned back to zero. Used new batteries tried taking batteries out of the handset power off/on etc. Tried Advanced settings on TV and did all the things I read on the forums but it failed to work. You can see all of the LEDs are all lit like the device is constantly sending signals for all settings. I even tried removing the control ribbon from the circuit board to disable the onboard buttons of the device but that did not work either. Through it in the trash after 1 week. Seems similar issues occur on multiple Samsung sound bars and there does not seem to be a solution. In future I will not buy another Samsung sound bar.
5,For $120 this is a massively good deal.  Going from TV speakers to this was a huge improvement.  Maybe when I get rich I'll get an upgrade but until then this speaker is fantastic.
2,Cuts out.  Amazon replaced.  Hope thos one works.
1,Title says it all. Factory reset it and it works for a few hours until it starts turning itself off again. Do a little sleuthing and find lo and behold this has been a problem for over a half of a year and still not fixed.Sound quality aesthetic all go out the window if the product doesn't perform its basic function of *staying on*. Look elsewhere.
1,Remote died within a day or so of receiving tried battery replacement didn't help poor user experience as you aren't sure what the buttons on the bar or remote actually do besides power and there is virtually no mobile app functionality. I would highly suggest pairing LG sound bar with an LG TV
1,I bought this largely for aesthetics and really wasn't expecting much. It sounds fine but it has a fatal flaw. For me anyway. All I've used it for is music (the new TV it was bought for isn't here yet) connected via the optical input. So my mini review is based upon that input only.Every so often as frequently as 5 or 6 times an hour the sound stops for a second or two. It picks right back up doesn't need to be reconnected or rebooted or anything. But obviously that's a non-starter. Returning it tomorrow. It's a shame as I otherwise like it OK.
5,No issues at all the sound bar is great. Wish I bought one a long time ago.
1,este producto lo voy aregresar por espesifica que contiene alexa y no es cierto estoy muy molesto
5,I like everything about my sound system.
1,Title says it all. We returned this is spent more money on a better soundbar.
5,great addition to a samsung tv
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               No funciona bien con alexano se puede emparejar con los dispositivos  eco y su funcionalidad es intermitenteno lo recomiendo
5,I love the size. It’s great for a small room and sound quality is amazing.
5,I love it aound is definitely what I expected...♥♥
1,The geniuses at Samsung decided to put on a feature that you can’t turn off.  Whenever the soundbar turns on it says very loudly the type of connection it’s using.  WHY?!?!? So if there is a power cycle with the TV that can happen in the middle of the night (the tv is off but sometimes does a nightly update or reset) the soundbar thinks it’s turning on and says “DIGITAL AUDIO IN” at 4am waking everyone up.I called Samsung and they could not turn this feature off.The sad part is it’s a great sound bar.  Quality is perfect; I use the Apple TV remote with it.But this has woken up the household a few times in just a few weeks.  Do Not Buy it until Samsung fixes this dumb feature.
2,Controller absolutely will not change volume. Stay away from this one.
1,This thing doesn't connect or shuts off half the time. What a waste. If you factory reset it it'll work for a little bit but it will glitch out in a few hours. Instant return
1,I brought this product because I have a Samsung tv so I thought the Samsung sound bar would be compatible. Well this sound bar is not supported by the app (Smartthings) which is required in order to pair the tv with the sound bar. It truly is unbelievable that a brand new product isn’t not able to pair with the app. The only option is to connect the sound bar to the tv with a cord. This is 2020 no one wants to use a cord everything else is wireless. The only way to update firmware on the sound bar is with usb. The technology is archaic. Amazing that a Samsung sound bar cannot pair with a Samsung tv
3,I didn't realize that this comes with a remote..I did not receive a remote.
1,2 months of play and the soundbar dies! Nothing more can be said.
5,It is easy setup
1,Bought this in January.  Had problems from the start with keeping it connected.  Now it's dead. Guess I should have paid for the expensive warranty.  No return option offered.  Beyond disappointed 😞
1,Bought fall 2021. Summer 2022 and it’s completely dead. Zero power. Garbage from China you can’t win.
3,Remote is difficult to use...sound is ok but not great
5,Great bass I find no issues with this at all 🤌
2,Besides the fact that very occasionally it likes to come on at FULL BLAST.... I am supremely underwhelmed at the sound quality.  It sounds like I've got earplugs on when listening to it.... crappy highs crappy bass.... midtones are pretty much crappy too.  Getting the picture?  Sure is LOUD though... I won't advise this to anyone...........
5,perefect for a small place
1,after 2 months not much good off and on bad sound had cable people check everything out said they where ok with there equipment have gone back to flat screen tv sound should have bought at big box store with some kind of support  or are any of these speakers any good?
2,Didn't work at all most of the time.....power was intermittent. Apparently a bad power cable. During the brief periods that it did work I was not impressed at all with the sound quality. Just seemed very weak not much better than the TV speakers. I returned it and will not buy again. Found a Vizio for $98 at Walmart and the sound is very good. Great treble midrange and bass.
5,So far we like take up less space.
3,Did not meet my expectations adequate.
1,I’ve only had the sound bar for less than 6 months and it has started to turn off while watching tv. I have liked the sound bar other than that but this was too expensive to only have it work correctly for 6 months. The warranty only lasts for 90 days so I would suggest getting the extended warranty.
1,The device turns on independently when turned off and switches from blue tooth to "digital audio in" and back again randomly.  I suspect this is why it was returned previously and put up for resale.  These are the kinds of defects one wouldn't know about until it happens then it's past the return window.
5,Works great
2,The sound was clear but low and weak. Could not hear it on the loudest volume and little to no bass
1,Sound is muffled.  Stops working periodically.  Hard to run.  Difficult to know what mode it is in.  Have to call tech support everytime it quits working.  They will not let us send it back.  Worst purchase ever.
2,Sound is okay. Not much better than standard TV speakers. But the voice support is awful. We don't need it and there is no way to turn it off. We've even tried with updated firmware but that didn't help.
1,Ordered 2. Every time we turned on the tv it would say digital audio on at max volume and sometimes wouldn’t stop. Returned both and they never refunded my money on the second one. What a nightmare!!! Do not buy!
1,The item description indicated I was buying a NEW sound bar.  The box arrived today and it’s NOT NEW.  The box where the accessories come had the seal broken the  included batteries were loose the remote control was not in its original bag instructions missing…
2,1. You can not get rid of the announcement each time when it turns on even with the firmware download.2. You can not use your Samsung TV remote to control the volume. You still need to use 2 remotes. I called Samsung tech support and confirmed both of these issues.Overall....disappointed.
1,Works intermittently. I have set it up more than a few dozen times only to have it stop working I wish I could return it. I Never would have bought it if I knew all the problems I would have with it.
5,Excellent sound and quality.
3,Don’t waste your money
5,Sencillo
1,Although the product says 2021 - Dolby Atmos - This isn't.The product is good if you are in need of a room speaker and not expecting Dolby Atmos sound. The 1 star is purely because I feel cheated with the heading of the product. Amazon should pull down such products where the description doesn't match the product title.
1,Like other reviews have mentioned having the device announce every little status is so unnecessary when the device also has buttons and LED lights. With company sleeping in my living room early in the morning the last thing I wanted to the pointless announcement of DIGITAL AUDIO IN when I turned on the device. I turned it on deliberately I know it's on no need to shout at me. It's going back to the warehouse.
2,That’s about all! Value!
1,No bass not broke just is a speaker per phone call With Samsung. There is no Bass enhancement. This is just an additional speaker for your tv without any  sound improvements. The woofer button does NOTHING per Samsung phone call.
1,Piece of crap. ( love You Neil Young ) Died just outside of the amazon window return date. Amazon made it right.
2,I have no opinion on the product never got to hear it work.
1,DO NOT BUY TO USE WITH 9500S AS AMAZON DESCRIBES
1,Was decent - nothing special.  Got it in March 2020.  Just stopped working in October 2021 and had to replace it.  Just think of it as a 7 dollar a month year and a half lease.
1,I bought it in new condition and received a used one without the correct parts and very dirty  >:(
1,Sound quality was not as good as I was hoping for but the price was ok. I missed the window to return it after it stopped working. Perhaps a defect.
1,Voice delay and bad sound quality. My TV speaker sound way better from the sound bar.
1,Constantly blurts out "Digital Audio In" middle of the night. Wakes the whole house up. Total garbage. Bad design. Feels like a ripoff. Do not buy this.
1,ONLY WORKED FOR 2 DAYS DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!
1,Ended up returning this item the sound was okay and it kept saying ‘digital audio in’ even after turning it off which was very annoying.
1,Only works when it wants to. Lol
3,The soundbar was easy to setup and sounds great but buyer beware that you cannot stream Spotify thru it using the built in Alexa integration (e.g. “Alexa play songs by Elton John”). While most Alexa features appear to work fine attempting to use Spotify via Alexa results in a “Device not supported” error. This appears to be a common issue with Samsung soundbars based on numerous complaints online.
4,I’m finding the Samsung S60A soundbar a little frustrating. Very good but frustrating.I ordered this thing to pair up with my Windows desktop to better enjoy movies on my 32” curved 4K monitor which is excellent in every respect but the inbuilt speakers. At 30” wide the soundbar nestles almost perfectly beneath the monitor and while the instruction manual is fairly bare bones it didn’t take long to figure out how to pair it to the desktop by Bluetooth.My first test of the soundbar as is traditional whenever I test a new speaker was to head to YouTube and play a little Fleetwood Mac. I started with Edge of Seventeen and was immediately blown away by the sound quality rich full and with a respectable amount of bass. Samsung has done an excellent job with the soundstage here creating an expansive sound from such a small unit. I was very impressed.After a few more songs I settled down to finish a movie I started watching last night and as soon as it started playing I noticed an issue: there was significant latency between the video and audio something in the region of 0.3 seconds. Denzel Washington’s lips moved and then a fraction of a second later the sound emerged. I can deal with a little latency from my speakers - all of them have at least *some* audio lag - because the brain is pretty good at ignoring it but 0.3 seconds is too much to accommodate. You can’t enjoy a movie with that much lag.Now if I’m playing a movie through a media player such as VLC latency is no problem as I can manually adjust the synchronisation to erase it using VLC’s tools but there’s no system wide method to do the same. The issue has to be fixed at the source rather than constantly worked around. I restarted the soundbar twice restarted all applicable Bluetooth and audio services made sure my drivers were up to date removed and re-paired the soundbar and restarted the computer all to no avail. The lag is still there as strong as ever.The upshot is that this soundbar isn’t going to be of much use to me with this degree of latency. I could address it by hooking it up via the included HDMI cable but as I don’t have a spare port it would mean investing in new equipment to make it work and I really don’t want any more cables than necessary hanging from my desk.I should point out in case this worries you that if you plan to hook this up to your TV and you’re concerned about latency it isn’t much of an issue there. Most modern TVs will have audio synchronisation tools in the settings menu that will allow you to hasten or delay the audio to perfectly sync up the video so it’s no big deal. If you’re considering this for use with your computer though and if the latency is a widespread issue rather than a flaw with my soundbar in particular it may be better to look elsewhere.
2,Bought this to match my samsung shirt throw projector but found out this is a very weak sound bar. Had to buy the bass module separately and you can hardly hear it. pass on this.
4,Setup is easy and it for the most part "just works" if you have a TV that supports ARC but the controls are a bit annoying and the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired at $200.The sound quality (particularly the bass) changes dramatically based on where you have the soundbar setup such as on the floor on a table near a wall on a table far from a wall on a table in front of the tv etc and none are terribly ideal - you usually get overly boomy or overly lacking bass. When you try to adjust the subwoofer the only feedback you get is the soundbar letting you know that you pressed the increase or decrease button and doesn't ever let you know if you're at level 0 1 10 50 etc so you can never set it to a certain level for a certain listening experience without trial and error. There's different sound modes as well but the instructions don't say what they change or what they do. Maybe theres some other settings I'm missing (and the documentation is missing) but I never got Atmos to work or if I did I never noticed a big difference.I have portable bluetooth speakers that sound better than this all while having to conserve battery life and retain their portability. But for most people for most uses this will be perfectly fine. I don't know if it's worth $200 but the ease of setup and relatively decent sound quality leave it to get 4 stars from me.
1,got it from costco but it quit working after 3 or so hours resetting doesn't fix it it lasted 3 hours after  the reset had to reset it three time for it to take and then the 3rd time around it lasted an hour and every attempt since then fails to work and i was told to get a firmware update then i was told it is up to date then and i have to send it to them for 2 weeks or a month and then The firmware update file for my sound bar HW-Q67CB/ZA will not open and no one will offer nothing other than sending off for your service center to do the update this is not acceptable when all I need is for the download to fixed simple but no one understands or cares about me and can't understand that the software download for the firmware update isn't unzipping and the web page needs to fixed
5,Had a large sony dvd surround 6 speakers for over 20 yrs that died. Wanted a cleaner simple look with low cost and decent sound.its  a-lot better than tv sound. i used optical cable for a direct connect so not sure on bluetooth issues with some. works  fine with infinity  and tv remote. Its not a Bose its a 140 dollar sound bar that to me is fine.
4,This will be great addition for any TV that is lacking in the audio section with a simple slick compact design▶ Build Quality & DesignBuild quality is pretty good as expected from Samsung. I like the fabric mesh cover and round design. the touch controls on the top works well and incorporated well in the cover. There is a remote included but depend on your TV manufacturer you might be able to control the volume from the TV (or cable) remote▶ Sound qualityCompared with the thin TV speaker this will definitely improve the sounds quality. Not the best around to be honest as it lacks some lows but you can hook it up with wireless sub and rear speakers to get a proper surround system▶ FeaturesThe soundbar support the latest dts:virtual x which is like dolby atmos but unlike dolby atmos it's not supported by streaming services at the moment and therefore there is little content to take advantage of it✅ Pros: Design Connectivity Sound Optional 5.1❌ Cons: No Atmos Bass is lackingOverall its a great well prices soundbar to improve you TV owns sound quality. It's a shame that they didn't include Atmos support but I guess it was to keep the price in the right place
5,I'm using this with my Sony OLED A8G TV which already has good sound as well as dialogue-enhancing settings. Still this Samsung soundbar gives a fuller-range sound with more bass and crisper treble and the dialogue is clearer. SET-UPThe little manual that comes with the unit doesn't tell you much. I had to search for and download the full manual from Samsung (which contains complete operating instructions with things like the "hidden buttons"). I connected the unit to my Sony TV via the bluetooth which worked well but I had to reconnect manually each time I turned on the TV and I am too lazy for that (the setting is four menus deep) so I switched to the ARC connection which also worked fine. The downside is the TV doesn't display an onscreen volume setting when connected via the ARC.SOUNDRight off the bat I noticed fuller range sound and clearer dialogue. My goal is to get the clearest dialogue and to prevent the music & sound effects from becoming too loud during movies/TV. I tried customizing the sound by adjusting the "Center Level" but I didn't notice any difference with it all the way up (or down for that matter). Neither the unit nor the TV display the levels (+6 to -6) for the “Center Level” or “Side Level” nor does the manual make clear what changing these levels will do. I plan to wait for a professional review hoping to get more information on the best settings. I also tried changing the SOUND MODE from "Standard" to "Adaptive Sound" ("automatically provides the optimal sound field based on the characteristics of the content"*) and that did seem to prevent movies and TV shows from becoming too loud. Again I'm hoping some pro reviews will clear things up.*On the Samsung website "Adaptive Sound" is described as "dynamically optimized audio with enhanced voice clarity for whatever you are watching." This is useful information that should be in the manual.IN USEI miss having a visual for the volume level. The unit flashes its lights each time you turn the volume up or down a step but that's it. Oddly when I turned up the volume by pressing the + button on the unit itself then later tried to turn the volume all the way down with the remote it wouldn't go to zero – I had to press the minus button an equal number of times. Going forward I plan to leave the + and - buttons on the unit alone.Overall this is a great-sounding soundbar. Samsung needs to work on communicating the info consumers need to understand their gear.
4,I've had a few Samsung soundbars over the years and they've been hit or miss. This one is definitely a hit.I have a 55" Sony A90J in our bedroom and it has pleasant sound and even has a lot of bass. I added this soundbar and was surprised how much it enhanced the television. I didn't have to crack the manual as I opted for plugging this right into the TV's ARC port.I've also had a few Samsung televisions so the remote was familiar. You can adjust the sound with the OPT button but the voice that guides you is too loud. It's louder than the sound from the TV and sounds annoying and out of place.We watched Monster Hunter with this soundbar and things like the grappling hook somehow sound like they echo across the room. I was so surprised the first time I heard this I had to rewind and listen to it again.Bass is adequate but it can't compete with a system that has a dedicated subwoofer. I also had a slight delay with sound from the TV but there's a sync setting I stumbled on and it helped.The best part about this soundbar is its compact size and ability to crank out some impressive sound. This runs on the pricey side. I mention this because I have a Vizio 5.1 system in a small room and it sounds better than this and has a subwoofer. But if you can only have a soundbar and no extra speakers you could do a lot worse than the Samsung HW-S60A.
1,Wont pair with brand new samsung tv. Not a big deal used digital connection. Sound bar constantly loses connection with subwoofer sound goes out about once every 60 seconds. Looked it up common issue and had to upgrade firmware issue was resolved for maybe 2 months….waiting on a new firmware upgrade I guess. Throwing it out to buy something else
4,Let’s get this out of the way first…many sound bars do not sound great right out of the box.  This is true with this sound bar too.  The reason is that the equalizer for all speakers is set to 0db which produces flat audio and little bass.  To achieve good audio you need to go through the speaker setups to get everything set properly.  Once you do this sound bar produces great audio.I am impressed with the audio of this Samsung Sound Bar.  It brings clarity to a wide range of tones and the audio remains clear at the highest volume settings.  Once set properly the built-in subwoofer produces good bass.  If you need more bass an optional wireless subwoofer can be added.  This is a 5.1 channel system with 7 total speakers three in the front and two side facing.  Two side speakers incorporate Samsung’s Acoustic Beam Technology which delivers audio that seems to come from precisely where the action is happening.There are three pre-programmed sound modes: Standard Music and Adaptive Sound.  In the Standard mode you can set custom equalizer settings for seven channels and in the other two modes the treble and bass levels can be adjusted from what is programmed but no other channels are adjustable.  I found that the Music mode was not to my liking so I use the Standard mode with my own equalizer settings.  The Adaptive Sound mode analyzes content played on the television and adjusts the sound settings for ideal audio for that content.  There is an Enhanced Dialogue setting that is intended to improve the clarity of voices in the audio output.  This is helpful if there is a broadcast with a lot of background music or sound effects that tend to drown out the dialogue.  This setting did improve the clarity of voices.The sound bar is compact and lightweight measuring only 30” wide and weighing a little over 6.5 pounds.  With a height of about 2.7 inches the sound bar can fit under most televisions easily.  Included in the kit is the sound bar power cord HDMI cable remote wall mount template with wall mount fasteners and a quick installation guide.  I had difficulty finding the full manual online.  It was not on Samsung’s US website.  In the support section for this sound bar under Manuals & Software there was no file for the manual only a firmware update file.  I eventually found the manual on Samsung’s Hong Kong website.  This needs to be corrected since the full manual contains quite a lot of useful information.Installation was very straightforward and uncomplicated.  The sound bar connects to the TV with the HDMI ARC (eARC) cable an optical audio cable Bluetooth or WiFi if only connecting to a Samsung television.  The HDMI ARC connection is preferred because of its better transmission rate but any connection should give great results.  Installation consists of connecting the HDMI ARC cord to the sound bar and to the TV then plugging in the bar’s power cord.  I have a newer smart TV so my TV recognized the sound bar as soon as both were powered on and audio switched over to the sound bar automatically.  There is a wall mount template and fasteners included for the bar.  Mounting to the wall consists of installing wall anchors screwing in the sound bar holders to the anchors attaching the mount brackets to the sound bar and hanging the bar from the screws.The sound bar is primarily controlled from either the remote or the SmartThings app.  The app only connects to the sound bar through your home’s WiFi.  Except for the basic functions such as power volume mode and input device selection I do not find the remote helpful in adjusting the audio of the soundbar.  There are only beeps emitted from the soundbar when changes are made so it is near impossible to know where you are in the range of a particular setting.There are indicator lights on the sound bar that illuminate when certain actions are performed or to indicate certain statuses but they are worthless because they cannot be seen unless you are standing over the sound bar.  There are buttons on the top of the bar that control power/mode selection volume and the microphone on/off.So why only four stars?  This should be a five star product except that I detest that Samsung’s SmartThings app will not add the sound bar nor operate unless the app’s location settings on my mobile device is set to always on.  I also dislike that I must create a Samsung account that requires personal information such as date of birth (which I fudged).  All I want to do is to control the sound bar I do not want these kinds of intrusions.  After I set the custom equalizer settings to my liking I disabled the app since the sound bar remembers these settings.  If needed I will enable the app.
4,The SAMSUNG HW-S50A 3.0ch Soundbar is a decent quality soundbar that enhances the sound of your television at a reasonable price.  The soundbar was a little tricky to sync to my Samsung television - there were no instructions in the box nor on the television and setup wasn't totally intuitive.  I ended up having to pull up an instruction manual for an older soundbar on the Samsung website to get instructions on how to connect the soundbar to my tv.Once connected the speakers worked really well.  They are definitely better than the built in speakers to the television but they're definitely not better than full sound systems with a separate bass.  This was expected but I honestly wished it sounded a little bit better - I own a different branded soundbar that offers much richer sound at a comparable price so I was hoping this one would at least sound similar.  Overall this is a decent soundbar and offers good sound for a reasonable price.  I would definitely give a list to it in person if you can before you purchase though.
5,I have a computer in our kitchen that doubles as a TV that can be seen from the kitchen or the dining room and when our old All in One computer died and I replaced it with a regular one I realized that I had a new problem I didn’t have the sound that I had become accustomed to from the Beats speakers that were one the old computer.I had been looking for options and there wasn’t really a good one because this screen rotates 180 degrees depending on what we are doing and where we are viewing it from. Normal desktop speakers wouldn’t work and BT portable speakers were always getting in the way and needing to be charged.When I saw this sound bar with Alexa built in I knew it would be the answer.  Now I have very great sound that can fill both the kitchen and the dining room.  The added bonus is that I now also have Alexa in the kitchen so I can have to play music without even opening up the computer as well as control the smart home items we have.The sound quality is excellent even though it is not installed in a conventional arrangement.  There is so much more functionality that I get now with this sound bar in addition to just great sound quality.I wish there was a better way to install the sound bar and connect it to my Alexa without having to install yet another app on my phone that I probably wont use again after setup is complete but I guess that’s a small price to pay.
5,We have this in our office which is a fairly small room. The sound is great and we are very happy with that. We use it both with just the TV as well as with the PC-in to play games and haven't noticed any delay or anything. The wireless subwoofer is exciting but we haven't gotten one yet. I love that it's wireless but I don't love that it sort of limits our options for what subwoofer we can use with it.Unfortunately it is a tad tall so since we sit eye level with the TV it blocks the bottom of the tv a little bit. We are looking at mounting options that might work with our TV stand but there isn't anything that works out of the box we will likely have to McGyver something.
5,This is an easy recommendation for me especially since as of this review (7/31/2021) it's at $200. The sound is already good for normal content but when you find something with Dolby Audio and that Dolby Atmos surround sound kicks in...*cue the Antonio Banderas biting finger meme*...ooooh sweet! I use this in my small bedroom with my 55" Vizio OLED testing it with Netflix and wow it fills up the room quickly. Almost literally as the Atmos portion of the surround sound bounces the sound upwards as well. To be honest for my tiny 10'x10' room it's a bit overkill. This thing would sound great even in a pretty spacious living room. I really don't understand how the model I'm reviewing - HW-S50A/ZA - is at $200 while the two other step-up models are at $330. Not sure how long this price reduction will last but if you've ever been curious about a Dolby Atmos soundbar or just Dolby Atmos audio in general this is a great way to dip your toes considering many other excellent soundbars can easily pass the $500 range.
5,The sound from this fills our den and it's outstanding. The sound bar was easy to set up and has been great when watching movies and sports. It even plays music beautifully! The holidays are just starting and I've found all these amazing Youtube channels that have hours of holiday music to play in the background from your TV/computer. With the music they have beautiful scenes as well. I love having one of these channels on my TV to run in the background as we're in the house. And the sound bar plays the music from these channels so well!
5,This soundbar is honestly excellent. It is everything one would need from a soundbar. Watching a movie with it is one thing but I believe that the best way to experience this sound bar is to listen to music with it.
5,The Samsung HW-S60-A soundbar provides great stereo sound in a very elegant speaker. It’s quite easy to extend the sound from an iPhone to the soundbar just using Bluetooth connection and Apple AirPlay2. Now I can play music and listen to podcasts and the sound without having to wear my headphones around all day. The bass is decent but if you want to get a rich sound I guess you have to add on the sub woofer which is available from Samsung. Regardless the sound quality is good enough for most applications and the unit looks as great as it sounds.
5,We had a Yamaha soundbar that gave our TV a huge upgrade in sound then we got the Samsung one which is far superior in quality.  My husband says it is much better quality and we actually don't have to have the volume up as high because of that.  The design is genius enhancing and heightening the dialog so that you can hear people speaking. Easy to use  connect and install.  Highly recommend
5,The setup for this speaker was really easy. The look of it is awesome too.The sound that comes out is really impressive seems like it would work well with most recording environments.The brand Samsung is something I've come to expect quality from and as usual this sound bar did not let me down.
1,Be prepared to "go it alone" regards getting the SB up and running properly. Try to change batteries in the remote. The ones that come with the SB are probably DOA. The sound is significantly better than the TV. It's also good for music using Bluetooth.Good luck.
1,When using Alexa soundbar turns off ARC thus the TV drops the connection. That means:1. TV's remote will not control the volume anymore.2. I got to select the ARC audio on my TV again if want to use the soundbar with TV.On top of this you cannot pair Samsung TV smart remote with the soundbar. That would allow me to use the same remote when e.g. TV is off.On Sonos Beam none of this is a problem. Even Samsung remote and Google Chromecast remote can control the soundbar volume.I was hoping to use this soundbar instead of Sonos and the advantage would be Bluetooth; My plan was to connect Google mini using Bluetooth which effectively makes the soundbar a Chromecast device. With Alexa on board i was supposed to get all in one device. Unfortunately this is all crap. Even when using Bluetooth you need to select the input. Sonos allows Ok Google to interrupt ARC. ARC signal interrupts Google Assistant playback. Samsung requires changing the input when wanting something else.Finally the app is crap - it's SmartThings takes time to get to the soundbar page and also there is no widget. Sonos widget and taskbar quick access is really useful.I still find my crappy setup better than this - it's Google Assistant on Sonos Beam and Amazon Echo next to it. Amazon echo is really small yet it has a 3" woofer which just is great for music with bass. Just imagine how bad this Samsung is when i decided to return it although it was 160$ on warehouse.Next thing to try is JBL Bar 5 as it's got both Chromecast and Alexa.
5,The top picture makes this soundbar look black.  It is not.  It’s gray.I have a small family room.  This soundbar is absolutely amazing.  I could not imagine the difference between just using the TV speakers as opposed to using a soundbar.  The difference is night and day.  You’re just encompassed in sound.Very easy to set-up / connect.  Wall mounting equipment included If you choose to mount it.
3,Got one as a Christmas gift and connected via optical to 32 inch Samsung TV in a small bedroom. The remote has adjustable settings for treble and bass but I was unable to hear any noticeable difference. Don't expect too much from this soundbar for the price although it does improve the built in TV sound
5,There's a lot of people saying this will play some connected voice audio that's supposedly very loud. Made me hesitant to purchase after reading that but didn't stop me and I went ahead to purchase. Boy was I glad to trust the instinct. Good audio. Very. Not spectacular like the sound bars you listen to and ur like woah  but for the price. Perfect. I wouldn't like any lesser quality or volume levels than this. I have a Samsung smart TV easily connects with the provided optical cable.
3,Very disappointed in this one. Setup was easy and some ability to tweak settings. It was an improvement over the tv's sound but not by much. It might work well for gaming or primarily music as the bass performance is not bad. But dialogue higher-pitched music such as classical or acoustic and it struggles. My husband actually asked me "didn't we get rid of this one a few years ago?" He thought it was our old Samsung that I had given away because it had similar issues.For the price I cannot recommend as I feel the sound quality is more on par with something that cost half as much.
3,For a sound bar in the $200 range this Samsung HW-S50A isn’t to bad but it also didn’t blow me away. It connected easily to my Sony TV without any issues. The sound quality is good not horrible but also not amazing. It’s better than the TV but not as good as my other sound at that was in the $300 range. This Samsung one doesn’t seam to fill the room with sound like my other one does. Basically you can tell exactly where the sound is coming from. Also when you get up to the highest volume settings it starts to sound really bad sort of staticky and crinkly.If you download the app you can tweak some of the settings but not very many. And the app has some glitchy issues on my iPhone as well. Its definitely not the best app I have ever used. Overall it really is just ok. Honestly I would spend the extra $100 on a better one.
1,The sound is delayed via Airplay (the reason I bought it) or Bluetooth. The volume control is terrible gets too loud or too low. Not recommended. Will return it
1,Love the sound but even when turned off it will say "digital audio in" every thirty minutes all night long. Returned first one second did same. Hours on phone with Samsung trying different things and no help.
1,Doesn't pair with tv so you have to have separate remote. Tv volume can't be on cause you get an echo. Can't see what the volume is when it's siting on the tv stand. I would not recommend
5,The best way to summarize this bar is it delivers sound you wish the TV had in its built-in speakers for the get-go. Since there's no subwoofer as part of this package you cannot expect authoritative very low frequency support for such signals that you find common in electronic dance music and movies/dramas. But woofer level of support is there and delivers reasonable oomph to make action movies much more entertaining that through most TV built-in speakers. I used the provided HDMI cable to connect the ARC ports for best possible sound potential.Setup like with all Samsung soundbars I set up couldn't be simpler. The remote is intuitive nice looking compact and has good range. Bluetooth connectivity was easy and rock solid. The fit and finish was great with the fabric outer layer but I wish there was a black color offered. The physical profile is flat enough to not occlude TV viewing.The high end frequency sound is not crisp I don't think detail is particularly great and there's some "boxed" in sounds in certain times. This model's the S50a but the available S6x has side horns that supposedly make the soundstage more expansive. But this is all OK for it's price point and why there are more expensive bars.Several different DSP sound profile settings are offered including Standard DTS Virtual X Adaptive and Music. Standard sounds almost monaural. DTS Virtual X is Xperi's proprietary object-based DSP and it can up mix even non DTS signals to provide an expansive/immersive "3D" sound effect. Adaptive like many is a good versatile option for many types of content.I wish there was a mini display like with other Samsung bars including some cheap ones that showed modes EQ adjustments etc. Having this S50a bar say the different sound modes out loud can awake others who are asleep in another room of an apartment.I got an excellent price for this and so overall I think this is an excellent value to have a simple single piece bar elevate sound to the way I would've liked the factory TV speakers to sound like. Final note for those considering adding a separate sub-woofer I recommend going with another Samsung bar that includes it as the price of the sub is so high that the combined price ends up much more expensive than the HW-Q600a bar that has a sub and Dolby Atmos (which this S50a doesn't) when a big sale is on and even more expensive than the HW-Q700a under a big sale which further has WiFi connectivity.
5,Great sound at a great price
5,Soooo easy to link to a Samsung TV and automatically paired to my Cox remote.  Clear and precise dialog from the adjustable center speaker.
5,Inconspicuous small footprint. Works best in movie mode but still packs a bit of a punch in other modes as well. Worth the purchase
5,Sound is great
5,I liked that it paired with my tv audio more of a full sound & I like the built in subwoofer affect
5,I'm just mad I waited so long to get one it totally changes your entertainment experience
5,Great for the cost
5,Love the sound and size perfect and easy to connect
5,Good sound. After reading the reviews about the voice on and off I did research updated the firmware and followed the directions for turning off the voice. Worked great. Paired automatically with my (very old) Samsung TV.  We're happy.
4,My daughter got one of these and then told me about it so I ordered one as well. I wouldn't have normally. but there was a great sale in place and I took advantage of it.I would have given this a 5 star review overall but for the folks at Samsung and the manual that came with the unit. The manual is a piece of paper with and there is another piece of paper included. The manual is so very poor. For instance it doesn't tell you how to raise and lower the volume. They refer to the volume control as a button - it's not. It's an on/off button that can also be pushed forward or backward to control volume.I called their tech support about this and they told initially me the unit I got was not one of their models. It went downhill fast from there. I called technical support before ordering the unit to find out if it was compatible with our TV and they said it was because we had an HDMI port on our TV - more incorrect info - you need a special kind of HDMI port and our Samsung TV doesn't have one. I had to use a digital audio cable to connect the unit to the TV.Forget about the "Alexa" feature. It probably works but I'm not willing to spend years trying to get an answer from them as to how to set it up.I rated the Bluetooth connectivity as 3 because I don't use it. I'm confident it works but there is little help to be had from Samsung in regard to this.
5,Only one day into using this soundbar and so far we like it. Sound clarity is very good and that's what we needed for our old ears.I waited until this morning to connect this expecting problems like I had with another soundbar. Used the HDMI ARC connection to my Samsung TV plugged it in and turned it on. Everything worked like magic. Grabbed my DISHnetwork remote to go through that process but I didn't have to!! Volume and mute buttons and everything worked with my DISH remote. I was amazed!!!The sound lacks some bass but that could be something I am not getting adjusted correctly. I love the sound coming from the front of the TV and love the clarity of speech since we are both hard of hearing.I haven't figured out the Alexa part yet but I will. We have dots and Echo Shows throughout the house.This was a great buy for us and I hope it works problem free for a long time.Oh I don't like the color and wish the unit came in black.
5,After some extensive research review-reading and actual testing I've finally decided on this soundbar. It's no replacement for a full 2.1 setup with a dedicated subwoofer but for my situation it gets the job done nicely. The sound is very clear (with no distortion at max volume). I would recommend keeping the Bass set to max or near-max levels for the most "full" sound.Background: I was specifically looking for an all-in-one soundbar (with woofers for that nice bass) for my small room in a shared house. One with a stand-alone subwoofer seemed to be overkill but I also didn't want to spend too much for a very temporary living situation. I could've gone with a full 2.1 setup for roughly the same price off of OfferUp but I loved the look of this bar and I got it for $110 off of Amazon Warehouse deals in essentially new condition.
5,Easy to set up works great paired with my Samsung tv
5,Great sound
5,2 minutes to hook up. Perfect synchronization with the tv. Amazing sound
5,This is the soundbar you want.  I tried a cheaper brand but all I wanted was for the soundbar to be controlled by the smart remote of my 2020 32" 4k bedroom TV.  I wanted to use only one remote.The cheap soundbar sounded nice but it would not link with the TV or remote and required 2 remotes laying around on the bed.  I guess I was unlucky enough to pick the one brand that would not link up to my new high tech TV no matter what I tried.  So I bought this Samsung.Before I even hooked it up I followed the instructions and downloaded the latest firmware to an empty thumb drive.  I did the step by step instructions and watched the lights blink.  I even tried it twice just to make sure.  It must of worked because I was able to silence the loud annoying voice control.Go to the Samsung website for all the FAQ's and tips on how to set up the soundbar.  Plus Samsung's Tech Support is top notch especially if you've bought and registered some of their other products.I hooked mine up with the optical cable turned on the TV and it linked right up.  You'll need the soundbar remote that came with it for the first time as you adjust the original settings like the annoying voice and other things in the instructions.  Then just pull the batteries out of it because it linked right up with the TV and  TV remote for both power on and off and volume.The TV speakers in the Q series TV are pretty good but this soundbar is better.  Lower lows.  Plus it more defines a center speaker for voice.  Turn up the volume and it become very dynamic.A tip not found in the FAQ's.  When you turn on the TV with the remote first thing in the day you notice a blue "on" light on the soundbar.  But when you turn the TV off for the night you don't get the red "off" lightThat's because the soundbar goes into "standby" mode for 20 minutes before it completely powers down until the next time you turn on the TV.I couldn't be happier.  More money but it works perfect with my Samsung Q.
4,I feel cheated on this product (or seller) the listing clearly stated it has Dolby Atmos. I suspected it is too good to be true at this price point. I was right.However If you just want a 3 channel sound bar this will not let you down. The sound is full and bass is really good.
4,Expected more control over the bass output. The is a setting but not deep enough. Other than that great sound and pairs well with the 4K Samsung TV in the Den
5,I got this for better sound quality on my Fire TV. The room I have the setup in isn’t very big so this is perfect even more than needed.For a couple of gripes on other reviews:My sound bar came out of the box with the firmware up to date and I was able to turn off the voice over.
4,I was not expecting much from this soundbar as it is for our guest room. Boy was I wrong. The depth of the sound and the clarity of the spoken word is well above expectations. I was not looking for the thump so a subwoofer was not required and after listening not really missed. Okay it is not a true atmos speaker. What it is will more than surprise you and you will not be disappointed. Just do the research and see what features are real breakers and decide from there. We did and it more than checks off all the boxes
4,Simple to install and pair good sound quality and good looking piece
2,Sound bar keeps going off while trying to watch TV. Called customer service they said send it back
4,It has good sound and was easy to set up. Just went to my local home depot to buy a pair of wall mount screws. Installed it and set it up in less than an hour. Got a nice discount on this for black friday.
5,Better sound then I thought it would have considering the cost is so low
4,It would be better if it had a woofer unit.
5,Love the size and sound. This is under a 65in tv and it hides the wires behind it as an added plus!
5,This soundbar is smaller than most others (which is great because it actually fits between the feet on my TV rather than having to sit well in front of it). It also does not come with a separate subwoofer.That said it provides full robust sound even with deeper/lower audio. I’ve seen other reviews stating that it’s good for smaller spaces. I do have a somewhat smaller living room so it does sound very good.Easy to connect. Worked with my Fire TV and remote seamlessly.
5,Works great
5,The sound quality is great for the price.  Has a nice appealing look
1,This is just a sounder there are no speakers as the photos suggests.  So misleading!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,The package arrived looking like it was kicked all the way to my house. Everything inside had been opened and then tossed back in EXCEPT THE REMOTE.Chatted with Amazon CS and the only option is to buy another one myself and then contact them and ask for a refund. Yeah that sounds like a great plan. Amazon handing out freebies days after the original mistake with no proof but my word based off a chat a week go with a useless CSR.The soundbar itself was quick and easy to hook up to my Samsung TV via Bluetooth. The sound is the boost needed to makeup for Samsung TV's mediocre speakers.
5,We were looking for a new sound bar to go with our Samsung Frame TV and the Samsung site matches this Soundbar with the TV. Purchased the light gray (almost white) because it goes better with white wall. Sound is phenomenal and many times better than the Bose soundbar it replaced. The only negative is they put a powerblock midway on the cord that makes it harder to hid the cord. I just ran a extension cord up to the TV and hid the block behind the TV. As you can see by the photo I have finished hiding my cords but should have it done this week. Highly recommend the soundbar!

4,Very decent soundscape that draws you in though as plenty other reviewers have pointed out it (entirely) lacks bass. The voice enhancement feature does its job well - it makes the sound quite flat though but if you struggle hearing dialogue and your priority in buying a soundbar is to aid you with this this is a good option for you.It's so-so for music. Build is nice. Remote is good.I would not pay $330 for this item but it has gone on sale regularly to $200 which is a good price for it.
4,Easy to set up
2,This soundbar claims to be 5 channels and it may process audio like that but in reality if the audio channels aren't coming from different physical locations then you aren't experiencing surround sound.  I knew that when I bought it but I thought the audio quality would at least be good enough. There is no bass at all even for soundbars that don't have a seperate woofer.And annoyingly it has a bright blue LED light that is always on to signify the soundbar is connected.  There is no option to disable it.
4,Tried this with fiber optic connection to TV with mixed results. Could not figure out how to control the volume through the tv but as soon as I hooked it up with a HDMI (One came with the product) it worked as expected. I did not try bluetooth.
4,Set up was easy. Installation was easy with Smart Things. TV had a visual guide of where to put the sound bar (Samsung TV). Sound is great and even in Night Mode! Controls work really easy across different Samsung devices! Would def recommend!!
5,I just received this yesterday.  I'm hard of hearing and have tinnitus so it's hard for me to make out words sometimes.  I have a Samsung TV that I love but the audio on it is horrible.This sound bar delivers very clear audio even at low volumes.  I love that I don't have to blast it to understand what they are saying.
4,I've had the Samsung Q80R in my living room for some time now and have been thrilled with it.  After that positive experience and wanting to replace the Sony 8500 in my room with something with a discrete center channel I decided to give the S60A a try and I was not disappointed.First off make no mistake this is a rather small soundbar without a subwoofer and as such you're not going to rattle the rafters with it.  That said it punches way above its weight class.Movies: The S60A does remarkably well for a non Dolby Atmos soundbar.  No it's not as immersive as Samsung's Q series but it's also not nearly as expensive.  I started out with Avengers: Endgame using Adaptive Sound mode and right off the bat dialogue was crystal clear while both the soundtrack and sound FX created a very nice soundstage so good in fact that it was far better in nearly every respect than the Sony 8500.  Next I tried Midway (2019) and I was equally happy.  In this case the Sony did a bit better with sound FX and creating a more 3 dimensional sound but the dialogue being clear and understandable trump's this with ease.Music: The S60A really shines here in Standard mode both from Bluetooth and using an Echo over WiFi.  Having a 7 band equalizer comes in handy here.  Naturally you're not going to get earth shaking bass but the frequency response is very good across the board and the soundstage seems to be much wider than the bar itself.If there is one bigger drawback to the S60A it's the lack of bass below about 100Hz.  For me this works to my advantage as it's in a smaller room and used primarily at night.Pros-* Awesome frequency response* Smart Things app is comprehensive and easy to setup* Large soundstage from a small soundbar* Discrete center channel makes dialogue shine throughCons-* No Dolby Atmos support* Lacks impactful bass below 100Hz* Works best in smaller roomsAll in all for the money I've yet to come across a better stand alone soundbar.  The S60A handily eclipses the Denon 216 Polk Signa S2 and Sony HTX 8500.  If you're looking for more from a soundbar look at the Samsung Q series but if you're looking for simple easy and affordable the S60A is certainly worth a look.Update:Since my initial review I've rearranged the room to where the TV and soundbar sit roughly halfway between the two walls and the depth of sound from the S60A has gone up dramatically.  It's still not Atmos but it outperforms the Sony 8500 which does support Atmos on every level.  I am beyond impressed for the performance per dollar that the S60A provides.
5,Very nice sound bar
5,Great sound bar for bedrooms!
5,Responde muy bien a los comandos de voz y la calidad de audio es excelente para su precio es una excelente opción en todo sentido
4,Si tienes una TV Samsung como en mi caso que tengo una Q oled de 50 pulgadas es una excelente alternativa. Se conecta muy fácil se integra muy bien con la TV. Mejora sustancialmente el sonido que viene de fábrica. Estoy satisfecho
4,Klang:Mir am wichtigsten: Der Sound den die HW-S60A liefert ist sehr gut. Und die Sprachwiedergabe ist sehr qualitätvoll was vor allem bei textlastigen Sendungen/Filmen ein klares Plus ist.Verarbeitung:Insgesamt ordentlich. Aber der Stoffbezug der Soundbar ist ein Staubfänger.Einrichtung/Installation:War bei mir etwas mühsam. Musste mehrfach versuchen die Soundbar zum Laufen zu bringen. Zumal sie sich nicht mit meiner Fritzbox 7590 die direkt daneben steht verträgt. Auch der Support von Samsung konnte mir da nicht weiterhelfen. Über einen devolo-Adapter ein Zimmer weiter funktionierte dann die Einrichtung/Anbindung ans Netz. Keine Ahnung wieso Samsung nicht in der Lage ist eine Fritzbox zu unterstützen?!Was wirklich nervt:Man kann optional "Audio-Feedback" nutzen. Eigentlich eine sehr gute Sache weil einem damit über eine Stimme z.B. kurz mitgeteilt wird welchen Wiedergabemodus (Musik Sprache) man gerade nutzt etc. Das erleichtert die Nutzung der Fernbedienung. Allerdings ist die Lautstärke für das Audio-Feedback nicht separat einstellbar (wurde auch vom Samsung-Support auf meine Rückfrage hin bestätigt). Das heißt wenn man einen Actionfilm in großer Lautstärke ansieht und einen anderen Modus einstellt erhält man bei aktiviertem "Audio-Feedback" eine Rückmeldung in einer Lautstärke die einen fast vom Sessel weht. Ich hab die eigentlich nützliche aber schlecht umgesetzte Funktion daher deaktiviert um nicht ungewollt abzuheben.
