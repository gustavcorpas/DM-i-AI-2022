5,The Sony tv has an excellent picture and works as advertised. It was easy to get our streaming services operating. The remote is rather crude and has no backlighting which makes it challenging for me to use but it does work.
5,Upholds Sony’s reputation of quality and sharpness.  Natural vivid color and sharpness. Remote is easy and intuitive to use. When time to replace main TV we’ll get another Sony.
3,Purchased this 32 inch screen as a replacement for son. I try to purchase one brand throughout house so I’ve only purchased RCA and Samsung TVs. My son games so after researching reviews I said why not. I am glad that we did. The picture is beautiful and my son likes the Roku features. I had a great experience and no problems receiving item. I did notice that the bezel on the top was somewhat lose but the tv works fine.
5,I have a 55 inch version of this Sony tv. Happy with the purchase. Needed a smaller tv for the bedroom. It did not disappoint.
5,Great image and sound quality If you are looking for a small HDTV this is certainly the best choice;
5,I love my Sony TV
5,This TV has a great picture and very good sound. Perfect for our kitchen area just the right size.
2,We are having to return this TV and buy it again.  The lips of people on the TV aren’t syncing with the words.  We are disappointed at having to return it in less than a month of purchasing it.
2,Have a defect  in screen working with Sony to replace
3,I deducted 2 stars because at this price this 2022 Sony TV really should be 1080p instead of 720p there really should be HDMI CEC (Sony calls this Bravia Sync) and because the remote control is way too long. There's a lot of empty space. The remote takes up more space on your table than it has to.The TV is very easy to set up from start to finish. It's a nice-looking TV and seems of good build quality. If you input a high-quality signal into the HDMI port you'll be very happy with the picture.The speaker quality on this TV is perfectly fine.
1,This product is awful. I needed a replacement for a Sony Wega that was too small. Since it’s hard to find new 32 inch TVs and Sony is a good brand I own other Sony devices I bought this unaware how inferior Bravia models are to WEGA . One site indicated  Bravia could be hooked up to a DVD/VCR player recorder but was completely misleading.  After spending enormous amounts of money to getting second installation because I thought the initial one was simply wrong discovered it really did not have enough attachments equipped to record. Also HdMI externals are so mixed up they intercept different functions.  One seems to be not functional.  If I select player another function pops up.Had I known I could not record I would never have purchased. By the time I waited for two different technicians  I went past the time I could return so now I’m stuck.  I wish I had purchased a larger Wega before.  Manufacturers get worse not better with newer models.
5,The one I bought only a year ago broke so I got a Sony which has served me for decades as my main tv.  Very easy to install.
5,A great picture with Bluetooth and WiFi. Always had great success with Sony products.
3,It's not as intuitive as I thought it would be
