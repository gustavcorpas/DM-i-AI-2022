5,The security system itself is cool  the concept. Pretty self explanatory on how to hang up the cameras .. connect the wires. Customer service was awesome Hugo Cruz helped me set up my system on my phone. He was very helpful and Knowledable.
5,This Annke product is great for the money. I bought the 8 channel system  but it only had 4 cameras. So bought 4 more cameras and it covers my whole house. Took me a good afternoon to run the wires and place the cameras. I have had the system for a couple of years now and using the app for my phone I can always see what is happening at my house. Just added a high gain pic-up mic so now I have sound. One regret. The 2mp cameras are just that. 2mp. If I every change out this system I will definitely go for 5mp or more. For the money the image is good and the system works good. I installed a pull box and ran the wires in a group along the wall  as it was the most convenient and fastest way to get started.  One more thing. The user interface is really deep. I expected some kind of learning curve but it is a simple and easy system to work. Has great playback and record features. The included program is very customizable. You could do worse spending more for less. On a budget it is well worth it for full video security.
5,Hugo is the BEST super patient and great to work with.
5,This is a great product and great customer service and Hugo was great for helping me.
5,I like it better then my last set up which was a Swann
5,
4,I just received it. It was easy to setup. Tested all cameras there wasn’t any issue. The picture quality is not bad. Night vision is not with good quality. The app is good. Also you have an option for IP cameras. Overall good product for the price.
4,Being that we originally did not use all the connectors we did not realize that there was a few broken. Today we tried to add cameras and realized that 2 out of the 8 didn't work on the box. I would highly suggest that you check all the connectors if u do decide to purchase these cameras
4,After several  attempts to connect My  Annke  DVR to My Internet/Router by Ethernet of course nothing worked . I even tried all the suggestions from you tube .Finally I gave in and made the dreaded phone call to Tech Support. Knowing I was going be on hold forever and  probably get a Support person who would not understand Me.Well' I got so lucky " The call was answered right away and the second thing I got lucky on was I got Tech Help Representative ( Stephani Venegas )  on the phone. She was Articulate Knowledgeable  Patient  and had My DVR connected in Minutes.I like Annke Products  but now  I really like them for Tech Support.
4,I gave it a 4 star. Not a good manual for set up. I used you tube and figured things out on my own. I just got it today and it was very easy to put together and get it recording But setting the clock is where I had to figure out how to. The device came with all the wires for the cameras and a HDMI cable along with a mouse and ethernet cable. My monitor uses a VGA cable and the DVR has the port so that worked great. Very clear picture. The manual is what sucks.... Once I learn to go online I will do a you tube video for the dummy which is me....
4,I had done quite a bit of research to find the right system for me.  I had bought a few IP cameras in the past and found them to be difficult to setup or operate (much of it was the "lost in translation" instructions) and generally not intuitive.  This purchase was my first "system" with DVR and multiple cameras.  I was looking for a system with hard wired cameras because I live in a "Morton house" (basically a metal barn with living quarters) and I worried about wifi signal and range.  I was also looking for a system that had a fairly large storage capacity DVR because living out in the sticks can sometimes present internet issues and I didn't want to rely on internet alone.I got this system in early June (2019) and have found it quite satisfactory.  Setup of the DVR and cameras was pretty easy.  I will say that looking through some of the menus on the DVR (mouse driven drop-down menus on screen [screen not included old computer monitor works Tv etc]) is a little daunting but I find that for the most part everything is mostly defaulted to work fine as is.  The app was easy to install and use as well.  I love being able to not only peak from anywhere (on my phone) but also watch recorded footage on the mobile as well.  Camera quality is adequate.  I have noticed that the quality looks worse on mobile live mode than it actually is when you play it back (recorded footage).  You can snap pictures and capture videos with the app on your cell phone (came in handy a few times already).  It comes with 4 cameras which I thought would be more than enough for my house but I have since added another and may be adding another yet.  Adding more cameras is easy too.  All you will need is another power splitter (comes w/ 4 way I ordered an 8 way so I could expand up to the full amount of cameras if needed).  And descent cameras can be purchased for a $30 or less.  Overall I am quite happy with the system.  I purchased mine for under $200 and feel like it was well worth it.
4,The cameras clearly caught a kid walking in my freshly laid concrete and his parents weren't happy with him. Fortunately the pour hadn't set and I was able to smooth out his prints.When the road crew were doing a shave and pave a asphalt loaded 20-ton dump truck drove over the end of my week-old driveway destroying a four-foot by 12-foot section. The driver got out of his truck kicked a piece of the driveway and drove off. When I confronted the road-crew supervisor he accused me of doing it. I forwarded a copy of the video of the dump truck driver driving you can even see him on his phone in the driver's seat as he drove over my driveway to the owner of the paving company and of the supervisor blaming me.My new driveway is being installed next week and being paid for by the paving company and the supervisor and dump truck driver will be visiting me when the job is complete to apologize.So in a way the system paid for itself.
4,No audio no color at night
4,Decent for the $. 1 of the 4 cameras that came with has  something wrong with the picture but it still works .funny how the day after I installed this  the price dropped by 30$. Aggravating but is what it is. I'm pretty sure these guys data*mining plays with prices based on your search history of certain items. This is probably the 15th time I've seen this happen.... I've screenshot other items before certain sale days. And on the sale day the price is raised by 30% while advertising 25% off....  ppl need to be aware of this even tho I'm 99.999% sure this review will be flagged.  All in all a good product but I have a hard time believing  these cameras are 5mp. When the same replacements  here on Amazon are advertised as 2mp.  Again buyer beware. Am I upset. Not really. Its more annoying then anything... hopefully so.eone ready this and sends 1 camera to replace the one with the rainbow moving across from right to left. NOW I'm done complaining. Its a decent item but more so for the sale price. If I had paid 150$ I'd be content but for 189 its slightly annoying. Its only a few days old so **subject to change*** will post an update in a month or two.
4,The night vision is clear & even with a large change in lighting quality from my porch into the dark you are still able to clearly see anything in my yard. The motion detector is top of the line. You draw a line with the mouse indicating the motion line you then choose a direction or select where it will alarm Any time the line is broken. It also has a doorway threshold alarm. You draw a box around any door & same as with the line choose a direction travel should not be going or both. It has alarms for motion detector voice recognition cameras being tampered with view obstruction lose of internet connection excessive heat warning & a lot more.
5,I bought this four years ago and often had a hard time operating it. I would often have to click buttons multiple times before they worked and sometimes it would take multiple tries to draw the unlock pattern because it rejected my attempts claiming I had drawn the wrong pattern. I thought it was a problem with the unit and I had been told that these cheaper systems can be glitchy.I recently realized that the mouse was the problem the whole time. I bought an $8 USB mouse on Amazon and all of the problems disappeared.As far as the video it takes I'm very happy with the quality of the video even if it's in a weird format. (It includes a tiny app to play it but VLC media player also plays it just fine.)I haven't played with the motion detector yet and I don't have it hooked up to the internet so I can't comment on that.I had to have help configuring it after it was installed and the included instructions were no help at all. I really had to play with it a bit to learn how to operate it.All told I highly recommend this if you need an inexpensive camera system just do yourself a favor and upgrade the mouse.
5,This 1 TB system is in my opinion one of the best starter security cam systems available! Easy AF to install set up and have it completed in less than a day! Can't go wrong with this system!
5,Put the cameras up and everything was working amazing but then all of the sudden one of the cables just completely stopped working. I tried it with different cameras and you could hear them power up but that was it. No image on my phone or computer screen. After re-running another wire to the same camera everything started working as it should. I checked for bad places in the wires or places where the wires could have snagged and nothing but they still would not work. Tried to contact someone about the problem but couldn’t figure out how to get in touch with the seller. But other than that everything works great!*UPDATE* 5/12/22The hdmi port went out in the my dvr box and it took me forever to figure out that the problem was with the port. I contacted support and after they helped me figure out the problem was with the hdmi port they offered to send me a new dvr and they read my review and offered a new BNC cable as well as two extra cameras as compensation. Great company and I would highly recommend!
4,So I received the cameras yesterday and it included everything advertised so I was happy about that . I read some of the reviews before I received them and some mentioned the camera hood that protects them from the weather was made out of plastic  not sure if they upgraded but mines are made out of metal . The dvr is smaller than expected which I like and I ordered mine preloaded with the 1tb hard drive . It took me 2 hours to set all 4 cameras outside  and runing the wires through the attic . I wall fished all the camera wires down one of the  master bedroom wall and connected to the dvr.  Im using a 19 inch tv as a monitor connected using  the HDMI . Once you connect to your router via Ethernet is just a matter of setting up by following the prompts and downloading the app for my iPhone for remote viewing . You will need to go into your router set up page to port forward in order to acces the cams from the app . For Comcast /xfinity gateways use 10.0.01 and unless you have change it  username will be "admin" and password " password " . If you do not know how to to this  just search it online (YouTube ) there are plenty of tutorials that will guide you through this process .I have mine set to record 24 hrs selecting the "override" option so it starts to record over old video once is full . I also set some alerts that will send me an email once the camera detects movement in a specified area of coverage . The email needs to be set up using the smtp server for your email provider . Also check online if you don't know how to do this .  I will change those settings later to record on a schedule but for now I'll leave it as is .The quality of the picture is not the greatest but I'm ok with that considering I paid less than $160 for the kit . The black and white night mode is clear enough (will post pics later )  I will probably upgrade the cameras later on . I am posting some pictures from the monitor and others from the app on my phone . ( some options from the app are not available for this cameras  for example the app will show options to zoom or move the camera but this does not apply for this set ) however when viewing from dvr   with the mouse you can click and select and area  in the image and it will enlarge it .Overall I'm happy with this purchase . I was finished with the install  dvr and remote access setup in less than 4hrs .
4,I bought the 8 channel Annke with 4 cameras and added 4 more. Its been up and running for a little over a year without a single problem. I have all cameras recording constantly and I am able to pull up video as far back as about 11 or 12 days if needed. I have it on a designated monitor in my shop and use the app for monitoring while away. I  highly recomd it for the money. Never had to use support yet.
4,For basic system the price is great and it has far exceeded my expectations. Easy set-up and starting. Instructions are fairly easy to follow however it doesn't cover everything the DVR is capable of. Am still trying to figure out a couple of things. The camera is clear and video quality are great. The smart playback is very useful and exporting has been a breeze. I do wish there was a volume for the alarm. Now this is the light edition I'm sure the full edition has many more options. But this edition offers simplistic interface with enough options for most users. Would recommend to those not looking for tons of bells and whistles.
4,When I received this system and took everything out of the box I have to say it was a bit overwhelming. But as I dug into it and seperated everything it got easier. One thing I disliked is the print on all the instructions are very small and hard to read it must have been printed by 25 year old LOL. The hardest part was mounting the cameras and running the wires to the unit. After that this setup is easy on the inside. After I got DVR connected to the internet the unit seemed to configure itself mostly. The unit works awesome as you can see by the picture night vision is good looks amazing during the day in full color. The only issue I am having is finding out how to adjust the sensitivity of the motion detector. This thing comes set super sensitive even bugs set it off and if you have push notifications set your phone it will drive you nuts with alerts. I’m sure I will figure it out if not I will contact them. My home feels so much safer now  when I’m away I recommend this unit to anyone that leaves your home alone a lot. Just take your time get your magnifying glass for the instructions and Go ;-)
4,Works good.  Nice hearty little system.  Install was a pain but that's always the case with a wired system.  I was able to stick the cable in between my soffit and the house siding as the cable is fairly small.  Cable is only about the size of a 10-12 AWG wire. Picture is pretty good. you're not going to be able to read a license plate with it but you see enough to know who and what's going on.  The software on the DVR box is nice it is a bit involved and if you're not good with computers you may have a problem.  I'm pretty tech savvy and it took me about a week to get comfortable with the layout and am still discovering new things on it.  I will say this the motion alarm on it is useless at night.  This is due to the fact of the amount of moths coming up to say hello to the camera I assume that they can see the infrared lighting the way they swarm to it.  It will constantly set the motion alarm off.  I have even put the motion detect setting on lowest sensitivity and also set it up to 200 secs and it still goes nuts.  Motion alarm still goes off frequently during the day but not nearly as much as night.  Even at the 200 secs setting it still picks up something moving if its moving for less than 10 secs so don't know how that makes any sense.  But the motion alarm is a crucial thing to keep on because you can scroll through the footage based on motion alarm events.  I also set it up to send an e-mail when there is motion which is awesome.  Just don't go running to your home because it detected motion most likely a false alarm. The mobile app is a nice perk.  Can see each of the 4 cameras from it and connects pretty quickly.  The only negative thing I have to say about the mobile app is the remote playback feature.  If you scroll to a specific time of day when the picture loads it displays exactly one hour ahead of the time you picked.  Not a huge deal just annoying.Overall this is a nice inexpensive solution.  For the price you can't beat it.  It's alot better than what I had before which is nothing.
4,Having a husband who works with wires it was a very easy install through the attic and it works great. Then I imagine it’s good enough to see the chickens at night and everything in front of the house as well as the back. The downside is that the sensitivity settings are a little much because it does pick up every car that passes the front of the house. Also there is no sound on this so anyone wanting to purchase it would need to consider that but the quality is a lot better than expected and it works really nice. We check it all the time when we’re away from the house and we can see if it’s raining as well as most other small details. The other downside I would note is the app. On the DVR itself on the TV you can fast forward to check some stuff but on the app you cannot fast-forward so you have to sit there and watch it all the way through or you can skip to a certain part until that’s the part you wanted to see. but you can’t do a fast speed setting on the app just the tv.
5,Me agrado que fue fácil de instalarlas y que funcionen bien. Las utilize para la seguridad de mi hogar gracias.
4,I waited to post about this video system until I had some time with it and I would say " for the money" It is a good bargain. The video quality is good and bright and the low light visibility is good. During the day the picture is bright and clear. It records all channels ( I currently have 3 cameras installed ) but you can only watch 2 simultaneously during playback. The interface ( menu ) is pretty straightforward for the basics: playback etc. but there is ALOT of settings in the menu that you may or may not use. NOW the set up of remote viewing looks VERY complicated and I have not even attempted to connect with the phone app or via remote computer. As many others have said the manual is VERY BADLY written and not very clear at all. Luckily the initial setup is pretty much "plug and play". Beyond that good luck!!It is very easy to playback and view switch between camera view advance thru the video etc. I use this system to record and monitor the back of our building which backs up to a very well traveled alley in the downtown area so there is alot of trash vandalism etc. that we want to be aware of should problems arise. You can look at the two pics i took from the live feed.and judge for yourself. Now I do think you should be aware of a few things that could be a problem for you: The cameras are plastic and they DO NOT articulate SIDE TO SIDE!! They only adjust up and down so if you need to turn the camera left or right the picture will be tilted. I solved the problem by mounting them on a metal L bracket designed for deck construction and just attached the camera to one end and "bent" the metal to the left or right assuring my video picture would be level.  It has rained several times and other than a little foggy lens the cameras worked fine. I would say if you want an inexpensive security system this would work great but I would consider a camera that articulates fully!
4,I had bought this to use with existing wired cameras from when my 8 yr old Qsee head unit was killed by a thunder strike.  I am just now cycling out the 11 yr old cameras for the 2MP IP66 cameras that came in this package so no feedback yet on the cameras themselves. They feel very light tho compared to what I am replacing. The head unit works as it should and the set up was easy (but hey I work in IT... ) once I played email tag with Annke support over software challenges for this head unit.  I am using the iVMS-4200 Client.  Viewing on my cellphone was easy to set up as well.  I did give up on trying to get email alerts for motion detection activities.
5,Hugo was a great help setting up I am not good with electronics and he made it happen thank you
5,During setup I had a small issue but after a brief call in to tech support Hugo had me up in running in a few moments. Highly recommend Annke
4,The video quality is fair. The option they give you to blow up and look more closely at something is worthless as it does allow you to blow up the picture however it doesn’t compensate for the pixel loss!  Not having audio set up in each microphone is a bit frustrating as well. But the most aggravating of all is the fact that this company has decided to be most arrogant by not providing a customer support number. You can’t find one online or in the paperwork . So assuming that your one computer is working and not broke oh yeah I don’t have a computer. OK let’s see maybe an iPad if it’s working oh yeah it’s not! That leaves my little  phone they have to manage the complicated pain in the neck form that you have to fill out and after you click submit you are left with a blank page and not even a message that says thank you someone will get back in touch with you. I didn’t even get a message saying that they had received the message. Had I known that this company was so arrogant to not even provide a customer service number I would not of even brought their product!
5,I had researched camera systems for the last year for the outside of my home. I stumbled upon these and based upon the reviews I purchased them. They sat on the dining room table before being installed and of course someone broke into my house and walked right by the box so that same day I installed them. They were so good I bought a whole other set for my mothers house. I mounted them on the outside of my house and drilled through the concrete in order to hide the wires which I ran throughout the attic. I also placed the hard drive in the attic in case someone broke again it would take a little more effort to climb into the attic and take the hard drive with them. I can't say enough about the night vision on these cameras. They are crystal clear at night from far and up close. During the day the quality is superb. I looked at systems that were hundreds if not thousands of dollars and am glad that I purchased these. The mobile app works great as well. I've had them in for about a month and have not had one issue yet. Only thing I recommend is to order the male female adapters and extra cable for larger houses. My house is 2400sqft and on two of the cameras due to the location they were mounted I was short about a foot of cable. I also plan to run wire under the ground and mount a camera on the tree facing the rear of the house.
4,Ill try and make this quick. The camera assembly is plastic but it feels sturdy. Installation was easy I had to buy an extra extension for the camera cable because of where I mounted one of them but the picture is very good for the price of this system. Night or day you can tell what you're looking at. The DVR system is very easy to setup and navigate through. The main reason I bought this camera (Obviously for security reasons) but so I could monitor the house remotely when I wasnt home. The Mobile app for the iPhone doesnt work unless you're on the network the DVR is connected to. Once in a blue moon it will work when Im out on LTE. The web based viewing platform doesnt work with Google Chrome however it works perfect with Mozilla Firefox. Lets you have a live stream of your cameras and access to remote playback features. Also I can view the system remotely perfectly from my Amazon Fire Tablet when Im out of town which is nice as long as Im on Wifi. Just wished the mobile app worked well. Customer service was so so I contacted them twice for different issues they responded quickly for the first issue but the second issue has yet to receive a response though I have solved it on my own.Pros - Cheap great cameras easy to install works as advertised.Cons - Phone Mobile App doesnt work well web based platform doesnt work with most internet browsers could probably work on the customer service.Bottom line I would recommend this product for anyone who needs surveillance equipment for their home/business.
4,This is a good basic starter system. I had an older 4 channel unit five years ago and the 150 gig hard drive just froze. The cameras are starting to loose its color and a couple already have distorted images on one side. I still plan to use my old cameras until it's time to change them. This unit came with a 1 TB (Western Digital) hard drive which I had to email Sannce to confirm since a few reviews mentioned that theirs had no HDD. I was assured that a 1 TB HDD came with my order.This is simple to set up and the only time it took me awhile was getting the mobile app running. I found out the hard way that I had to disable the "3rd party app" on my phone security settings to "allow" in order for it to download. I've had this for about a week now and the only gripe I have is that occasionally I get a network busy message when trying to access using 4G. Error code 10005 shows under "more detail" (hence the 4 star). I have not contacted tech support but will soon. The cameras are way clearer than my old units (as expected). I might need to get a bigger monitor/screen from 8 inch to maybe 20 inches since the letters are really small when trying to maneuver on the settings plus there are now 8 cameras vice 4. Unless you want to spend hundreds more don't bother changing this if you get one since 99% of all these gadgets are made in China. Quality and dependability are still much to be desired.
4,I am happy on the quality of the picture at this low price.The quality of the cameras are good The brightness of the screen makes the camera very good and easy to see the outside. I can download app to connect with the system so I can see this all day and not worry about anything.I highly recommend this security camera!
4,Our existing CCTV system died and we needed a replacement unit fast. Shipping was estimated at 4-5 days out but it actually arrived the next day. It works well with our existing cameras and we were able to add 4 more angles by installing the 4 cameras that came with the unit. So far so good hope we never need to review any activity on the hard drive but will be easy to do if needed.
5,I’ve had these cameras up for at least 3 years now maybe a little longer and they have worked flawlessly so far. It’s never been turned off the system has ran day and night for years and still going strong. I have a small flat screen it’s hooked up to and it’s connected to the internet so u can view it on a mobile device as well. The motion detector will send snap shots to an email address so if the worst was to happen and someone stole ur system there will be back up images stored online.
5,I love this system and would buy again if i had better luck on this earth but i just simply dont and thats okay.
5,I purchased this system to replace an ANNKE system I bought 6 years ago. I ran the wires for 7 cameras back them and am delighted that I was able to use the already installed cable with the new DVR and cameras. I have purchased 3 more single cameras so I can replace all cameras.The installation of the new DW81KD DVR was very each as was replacing the old cameras with the new ones.  It was a snap plug & play. The new cameras with improved night vision and motion detection are great.Along the way I had several questions about compatibility and configuration.  I chatted several times with the ANNKE Customer Support Team and received fast and accurate support.I am impressed with the quality of products and services ANNKE provided to me! The system performs as advertised and as expected.
5,The Annke comes with four cameras as described. I can't say anything new that hasn't been said but will add a tip. At the base of each camera is a handy swivel but it swivels in one dimension say side to side/up down. If you need to redirect the camera in another direction after securing it to a rafter or whatever your out of luck. At the base of the camera there is a nubbed disc that can be rotated but its purpose is to lock down the rest of the camera. That said be certain that the viewing angle of the swivel is in a plane of the area you want to cover when positioning and BEFORE screwing into the wood. What I did was attach one screw to hold the camera in place and then rotate the unit to view the area I wanted for surveillance. Hope this helps.
2,I purchased this because I didn't want to pay for any subscription. But this thing only lasted for ONE YEAR only. I bought this to replace my older camera which was way cheaper and lasted for at 3 years straight. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY GETTING THIS.
5,Was extremely surprised at how good the picture is. Will be buying 4 more cameras to complete the system.This is a perfect system for a single family home garage shop or small business. I highly recommend this setup.
5,It works great my home feels secure and I can monitor it away on my phone. I love it
5,Bought this kit due to its inexpensive price for monitoring our parking lot for any suspicious activity after hours.  Cannot read license plates but I wasn't expecting that.  Easy installation software is easy to use.  Doesn't have a Wi-Fi interface but I wired to our network switch so I can access the DVR from anywhere.  I was really surprised and happy with the results.  The  cameras are cheap but was expected.  I also get notifications on my phone when motion is detected.
3,Not easy manual.pictue not clear. Not worthy
3,The views should’ve been wider
5,Seriously pleasantly surprised with the quality of this product. It's exactly what I was looking for and has proved it's self to be worth the money it cost. The night vision is great. Installation can be done by you takes a little bit of thinking about how you want to run the wires but doesn't require electrian level skills.
5,Bought this to replace an older system with the same wire set up one power and the other video. My plan was to use all the new components except the wires I wanted to use my old wires. Didn’t work out that way. Wouldn’t work with my old wires. I had to pull the new wires that was included and everything worked perfectly. I ended up having to buy additional wires to get a 200 ft run.My opinion you can look at video systems until you’re blue in the face. Don’t think you can go wrong on this one.
1,I just tried to export some video to a USB drive.  COMPLETE FAILURE!!!!I witnessed some activity of interest and wished to save that video to USB. So I tried exporting it.  It not only did not write a video file it CORRUPTED THE USB STICK!!!  I tried exporting in multiple ways formatting the USB (FAT32) using their utility etc.  Nothing works!  The error messages in the log state that they DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR OWN VIDEO FORMAT!!!  THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE DOES NOT WORK!!!(Original post:)The hardware works as expected although a camera viewing angle of >90 degrees would be preferable to allow full 4 camera coverage of a square structure.  These cameras only cover around 80 degrees.The part that bothers me though is the software.  On a sunny day clouds will cause a motion alarm.  So I turn down the sensitivity at which point valid motion is not detected.  Hmm.  No alerts when desired or alerting constantly choices choices choices.....  And then when using the software to find a specific event good luck.  First if you only record the event itself (versus continuous recording) it will almost always stop recording prior to the actual end of the event.  It triggers on first motion only and then records for a set period.  It does not monitor continued motion.  When viewing a continuous recording and trying to move between events there is no way to do that.  You can jump forward or back 30 seconds (try that over a 6 hour period) or you can let it play each and every detection event in its entirety before it skips to the next 'intelligent' event.  The time/date scrolling is abysmal no granularity so it's hard to get closer than about 15 minutes to the time of interest.  Would it have been so hard to include a button to skip forward or back to the next event?  And perhaps a way to enter a time and date of interest and jump directly to that time?  The list goes on but you get the idea.  It works but not well.
2,I had high hopes because of the high reviews. The system itself seems ok but 3 of the 4 cameras have issues directly out of the box. I assembled everything together at my kitchen table to test it all see the quality and image width etc. The 1 camera works great so the system has potential. However one camera came completely useless (in my picture) and two others have a vertical line scrolling horizontally across the image. I have contacted Annke by email because they're customer service line doesn't get you to a person. I will give it another day or so to see if they're willing to correct this issue. I will update my review if it's resolved or if I send it back.
2,It appeared I made a good purchase and the system worked great for about three weeks then suddenly all cameras went down and would not power back up. Too bad so sad; returning the unit.
5,i have purchased  2 of these  the second one for my daughter  mine is over a yr old and working great  the only grip i have is the playback could be be better in the software its difficult to navigat thru
5,For thr price this is an outstanding set up.  My previous system died.  Decided to try this one and the cameras alone were of much better quality than my older set up.  Ordered 4 more cameras to give me a total of 8.  The app is pretty user friendly.
5,Let me start by saying I'm cheap. I don't mind researching if it means getting a good product at a low price. My previous system (which was y the same company but obviously older) had issues. It was usable but I was hoping th second time around they had fixed a few things so I took a chance. It paid off. The UI works cleanly and responsively (though it's not Apple or Microsoft level of UI). The picture is sharp and definitely good for the money paid. I have my system plugged into Ethernet and with the app it's great to be able to look at the cameras at any time. I did drop one of the cameras and though it still worked the picture was somewhat compromised so they're a little fragile. Luckily I used some camera from the previous system since they were compatible. I don't leave Amazon reviews often but hopefully this helps.
4,Please be sure to read all reviews and decide if it pertains to the product or the shipper/seller.I have read many that say this is useless at night short range not high quality but I have to say you get what you pay for and this is beyond fantastic at the price!They are only 1MP cameras and cost $17.99 each you want better buy the more expensive ones!These work great for me and yes at night they are short ranged but again they are inexpensive.Yes they are in a plastic housing but how much damage do you think you will do them once mounted? Under the eave of the house they are protected and they are cheap enough to replace anyway.Mine all worked from the box connected up on the workbench to test then proceeded to drill my wire holes and mount them all!I have nothing bad to say about this. The DVR seems fully loaded with features for the price paid!Only 1 wish was that it allowed for a USB wifi dongle instead of hardwired for remote access. However it does allow the use of an external drive for backup purposes as well!
5,Nice  and  easy  to  use
5,Install was pretty easy. Although the small screw nut that you loosen to adjust the camera come off very easy.. and are lost in the grass forever while you’re on a ladder... IF you aren’t careful. And those nuts are so small it’s impossible to find a replacement.. so you just use duct tape to hold one of your cameras..  Unlike me. But anyways besides losing that nut off the small screw you use to adjust the camera it all went up pretty easy within an hour. I also downloaded the app and can watch footage from anywhere now i still cant figure out how make it send notifications on motion detection. If it works i still havent figure it out yet. The night vision works really well in my opinion if something is out there in the pitch black dark you will definitely see it. I was going to conceal the DVR and all the wires so that no one could steal the evidence.. but the DVR gets really hot so i didnt think it was a good idea to cover it up. Besides all the small negatives so far i really it. Cant beat it for the price.
4,It came very well packaged.I only have two cameras installed so far.  The picture quality is good IR is good. I did not rate the tech support because I have not used them.  I'm still programming the motion so no reviews on that either.There are a lot of options when programming these cameras I'm still trying to figure that out.So far my biggest complaint I stripped one of the screws that angle the camera so I'll have to do a little extra work to fix that.Once I get them all up and running I'll do another review
5,After a few mistake of extra holes in the wall I think I’m an expert now lol.Anyways rcvd my order quick. Husband installed it that very night. Everything works well! I was amazed at the picture quality. The next night my night vision went out and we wasn’t sure so thought we give it a few more days to see if it would come back on but it didn’t. We read thru the Manual but wasn’t able to fix it. I tried to look for a phone to call Annke service but there was none except an email. I was thinking...hummm how long would it take them to respond and surprisingly they responded within an hour!!!! Omg I was so surprised and happy when they actually answered me Heehee.Anyways after working with them via email for the next day or so they sent out two new cameras same week!!! And the cameras’ night vision works again!! Yay!I’m very pleased with Annke and their customer service!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!We purchased this a year ago and had it installed by a technician even though its plug and play.  The first year was fine then two weeks ago everything went dark and this is where everything went completely south in customer service and quality of equipment.  The first time all four cameras went dark after several hours I was able to get it working again – but not sure what I did to make that happen.The next day everything went dark again and I could not get it back running this time.  I contacted their customer support which is almost impossible to contact as they don’t have a readily available number to call.  Only after two weeks of back and forth emails they sent me a number to call but I was limited for the US calling between 8pm and midnight.Each day Id receive an email from their customer support telling me something to try almost like a tease this might work after a minute of trying.  When Id email them back it didn’t work I’d have to wait 24 hours for another tidbit of information that didn’t work.  After two weeks of this I demanded a number to call and only then did they provide a number that the representative who I spoke to barely spoke English and had me do everything I did over the previous two weeks via one email a day.  Then said they would have an engineer contact me by email.I got the engineers email they said maybe my electrical system in my house was off and for me to change it……..yeah I’m going to change my entire electrical panel – to what wait 24 hours for another tidbit of information that was useless?  I’m really disappointed in the lack of customer service after buying this system and paying someone to install it and for it to completely give out after less than a year of working.I wish Id spent more money upfront on a better more reputable system that came with a warranty; as now I plan to cut this one out and have one of those systems installed.DO NOT buy this you will not enjoy it or what you’ll experience once it gives out in a year. it’s not worth the money or heartache of their customer support service they provide (if you can figure how to contact them).  See the picture attached to see how only the cameras went out but the DVR still worked but recorded a blank screen for four cameras.
5,Everything works like it should definitely a do it yourself if your ready to run wires yourself. The platform on the device is kinda cheep but you get what you pay for. there are many options for motion detection and every setting can be changed after setup like the streaming quality frame size time and date and push phone alerts. Anything you could think to do with cameras this device can handle just remember many features like sound won't be available if you use the cheap option cameras that came with the system. There is also an option to add an IP cam to the device which can be helpful if you have an existing camera or want an un-wired camera. If your handy with tools and have a couple hours to dedicate to set up definitely save some money and do it yourself.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Good quality security systemit’s even better when it comes with everything you would need! The night vision is amazingI honestly didn’t expected.My husband had a really hard time to figure it out how to properly install it outside of the housecause it’s our first  experience with security systembut it was worth itfeels  a lot safer like that.It comes with an appwhich is very convenient and easy.It’s been almost 6months since we had it installedso the cameras got through a lot of rainwind and cold weather everything is still running perfectly.Good quality  for this price!
5,Night vision is in combination with my fliod lights so it good.
5,The cameras night vision is very clear. It would be nice and convenient  if they had a customer service number but when you email Annke they will respond back to you in a timely manner to assist with your request.Great cameras to purchase.
1,Had to use pliers to get BNC connectors on the VCR.  Haven't set it up yet. Once I forced the connector on got a picture.  Can't say much about quality yet.  I have OODLES to say about Amazon Support on this or anything else. The chat feature works until you get someone who can't keyboard English. On the phone always someone whose first language obviously is not English. Sorry but I expect a clear technical dialogue. Amazon needs to do better.  I don't think it's asking too much to expect customer service in the customer's native tongue. I wasted a lot of time on this until I just decided to wing it.Think I have it working...  Instruction manual not the best but I have seen worse.this is an update after 8 months from install date:  Have replaced 1 cable now 2 more are broken.  Thjin coax and poor quality bnc connectors ruin an apparently functional technical design.  if you have to do any attic crawling or have an excess wire exposed to the elements forget this product.  I ordered extra cables (another order) and have one left in the box and have already thrown away two or the orginal set and now two of the replacement cables.  The are just plain flimsy.  Cannot recommend this unit for old construction and if you install it in new construction be sure to put the cables where they can be easily replaced.Update:  BNC connectors are cheap and don't fit like they should.  Should be an easy twist on twist off and fairly substantial.  These are thing and one of them is cracked.  Because of the fit issue taking the cables on and off the VCR will pose a problem.  This isn't something you are going to move around reliably (not that you should need to). I am just saying be sure of where cable runs are going to end up and where the VCR will be located. I really don't like these cables primarily because of the BNC connectors.  Very cheaply made. In my experience BNC connectors were used in Military radar systems for video cabling.  The connectors I am familiar with were nickel plated and substantial.  I may take a shot at replacing at least one connector myself.  Doubt that factory replacements will be any better than what came with the system.
5,Bought this item to keep an eye on my vehicles and property. It's also beneficial when my pets are in the backyard to see them. The crystal clarity of the daytime view is amazing. Although it would be great to have night vision at a better quality than what is presented it is still acceptable.  Overall I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to add security and peace of mind to their life when it comes to protecting things in their lives that need monitoring.
5,We have this system installed at a remote location running of solar power and on a 15gb/month data plan. It only uses network data when you’re actively viewing video unlike competitors which is a HUGE plus.  The cameras seem solid and the night vision is good. My only small complaint is the included cabling- with fixed lengths and semi-proprietary wires be prepared to cut splice and solder a few to clean up the install. All in all 10/10. It’s sat in the harsh Nevada desert for 9 months and hasn’t missed a single second of video.
4,I replaced my Swann system with this one. This cost 1/2 what I paid for the old one.  I used some cameras from Swann but I can't tell the different on the picture quality.  Over all quality is very comparable to Swann.  Base mount of the camera made of plastic so be careful when screwing in.4 stars since the software and instruction are suck.  After the wrong shipment I contacted the seller.  They followed up until I got the correct product.  Did not contact Tech Support so can't rate it.
5,Great for the price a pain to connect to a high end PC with no disc slot. Good quality very clear. Easy to see on phone. The screws ARE JUNK.(UPDATED) After using for a good amount of time I can tell you this STOP LOOKING HERE. This security system is great for the price great clearify and quality the DVR must be Enthernet corded to the router or modem to see on your cell phone app which WORKS NO NATTER WHERE YOU ARE. I never read my instructions but what I can say is 100% write your passwords down and it's really plug and play from there. Works great in weather as well have had icerainsnow all of them only thing inreccomend on helping weather protection is to wrap the connections with sarran wrap works great.
4,This system works great. It was fairly easy to get set up. Although some of the wording in the directions is a little confusing there's a picture diagram to go off and that's really straight forward. The cameras picture is clear even in night vision and it's easy to navigate all the cameras from our tv. It comes with 60ft bnc cables but I added 100ft bnc cables to make sure they'd reach easily.  It's nice to have the option to access the cameras with or with out internet and when connected to the internet you can view cameras through the app on your phone. Overall very pleased with this system.
5,I loved the ease of installation.  A friend installed and helped me hook up.  I already had lines run in my attic so all I had to do was connect them.  I called and talked to the Annke employees to help me set it up and activate it.  The cameras are very clear and bright.  It is not color at night but you can see so color doesn't matter at night.
5,Got this cameras for my home and I'm very satisfied with the results I would definitively recommend this product.
4,I'm very happy with my service.Hugo Cruz was very helpful. Thank You.
4,Have only had installed for about a week and I'm impressed so far. This is my first surveillance system so I don't really have anything to compare to. Good quality day image and pretty good night. Was easy to set up and start monitoring through my phone as well. Would recommend purchasing.
5,Purchased OCT 20 2016. Installed myself and is still running strong.The only couple of issues Ive had are the following:1. Pulling these wires through jagged holes WILL snag them...I guess that's more of user error than with the product.2. For about the last 3 months my DVR will reboot by itself. I record 24/7 with motion activation on so I use a lot of space on the hard drive so maybe that doesn't help with preserving the life of the system.3. The application to view the cameras on your phone could be a bit better. I had to download the program a few times before it worked.  Not terrible but needs work.4. The screws and threaded ring that allow the camera to pivot and turn can become a pain to move. Had one gall up on me. use a tiny bit of oil and be careful.Honestly for the third of the cost of buying basically the same system from Wal-Mart / Costco / Sams Club....etc  you get a pretty adequate all in one system!
4,The picture is good. Customer  service is not so good. There was a lot of going back and forward and conflicting tech advice.  **Beware*** the dvr has to be hard wired to your router. Make sure you put the system in close proximity  to your router. I just assumed that in 2020...even systems on the lower end would be able to pick up a wifi signal. This system cannot.
4,Sensitive motion detection great image qualitygreat night vision...one camera fritzed out within a month and tech support was no help. Just have the three cameras now. Once in a while one of those goes blank for a while but turns back on. Checked connections and they're secure. Requires running cables through the entire house. Doesnt alert you to movements you have to just check in. Playback feature is great!
4,Great product over all wish the night vision was a bit better but for the price can't really complain. Motion detection was a bit spotty but other than that worked perfect for what I needed it for then after a year and a few months 4 of the camera started glitching out and it's almost like the cameras reboot at random times sometime they go on and off on and off then no camera at all for a couple hours nonidwa how to fix it
5,I did quite a bit of research prior to buying this system. I was looking for a good system that was cost effective. For the money I spent I was very pleased with this system. The installation and set up was fairly simple. Setting up phone app was a little complicated but after a little work it is working fine. I am very pleased with the quality of the video. I would definitely recommend this product for home use.
5,I forgot my system password after a quick set.tried to do it my self for a week or with no results . I then called Annke for help set up an appointment . The girl that  helped me got the job don in minutes .best help i every got from a seller i have ever hadThank you very very much system works great .
5,Perfect.  I had local a company come in and install the 4 cameras 24 inch tv monitor good video day and night.  Suburbs  of Detroit.
5,This is fairly easy to hook up. You might need help getting the internet connected if you need it.The picture clarity is fantastic in day and night.Had it for a while and actually ended up giving it to my cousin who was experiencing shady work place issues. She had bought additional units and is also pleased
5,I'm impressed the quality is way better than I expected. I hooked it up and make sure everything works and it links to my phone. Now all I have to do is actually install it. The cameras are very good quality full metal housing even the arm that holds it. The wires are good quality as well in the DVR also is metal and feels really solid. Mouse it comes with is fiber optic which I was not expecting. Overall I don't think there's any way to go wrong with this system for the price I am more than happy and definitely recommend this system. As a matter of fact I just purchased another one for a friend. it is for protection of our family and house！
5,I'm still learning and trying to configure what works best.  I wish some of the settings were clearer to understand to someone whom may not be as techie as the next... I find myself looking up things a lot.  But that's more my issue then an issue with the product😁. Snow is driving me bonkers setting the motion of every few moments.  I already have it on low sensitive🤷. Night vision works great
5,Love this camera system. Has night vision u don't have to pay monthly fees just need internet. I recomend them to everyone an have set up alot of these. Work just as good as high dollar ones to be honest. Every once in a while a hard drive will go out but they are very easy to find replace an are cheap.
5,Well worth the price for what it is. No need to spend hundreds on "high tech" cameras. These work perfectly. I personally would recommend taping the plugs together (we did for added protection)
4,I really enjoy having these cameras. Easy to set up and install. I love having the apps on both my tablet and smart phone. I have my home viewing on a 26 inch flat screen tv and I can see all 4 of my camera squares perfectly. Not too big or too small. The only thing negative I have to say about this system is that you have to purchase the microphone seperately. It was only like $8 through Amazon but you have to find one that's compatible and that was the hardest part because I was unsure of what exactly I was looking for. I'd recommend these cameras to anyone who wants that peace of mind of what's going on at your home when you're not there.
4,me gusta la calidad del  producto; pero más me gusta es la asistencia técnica de annke help soport. yo tuve un pequeño problema con la configuración de la alerta por email llamé a  soporte técnico y me atendió una funcionaria de nombre kate busco y utilizo todo los recursos para poder comunicarnos que interfiere la diferencia en horas y la comunicación del idioma ( soy de habla español). lo bueno de todo me ayudó a configurar totalmente mi cámara de seguridad.
4,I am able to see whats happening in real time on my phone whether I'm at work or home.
5,I just received this product and installed it with all four cameras in under 3 hours. The image quality of the cameras day and night is outstanding. The instructions were outstanding and easy to follow. I also purchased additional 100 foot cables as I had long runs to install. The DVR comes with a mouse so all you have to provide is a monitor to view the cameras. Very smart and easy to follow screens on the DVR. I previously had wireless cameras and would recommend wired cameras over wireless. The four cameras that came with the system were very easy to install and adjust. I highly recommend this security system
4,Of all the systems I have owned for my business this was by far the easiest to set up. The only thing I have an issue with is that 1-3 out of 8 cameras doesn't show up when viewing remotely. I confirmed in store that they are all plugged in and working just for whatever reason they have trouble showing up on the app. Not the end of the world but it would be nice to have all the cameras viewable all the time as that is what is advertised.Edit: Company responded and is working with me to fix problem which in my opinion merits a higher review because sometimes errors do happen and it is nice to see them step up to fix the issue.
3,Is not easy to setup and there is no customer service help by phone or email. Almost 8 hours just to get to work on a Monitor and got their app for phone but it will not hook to system to view at all but does say has to be on same network to view and ANNKE system won’t let you setup the network settings at all so no internet and no one at company answers phones or emailsI would stay away from this one.
5,It took us a little bit to get the motion detection set correctly so I wasn't getting tons of alerts (the directions are written in somewhat broken English). Now that we have that figured out they are great! My tech savvy family friend was even impressed with the clarity of the cameras!
5,This is my first experience with a security system.  This system was well packaged and well laid out.  I removed everything from the boxes and assembled them on my kitchen table to see how everything worked.  It worked like a charm.  I was able to install the system and while messing with the settings got myself into a little trouble.  I e-mailed the company and they responded the next day with the correct answer and some links to related issues.  I also had some technical questions about how the playback system worked.  Once again my e-mail was answered the next day.  I could not be happier.  One of my concerns was that other reviewers said their cameras weren't weatherproof.  My 2 front cameras are on the porch and my back 2 cameras are mounted partially under my gutters and I have experienced no problems with water getting into the cameras.
5,Got these to hook up at my father's house. He wanted something cheap and I told him it's not going to be good. We went with these cameras and I wasn't expecting much.The cameras have surprised me though. The only complaint I have is the cheap plastic camera housing and their awkward swivle system.Picture quality great easy to setup comes with long cables. Replacement cables and extension cables are cheap if needed. And here's the best part the app is amazing. I scanned the qr code and Bam. All my cameras are there in a snap. I can zoom. I can turn on motion detection. The app supports finger print log-in and has a tablet mode. Great job Annke team who put together this amazing cost effective system!
5,I first purchased the DVR to replace an older unit that died. I liked it so much I purchased this system for another location. Cameras are 1080p with great resolution and night distance. Tech support always gets back to you for questions. Do note these cameras are not metal but well made and I actually like that because they weigh less. Easy setup using their cloud or you can disable their cloud and port forward on your own. It supports zone crossing masking and many other features. The mobile app can combine multiple DVRs for a single view. Very happy with this unit and the company.
3,What I find absolutely unfreaking acceptable is that nowhere in this company is any sort of audio surveillance gear so now I have to go off site And modify everything to have audio I would have never bought this unit if I'd have known that it's cost me 8 hours worth of work all in all the price was good The pictures quality is good The software is basic minimalist no bells and whistles Of course if there were bells and whistles it wouldn't matter cuz there's no freaking audio!
5,Great little camera system. My only problem is the motion detection is very sensitive even at lowest setting. Over 300 notifications at night due to red lights from infrared attracting bugs. Also shadows will set it off so when the sun changes position the shadows from trees & house trigger it. Finally just turned it off to avoid using up all the space on the hard drive.
5,I like these cameras!
3,Excellent video quality meeting my needs for outdoor private/home security.  I have four of these on each corner of my home and it records 19 days worth of video so I can review it when the need arises.  I didn't have much difficulty with the set up although I had to use some googling to figure out how to connect the email alerts.My main complaint and disappointment is with the motion detection.  I have watched tutorials read forums and tinkered endlessly with settings to get it to work correctly.  It either is too sensitive sending a hundred emails in 5 minutes or not sensitive enough.  I still cannot fathom how it detects so many false alerts but fails to detect me walking in front of it and waving my arms around.  Hopefully this will be addressed with a software update in the future.  For the time being I just don't use motion detection.  The motion detection might work better if I had the cameras indoors where lighting/bugs/leaves/etc. are more controlled but I cannot recommend this if your primary goal is to have motion detection outside.
5,I was amazed at how clear the cameras pick up day or night . Been using this system for a while and have not had any problems at all. Easy to install and set up after the cables were run. Running cables was the hardest part to the install but they were long enough as is. Have not needed tech support.
5,Likes:  plug n play easy set up picture quality motion sensor recording.  Dislikes: needs a better "step by step how to manual" I had to go online to YouTube to figure out some of features and set up. But overall a great system.
5,I had an issue with my Annke system I made one phone call and had the issue resolved in under ten minutes due to the great tech support
4,I was a little concerned when I opened the package the system seemed made very cheap but for the price I didn’t expect much after installing the system I was completely surprised the picture quality of the cameras is amazing installation is very simple and the night vision is the best of any security camera system I’ve owned highly recommend this product
5,Good quality images easy to set up
3,They're good entry level cameras where you wanna have eyes on your house but not spend hundreds of dollars. They've been up for a week so far and only complaint really is they're not crystal clear and the app is terrible. Motion detector is too sensitive even after adjusting them to minimum of 20. So I get 100+ notifications of motion a day. When I hit play back 95% of the time it doesn't even work
2,The setup for this system was for the most part easy. You have to pay attention to the wires for the cameras there are male and female ends. Didn't state this in the directions so after running the wire for the cameras I had to remove them and redo.... This system is installed in an outbuilding to monitor livestock. The cameras are located indoors and outside.Getting the DVR to connect to the network and getting the system to start monitoring was less than easy. The directions in the manual on setup were TERRIBLE and missing information. Very CONFUSING.  I had to combine directions from two sources on the Internet to get this to work.  It took a day and a half to figure out how to get this working. Customer service is so so and the only way I could connect with them was via email.I have had this installed and working for two weeks now without any issues. The camera quality is good both day and night. I will say I let the price of this product influence my decision to buy it but I'm not certain that was the right decision. Customer service is just as important as having a good quality product.
5,I have been an Annke vision customer for a long time now. Recently our DVR and security camera of another brand began to breakdown and I decided its time to improve. I review many security cameras but ultimately decided on the Annke 1080p security cameras. The packing are solid and insured that the security camera received no damage during the transportation. The installation went real smooth because easy to ready manual. The manual provided pictures and easy to understand instructions. Once I had everything setup I immediately begin loving it. The 1080p DVR and the water proof camera and great quality made it worth the price. I would recommend the product to everyone in need of security camera.
5,Very good quality for a good low price 👍 I felt like I needed to add more I’ve had this system for a year now I’m very happy I feel much safer. I recommend it to anyone that wants a simple easy security system for a good price. it’s worth it 😁👍
5,The dar and the cameras were very easy to set up.The cable was very long and it could go up to the third floor from the first floor.It took just 10 minutes to set up the divejust plug it into the monitor and it’ll set up.The 1Td hard drive was already set up for me.After set upyour left with 923GB of memory.Connecting it to the network was very easy and convenient. The 720hp looked very nice on my phone.I’d never thought i’d I’ll be able to buy a camera and a dive set for such a good price.Currently I love this systembut I would wish that the camera was all wireless since handling the wires was very tiring.
1,Had this camera for 10 days.  HDD error called over and over and all I got was email trouble shooting response.  Impossible to talk to a person that can help with any problems you may have
4,I have to replaced one of the cameras that came with this system because it has stopped working other than that I really like this Ankee system and the ability to add cameras to it is a big plus for me. Installation was a little bit troublesome with running all of the cables for the cameras.
4,I've had the system for almost a week. Simply can't beat the price for the quality ease of installation and ease of use. All the parts were in good condition and had more than adequate wire length. Has a good clear picture day & night.  Oh and delivery was right on time.So far.. it does everything I need it to.
5,Have the Camera for about 1 month now. For the price its a Wonderful Product. i can access and view it from my phone and from my home LED t.v via a HDMI cable. the camera will turn to night mode and day mode it self.  the package came with only 4 camera heads i planning to buy more since there are still blind spots. i contact customer service regarding sharing the device with my housemate and they are quick in the responsing. so far i am loving it and feel safe with it installed.
5,Great picture on my tv and in the phone app I bought an hdmi cord for a clear picture. Definitely worth the money and security. It was fairly easy to setup alot of wiring to run and plug in but once it was all done we were happy to have done it..cant beat leaving your house and just opening an app and you can see it in seconds. Thanks
5,Once you get the cameras in place and set up the cables and power it on... The product is amazing! I got mine in Feb but just got it set up yesterday due to not being able to install it myself (heavily pregnant) but could otherwise. I can easily see my 4 dogs doing what they aren't supposed to be doing out in the back yard. And in the front yard when no one is outside. I definitely feel like I can be a little more at ease knowing that I can easily go check the camera feed if something doesn't seem right. I will be getting the additional 4 cameras at some point... To get those blind spots
2,It's a steep learning curve with this one.  We had to purchase a separate computer monitor and VGA cable to connect to the DVR they supply in order to even set up the cameras.  They do provide a mouse however (I guess that's helpful).  I reached out to support via the app and it took a full week for them to get back to me.  I finally found a discreet help desk phone number (404-620-4370) but they only take calls from 7:30pm-11:30pm EST Thursday-Sunday so obviously you're not going to find help when you need it.  That concerns me the most given the steep learning curve with this product and it is not very intuitive.  I'll also mention it took us 4 weekends to set up everything.  We did not have enough wire to go to places around our house and we had to order extra.  Also the Annke vision app I downloaded looks alot different in their instructional videos.  In their video they're simply able to click on "alarm notification"; this is not an option on my app.  If anyone knows how to set up the alarm notification on your Annke Vision app I'd love to know.  So right now we're stuck and can't get help with that specific issue.
5,If you have any difficulty with the system customer support is excellent and always answer in a timely manner this is probably the best customer support I’ve had from a security camera product!Melissa made contact with me many times until I was happy!
5,Works Great.The package was delivered fast. The picture is crystal clear and online immediately once all connections were plugged in.  It’s amazing that It can be installed simply.I've had this setup at my restaurant for over one week now. There’s no problem so far. I love it! It works as what advertised on Amazon. Installation is fairly easy. The ability to view the security cameras remotely via my phone is helpful. I am so happy to know my restaurant situation when I am outside. Video quality is as expected. It is clear in both daytime and night time to see clearly. And If you’re looking for a useful and affordable camera kit! I think this is the right one for you.
5,I love the security cameras on our home  with a great night and day vision!!
3,The picture is pretty good and it was easy to set up. Disappointing that not all cameras are capable of using the line detection or intrusion detection. Only allowed to set it to a couple cameras. Cameras cover a fairly wide area. The phone app could use quite a bit of work. The camera system is good for what the price is.
3,Work great daytime quality is great. Night Vision is awesome but anything in the way the IR causes it to look darker. Motion Detection is annoying constant notifications from anything small. QR Code to link is confusing need better instructions but other than that they work good. Price could be a bit better.
5,I secured my home and I amMore than pleased at the crispNight vision and even day vision. The phone views are almost like looking in real time at my home. I love most the ease of set up and the fact that anything moves I capture it. Love this quality security.
3,Very clear picture; easy to connect with DVR; everything was in the box.  But we have had a terrible time turning the cameras in the right direction.  We gave up.  Pictures are turned to their sides.  We twisted the ring adjuster but the picture was upside down when we rotated the camera.  We adjusted the up and down with the phillips screw.  Needs a ball and socket so camera can go left right up and down.
4,Good entry level system. Few notes cameras do not seem to put out 1080p and are quite grainy. They are good enough to pick up something like a license plate if it’s close enough. Have since upgraded to a true 1080 version.
5,Had it for a year. Don't use alot of the abilities but leave it on 24/7. Not really going to get license plates at 50ft but is good.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I suggest buying this item because the quality of the camera is very nice. I have installed 3 camera one for my back door one for my front yard and one for my living room. It’s also easy to download the app and easy to set up. I can quickly and easily connect it to my phone to look at what is going on around my house.
5,Cameral works fine but hard to set up if not ethernet connected. We are in a remote location and rely on thumb drives.  Customer service to fix password issues were great!
5,This security system gets 4 cameras They are impressively light compared with my old ones. This make the installation work much easier. The most time-consuming part is connecting these cameras to DVR box some experience would be helpful to figure out how to go through the wall and better secure and hide the wires. The 1TB HD is preinstalled in the DVR box not a standalone item. The picture quality is crispy. Email motion detection reminder works well and video can be watched through phone app everywhere. So there is no need to get a TV or monitor for it. This is a plus for me.
4,hard drive was not working when i got it hooked up to be able to record. emailed the company and got a quick reply to open it up and verify it was installed. it was there but connector was loose snapped it in and works great...could have come loose during shipping. everything else works like it should easy to install and set up and playback.
5,After initial set up system is great picks up just about every movement and is really good in the night vision too.  Great purchase for money.  Will be getting the same system again.
3,Product description is misleading. NOT a HD camera. Would have been nice to have a user manual in the box. Also does not have a network card. It relies on being close to your router or a long network cable.
5,Fast shipping. Easy to install. Came with plenty of wire to run each camera around my home. The system is simple and easy to use. picture is great. Motion sensing works great as well. Worth every Penny.
4,Works well especially for the price. The night vision could be a bit better but it definitely works well enough for most people. I’d buy it again.
5,Works great during the day and night tech support was very helpful in the set up process delivery was fast over all pleased with the price affordable.
3,Maybe its me and I cant get it to work im not sure. All's i know is i followed the directions hooked it all up and i cant get any video picture. I did not think this was going to be this confusing. Its like you have to have a degree in computers to know how to run the program. Very agervated. Been trying to get this to work for 3 weeks. If I finally figure it out i will change my review.
4,Good cameras the only thing I don't like about them is the mount. You have to mount them with the base sitting flat or you can't rotate the cameras left and right at all. One of the cameras recently died on me but they honored their warranty and sent another out without any trouble.
4,The manual isn't quite strong enough to explain operations of changes one can make etc.Overall the system works well so far and am pleased with it thank you
5,Nos gustaron mucho muy prácticas de usar lo único que el sensor de movimiento no se puede configurar por cámara separada.
5,I love this. It had stupid easy directions on set up. Our DVD player quit working so we couldn't watch the how to set up video. But the booklet had pictures and directions even a 3 yr old could follow. The email set up and notification was difficult. We still dont know how to do that but the playback on the monitor with the mouse works great! And the monitor has a sticker letting you know the size of memory they have in it. I am very pleased with this!!
5,So far so good.To be able to acceas from PC you need a router. I Couldnt watch streams on windows 10. I am currently using windows 8.1 and explorer. Knoppix linux cant install the plugin. You must install a web components plugin provided by the vcr box upon trying to watch a stream on iexplorerCamera picture quality is inferior to a samsung s4 inside a room I dont have experience with security systems though.There is a splitter for powering multiple cameras with the supplied 2A 12V adapter.
5,Very good picture easy set up with plenty of storage overall a very good purchase on my end I believe. The only thing she keep her mind is you do need an ethernet cable to connect directly to a router if you want to be able to view the cameras remotely. Other than that everything was above expectation.
5,This was a gift from my brother to celebrate moving into my new house.when it comesI am pleased that the cameras were packaged neatly in there own seperate boxes with a thin styrofoam wrapping. Everything was packaged separate and nicely. The instructions led me through the setup quite simply. Cables were of an adequate length.And these camera provide a clear image even on darkI can monitor my front yard anytime through the screen or the APP MYANNKE on my phone. It is super convenient being able to view them when I'm away. All in allI highly recommend this product.
5,Took very little to get here and when it did i didn't even need the cable extender i also ordered it had a very easy installation and clear instructions.It has many great in-DVR features too.
5,Very pleased with system! Picture quality is great also setup/install simple and easy. Bought this unit when on sale. I’m gonna add more cameras to the DVR soon. Just buy it and move on!!! Thank you.
5,Great product! These are the best cameras I've had this far. The fact that I can set it and it will contiuously record is the reason I purchased. It does it's job well. The only negative I can say is the setup does take same work and tweaking. 3 passwords and a swipe lock? A bit excessive. Otherwise the system is perfect.
5,I have restaurant Business and alway worry about thing happens got alot of trouble before with my counter. AND the worry about night time somebody going to broken door and coming stolen ny stuff finaly i buy the security Camera and install for my restaurant they have 8 camera can cover everything and have 1 tb memory can record for more than 4 month now i donot need to stay on restaurant all the time now because they even have online service i can watch things have on my Cell Phone. Recommondation.
4,Installed at a friend's house for home security.  Didn't mess with the adjustment for motion sensor and never had to call for tech support.  Good clear day and night picture.  Easy straight forward installation.
5,I am happy with this product It makes my home safe
5,One of best systems in this price range. Easy installation. Cameras are very light weight. We had to installed on drop ceiling tiles and the camera weight made things a lot easier.
4,Great product! Works great so far. Only down side is the cords are cheaply made. They stretch to easy and disconnect inside the wire housing. Just have to cut it and rewire it. Nothing major. After a long time of the system up and running the product is cheaply made. It’s great for a way to watch around your house but don’t rely on it to always save your video or even record. Mine stopped recording 3 weeks ago and I can no longer play back video.
5,I replaced my 11 year old system with Annke Surveillance Camera System . It works perfectly for my needs. The support section was very helpful since the setup was different than my old system.
5,I purchased this security camera system for my business property because of the price and functionality. Good image quality and easy configuration. It came with 4 1080P HD cameras and allows you to add 4 more if you desire. you can set up the system to send you emails with pictures any time a camera senses motion. There's also remote viewing through the app on your smart phone. The package included all the cables and 1TB Storage capacity. Good night vision visibility. Good wide angle view. Absolutely love this security system.  Would definitely pruchase them again
5,I got these to replace an older moder that was damaged by a power surge. It takes a bit of reading to get the networked cameras up bit its still a good machine. Just download "annke vision"  instead of the app the manual recommends and you'll have the cameras up on your phone. The old app is not in use anymore but you had to find that out after reading online. That's what had me stumped for hours. Oh only thing I noticed is it DOES NOT have the ptz control for moving pan tilt zoom cameras.
5,This is the best value I found on the market for HD motion and night vision DVR system. It comes with 4 cameras and 1 TB memory disk.The video quality can be choose from basic and HD and it is very smooth. I just test it out inside the living room and guest bedroom a little dark in the room but it still came out perfect for the quality.I’m planning to get few more cameras for the backyard. Very impressive.
5,I upgraded my 1080 for this camera set and I'm so happy I did worth the money. Easy to hook up and record
3,For the money this is a good system. The cameras are all plastic so we will see what the Sun does to them over time. The Dvr works but the included harddrive is noisy.the instructions on setting it up are not up to date to the OSmaybe this was just the case with ours. I tried calling tec support but wait times were 100 mins plus.
5,just got around to installing this product today so can not give an honest assessment of it yet especially while in use at nighttime . from what I seen of it so far  the images in the daylight are very clear  at least 40 feet past the front of my house which is what I wanted. Was easy to set up and all parts were supplied. so far  so good
5,Buena Calidad
5,
4,I am a technical person.  It is not easy to setup especially try to get online.I am adding this after two months of using it.I have to contact support multiple times and the support is great.  They tell me what software and app to use.  I am pretty happy with my system now.
4,The additional camera ordered was defective upon on delivery. Sent back for a refund.
4,Thus far I am completely satisfied the product and the east of set up. Still have not connected it to the internet yet but will be trying to do so in the next few days. My ONLY negative thus far is the booklet that comes with it...it is pretty weak. But the system was pretty easy to connect to the cameras. Cameras feel pretty "low cost" but I am ok with that.
5,Me gustó se mira muy bien en la noche y el motion sensor trabaja muy bien y para activarla con la aplicación es muy fácil
5,Cable that goes to DVR is not the right one. It doesn’t fit in the port of DVR. I need to return all or u need to send me the cable that Fits in DVR
5,The system was a bit of a pain to set up and get connected to our phones. But once it was figured out it was smooth sailing. The motion detection is very sensitive and it’s set to the lowest setting.
5,works great very clear easy to install very satisfied. the only neg. is it was hard to load to my phonenot enough info. i had to go online to figure it out. but now it works great
5,Came with a broken cable and a broken base on a camera.  Annke is sending new equipment customer service is outstanding.  Kit works great otherwise very clear night and day.  Better than I expected for the price.  Looking forward to adding more cameras to watch our livestock too!
3,Great day time camera. Terrible night vision ability. So your really getting a camera that records well only half the time. Hopefully nothing happens at night because it will be difficult to catch on the cameras. But really good day time cameras. And great memory. I can go back and watch recordings 2 and a half months so far.
5,great set but should have bought the other 4 cameras with the set
5,Easy setup and installation. I did buy the 100’ cables as well just to be sure I had enough to run through the attic and saved the 60’ cables that came with the cameras.  So far so good although I have not connected to the internet and tried to use the app yet. Otherwise it’s all doing great so far.
5,Just got the system installed. The resolution seems good component quality seems good. I have connected it to the internet and can view all cameras on my desktop and smartphone. So far seems to be good quality and it is really nice to be able to adjust the motion range and sensitivity for each camera. Night vision is really good. I would recommend this system if you are on a budget and don't want to spend $500-$1000. Good value for me.
5,Easy to install took about 2 hours with no experience. App works great when away from home.
5,A great value product.
5,I'm very pleased with my cameras for some reason actually 2 of them stopped working but when i contacted the seller they were very friendly and very prompt to handle the situation and i now have 4 new cameras on the way. Thank you so much
2,This unit was easy to set up despite the Asian English of the manual.  The movement detection is poor and on one setting shows continuous movement and the next sensitivity registers no movement even when one jumps about and waves at the camera.  Moreover if it does detect a movement it just sends a message that the movement occurred but it does not send a video like other brands do.  I set it up so that I could watch my house on my iPhone and it worked fine for about a week if I got a good wifi connection.  But then it stopped because it rebooted itself and came up in set up mode.  When one is in the USA and wanting to see one's security cameras in Australia it is a bit frustrating when everything stops.  You don't know if the house has burnt down or what.  I will be looking for something that is a bit more robust and throw this system away.  The cameras are good but are NTSC.  The system also works with PAL cameras. It won't allow a mixture of camera systems. One or the other.
5,Very good! Motion detection noise irritates because it goes off when a bug flies across the camera cuz bugs are attracted to the light but doesn't sound when a dog or cat walks in the cameras path. So is ok. I need to find 3 more cameras to add but don't know which to choose or that is compatiable. Like wireless cameras so i can place hidden in the yards.
5,this is a pretty good product  so far of the other brand night hawk ...
5,Cameras were easy to install which running the cords was the worst part. I was very impressed with the picture quality of the cameras. I wish the remote for the camera DVR worked better as you have to be pretty close and pointed in the right spot for it to work. At first I wasn't sure as the bar codes for apps didn't work but I emailed the support email in the book. They were very quick to respond with the proper links and step by step instructions. After their instructions all works perfect and now I am think of expanding to a few more cameras.
5,Stop looking for hours and just buy this one. For the cost it’s all good baby.
5,More than I expected for the price. Decent video good low light quality. Installation and setup up was incredibly simple. Works exactly as advertised. Mobile app is simplistic but works. I installed at my cabin in the mountains and can see what’s going on when I’m home. I would highly recommend for the price. I am going to purchase a couple of 1080 cameras to add since there are still 4 available channels. Curious to see the quality difference from the 720 camera.
5,I bought this on behalf of my neighborhoods HOA to install in our clubhouse/pool. It works GREAT! The picture quality is amazing for the price and it has worked without a hiccup. We hooked it up to an old computer monitor and now our neighborhood common areas are covered 24/7. It eliminated the problems we were having with kids sneaking into the pool at night.
5,I think it is an excellent option for surveillance and home security. the cameras are very clear day and night the operating system is very simple and with the possibility of connecting on the internet to see in real time from our cell phone.
5,😁😁😁😁
5,Great security camera system. Easy to install and set up there are youtube videos if you are not sure how. Good picture quality( pretty good at night time too). Motion detection can be useful and you can remote access the cameras on your phone or tablet. Product came with a 1TB hard drive and the system overwrites old files so no need to worry about hard drive running out of space.Great system overall.
4,The picture quality is amazing for the price. I am adding mor cameras both indoor and about and am very satisfied. Setting up the app on the phone and the settings in the DVR could have better instructions
5,This camera is awesome so far!!! We installed it which is difficult because we have a two story home and we have to run the wires. Not really the companies fault but installation wasn’t easy. We have set up the motion detection and it records all day. This camera gives me a peace of mind and is not as expensive as some other camera systems out there. We received everything as it stated. The picture is clear as well!!
3,It works but the interface via Firefox or Chrome on Linux is junk only allowing you to view one camera at a time and no interactive interface.  No clue if the MickeySoft Active X bit works. I refuse to install  that virus on my computers. They need to put a coder on this product that understands user interfaces without the Active X crutch.Direct viewing and control via either composite or HDMI video and mouse is fair with multiple display options and good resolution.The device itself is not bad so I gave it a 3 star rate -2 because of the [ lack of] web interface for Firefox or Chrome browsers.
4,This is a 8 channel dvr but it only comes with 1 Female to 4 Male Output Power Splitter
5,easy to install if you get the right person; the camera was worth the purchase!
4,Used this to replace a First Alert system.  The four cameras I had worked fine with this so 8 total now. Everything is working fine the menu system is easy to follow. The only thing I found I do not like is when using what I call scanning view you cannot pause the scan without going back into the menu to stop it. Hopefully it will last a long time.
5,There were no problems with the installation the only thing I had to buy was the brackets for attaching the wire to the wall. It works as it should you can view it from your phone. Price and quality consistent
5,This camera system is easy to set up I ran camera to the 4 corners of my house. It does exactly what I need it and setting up the smartphone app was easier than I thought. Everything is seems to be good. Image clearcrisp no picture noise no issues so far. We got this camera system we feel safer. Thanks.
1,I recently installed a SharkTap to manage another security issue and found that the Annke DVR not only forcibly creates ports in my firewall to stand up services to allow you to watch cameras and manage the system remotely - even when those features are DISABLED in the DVR’s UI - but it also creates and maintains external connections to at least 2 hosts in China (for updates? for...?). The connections to China are not authorized by me and have no related settings I can find in the DVR to stop them. I’ve disconnected the DVR from my network but still getting request packets from Chinese servers looking for the IP where it was previously installed.If you buy this product NEVER connect it to your network and NEVER install the mobile device apps from Annke (“Annke Vision”).  I’m maybe being overly cautious here but I prefer my safety and security a priority. Annke says they do the same - I don’t believe it.
5,Better than expected!! Received it and hooked it up and the clarity is more than I need. I installed the system without any problemsthe instructions are simply and clear. The included cables are more than generous in lengh. The quality of the camera are goodthe pictures attached show the images in complete dark and very bright light. Awesome systemdoes everything you need for a security system.
1,For the price the hardware appears to be a great value - high quality consistent.  But I wanted it to work as a security system - flag motion and make it easy to review those events.  I've tried the IP app  which works fast and is good for live viewing but lacks config options and no alarms are shown.  Also tried the Windows Guarding Vision client which is extremely slow but has most config options but doesn't show motion events except those detected while it's running. Navigating the timeline where the events are supposed to show up is slow awkward and doesn't show most events.  I think they're 90% of the way there but right now it's FAR worse than the 15 year old system it replaced.  Great hardware is worthless if it can't work as a security system.  Sad.
5,I purchased these for a home security system.  The cameras are great---good pictures easy to set-up and install.
4,Dose pretty good for the $. Night vision is surprisingly good. And wasn't that hard to install. All in all I'm happy with it.
3,would give it a 5 star but the recording is iffy....i bought the one that is supposed to record multiple cameras at once but its weird it only records when it wants to.at first i thought it was just the camera not picking up but on the main viewing screen it shows up fine for all the cameras but it only wants to record camera 1 not the other 3 ...i say that but at one point in time it did record other cameras but i cant figure out how it did it or what made it stop cause i havnt changed any settings
5,This has to be one of my best purchases of the year. You will not regret buying these cameras. The night vision works great. The hard drive can store about a week's worth of continous video with the 4 cameras setup. Not to mention the install and setup was a breeze. The added benefit of being able to use a smartphone to see thru the cameras real time is great as well.
5,So far we love it. Does what we need it to. The motion detector is super touchy but there’s SO MANY settings I completely believe this is a user error issue lol. Night vision works well.  Love the app feature for the phone. I’m addicted to watching it already 🤷🏻‍♀️ Def worth the money. It’s cheap and gets the job done
3,great unit but having hard time to connect to my phone ? besides that good quality vision
5,EDIT: I must say Annke was quick to respond and try to find out my issue we have determined that there was an issue with the cameras and they worked hard to resolve issue I will update once issues fully resolved.  System was easy to install and set up but over all picture quality on this item was not good looked like a toy camera picture
4,Overall it's a good system for the money.  I will be investing more in the near future to get a better system though this is a good temporary 1-2 year cheap security system.  Hardly any understandable support for activating some of the features since it's poorly translated and structured in a faq format.  Very frustrating.
5,The things in the warehouse were stolen several times. Install the camera. Now you can feel at ease. Someone steals. It is useful to check the alarm. You can see it clearly at night. Also buy one more to put outside the warehouse. Go to the store to see the price is more than $200. The same pixel.
5,Great product. This is my second system
5,Easy setup and great video quality.  Price comparison to other models is outstanding!
5,It didn't mention this when I bought it but it does come with 4 sixty-foot cables and a power supply for all the cameras. It's a surprisingly good system for the money I'd recommend it.
5,Pretty good graphics a little hard to figure out with little instructions on the operation.  The disc that came with it had other DVR info on it and helped a little.  On line help was great though.Updating my review!  It has been over 3 years and I finally had a problem. A few emails and that was taken care of.  And it wasn't even an equipment error.  It was my plug in source.  Great customer service.
5,I definitely recommend this brand to everybody it's been working great for about a year-and-a-half now and would not change anything image quality is good as well
5,Setup is painless  everything is exceptional quality down to the connectors on the BNC cables  the picture quality is amazing  definitely will be buying more Annke products in the future
5,if you call customer service and ask to add on more cameras (lots of luck)  you get the run around or even better yet they don't make your cameras anymore I just bought them 4 days before I called them to add more cameras to the system???? now I'm buying a completely different system from another manufacturer
5,This is a very good security camera it has 1080p the video can be seen clearly the installation and use is very simple it also has an alarm function to remind you of the situation at home at any time I can watch the situation at home at any time through the mobile phone app I think every family should installvery nice
2,After I bought one their video surveillance systems I encountered a problem with my buzzer not making any sound. I contacted their support by email which in my opinion not very good because it can take 24 hours to receive a response. All they did was to send me link to the FAQ page. You cannot find a company phone number for the City of Industry offices. They do not want you to call them. I asked several times in my email gor them to call me. Three days have passed and I have yet resolve my problem. They need to redesign their software and manuals they are lacking in many areas. There should be a a simple way to install and connect to the DVR over a wireless connection from your laptop android or whatever system you use. I searched for Windows install direction and found nothing. I would not recommend buying any of their systems until they resolve some of these issues and provide a phone number.
5,We love this camera system. Has great quality day and night. Easy to use. We have already caught the neighbors stealing! It’s come in handy!
3,Writing this to get the extended warranty.  I'll update after I get it up and running.  So far not a particularly easy setup.
5,I’m happy with the night vision
5,Great product!  Was pretty simple to install.  Had all 4 cameras up and working within 4 hours.  My family and I definitely feel a lot more safe with the security cameras. There is an app where you can check the cameras from your phone from anywhere.
5,They help me replace bad camera and a wire. Service was great. Willing to work with them aging.  Looking to up date two camera in the future for the front and rear door.
5,We have a problem with a junky neighbor.  We are able to easily review recordings.  We had a small problem figuring out how to download the recordings but  there were a lot of utube video to learn from.  Needless to say it gives us a lot of peace knowing that our house has the extra protection we need.
4,The directions are not very helpful that I am getting from tech service through email. If they don't fix this soon I will be forced to never but this product again.
1,Worked well for about a week.  Will be returning this product which was way more trouble than it’s worth to connect everything.  Hard wired and works fine on the tv but the playback notifications on the tv have black and white checkered lines.  Live feed in Basic sort ofworks HD does not.  The app has black and white checkered lines throughout each camera live feed in HD and Basic view.  At night you cannot see a thing via the app.  Have had several emails back in forth with customer care and no fix.  19 emails to be exact.  I’m done.  Don’t waste your time and money.  The night vision is horrible and you’d have to buy a separate infrared light like we did.
5,Picture is very clear and this is already my second unit
5,Excellent product very easy to setup. Works very well menus easy to use. I purchased this as a gift and then installed it. Hardest part is hiding the wires.
5,Just installed last week so far picture is great motion detection is great. No problems with the system.
5,Buen producto y fácil de instalar
5,so far so good. Have had it up and working for a week know
4,For the money this is a great deal. Set up in my barn to monitor toys when I am not around. Not hooked in to internet only using it if I see stuff missing. Easy to set up ensure you have a monitor. Still playing with the settings. I plan on purchasing more for other properties.
5,I've had the Annke for about a year now. Like the system a lot.
3,Tuve dificultades para ponerlas porque a diferencia de otros sistemas de cámaras que tengo los cables de este sistema  no están identificados que lado se conecta a la cámara y que lado se conecta al DVR. Una vez conectado los cables volverlos a quitar es bien difícil desesperante si los colocastes mal por no estar identificados. Las cámaras son plásticas y con el clima que hace en mi país no duraran mucho.
3,QR code nor any options I have tried will allow WIFI or phone app
5,After an electrician put the cameras in I lost the password. Customer support was right in the money and extremely secure and helpful. The system seems to be working well and fairly easy to operate after reading the manual.
3,Can't say whether I like or dislike this. Before I get into detail I paid $160 for four cameras and 1TB DVR. The picture isn't the greatest you can make your surroundings but hard to pick up facial features. At the end of the day the saying is "you get what you pay for". As far as mobile viewing forget it. It's junk. It's a foreign company and no instructions. I use my iPad for continuous live feed and it constantly disconnects and have to restart it.
5,Great system for an awesome price. Comes with everything you need to start your surveillance.
4,This is a great survalence system it works great and easy set up day time vision is perfect but I gave it only 4 stars because night vision is horrible unfortunately  also love the fact that I can view the cameras anytime anywhere on the app
2,Merchant neglects to inform customers that DVR can only be setup with Windows OS it does not work with Apple OS or any other OS.  Power supply to cameras is provided by a shared (4 cameras) power adapter with an output of 12 VDC/2 Amps.  If cable power supply to cameras is too long the power looses intensity due to cable resistance and it hinders camera performance.  There is a mobile phone application that allows you limited remot control access but it is not useful for the initialization and/or activation of the DVR.  You need WiFi for that.  If you are in an urban environment with very good WiFi signal and a fairly new computer with Windows OS then software works user friendly.  Once setup is accomplished camera image is excellent.
4,I lice the system  came on time very easy to use . I make a very good choice .
2,Hooked up everything on the bench to insure everything worked prior to installing it. I was surprised how nice the images were on the monitor. Suddenly I heard a click and then got a peppered spray of colors over the monitor and then the system began to reboot over and over again. I verified everything was connected properly and even switched hdmi cables which by the way didn't come with unit and tried again and got the same thing again while going through the setup up. I attempted to call amazon support but due to high volume I couldn't get through. There was an overseas number for Sannce support in China but I chose not to call long distance to China. Inboxed it up and sent it back to Amazon. Amazon's online return made it very easy. UPS picked it up at my home the very next day.
5,Have only had for over 2 months; easy to install and work great so far. Quality is very decent if we consider low price. Very clear in the day; Night vision is clear within 50 feet. Playback works perfectly. Web and phone access also work great. Only con is that the cameras itself can only be adjusted up and down once installed not side to side (don't have a pivot mount). Will update in the future...
2,I have had my camera system since September 2016. It is now November 2018. These are not weather proof. Both my exterior cameras have leaked and caused not only the lenses to fog but has shorted out the "night vision" LEDS. I am a bit disappointed though I have had them for two years that I went through the effort of installing everything just for them to fail. I do not want to buy replacements since Wifi cameras are so much easier. User interface was weak had difficulty clicking on the timeline to "zoom" into something. Never quite worked correctly and the motion sensor and night vision weren't particularly good either. One "Pro" to all this is now I have what LOOKS like surveillance around my house but isn't actually working. *oh well*
5,very good
5,Cameras work great! Motion detection picks up every little thing (wind blowing trees plants moving frogs....etc..) but I’d rather that then the opposite! Great cameras for the price. Haven’t had any problems
4,I've had this system for about a week now and I'm still figuring things out.So far I am satisfied with the productthe system is not bad for the pricewould have been better with sound but you get what you pay forwould recommend for starter system
5,Just installed the unit set up was quiet easy well pleased
5,Work amazing easy to put up. Got amazing view and you can see it really good.
5,Easy hookup  Plug and play
5,The product works as advertised. The camera clarity is fantastic and the night vision capability is adequate.Motion sensitivity is too good if anything but I'm not complaining at all.And the whole system is very plug and play.
5,For the price of 150. I am so happy with it. It setup just fine plug and play. For some reason I can't get the remote viewing on computer to work. The mobile setup was very very easy and it opens and cameras are right there. Running the wires is the only issue. This is a great product.
4,The cameras work perfectly fine. The only thing is 1 of them was broken i sed a email and no answer jet.
1,DOES NOT LAST!! After owning this item for a less than a year it died! This is the 2nd time weve had this same issue. Customer support is TERRIBLE!!!!!  JUNK JUNK JUNK
5,The night vision is not good at all
2,Of you want anything other than straight on picture look elsewhere. You can adjust up and down but forget it if you want it turned right or left. You can provide a up and down hinge but it’s too hard to add a simple right and let one.
1,The Annke vision app does not work. I scan the QR code and when I try to add a device it doesn't find anything. Getting a hold of any kind of customer service is extremely difficult. I was directed to contact Amazon customer service where a person whose first language is clearly not English tried to troubleshoot the issue by reading out of some kind of manual. I found it extremely frustrating and unhelpful. I want to contact Annke directly but there is no way to do this. I've left a comment on their message board with no response yet. I do NOT want to troubleshoot the issue over a message board. I want someone to call directly who can troubleshoot the issue in real time. It is a waste of my time to check a message board and my e-mails. I'm going to return this product. It is completely worthless to me if I can't remotely view my property. Someone could easily break into my house and steal my equipment and I would never know who did it.
5,Easy to set up and the cameras perform better than I expected in both daylight and night.Excellent value and if it lasts long it would  rate  5 stars for a basic video security system . After three years  I can say it merits 5 stars.  The company ‘s technical support has always  been available and helpful . Hard to beat In value
5,Everything I needed awesome 👌
5,Works great set up after installed a little challenging but got it done
5,This is a very good camera system that works well in low light and very good and daylight it records everything and you can review it with the software that comes with it had it for over a year no problems.
5,Great timing....
4,Cameras work good must have come with a faulty box because it won't connect to the internet no matter what I try
5,La verdad muy buen producto facil y sensillo de conectar algo mucho mejor que se conecta al internet facil y rápido  sin necesidad de estar poniendo numeros solito se conecta la verdad muy contento
5,Excelente producto realmente me ayudó a ver quien se comía todo lo del refri en la noche!!!!
5,It all good
5,This is the second system I've owned. The first was another brand and I had a lot of problems with it. I have been very pleased with this entire system. Very easy to set up easy to use and the app. to remotely view on my cell phone has worked flawlessly.  I recommend this system to everyone.
5,great product price and fast shipping
5,Fast delivery  plug and play setup very affordable picture clarity ease of playback all very positive.
4,When I power up the receiver it interferes with my cell phone
5,I really find it hard to review a company that will go the extra mile to resolve any issues I am totally satisfy with the annke security camera system
4,The only negative I have to say is that it runs all night for some reason and it is probably
5,great value and has been going strong for several years in heat of Phoenix
5,Awesome price and great quality!
5,Best equipment I have....all four sides of the house....works like a charm day or night.
5,Home security
4,all worked good for a week now one is stuck in night vision  got to get a new one for it
5,It is the best cameras I ever bought it. The picture is so clear that I was impressed. The price is worthy for the great quality of this product. Everybody is too happy and feel more secure having them. Thanks.
2,Just replacing existing system camera wires too short two days of trying to get system working can't find answers on line still no clue how to operate functions or what functionsit has. I have had several systems but this one has little help that I can find. I would not recommend. The cameras looked ok but all plastic. App will not load on my PC
5,I purchased this product and love it!
3,Purchased this for my husband who works with Alarm and Security Systems and he is having issues figuring this thing out. After reading some of the reviews I guess he isn’t the only one having the same problem. Hopefully he can figure it out so we don’t have to return this if that’s even an option at this point.
2,One year update--System still working minus one camera which lasted 11 months. Two emails to annke about the camera did not get a reply.Giving it 2 stars due to the lack of a reply and broken camera.Everything is still working after two months use. Setup would be easier with complete instructions. Running the wires to the outside is a bit harder than necessary due to the ends not able to be removed. This requires drilling a larger hole to the outside. Bought the extended warranty from a third party vendor with it and still have not received it yet (nothing to due with annke itself)just a warning if your thinking of buying the extended warranty..
4,I really like this system thus far. The only bad part my remote didnt work but dont really need it i hooked up a wireless mouse and im very happy to say the least i recommend this product.
1,Absolute CRAP 💩 customer service because there is none. Might as well contact someone on Mars because these people will not return emails. Don’t waste your money for this garbage. Initial setup w garbage instructions took about 5hrs and actually worked well until the Annke app just decided to stop sending notifications even though settings are online and enabled for notifications. Uninstalled/reinstalled app restarted internet restarted phone.. made sure the notifications were still on. Nothing has worked. And again let me state how crappy 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩 CUSTOMER SERVICE is. 100 terd rating for that. Very dissatisfied customer. Would not recommend. Don’t waste your $$$ people!!!!
4,Thumbs up easy to setup all products accounted for.
3,Okay
5,Facil instalación y burna calidad
1,Product sort of works. I have had these running for 3 years in my business and the live video works as needed but both times I have tried to go back to find video they have not been recorded. Had an incident that needed to be reported to police at our business last week and the camera failed to record the incident. Annke support was unable to help me fix the problem. They had me update the app on my phone and when I did the new version of the app could not connect to my security system. Their customer support had been no help.
3,It works good but it was not easy to use and specially once it comes to hook up with internet the functionality is not at all easy. several times of reset but did change the setting every time i restarted it. Better to go with swann. I used them 7 years in my store and never had problem at all.
5,Great camera system for the money spent.  Works great. Notifications are almost instantaneous. Great video quality.
2,Very cheap quality cameras with no good zoom feature each camera has to be powered and the cable that comes off the camera with coax and power is not long enough to keep the connections inside.. you would have to wrap the power connection for outdoor use.  Software too complicated to rewind easily and does not work with current web browsers. You need the old Internet Explorer to remote control/view. Overall Not a great system.
3,Las cámaras son lo q pagas. Son baratas y son de calidad barata. Los cables se dañaron en menos de un año el equipo tecnico amable me indicaron q debia proteger los cables de el clima.
5,We installed this system pretty fast...we use the app to check out our footage and it works perfectly fine. We use it indoors and the quality is great even at night. It is motion detected. So far so good.
5,Estey contento con Las camaras pero por error  pulse un Boton  y me devolvieron el importe  delas camaras por lo que quiero devolverles el dinero que me devolvieron.
5,This system works great only thing is 2&ahalf years later it stop working.  The power just went out a few days  ago.Looking for another one now
5,I absolutely love this system! It works great. We installed it in our home over a month ago and haven't had any problems. I would definitely recommend it.
2,During the daytime this system works great. Quality of the images are nice motion detecting is awesome even with the easy programming. Night time? The IR light can't reach far enough (about 25 ft for optimal view) and outside the reach of the light it can't catch motions well. Nice daytime or indoor system but not recommended for the nocturnal use.
4,Great camera and recorder for the money. Not hard to wire the cameras.  But the connection to the internet isnt a plug and play.
4,Works nice for the price.
5,Can’t beat the price and the quality is great AF. Set this system up and running within 30 min.
5,Me gustó mucho las puse en mi casa afuera
5,These cameras are working as described. I had only one issue with one of my cameras but after contacting the company they resolved my issue. I would recommend this product.
5,Works great for the price point.
4,for the price is good deal I bought this system and still is working well the only that I cannot configure is the alert alarm but may is possible is the provider is closing the ports.
4,Cameras work Great. Would have given 5 stars but the directions to set up Sgt are really sketchy. Luckly have friend who's worked with security systems helped set up.
5,Nice and perfect easy installation easy camera setup amazing check video anywhere and if I was traveling out of us.still everything perfect.thankyou annkee.
5,Great product camera are cheap
5,I like this product very easy to use and clear vision
5,Just installed these for our son as a gift.  Cameras look great. Picture quality is great and they are basically plug and play after you get your wires ran.
4,Video is clear. Product arrived on time. But the remote to the system came damaged which isn't too big of a deal because the system can be operated without it.
5,The seller shipped very fast the things are very light and also equipped with a mouse very good.  I like it very much…
5,Nice system....easy to install and easy to setup. Pros Lots of Features Easy to Use Compact Motion-Activated Clear Instructions Very Bright Nice Design！Great Product Excellent buy Incredible service!!!
3,I am considering returning this product. I just opened the package and hooked everything up to verify operations and I have one cable that is shorted( turns cam on and off when wiggled) and the other is a bnc fit issue and now the bnc cable is stuck on the dvr :-( sooo 2 total bnc issues so far
5,Muy fácil de instalar no necesitas tener experiencia en INSTALACION de cámaras
5,For the price this camera kit is you can't go wrong the picture is great the cameras feel sturdy and the night vision is awesome only thing I found hard is figuring out all the different menus since theres so many different options.
5,Good
5,Great cameras for the price was easy to install
1,Poor video quality + its stupid to have this without a remote in it having to  Constantly get up to move the mouse around to watch a video is stupid also if a dang spider web gets on it the dang thing records it why is this even on the market ? It's very annoying when you wanna watch your notifications and this pice of junk try's it's best not to Play it I'm like wtf is up with this crap.
5,Product works great. Not 1 complaint
4,Simply a fantastic smoking value I love it
5,Hardware was easy to install.. setting up software takes some experience.  Have used 3 months now.
5,These are really great affordable cameras!!! They are VERY CLEAR and VERY EASY to manage and use. I DEF. RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE!!!
4,For the cost it is a good system
5,Quick delivery the packaging is great. Made a cool birthday present. Cousin is excited said the installation was easy and works great.
5,It’s not the best cameras you can buy but there cheap and dependable After a year it’s still working great plus the app is nice to have to check in while your away good customer service as well
5,The cameras are cheap cheap. They are very blurry. Had mine only a month 1 camera quit working and cant get it replaced. Stops recording with out notice
5,This set up so far is righteous
4,Camera was easy to install I had 0 issues.
5,I bought this item few months back easy to use and video quality is great. Great motion detection functions.
5,For the price I would say it doesn’t get much better wiring was quite an ordeal but after everything was finished I am very satisfied.
4,What i looking .expectations good
2,Unit was DOA. I read others had opened and found loose cables so i did... and found the disk cable not pushed on good. Got it working! They give you a power supply for the DVR but not the cameras. Cameras are not IP cameras in this package. EACH CAMERA NEEDS A POWER SUPPLY THAT IS NOT INCLUDED. The DVR & features are awesome and the camera quality is awesome. I can read a license plate at 50ft. They just need to get the lack of power supply issue fixed and do some quality control! Now to find some power supplies...
4,Great cameras. Just wish they had microphones for sound
5,Yes
5,Love these cameras i watch it off my phone looks great even at night just need to angle them right to get a clear picture
5,took me awhile to understand booklet
4,Very pleased with product and service
5,Not hard to set up. System is easy to use and excellent video.
5,Great
5,Good quality picture.  Cables are thin.  I had to replace 2 out of 4.
5,Perfect work. Easy to install and operate. Perfect customer service!
5,It was fairly easy to setup some cables are a little shorter then I'd like. All in all its well worth the money I think.
2,Pictures are excellent.SUPPORT is HORRIBLE they do not answer on followups.  The manual is almost useless and the on-screen  directions are misleading and in one case wrong.  The apps are full of errors or blocking situations Seems impossible to add a second phone with the app.  Still cannot figure out how to record. alarm with motion sensing OR play back OR access a specific time OR even if it recorded anything at all.In short EXCELLENT HARDWARE PISS POOR SOFTWARE/PROGRAMMING AND NO SUPPORT.  Thus I would avoid this company despite the price.
4,AAAAA+++++
5,once Amazon got the 4-1 splitter needed to hook up all 4 cameras this product works great and easy install
5,Works great - as expected.Would be great to have a wireless mouse so the DVR wouldn't have to be right by the TV.
5,Even though the software is a bit dated it is exactly what I needed. Easy install and set up.
4,Decent security cameras the image quality is a little grainy at night but the DVR more than make up for it.
4,Great system the directions was a little hard to understand if it wasn't for that it would of been 5 stars
1,Emailing to Annke support is like reading through Google Translator. The system's OS/GUI is that of the late 80's early 90's screen. The manual appears to also have been translated with Google. The pictures in the manual to not match the what is displayed on the screen. A lot of reviews for Annke products are fake. I would avoid any Annke products. One of their apps has been pulled by Google Play store due to privacy and security issues. They then want us to download the app from their site (outside an app store - which we will not) and then they wanted us to "try" a 3rd party app - of which we will not.
5,Excelent! I can see my house clearly from my cellphone.
4,Worked great .every once in a while the cameras goes go crazy just reset the power to them and they clear up
4,Works great in the day time. Night time picture could be better but I can't complain considering the price
4,It's fine it's working good
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I got this for affordability. Got these Sep 2020 it's March 2021. Not sure if cameras or wires. Do not like either way. 7/13/22 nope don’t like this
5,Great camera system just sucks I can't get the audio to come through.
4,good bang for your buck
4,I need four more cameras  to add to the system  one of the line didn't work plug was damaged .
5,good Product
5,Love the ckarity  of screen images
1,The system seemed to be working fine. Camera quality was good. Ran for about four hours and the DVR started to make a vibrating noise. Turned it on the next day and it continued to make noise. I returned the system since I had no confidence that it would last. Disappointed
5,Failry priced system. Working well and was easy to install.
5,Very nice and affordable unit. The system was easy to install. The video quality is very clear and sharp. One of the original camera was defective. The company sent a replacement pronto. Great costumer service. Will buy again.
4,Great Product
5,Installation a Little Complicated even For A Tech Savvy Person Like myself  but nonetheless well worth the trouble ! Works AWESOME!
5,Fast delivery easy installation good clarity  Good resolution and in color. I recommend this camera.
2,These cameras don’t last. They worked good ( during the day) but then one by one the cameras quit working for no visible reason. You can’t see anything at night unless the area is very well lit. The system arrived with no memory at all and we had to pay to send it to the company. The company installed the memory and sent it back refunding our shipping fees. Took about two weeks to get it back. I would not recommend this system.
5,love this thing remote viewing work great even 280 mile away but to get that work u really need to scan codes from screen when being set up very happy well be buying more camera's
5,Didn’t need tech support very nice for the price
5,Everything was good about the system.  Easy installation and great video.
5,Seem to be very good camera very clear view at all times.
5,this camera is everything I was looking for easy to work and easy to setup
5,dvr leaves off an odor
5,I very happy with this system.
5,we Intsalled these and they worked amazing! I would buy again for the next house
4,Works great! Great value for the price. Software could be better on both the DVR and the APP.
4,Met my expectations.
5,I have 6 camera systems and this one is great.  It has features that are on par with my $500 systems.  I will buy this product again for other locations.
5,This is my 2nd Annke security system i have purchased. Very satisfied.
5,No dislike At all overall great system using in a gun store!
1,I have owned and managed over a dozen systems CCTV mixed systems/hybrid etc. My old LaView from 2015 is STILL running 24/7/365 without ANY issues. So is my Westshine and Qsee. ANNKE Vision NOPE. 50% Camera Failure Rate within 6-month(under eves/covered) and zero signal or any activity now at OneYrFourMonth. A mid-sized door-stop i have now. If Annke was to actually get back to me then i can see what they MIGHT be able to do. Otherwise I would stick with a major brand of longterm experience. nothing like having to redo entire systems repeatedly thanks to attempting to be thrifty. OOPS.
4,working great so far.
5,I have had no issues everything worked out of the box. picture quality is good. of coarse running the wires were a pain this has nothing to do with the product
5,set up of email notifications a little difficult but finally got through it.
5,So far this system had been excellent!  Installation and setup was simple enough and the app works great!  I will expand the system and would recommend it to anyone.
1,I purchased this cheap system for my new home. At my old house I had a Samsung for many years and it worked flawlessly. I went with this based on the reviews. I finally got all of the cameras mounted and hooked up the system. No matter what I do I can’t get the picture to display to my tv. I’ve only tried the HDMI connection but I’m so disappointed. I’ve drilled holes in my house and spent a significant amount of time only for the system to not work. Do not waste your time or money on the this. Go with a more reputable company.
5,So far great! Way better than our old one. Was super easy to get going. Recommend for anyone needing some peace of mind!
5,Since I bought the security camera system about half a year agoit has been working very well. The noise generatedby the digital video recorder is minimal and negligible.I like it.
5,Easy to install and easy to use.
4,For the price a good set up. No  regrets.
5,This was a replacement for an old system so wires were already there and therefore I cant comment on the actual installation process. Seems to work just fine with no issues to date!
3,Bought a few months ago.  Had a few troubles  with the system but nothing too bad.  &  today it stopped working &  a blue light is blinking
5,Easy to set up good picture Comes with everything you need
4,Excellent I'm satisfied with the functionality of the camera
2,Camera work pretty good for the price but Iv already had trouble with one camera. 3 cameras are in full HD color during the day but one camera is poor quality in black and white. Also the QR code would not scan so I can have live viewing with my smart phone. Customer service is in another country of course and they only respond with e mails and links which is not helpful. So far I'm not pleased
5,Great system reasonably priced. Customer service after purchase is great as well. Staff is super helpful and want to make sure you're satisfied.
1,Worked good for a month so bought 4 more cameras to add to the system. Worked good for another month then it lost the feed to 4 cameras. I thought it may be the wires so bought new wire ran it got all but 1 to work for a day then lost feed to one that quit before and a new one lost feed so now back down 3 camera feeds. Then today the hard drive crapped out. Won’t record anything says can’t initiate hard drive and is glitchy now when clicking thru the menu options so I dunno.
5,Great quality have had no problems with. picture is great. easy set up. feel much better knowing I can check on things anytime..
5,Must have for home owners... quality is great. Easy to use. Definitely worth the price!
5,Got this awesome security system and nothing but positive things to say!  Very simple to set up and use. 1080p at its best!  Just needs a better user/installation guide.
5,Easy to install on a smart TV with no internet required
4,Good cameras sister loves themas they where a gift to her.
5,I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have had no problems with it in the two weeks that I have had it installed.
5,Can't get a better deal for that price.  Cameras are not high definition but for general surveillance they are just fine. Easy to setup.
5,Sweet Surveillance System! Now I know why installers charge so much...Pain in the Attic for sure!Picture quality great Iphone hooked up with a glitch DVR not fancy but the program is awesome.
5,Awesome system. Does everything you need for a security system. Quality is pretty good of picture. Night time picture is not as good as day but can't beat the price!
3,Must download a special player to watch on my computer and I need a flash drive to move the video file from the DVR to my computer. Difficult instructions. Too complicated.
5,The camera is very good. It will get the job done real good
5,Very good love these cameras
5,This product is amazing I could install the cameras and is so easy to use I like the app is easy to use the image that present is very good night vision works perfectly.
5,Easiest self installation ever. The best part though is during setup you link your smart devices via QR code and from then on you simply login to remote access.
5,Wonderful system
5,So far they have been incredibly awesome and easy to use 😊
1,Great entry level security camera. It is easy to set  up and the video quality is okay.After one year of use the outdoor cameras went thru  cold winter temperatures rain and hot temperature and were very reliable. The only issue I had was that the factory hard drive gave out with in a year. I reached out to the Annke for support but they never followed thru. I purchased a better surveillance hard drive and its good as new.
5,This system works awesome and even better the price is reasonable.
5,Love it but I thought it would have came with a remote control
5,Fantastic product. Its just what i needed and holds up to the harsh weather of Missouri. Recommend for anyone that wants to keep their home or business safe
5,lousy directions for every thing but with help you can get it working and then its a great unit
5,We love everything about these cameras the picture quality is great at night too
5,Excellent quality and view.
5,It is very good and it easy to use
2,ONE CAMERA DID NOT WORK SO I SWITCHED THE LEAD AND IT STILL DIDNT. THEY E-MAILED  BACK IT DID WHEN IT LEFT THE FACTORY. YA OK.  ALL PLASTIC LOW QUALITY!
5,Great quality for the price
5,Great system easy to install and toconnect to your cel phone.
5,Works great ez installation well worth the money
2,Installed it and I get no picture on my monitor when hooked up with an HDMI cable. Hooked it up with a VGA cable and now it works. HDMI port is definitely bad. Just gonna keep it instead of dealing with returning it. Manufacture is only open 7pm-11pm EST.. WTH?!
4,Works great and records good quality videos
1,I finally got this up and running yesterday and seemed to be recording and running fine. I got home today and found alot of motion alert messages. I went to watch the videos and found none. Not one recording. Called tech support and gave them my model number and he asked me to go through options that were not even on the DVR we did not even get the issue resolved. I am disappointed in this product.
5,Works fine except that I haven't been able to get  it to work on my phone. It is my wifi service problem not the device.
2,Included Manual lack operating information.There is more information on how to set up the internet connection.There is very little information on how to use all the applications.I was able to download 1 1/2 hour segment onto a external hard drive.PROBLEM download is in 6 second segments. I have 2500 segments.How do I combine the segments into one video document.
5,Very good quality. Impress on how clear the picture is at night. Was easy to install. Had some problems because didn't read instructions. But the seller respond my question very fast very helpful.
3,We didn't hook it up. Way to many wires. It's not wireless if it has a box full of wires .
5,Simple
5,These were easy to setup and look great.I've seen better quality but only when purchasing a $500+ CCTV system.Highly recommended but shipping is very slow.
2,The system works good and is easy to hook up. You will need a monitor to start the system up. I would change my review if I could get the app to see when I am away from home. It works at home on my wi-fi but not when away from home. I have read the manual don't understand what I should do to fix this.
4,good product clear picture
5,works good
4,Not real clear but it works
2,After the installation of the cameras I was setting them up to view on my monitor. Everything was going great but suddenly I get a “no permission” pop up. I cannot do anything if I click on cameras or view live it says that I don’t have permission. Anyone knows how to fix this issue?
5,La precisión
5,Great product does exactly what I needed and has stopped the vandalism!
2,So high tech not easy to install
3,1 of the 4 cameras didn't work. Other than that it works great!
5,Necesita mejor vicion norturna
5,This is a great camera system and easy to set up.  The picture is great and yes it does have a DVR that records.
3,Great product but no customer support  at a decent time of day
4,great love the product
4,Work good
5,The camera works great really helped out. A great buy! 👍🏻
4,Great for the price.
4,hey what do you expect from a cheap camera system?
3,It works but took a little work it was not easy hooking it up still don't have alerts going to my phone we still working on it
2,Never could get the motion detector to work. Not user friendly setting it up with multiple devices. Not happy with customer support. Camera’s have a great picture.
5,Very clear images. Easy to operate.
5,I can say that so far - (about 3 weeks) its up and running.. and Its Great for the price .... 100% HAPPY :)

5,Everything works as stated
5,Love them
4,works good
5,awesome system east install
2,Great looking Cams. Works nice. The video is really clear. Both day and night. Really wish I had purchased the wireless setup.This review was changed because the seller asked me to give a better review.I wouldn't get anything else from them.
5,Installing this weekend.
5,Image is perfect day and night
5,Excellent picture both day and night easy to install.

1,Not worth it.  These cameras are supposed to be inside outside but when you put them outside death gets inside of them and you can’t see any longer. The night vision is very poor you may be able to see somebody walking but you cannot see their face.  Motion detection is quite a bit off. The software says that you could block out certain areas so it does not pick up the motions but that does not work. The interface is designed very poorly.
5,Love it!
2,I have now bought three of these sets from SANNCE.  The DVRs have been great but in the first two sets I had a total of three bad cameras which I didn't bother saying anything about.  Unfortunately this time all 4 cameras are defective... have video to prove it... hope they will make it right.
5,Worked way better than expected...and quality of images is great would definitely buy again
5,Exelente vendedor. Muy bueno
5,Works Great. Bad weather effects remote viewing at times. Clear picture day and night. Well worth the price.
1,This turned out to be a nightmare.Installing the software and the phone app ended up badly but worse than that was the fact that you need a serial number to configure the device.Guess what the serial number for my system was invalid.The only reason this could happen if this is a counterfeit product so you should double check before you buy this.It will work for recording and reviewing on premise but it does not appear to be a genuine product
1,If you want to catch bugs rain and birds on camera then this is right for you.It does not however catch on camera people or bigger animals like cats skunks deer cougar etc.Tech support said they could do nothing about it.Never buying this brand again and returning ASAP.**update**Customer service reached out but when I replied to the email I was hacked.Very dishonest company!!
1,There is no tech support email only from China.  The obstructions are terrible.  Instructions say to plug red lead into the power plug on the dvr there is no power plug on the dvr.  It takes a separate power plug (not included) for the red leads.  I would give them a zero if it was an option.  Not a DYI system
5,Good system for the price.
5,Don't have any
3,The image in the camera is not clean
1,After installing one camera it was discovered that the HDD was never put in the package. After spending 15 minutes on the phone with some customer service lady she offered me a $15 dicount. Really!?! HDD's run for $50+ dollars! After explaining that to her she changed her mind and gave a $35 dollar discount Still not enough to purchase a new hard drive but better than taking the whole system down to return it.Just safe your self the hassle of missing anything and look else where for a camera system.
5,Easy to install easy to use
5,CLEAR AND HAD PLENTY OF CABLE
5,Absolutely a bargain at this price!  East to set up easy to install and easy to use!  I love it😄
2,This unit was placed in a rack and only used two cams. It broke w a terminal hard drive failure after about a year. I never liked the interface. We replaced with a much better piece from speco that does both legacy and tvi.
5,Great quality customer support. Catches even the small critters. Easy to review past recordings.
5,Exelente fácil de montar. 100% recomendable
5,Awesome 👍
5,Gives us peace of mind
5,Better than I expected!
3,System works great for the money but the instructions were nearly impossible to understand.
5,Quality is great day and night. Only thing I would like to see is to email a captured picture.
5,Wow what a great deal
5,Good
5,Everything worked just as described. Fast delivery easy to install and configure. Great Buy!!!!!
5,Good product easy setups.  Video looks good.  Note: recorder is not wireless must use an Ethernet cable.
5,works good but is not the best quality video but defiantly gets the job done for the price
5,Perfecto
3,It works I haven't installed it yet but I tried it
1,this was crap...pure crap...pooor quality and the dvd didn't even last a month....i totally regret this purchase and i would not recommend this to anyone.i believe its unfair for anyone to spend the money and receive crap for it in return because every dollar is hard earned cash....i emailed the seller but never got any feedbackin instances like these amazon needs to ban those people
5,Another happy customer .
5,Easy to install
2,The product does no looks clear and I thought it was going to be better so I spent 167 to get out of a company and it was not worth
1,Upon purchasing this product it advertises 1080p. When you open the box the drive is 1080p but the cameras are actually 720p. Extremely displeased with the product as far as what the advertisement says.  how can you offer 1080p in only produce 720p the quality is not the same and you should not advertise falsely.
5,Easy to install
3,Not a bad unit but one camera didn't work.
1,receiver stop receiving cameras pictures after 2 yrs right after 2 yrs warranty expired
5,Works great  easy to put camera 's up  I would suggest different screws
4,I think the DVR unit is a little slow still working on its .
5,Thank you very much lovem
1,Pretty much no tech support. Is not weather resistant. With in 6 months all the cameras out in the weather quit working.
5,Awesome I now have 8 cameras
1,I could not get it to connect to anything. It kept telling me that there was an incorrect verification code. The verification code was on the back of the unit. I emailed Annke about the issue and no one ever responded.
5,Love it
5,Better than I expected and easy to use and can add more cameras
5,Home security
1,A Cable defective have to buy a separate cable from different seller
1,Did not include cameras so it has been returned. Crazy me.. I seemed to think the description was clear that the "4 pcs 1080P cameras" meant they were in the box. Must be an old photo that includes the cameras as well.
5,Camera's work great!
3,Works ok. Customer service is terrible.
1,The camera quality is great but the instructions and manual are awful. There's not an 800 # you can call for customer support. You email..and you wait...very frustrating for someone who is not "tech" savy. I wish I had purchased the $$ one at Sams that comes with a monitor and the customer support to actually set it up. That alone is worth the money to me!
5,Cables provided along with the Cameras are the Big Plus.Camera quality is decent.
3,Videos aren't clear at night
5,House security
2,I paid $150 for this security system and it doesn't even come with the cables to hook the DVR up to a monitor
2,Terrible Security camera I don't recommended to anyone. No description or guidance at all they sent a handout which is not clear at all basically you have to figure it out yourself and after you do it doesn't work. Good luck.
5,The product is excellent. Good resolution and scope. cameras allow a wide viewing angle.
5,Works Great in both day and night! I would recommend these
5,Great
3,Complex for beginners
1,Hope you don’t get a defective cam out of the box. They will give you the run around to get it replaced.
5,I recommend this item work excellent 👍🏻
5,Works and is easy to access from pc and phone
5,This is a noce system. Much less expensive than other brands. Very easy setup!
5,good
2,System was easy to install hard drive is plenty big but the quality of the images is poor at best. Night images are like looking at illuminated blur. Sorry I could not recommend this system to anyone.
5,Great system amazing price
2,Nice when it works but 3 out of 4 cameras would get stuck in black and white mode consistently. Camera quality isnt there. I returned this item.
5,It's the best for it's price.
5,Very good system. Clear camera view no complaints.
1,This is a kids toy. Do not waste your time. I can't even read a t-shirt at 20 ft in broad daylight. I have another system at my office and it blows this away.
5,Great productFast shippingThank you
5,Love it but order extra wires u may need
1,THIS CAMERA IS WAY WAY WAY TOO COMPLEX. IF YOU WANT A NICE SIMPLE SYSTEM THIS IS NOT IT. TOO MANY COMPUTER FEATURES AND TOO HARD TO OPERATE
5,Extremely easy to use step by step directions. Remote viewing works :)
2,Easy to install!  I ordered this system several months ago but I didn't get it installed until last week.  Remote stopped working 2 days after set up!
5,Customer service is awesome they're quick and easy to resolve the problem. A+++
1,Can't download "Annke Vision App" on Androids or Computer. Waste of money!! Don't purchase!
5,Annke CS Rep Stephani VG. was very outgoing  and curious in helping me set up my device. She was also very  Patient with me as I looked fir thing that she was tell me to do. Being new to the system. Overall I would like to speak to her everything I call the company if need be.
5,Great price great quality fast delivert
5,I will be buying more
1,Most of it was missing and what I did get was used.. VERY UNHAPPY.... Could not understand the person from customer service...
2,Picture not too good an having problem down loading to my cell phone
1,Picture quality is great installing is easy the downfall is you can’t connect to support group to talk. I’m having trouble viewing it on my iPhone while away from my house I hate them
1,The cameras that came with the unit are trash. 2 of the 4 have failed one melted out the power the other one quit working on night mode.
5,Love them great quality
5,Great product and fast delivery
1,Vga port stopped working. Was told to switch to the hdmi port. I refused. Got a replacement. Vga worked about a week. Same thing. Had to order 40ft hdmi cable so to use hdmi port. Impossible to view from away from home. Settings are very difficult.
5,Easy setup and great quality!
4,I am very happy so far I just can't figure out how to keep cameras online.  They only seem to go online (so I can access via app) if someone is in the barn where they are located.  If no one is in there it goes offline and we cannot access it through the app.  I need to be able to look in at animals remotely.
2,Throughly Displeased
5,Awesome product. Works great!
5,BERY GOOD GRACIAS
2,Very disappointed. Way to difficult to review any recordings. Would not purchase again
5,Fast delivery and great product support.
1,I can not get it to work!!!
1,Wanted to upgrade my system cameras and Dvr  the cameras are good but the features for Dvr were a lot less than the Dvr I had so there was no upgrade only a down grade shipped back
5,Great system for the price.
5,So far so good. Happy with everything.
1,I don't know where these reviews came from but mine in junk it's stuck in night mode won't stay online the app remote view don't work well customer service don't answer calls back very late at night I mean wow
3,The cameras themselves work pretty well. The night vision is just as good as my previous more expensive surveillance system. Motion detection works well and the picture quality is satisfactory. My issues with the system so far are one the set up process is very difficult to understand. The instructions are not very clear and trying to connect to my phone has proven impossible even with looking online for additional support I have still not been able to figure out my issue. I know it has something to do with the internet connection but I cannot seem to get everything to match up so I've given up and just use the cameras without the phone. Second there's a lot going on in the maintenance/ system setup that I just don't understand so I'm not sure if I am getting the most out of the system or not. I'm usually pretty smart when it comes to tech stuff but these cameras seem to have me scratching my head with a constant look of confusion on my face whenever I try to play with the different options.
1,Less than a year and it went the hard drive just stopped working
5,Love it!!!
1,Works great.no problems with product. hard to find an app that don't cut out or free to view from away from home. Update : This company does not honor its warranty. Hard drive failures. Camera's lose color and go blue.
5,A must have!
1,Forgot my system password and now the whole thing is useless.. No way to reset it and no information available online. Overall this was a bad purchase and would not recommend it to anyone.. DO NOT BUY!
5,Good  product at a good price
1,Again product and Amazon are great. Customer service leaves a lot to be desired..
5,Nice
5,easy to install and have good resolution cameras.
5,Does everything it says 100% satisfied
5,Great item!!!!! plug and play system....
5,Nice quality got it in no time
2,Camera has decent views. Very poor assistance or no manual for setting up motion detect and notifications.
1,Cameras only worked for 4 days and could not get them to work again. Sannce customer service doesn't exist unless you call china and that's no help at all. Would not recommend this system to anyone.
5,It is very easy to instal
5,Easy to set up. Good clear images

5,Great value for what you're getting! Easy to set up and customer support will guide you well!
4,The night vision is wonderful
3,The system from a hardware point of view is really amazing for the price. Connecting things up is pretty intuitive; worked right out of the box the first time. Night vision works for limited distance; to be expected. Connecting to the internet was done with a wireless bridge in client mode; again without an awful lot of pain. Sounds pretty good so far.The bad....Instructions when needed I am guessing are Chinese converted to English. Very choppy wording and a bit of a struggle at times to understand. There doesn't seem to be version levels on the written material in what is supplied and what is on the internet; a lot of the stuff is back level and no longer correct as you discover by trial and error. This matters when you try to get some of the software working. The event mask and event record doesn't seem to work. You get event history but not in the area that you picked for trigger. I never could get the "send me an email" software to work and I did put a lot of time in on it. Support for the US is not covered with a toll free number and I believe is good for just 4 hours daily. In all fairness I haven't yet tried it.  But for $150 it's not bad!
4,Initially bought some high price cameras. After watching a few videos displaying this camera I decided to try them out. They work just as the high price cameras do in my opinion they even work better.
3,Edit: Update after about 4 days of operating cameras. I have had pretty good results from 3 of the 4 cameras but one of the cameras isn’t switching from day to night mode by itself. Curious to see if this will happen to any of the other cameras.Is a very good product so far. I got all set up today and it the picture quality is great! The motion detection is nice especially because it can be adjusted but it takes a while to get it nailed down. The night vision works very well and you can see a lot! I would order again. Will update if something changes.
4,Very good
3,Setup was pretty easy but I'm having a problem with it now. Waiting on support. When it works it works very well.
5,We bought the 8 channel system that came with 4 cameras. It's a great purchase and easy to use and gives us peace of mind knowing we have cameras covering our property. We like it so much we are planning on purchasing 4 more cameras to add on.
5,our cars were vandalized and this product gave the officers a clear view of who it was. Unfortunately they have not closed the case yet. Investigations ongoing the detective wants the driver too. Cameras may help you too.
5,easy setup! great picture!
5,I have purchased multiple of these systems and cannot complain from any of them 10/10 overall
5,Definitely a good investment for keeping an eye on things. Whether you're home or away. crystal clear picture and excellent night vision.  I have it hooked into a computer monitor and my 55" flat screen and smart phone. I definitely recommend this security surveillance set up to everyone.
3,I received mine and it works great in all but that I cant activate the recording. it was suppose to come with a 1tb hard drive built in but i cant find any hint of it. This is the only glaring error i have with the system beyond that this system had clear view easy set up and the remote viewing is extremely simple and accessible. I hope to be able to contact them to fix this issue but any support lines are not readily available.tl;dr Great system Works like a charm great remote viewing Missing 1tb hard drive
5,As far as a live monitoring security system this exceeded my expectations and had so many good extra features.We ordered this set to replace an older set that stopped working. I was afraid the quality wouldn't be as good because they weren't as expensive but it was honestly far better. We had a problem with one of our cameras but customer service helped us quickly and were very friendly.I definitely recommend this set to anyone who is looking for a security system.
5,Great deal on this system. Very easy to set up and use. Also very easy to set up the mobile app on iPhones. Just download the app and scan the QR code.... It instantly connects! The picture is crisp and clear even at night good security system!
1,My only concern is that the cameras are powered by a cord. That cord is only six feet long with a four part split for four cameras. My set up has four BNC video cords that are sixty feet long. But the power cord is six.feet.long.If I could I would return this item.60 foot video cord+6 foot power cord for the cameras=WTF
1,No matter what kind of hard drive you install this device seems to destroy it by some magic. Also when the hard drive DOES work it only records for a couple of weeks and then you have to reformat the drive to get it working again after an "exception error". Also email alerts simply don't work. The device seems unable to even send emails. Both problems are well-documented on the Annke forums but there are no answers to any of them. Also the tech support is nonexistent. I'm currently on hold  (again) and it's 1 hour and 33 minutes so far. Don't buy anything from this company. We're talking about your home security. I promise you will regret buying this shtuff. I'm goign to order a new one from somebody else and junk this in the garbage. I'll video mysefl doing it and poste it on Youtube. Let me know if you want to see the video.
1,The one star is simply for customer support. The cameras have a great picture and the DVR works as needed but comes with little to no instructions and the instructions you get tell you nothing so you have to resort to calling the customer support line which is only available in the US from the hours of 7-11 am and 8-12 midnight in the pm. Then when you get a person on the line they are rude and barely speak English. They don't know what they are doing cause I think they are reading from scripts given to them and they all seem to be women from China pretending to know about the product. I don't recommend this product to anyone unless you are very familiar with security systems and can do it yourself. Terrible customer service support.
2,DO NOT CONNECT MORE THAN 1 OF THESE TO YOUR NETWORK.I connected two and could not get the port forwarding to stick for remote access. This is due to them having identical mac addresses. This is a basic oversight that should have never made it past the development stage. Avoid if you need more than one.
1,I just want to copy video footage to my computer and copy to a cd  not sure how to do this and no off switch  DVR does not shut down system
1,Not happy at all. Tech cant resolve the problem. I'm on the 2nd dvr and nothing works
5,High quality pictures. It has 4 cameras. It is enough for a big house.
5,I loved the look and feel of these cameras. The picture quality is fantastic and night vision is flawless.This was so easy to turn on and start using. We love them. beautiful video and great night vision Video playback is wonderful. Great quality and best price
5,Not finished with installation. Like it so far.
5,Good
4,I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.The installation was quite easythe images are clear and the motion detection feature notifications are spot on.. This is a great product overall.
5,Good camera night vision & motion detection work fine!!
4,Easy to assemble. The wires took time to unravel it was a mess but I got it. And once everything was hooked up I was glad I purchased. Having neighbor problems and this gives more security. you do NOT need internet unless you want to view remotely
2,I have a blink camera connected via WiFi which sporadically stops. I figured this is because it is not a wired connection. I saw a neighbor who recommended this ANKKE brand. I bought it wired it up and was immediately disappointed there’s NO AUDIO. I can live with this. The setup and user interface is terrible albeit manageable if you are using this camera sparingly. Moving forward or backwards on the device takes a long time. For the app it takes 2min clips which always start with 20 seconds of no motion sensors. So when you see motion detected you play the video wait 20 seconds then see any motion it detected. I find the motion detection to be very finicky and unreliable. I get dozens of notifications of a moth but last night got nothing when a coyote came into my front yard right in view of the camera. The night vision is good but WILL NOT CAPTURE A LICENSEPLATE OR TAG SO I can’t rely on this to notify me when there is true motion unfortunately.
5,Wasnt expecting it to be this good of quality. Really happy with this highly recommended for anyone wanting a camera system. Even the app is easy to use. Really good HD quality video.
5,easy set up easy to use dvr and great quality from day and night with the camera motion dection catches everything and easy to link to your phone also can share access to the app with an option to just show the live feed I definitely recommend for a home security system.
5,Easy to install great quality..Love the night vision! Using this system on our 40’ diesel pusher RV for views of all 4 sides while driving.
1,I've have these cameras for less than 90 days and they stopped working I paid a decent amount of money for them and I can't return them  although from no fault of mine they have stopped working  reading the comments I see there's many more with the same problem. Don't buy this trash and someone is going to refund my money so I can buy some good cameras or the BBB will be notified
1,I have had this system 4 months and have never got stable power to box. I tried replacing the power supply several times and it doesn't seem to be enough power connecting internally. I contacted Amazon to ask they switch box but they refused because it was past the return window. I have since researched and wish I did not spend my money on this brand. You can only get at Amazon not Best Buy and it seems to be easily hackable and the power supply and components are shoddy and not at all durable. Overall this is cheaply made unreliable and they will not back their products with replacements
5,Need to play with it to learn all functions.  Great. Tech support.  Full of futures not advertised
5,The installation process of the camera is simple. I can quickly complete the installation without reading the instructions. There are some labels on the cable lines so I have no any confusion about the connection with cameras and DVR. The 60-ft cable length is enough for my family to use. I do not need to buy the extension cables. After installing the system the resolution and picture quality are not bad. Compared with other products of the same price it is already pretty good to have such a sharpness. However after moving the camera the picture will be blurred for a short time but it can be restored quickly. Does not affect the overall imaging effect. Overall this camera is worth to buy.
5,Que tiene buena visión tanto de día como de noche
5,I can not believe the clarity of the image we are viewing. If you want to feel safe or feel safe when you are away from your house; make this investment.Easy to install and setup. Very good coverage of the area you want to monitor. Excellent video quality. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone needing a surveillance system.
4,So far so good
5,When I got this I was replacing another system I had for 10 years that was on its way out. I had a little trouble getting this up and working at first.  I got it working pretty quick and had a lighting storm a few days later and the power supplies stopped working.  Ugh. But I replaced the power supply for the DVR and the cameras and now everything works Great!  I had everything in multible surge suppressers. Works great now so I am happy.  So 5 stars despite a minor set back.
5,Just put them up.today really like the quality of the cams picture both day and night worth the money
1,Its virtually unuseable IF you select the option to be sent notifications of alarms it senses. I get at least one every 5 seconds from bugs and birds  on my phone. had to shut notifications off as it is out of control  and that is with sensitivity set to lowest . I think the red glow of the camera  ir  lites attract the insects. its no good without notifications  instructions are bad and night ir is bad. Also if intruder didnt put their face up to the camera you could never identify them its that bad. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a surveillance system.
5,night vision not great all else is great
5,Very nice for good vision
5,So far they work great.  No issues
5,Very happy with this product.
5,Great set of cameras worked great
5,I got these for my campground and driveway to see when people are coming and going. Really nice camera and dvr. A bit of a challenge to run the wire but great results. Still learning the preferences and options!
5,Love the system easy to use and not real difficult to setup
5,Excellent product. I have had this for a couple years now and it works perfect!! I would highly recommend.
5,cool
5,Excellent
5,These are awesome cameras and system. I yse it everyday and can login from anywhere with the app
5,I’m happy we bought this system but it could’ve come with better use instructions. Customer service has limited hours but they always got back to me quickly. Very happy with the purchase and would buy again.
5,I have to say I was worried when I purchased this that it wouldn't be the best quality. I am happy to say that is not the case! This is a great system picture quality is really good and setup was easy. The cameras have very good picture in both day and night vision which was a pleasant surprise. I have motion alerts set up for all 4 cameras around my house and it is nice to know what is going on at all times even when not at home. Setting up the motion zone is easy and there are videos on YouTube showing how to do everything this dvr is capable of which is great. The annke vision app works well and I have had no issues with it either! It has been a short time couple months that I've had it up and running so we will see how it holds up in the long run but I am hopeful it will last. All in all I am very happy with it and I would recommend it!
5,I put this in my shop all the notifications go to my phone.  I kept getting a ping and when i checked the video - a fly (facepalm).  By 10 in the morning I have 100 notifications  they are very sensitive and this is a good thing but it can also be very annoying.  I bought two more systems for two more houses.
5,Quality and support
