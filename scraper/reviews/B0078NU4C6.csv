4,When I first bought the product I misread the description and thought adhesive would be backed to the strip. That's my mistake and not affecting the product's 4 star review.It comes in the box coiled which causes the inner coil to keep a slight bend to it. I've been unable to "train" for it out of the bend and because the product falsely claims to not need adhesive it loses a star. That said the remainder of the product uncoiled just fine and was easy to install. The quality is in fact better than I expected and I can tell it's very sturdy. I don't regret buying it. I'll just need to tape a section of it down. The brown color blends well to our floor.
5,The material and construction are just as sturdy as you might wish while remaining flexible and very resistant to damage from impacts or dragging. I have a destruction oriented puppy and am not concerned about these covers. The cover just lays flat on the floor there's no built in adhesion and if I changed one thing it's some added friction to the bottom to help it stay put on a slick floor. Easily fixed with tape or glue though.
4,We're running electrical cords across a room with hardwood floors. It's far too easy to trip over those cords so I ordered this cord cover and it works very well.This is fairly heavy flexible material so it doesn't need to be stuck to the surface beneath it. It holds itself down simply with its own weight.The cover was folded for shipping and - about a month later - it still hasn't fully flattened out. (I've now taped it in place to "train" it to remain flat. So far so good.)The manufacturing quality is excellent. It doesn't look cheap. In fact even though it's not the same color as our floor it seems to blend in nicely.I'd buy this again. It's at least a four-star product and an excellent value for the price.
5,I need to run an Ethernet cable in the room I rent. The landlord didn’t want holes drilled. There is about 3 feet of floor where the cable would run however it’s a high traffic area for other roommates and they will trip. Since putting this in not a single person has tripped. Since it is in a high traffic spot in the house it does get cuffed up but you can see it on the floor in the middle of the night.
4,Very long. Used a little and saving the other part for next time. No adhesion at all. Very sturdy and quite easy to install. I had to buy my own tape though. That's not good to me and quite a waste. Not sure if I'll buy this again anytime soon but we'll see.....far into the future.
5,Perfect to cover cords running across the room.  No on trips on them anymore as no our robot vac doesn’t get tangled. Just bought my second one.
5,I had always used a rug to cover the cords that ran across the traffic pattern in my room but this is way better!  Matches my flooring even so it isn't such an eye sore.
4,Arrived on time and easy to install. Measuring and cutting helps with getting a customized length. It worked for what I needed it for. Thanks so much!My apologies if I already put a review. So much going on. Feel free to remove my comment.
5,I’ve used this on my outdoor step to hide a wire but also for safety concerns to for my landscaping lights I had to run a wire across my step. As far as the adhesive tape that came with this is junk but I also needed something more heavy duty which I purchased to stick to concrete! So far so good waiting for winter months now to see how well it holds up!
5,This was absolutely perfect for hiding my electrical cords!
4,Does the job but could be a bit wider.
5,Works just fine. I would put done
4,I have a 12/3 drop cord for my imersl shop island table.  This won't even close up around it  so it's not made for anything other than smaller wiring. It also doesn't stay on very well  is flimsy and kind of thin  so it bends really easy  letting the cords fall out.  If you plan to use this in an office with smaller wires  and not many wires  then this may work.  But if you need something to stand up to a bit of traffic and retain the wires well  I'd suggest looking at other products like I have to do now.
4,Used to hide extension cord from a floor outlet to under the couch to connect lamps. The choice of colors was lacking as a light tan would match the wooden floor better.The recess for the cord has a thin lip that doesn't quite easily contain the cord while inserting and it took a week or more for the rubber to completely relax from bringing coiled up.
5,Quality and length perfect for my need. The robot vacuum goes right over it no problem. The extra length worked out great as I needed a 6' section and a 6" piece. Used small pieces of alien tape to adhere. Now I don't have to do any preparation for the vacuum to run on a schedule.
5,My wife is on oxygen 24/7 and the hose gets stuck under furniture and other objects and also gets stuck in the wheels of her walker when she tries to cross over it. This product has helped to eliminate those problems
5,it’s very flexible and relaxed after an hour. was easy to install. it would be great if a double stack type take was provided too
5,Unrolled it - NO CURLING. Immediately lay flat 'embraced' the cable smooth fit on the floor - PERFECT!!!
4,Needed to run an extension cord accross the porch for a small water feature. Does the job.
4,Easy to use
5,Easy to use and fits large extension cords
5,Matches my floor perfectly can barely tell there is anything there. Keeps all my cords nicely tucked away
5,My lazyboy chair is plugged in and not against the wall.  This blends in with our dark floor saves us from tripping and also let’s the robovac slide right over.  Very happy.
4,I bought this to cover a phone wire at work between my desk and the wall until the phone can be moved to a new location. The product worked great! I liked that there was no adhesive because I didn’t want to chance damaging the carpet at mg workplace. And it’s heavy enough it’s not needed. However with that said packaging/shipping was garbage. It arrived wrapped in plastic but was half ripped open. There were dented scratches and color stains periodically through about the first two feet of product. However after that everything looked great and worked well for what I needed.
5,Fast and easy to use.Fits smaller extension cords only.Works great!
5,Does what it says: keeps birds in check not all over the floor. As described.
5,Easy to install
5,I needed this to cover a thicker cord for a surge protector. It fit with a little persuasion and the bottom flaps popped back into place. I did not use the side channels.  Since it was a thicker cord the protector does not lie completely flat on the carpet. There is a very minimal gap on each edge but not enough to catch your foot.  It is comfortable to step on with bare feet and does not shift on the carpet. Vacuum cleaners easily glide over it. I cut it to fit with pruning shears with no problem.
5,I have a gazebo in the middle of my patio and I run electric to it with a long extension cord.  I bought this cover to hide the cord and avoid a tripping hazard.  The light gray color blended in well with my pavers and it was super easy to just lay down cut pieces to length if required and insert the cord.  The fit was just right for one medium duty extension cord I do not think it would be able to handle much more but I have not personally tried.  This worked well for my needs looks clean and it has hardly moved on the ground in a few months.
5,Product came quickly and was easy to install. Thanks for a great product.
5,works great but there was not adhesive. taped down on slate floor with duct tape.
5,It’s weight keeps it in place nicely. Exactly what I was looking for.
5,I bought this to hide the cords that go between both of my couches. It does the job!
5,This worked and doesn’t leave any residue or tripping hazards
5,I purchased a new desk with a built-in power strip. Thus allowed me to place the desk in the center of the room and plug in the power strip without creating a tripping hazard.
5,Job is done
5,Used to cover an extension cord on my patio. Did not use the adhesive lays nice and flat on its own.
5,Works as expected.
5,Easy enough to put cords through & no issues. There’s no adhesive on the bottom. It still stays on the floor flat as long as the cords are straightened out. Works for me.
4,Needs double-sided tape to secure to floor.  Otherwise. it works
5,I thought this product was great if you need it to completely stay in place at all times k would ad an adhesive. I didn’t because It doesn’t move enough for me to care haha.
5,… in hiding a heavy-gauged power extension cord on a tiled floor … prevents the cord from looping and potentially create a tripping hazard … perfect … lies flat and unobtrusive…
5,This is made with durable rubber material and feels like it will last quite a few yrs. Was easy to use and decent price. 5 stars
5,Good quality easy to cut and fit to area.  As described received quickly.
4,Good product NOT for thicker courts.
4,This didn't hide as many cables as I'd like but it did hide the two that were the most important.It also slides a little.
4,We've 3 of these for months and we still can't get the ends to lie flat very well. Other than that they have been great.
5,Can get 2 cords covered at once if patient
4,I like that this lays flat and holds the wires. I wish it had a larger slit for the thicker cord of my surge protector but it does have a low profile which it wouldn’t have it held a thicker cable. Unfortunately it doesn’t stay in place when my robo vac runs into it. I’ll have to always watch while that’s running so it doesn’t push everything around and pull the small wires to my power recliners out.
5,I was worried about the color match and how easily the material would “relax”. Color matched our floors pretty well. The item was nearly relaxed after unrolling it from its packaging. With 30 minutes in the sun it was fully relaxed. Easy to to trim with a utility knife. Overall very satisfied with this item.
4,Hides the cords
3,It should do what it needs to but the one I received is definitely NOT 6'. I'm 5'7"ish and it's noticeably shorter than I am. Not annoying enough to return it but still irritating.
5,Using 3 of them inline outdoors to prevent tripping on pool cable across concrete patio. Stays straight on ground doesn't curl. Only consideration was that dampness gets trapped underneath following a rain. This is not anything the manufacturer can prevent unless it were to have a supplemental lower cap placed over the bottom. To address I've duct taped the bottom after the cable is inside to keep water out; worked great.
3,It barely fits one XLR and headphone cable. If you're running anything more look at larger options. It's also a bit *too* floppy and doesn't protect the cables much. Will definitely cause problems with a cable over time if you keep stepping on it. I guess I shouldn't be surprised for the price it works for now.
3,This is just a sturdy piece of rubber-like plastic that lays  on the floor through its own weight (no adhesion).  It has a channel to hide an electric cord and will most likely keep you from tripping over the cord.  A robot vacuum will glide over it as well.  At the end of the day it's a lot of money for a bit of soft plastic.
3,This covered what it needed to but it is on the flimsy side. It "bends" too easily and is very light. Didn't return it because we made some adjustments to it.
5,I love that this unrolls easily and stays flat without any adhesives.  It was easy to cut to length with regular kitchen scissors.  It's soft on your feet and the color blends nicely with my floor tile.  I used it to cover cords from the electric recliner loveseat across an opening to the end table.  Looks a lot better than those two black cords and now maybe the cords will quit getting pulled from the couch. This is the 2nd one I've gotten from DLine.  Made in the USA.  Great products.
5,Great product
5,Lays flat. Cords tuck in so easy
4,These covers look great and work great. The only thing is the space on the bottom of the covers where you place your cords is a little narrow.
5,I wanted to run an extension cord under a baseboard radiator -- I just cut this to the exact length tucked the cord inside and pushed it under the radiator all the way to the wall. Simple to do the cord is protected from the heat and since it is close to the color of the radiator cover and the floor it's pretty inconspicuous.(Really it IS there if you look very closely -- though it's easier to see the cord as it extends around the woodwork than it is to see the cover under the baseboard radiator.Love it.
4,Not tripping over extension cord any more
5,The light tan color shows dirt marks from shoe treads instantly and badly. Returned the tan and got the dark brown and it's perfect. No issues with it curling like people have complained about with other manufacturers.
5,It blends perfectly with our hardwood floors. It eliminated the trip hazard of an extension cord I ran to the couch.
5,After uncoiling one end was up a bit. Laid in the sun for a few minutes took care of that. The height is minimal so as not to be a stumbling hazard. The quality of material is outstanding and when stepped on gives under foot.
5,Very beautiful and sturdy product - the only negative is that it collects dust easily so keep a wipe cloth handy in case you are moving it around.
4,I had hardwood floors installed and needed to run my cable wire across the room.  The previous cable ran under the carpet but hardwood floors are a different animal.  I replaced the cable with a longer one and ran it against the wall.  I had one section in a doorway and this product hid the cable and held it down well.
5,Too cover up internet Cable
4,Works well - using it to run the wires for Holiday lights that are overlapping the front walkway. There was an issue with it curing up (it arrives as a wrapped up package) so that needed extra tamping down but otherwise it keeps the wires safe and trip-proof.After this use I would need and use it for other areas of the house and backyard.
5,I've used this brand for years. It comes rolled up but within a few days of laying on the floor it becomes flat. Plenty of room to stuff & protect multiple power and data cables. In professional use we would gaff tape these to the floor but at my home I just let it lay flat and people just naturally step on or over it. I've never had one break or rot they are a very good quality vinyl. You could put some strong double stick tape on the bottom if you plan to have it in place for a long time and don't want it to move.
5,Works as anticipated. Blends in nice with tan colored indoor/outdoor carpet
5,I had bought another Floor Cord Cover which came with 2-sided adhesive tape but even being taped down it would not lay flat.  This Floor Cord Cover however lays flat and stays put even without taping it down.  I view the fact that it's made in the USA (as opposed to Taiwan) as a bonus.  I suppose some proof that the USA can still make good quality competitive products.
5,Works very well protecting a length of cord. No adhesive you’ll have to add some yourself if desired.
5,These types of products have been around for a long time and still a lot of folks don't seem to understand that tripping over exposed cables and wires is not a good idea. Install these to prevent tripping hazards. Make OSHA and yourself happy at the expense of trauma facilities and orthopedic surgeons.
5,A great solution for our need!
5,I hired a handyman to mount my TV and Sound Bar.  The need for longer power cords caused us to leave the job incomplete for a few days.  I went to Amazon.com and ordered the longer cords and noticed the D-line competing products.  D-line has VIDEOs included in the ad's to show how to use the products.  That was all it took!  I ordered one for the wall under the TV and sound bar wires and one for the floor to cover a cord that crosses a doorway.  Now I'll have to return the inferior product I bought locally.  I highly recommend D-line products!The D-line video included in the ad gave me the confidence to handle the floor cord cover by myself.  I unpackaged the 6 foot length and took it over the the door in question.  I measured how much of the cover would need to be used from a point below the outlet to a point just past the door jam.  Using a sharp pair of shears the cover cut easily and smoothly.  I then tucked in the cord into the center channel flipped over the unit so that the flat side was down and my job was complete.  Thank you D-LIne!  Excellent well thought out products  with common sense and simplicity in mind.
5,Sturdy and easy to install
5,We had 3 cords to hide against the wall it looked so messy.  This cord cover was easy to put up the adhesive works well.  It just looks like a molding along the bottom of the wall.
4,I moved my furniture away from the wall and needed something to hide the lamp cords (and to prevent tripping over them). This worked perfectly!  I would have given 5 stars but I thought it was a bit pricey.
4,I got this to cover some cords at my gallery -- they go across doorways and we don't want anyone to trip. I like that this is heavy duty and actually surrounds the cord instead of just covering it -- the rubber part wraps around the cord to hold it in better. Six feet is enough to do one doorway and the distance from our desk to the wall outlet so one package of this was enough for our needs. I didn't have time to flatten it out before using it so I currently have it taped down on the edges because it still rolls up a bit. After time it should be find on its own but I'll probably still tape down the edges for extra safety. Our floors are concrete and painted linoleum and this lays fairly well on that without slipping but you can never be too safe.So far it works well for what we needed.
5,Works great.  Lay flat and set outside in the in the sun for a couple of hours once opened and it will lay flat also very easy to cut (if needed) when it is warm.
5,Got this to cover Christmas light cords outside to keep them from being a tripping hazard. We've been really impressed by how well it keeps everything down and stays flat against the sidewalk.
5,It was absolutely what I wanted. Easy to install stays In place and durable. The color blends well with our wood floors. We have about 5 feet behind sofa and covers lamp cords perfectly. I would recommend this!!!
5,This was just what I needed. We wanted to bring an electrical outlet to the kitchen island but didn't want to drill on the floor. This cord cover was the perfect solution it is flat enough not to get on the way sturdy enough to retain its shape and the adhesive stays in place. It has been the perfect solution for our kitchen.
5,Unlike other cord holders this one is strong the wires stay in and it lies flat willingly - no need for heat or to weigh it down at first.
5,It was easy to apply.
5,It works. Not damaged.
2,The material is nice but not ridged enough for large gauge extension cords. It’s very frustrating trying to stuff heavy duty cords into a very wimpy and very soft cord cover.For the $75 bucks I’m dissatisfied. If this is for a smaller application I’d also be dissatisfied. The cover is so so so soft that it’s impossible to make a clean and straight cable run which is the entire point of these types of products.
5,This product is very useful for quick setup and is also sturdy! The only thing be mindful is the number of cables that will go into it!Note the gauge of the cable before you purchase the appropriate cable cover
5,The material is heavy duty but compliant enough to lay flat on the floor. Can be easily cut to fit a specific space i.e. doorway. I bought a similar product from a big box office supply store and it would never lay flat causing a trip hazard this one lays flat after a couple days out of the packaging. I highly recommend it to protect/hide your cords.
4,This is a great product. Very flexible and sturdy and it really does pretty much lay flat when unrolled. I am deducting 1 star for no adhesive included. It's not a huge deal but I think people pretty much expect it and if you don't have any double sided tape around and want to stick it down it could be annoying.It is very small. IDK why but I just kind of pictured a 1 size fits all. It doesn't. I don't knock the product for that. I should have paid attention. I was trying to cover a heavy duty HDMI medium sized extension cat6 and 3 medium guage speaker wires. Not a chance!I would say this is big enough for 2 average sized extension cords in the main channel and POSSIBLY a smaller guage speaker wire down each of the outer channels.
5,We used this light duty cord cover to enclose an electrical cord snaking across our living room floor which was a potential trip hazard. The cover is pre-slit on the bottom so it was easy to insert the cord (the cover can accommodate two cords up to 0.31 inches in diameter). We ended up using the entire 6-ft length but it would be easy to trim it if necessary. The material is a somewhat flexible PVC which makes it comfortable to walk across even in bare feet. This cover is also manufactured in 30-ft lengths.
5,
5,Simple to set up - meets my needs
5,A real lifesaver with our puppies the cords are now protected and so are they.
4,Had to run cord from office to front room and had cord laying on floor as trip hazard for about two years.  Finally decided to fix it and was super easy. Got the black color to match darkly stained original wood floors.  It’s a utilitarian purchase and there really aren’t any “cute” solutions to the problem.  Doesn’t come with adhesive backing.  Since I was laying on wood floor and not carpets i affixed with Velcro strips.  Which raised the profile a bit.  But not much.
5,Worked well. Quality.
5,Bought these for our condo building – we wanted a cover for our security camera extension cord on the front porch as well as an indoor extension cord running to a wifi extender in a back closet. Looks much much cleaner professional and under control and no longer a tripping hazard!
5,I’m loving this product to the point I bought a whole other roll my Roomba is able to go over
5,To hide a drop cord. I had a lamp at the end of the sofa and no convenient outlet.
5,It came exactly as described. Good material heavy weight and came unrolled nicely so it lays nice and flat across the floor without having to heat it up or anything like that. It seems to be holding up very well no signs of it tearing up or anything. One suggestion I have is to make sure you wipe both it and the floor well with rubbing alcohol before sticking adhesive on it. Clean surface and a good adhesive like doubled sided gorilla tape will hold it down for a long time no problem.
5,Very well-made product. Easy to use and trim to desired size. Highly recommended.
3,Le he estado dando un buen uso lastimosamente no venía con el adaptador para unir 2 cintas y además no cuenta con buena adhesión de igual manera eso se puede arreglar con cinta doble faz.
5,I was concerned when I read all the on line reviews about similar products.  Most reviews indicated the product did not lay flat without a lot of effort (hot water soaking etc).  This product came as a coil and when I unrolled it it was already flat except the ends.  I did a reverse coil overnight and the piece lays completely flat on our carpet.  There is some give to the product so you don't even really appreciate much of a bump as you walk over it.  It is in a high traffic area in a bedroom and we have had zero issues with tripping over the cord since it was installed.  I already have a second piece to install in a separate room.
5,Several reviews have mentioned the limited space inside this conduit.  I agree but this was just what I needed for the product.  It took a bit of effort but after straightening the product (hot water method was easy) I trimmed the ends off and was able to force in a good sized power cord from a power strip plus oner audio cable for my PA.  This was all the product was able to hold but perfect because my goal was to eliminate a tripping hazard and yet let a door open easily over the installed product.  The conduit is laying nice and flat on my carpeted floor and the door does not touch it when opening and closing.  Recommended.
5,Does its job. Use it on carpet and it stays.
5,This product truly met my expectations. You can hardly see where I had to use it in front of my fireplace!
5,I had to run power to two different couches that are set away from the wall by 4'.  It was this or trench the tile and make it permanent.  This solution works well and little ones can run or walk over them without tripping and there is little movement.I really like them and they protect the cords.
4,Only fits one cable so if u have multiple cords running towards the same power outlet u can’t get more than one (possibly two- depending on size) in.
3,This Item will serve its purpose in a low traffic area.  If there is a modest amount of traffic I would recommend a heavier version of the same type this one is more light duty.  This works well for me as all areas in my home are low traffic.
2,Easy to cut to length  fits cords well but doesn't lay flat like advertised
5,Worked well to cover a standard 3 wire 16AWG extension cord crossing our wooden floor.
5,Bought this as an extension cord cover between the wall outlets and the table lamps.  These lay flat to the floor beveled each side so you feet don't catch on them.  The tan color matches our natural hardwood.  These are easy to trim to the needed length with an ordinary pair of scissors.  Overall just a great product for my application.
5,Bought it to cover an ethernet cable in a doorway. Works perfect no complaints. Very easy to put on feels sturdy.
5,Does the job well.
5,Great cord cover for cat6 ethernet cable running across doorway.
5,Everything was as expected.
5,Nice and flexible easy to get wires into.  Slot is big enough for several wires.  I bought more because I liked this one so much.
5,Flattens out quickly  heavy enough to stay put.  Does exactly what it's supposed to.  I would definitely buy this again.
4,I needed a cover for a long+thick power cord that my Roborock S4 likes to catch and get stuck on. Turns out the cord was thick enough it barely fit into the channel and the protector itself required some manhandling to get the edges to align flat on the floor after (likely because over-filled). Then the Roborock started getting stuck on the protector instead. So these are a double-flop for my purchase's intended use.I'm sure I'll find a use for these elsewhere in the house though.
5,I have two nine-month-old Dobermans who are clumsy and constantly tripped over my iMac cable usually unplugging it while I was using it. Or chewing on it if they got bored. This solved all my problems and it kind of disappears into the dark carpet so it’s not an eyesore and doesn’t look tacky.
5,I had to cover cords so that no one would trip on them so this worked out perfectly!
5,I simply flexed this opposite way of the curl to get it to lay flat. It’s fine. I’m not happy about my power situation with my recliner sofas but at least nobody is tripping over cables now.
2,It’ll work  but does not lay flat as stated. Can barely fit more than one cord through it.
5,This one lays flat - truly flat - and does not curl up. Didn't have to put it in hot water or anything.Be advised that it has a pretty small cable carrying capacity which is fine if you know what you are getting. This is not for very large cords or a bundle of cables. We are running a few USB cables through it and there is just enough room to add a 110V 14 gauge power cable.  Don't expect to be able to run multiple large cables through it.It works great. Highly recommended.
5,Covers wires.  Good buy.
5,I bought these for my front porch and back patio so folks wouldn’t trip over the fords I gave for lights and fans. They are super easy to use stay put and you don’t hardly notice they are there. They do exactly what I needed!
5,Was very easy to handle yet very strong great piece
5,Handled my crazy little husky and Goldendoodle dogs running behind the couch wrestling. Hasn’t popped off once.
5,This was the perfect cover to protect a cord and keep it from being pulled or dragged  from where it needed to be.
5,we have a lot of gaming cords and these amazing cord covers are awesome! My husband and i love these for our gaming and anime room. It's a must have!
3,There isn't really any protection to your cords or hoses.  It's more for looks than protection
5,Sturdy holds the cords and well.
4,Even though it wasn't the cheapest option I bought this as it seemed that it didn't have the issue of retaining its spiral shape once unpacked. I left it on the floor for 2-3 days and it flattened out for the most part.I then stuck it to the hardwood floor with some double sided tape here and there and it's protecting my cat5 cable.However I wish it came with it's own double sided tape. Unless you have carpet the tape is absolutely necessary to keep it from sliding around.
5,I bought this because the description claimed it lays flat as soon as you take it out of the box. I was amazed to find that it did! I didn’t have to whip out my blow dryer or anything. Just cut it to the length I needed easily slipped my Ethernet cable in the premade slit on the bottom and I was good to go. Took me like five minutes total. Now my boyfriend won’t trip over the cable every time he leaves the room. :)I purchased the gray version because our carpet is a weird mixture of gray light and dark beige. It matches perfectly and looks ways better than the cable being out in the open.
5,The product works fine it's exactly what's advertised.
5,I bought two of these to cover power cords and speaker wires on the carpeted floor of our rec room.  My wife had tried using clear duct tape to tape them to the carpet - but the tape would loosen up and look terrible.  I bought these as a more permanent solution.My wife was skeptical about them - fearing we and guests would trip on the covers themselves - but that is NOT the case - they work and look great - and eliminate the tripping hazard that power cords or cables present.  Recommended!
3,Very lightweight and flimsy. You would hope that if you're going to be putting this on a cord that there would be some weight to it to hold the cord down. It just curls up and gets kicked around when people walk near it.
2,Was hoping this would be flexible enough to coil up and take to various events but it keeps it's shape and doesn't lay flat once uncoiled.  If you get this in place and keep it there it's probably fine but for me it didn't work for my needs.
5,I like the color which helps the blending into the area where I used it. It covered electrical cords on the floor which looked awful before.Great solution
5,Seems to be a lot of problem with curling on the cheaper competitors products. Spend a couple of dollars more buy American and purchase something you don’t have to fight. This worked great right out of the box.
5,Love this product.
5,This product worked exactly as expected. Lays perfectly flat right out of the box.
5,Used the cord cover for the Christmas cords and the cover worked perfectly to prevent folks from tripping on the Christmas light cords.
5,I'm not understanding the reviews that complain about this not unrolling. I received mine unrolled it and laid it on the floor and it worked just the way it was supposed to. Didn't have to boil it or anything like that. Didn't need to stick double-sided tape on the bottom. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
5,My cable box feed cable had to cross by a closet doorway and was always unmanageable. This product is heavy enough to firmly capture the cable for safe routing.
5,I bought a few of these too hard XLR cables on stage I can fit two cables inside makes it look really nice on stage
5,It is exactly what it was intended to be.  Very easy to install & extremely good quality.
5,The only way I could be happier is if I had purchased this one first!  After being burned by a similar product from another company that never flattened out I was skeptical.  I bought it anyway and laid it out in the hallway for a couple of weeks to make sure it was going to lay flat.  It did from the moment I unrolled it from the packaging!  I just installed it in my office and am so excited!!
5,Used to hide my Cat5 cabling across the floor in spots I couldn’t hide. Sized cut and in use in seconds! Should have bought months ago! No tripping any more!
5,It does exactly what it is supposed to do. It's made well and tough but flexible too. I'm really happy to have my speaker wires hidden and not messy like before.
5,Product was exactly as described and received the next day after ordering !
5,Perfect for hiding an extension cord and eliminating a trip hazard on my condo. The cord extended from a wall outlet along a sliding glass door sill to a table 8-feet away.  Potentially dangerous and definitely unsightly.  Snugged against the sill the cord cover hides it all and keeps it free from tripping feet.
5,Used it outdoors for the holiday season covering a power chord of the holiday decorations in the frontyard running over my pathway. It held up nicely and it hardly moved at all.I'm sure the mailman appreciated not risking to trip over a loose cord. And I felt like a model citizen every time I passed it myself. Good purchase.✂︎ Yes I was able to cut it very easily with an ordinary pair of scissors.
5,We have a cord from a recliner that has to run over to the wall.  It was a tripping hazard so I taped the cord to the floor.  Well I worried that the cord taped to the floor would get damaged by people walking over it.  This solved that concern.  Easy to route the cord through this and it adds protection so the cord won't get damaged.  I still taped it to the floor to prevent it from moving around or getting tripped over.
5,Needed something to protect electric cords from my puppy chewing them and this works 100%
4,Did the job. Hid the cords. However need adhesive 3m double sided tape to keep cover from moving in place.
3,If you want to conceal a thick power cord (like a power strip cord or 1/4 in thick) consider that this strip will leave a bit of a gap to the floor. If you have 1 or 2 small wires (maybe a thin wire for a lamp or phone charger) then this cord vover might work.
4,I cut this in half as I did not need it that long. Fairly easy to cut and thankfully it lays out flat. Very little curl up.
5,This works great for our space! It was incredibly easy to install and the heavy duty extension cord I wanted to cover fit perfectly inside. There is no built in sticker or adhesion we have this in a low traffic/up against a wall area so using this to cover an eyesore vs a tripping hazard.
5,I used this to hide cords that came from our couch to the wall.  There was about 2 feet of a very noticeable black cord on our beige carpet.  This product hid it perfectly!  It blends in with the carpet and isn’t nearly as noticeable as the bare wire.  I didn’t use the adhesive because it’s an area that no one walks in and it’s on carpet.  I’m very happy with the purchase!
5,I was trying to run an ethernet cord from my router to my computer but the cord was going under the front door to my home. I was afraid that I'd sooner or later trip over the wire or open the door and damage the wire so we decided to buy this to hide the wire. There is enough space in the pocket of the sleeve to hide extra slack with a lot of space for wiggle room.10/10. Would purchase again.
5,Just the thing for plugging in the lamp behind the sofa in the middle of the great room.  Didn't know what we were going to do!  Thanks
4,Mostly serves its purpose. However it's not heavy enough to keep from getting moved around by Roomba. Sometimes the Roomba gets over it with no problems. Other times it just gets pushed out of place.
5,Works great in the area needed
4,This definitely serves its purpose and makes the cord that stretches across our kitchen look so much neater and also helps for it not to be a tripping hazard. The only thing I would change is I wish it came with some type of adhesion to stick it to the floor so it wouldn’t move.
5,This took less than a minute to set up and has been exactly the solution we needed for our cable containment challenges. It looks good in the room and adds an important element of safety to our space. I highly recommend if you need to keep your cables out of the way in a way that looks good and that people won't to over.
2,I bought this to bridge the gap from the freestanding end table to the outlet (about 2 feet) it is still a tripping hazard and not at all what I hoped for
5,Used it to cover cables going across a door frame opening. Haven't tripped doesn't stop Roomba and looks great!
3,I’m looking for a cord cover that is similar to what I had before which is stiff enough so that I won’t  have to apply the adhesive. This  product is good but not exactly what I was looking for. The material is soft light weight and malleable which means your wires don’t stay flat on the ground. It is durable though. I’ve rolled my computer cart over it multiple times and it’s held up.
5,I did a lot of research before purchasing and this cord cover had great reviews and was made in USA...a deal breaker.  Very easy to install and the color was great on my light carpeting.  The lamp cord was black so this cover hide the cord nicely.  We used the leftover piece on another small area.
4,Easy to use but light weight so my robot vacuum is always pushing it around.
5,This works as described. It lays flat on the floor to keep me from tripping on my phone cord. I cut off about three inches from the total length using an exacto-knife to fit the length of the wall cord plug-in to my desk. Installation was easy just tuck the cord in and that's it. It doesn't really "stick" to the carpet but it lays flat and stays put for the most part. I sometimes kick it around and can straighten it out with my foot with no problem. No chemical smell either so I'm happy with my purchase.
4,I like how the lighter color blends pretty well on our floor. It does move a bit not as sturdy as I thought but a good price.
5,Love D-Lines products. They solve the problem. I needed something to keep an Ethernet cable that stretches across carpet from tripping people or people from yanking out the Internet as the walk by my standup desk. The floor covering was so simple and easy to install and is heavy rubber so it lays flat. Perfect!
5,Easy to deploy - cut the length that I need and fit three cords inside
5,This is a quality product. It lays flat out of the box except for maybe the very center of the coil which took a few days to finish relaxing but that is no big deal. It was easy to cut as needed for application. It has served it's purpose to eliminate a tripping hazard and it looks much better than a wire running across the floor!
5,I am very happy with the product.  It felt and appeared to be very high quality.  I installed it to cover a pair of networking cables and looks great.The quality also appears to be top notch.  I am pretty picky and this cable cover deserves a 5 star review.  Bravo 👏
5,Works great. laid flat out of the box. no extra work (putting on dryer hot water immersion etc.) no strong odor that other reviewers have mentioned..  used for 2 pairs of 14 guage speaker wires color blended well with my tile floor
4,purchased a new power recliner sofa and needed 120v power to the sofa. this item worked perfectly from the wall plug over carpet to beneath the sofaand was easy to cut (shears) but.... luckily i bought it several days ahead of the sofa delivery and was able to set in the sunshine to "air out". very strong off gassing to me. otherwise 100%
4,This is good for places you will NOT have foot traffic.  It's very flexible and lightweight easy to cut and put in place.  But I put it in a pedestrian crosswalk area which instantly create a trip hazard and non stop plug pulling.  If you're dealing with a traffic area get something more rigid.
5,It came coiled so I uncoiled it and soaked it in hot water for 10 minutes I also let it dry overnight on the bathroom floor making sure it laid straight by morning it was perfect and did not curl at all! I was able to place 2 ethernet cords inside and it works perfectly! Definitely will buy more when the time comes!
4,Using this over top of carpet. Serves its purpose for me but would work way better on a hard surface. But it’s a good quick fix if you need something to prevent tripping. Has a decent weight to it so it doesn’t move very much but like I said if it’s on carpet it works ok. Hard surfaces it would be perfect.
4,It serves the purpose.
4,The flexibility is very high and it won't hold many cables inside its channel. But if you're just using it to run a cable or two to a desk across the floor this is a good solution. Next time I would opt for a stronger heavier material with a bigger channel so I can add more devices later on if needed. But this solved my needs and the price is VERY reasonable. Good value!
5,Running a 7.1 sound system in my living area and a 5.1 in my bedroom. Not a fan of wireless much prefer wired speakers off my amps. These strips do a wonderful job of hiding and protecting the speaker cables. Highly recommend this product if needed for something similar.
5,Thought it would blend in with our beige carpet and it definitely doesn't. But it's easy to cut sturdy  and we haven't tripped on it at all so I'm happy! It lays flat out of the package without having to do the hot water thing to straighten it out too.
5,Works good lays flat stays put
5,I originally purchased my first one of these covers for a solid floor cut it to length and it worked perfectly staying flat without any adhesive tape. When I needed one in another room with a carpeted floor I 'went cheap' with a brand which is lighter and about $5.00 less: BIG mistake and waste of money. I ended up tossing it and re-ordering a second of this brand and style. Don't make my mistake. This is a good cord cover and won't disappoint.
5,I have one single coax cable that fits the opening on the bottom and there is no room for another one maybe some electrical wires would also fit.It is good material but light when the cable moves it also bends in that direction so I throw a rug on it.
5,Easy to use can cut other desired lengths. Make cords safe to walk over and doesn’t look out of place.
5,I bought this cable cover to use for my oxygen hoses. My cat continually chews through the tubes! I texted U-line to see if this cover would work for oxygen tubes and they said yes. It works great! Please consider using this cover! You will not be disappointed!
5,Na
5,Great for apartments where you can’t make holes in walls. Used this to keep the ugly cable cord from hanging over my door or being a trip hazard running in front of the door. Simple but effective. And you forget it’s there after a day or so.
5,good
5,I got tired of tripping over all my ethernet and power cords in my home office due to the position of the desk. Plus my OCD was going crazy just seeing dangling wires. The buck stopped when my 3-year-old ran in and tripped nearly sending my new MacPro crashing to the ground! UGH! -- So I was looking for a good floor cover to conceal the wires and tried other products but due to my home office being carpeted they just wouldn't lay flat and honestly smelt horrible. "I hate the smell of cheap manufactured rubber in the morning" -- anyways... No weird smell with these lays flat on the carpet and you can just feel the higher quality vs. ones I picked up from the local Walmart.
5,This is soft lays PERFECTLY flat a breeze to cut to desired length.  I will never buy any other brand.  XOXOX
4,Product is value priced and covers as expected. I would recommend this forb lightly trafficked ares only.
4,This does exactly what I need it to do it is heavy enough that it stays flat.
5,Took a day or two to lose the curve from shipping but love them. Rather slim and easy to use.
5,This ships rolled up which caused some concern however once unrolled it lays flat. Does exactly what I needed it to do and is relatively unnoticed.
5,This is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made on Amazon! The product worked better than expected. After several weather changes storms and temperature variations it has stayed exactly where placed and completely flat. It’s also very easy to use. I highly recommend this product.
5,I bought this to keep the wires away from the treadmill in my exercise room. It was not rolled tight or small. It is very pliable and at first wanted to twist a little - not much. I put it under the throw rug for two days and now it lays flat and straight. I liked it so much I ordered a second one. Not sure how well it would do on carpet. Very good for tile or wood/laminate floors.
5,Very good and aesthetic product to hide electrical wires...takes 5 min and if it comes enrolled at least it remains straight once on the floor. Different colors but I picked up black to match the decor. Not expensive as I bought only 5 feet the width of the door. I bought also transparent/invisible adhesive hooks to fix the cables on the wall. All in all it is ok.
5,Perfect for the need! Works well does what it needs to and protect from tripping over wires cords etc.. works well if you have children!
3,It helps keep everything clean and safe
4,Love the product.  Using it at home so we don't trip on the ethernet cable and dog won't chew on it.  Working from home with computer cords
5,By the time I cut the cover to length and inserted the cord (only a couple minutes) it laid flat on the carpet and has stayed in place for the 2 weeks it has been in use. Very satisfied with this product.
5,I installed this cord cover to protect some wires from the vacuum sweeper.  The cover does protect but it can be moved around easily by people walking on it so I need to reposition it now and then.  However I don't want anything glued to the floor so I am happy with it as it is.  Installing it was easy it came rolled up but it unrolled easily and it was easy to get the wire inside its cavity.  I cut it to the right length with scissors - no problem!
4,can contain something like a couple of speaker wires pretty well.  I tried to shove two 12 guage speaker wires and  two coax cables in and it was able to be squeezed in and then taped to the floor.
5,It looks great. Used it on a door way. Doesn’t come with anything to adhere to but I used a double stick tape and it worked great. No more tripping over cords.
5,Works as advertised
5,Arrived as expected.  Quality product.  Does exactly what I expected in providing a safe channel across a walkway to hide a lamp cord.
1,This arrived in three 2’ piecesI immediately returned it without any problem!I was disappointed but received the proper 6’ piece two days later!
4,I thought it would stick to the floor.  It has no adhesive backing.
5,Worked great in the corner of our living room to hid lamp wires where you can short cut into living room. Made it very safe to walk by. My wife is very happy!
4,Can only fit a few wires through this and that is in the middle channel ONLY.The other 2 side channels you do not have access to as they are sealed off.  And cutting a slit in them would be a pain if you wanted to run a wire through them.
4,Too small to fit a 12/3 (12 gauge) extension cord.
5,Longer than the area I had in mind but I managed to move around and color matches carpet. Really flexible unlike those I have used before so cords went in the slot easily. No tripping here.
5,Great product!  Laid flat on my wood floor immediately upon uncoiling from the box and inserting a power cord through the center opening.  The product color also blends in well with the color of my wood floor.
3,We had one phone wire and one thicker extension cord wire and it was hard to get both in the bottom. Should have double sided tape on bottom
5,Used this to run some wires through my car I worked as intended nice product and flexible!
5,Stays in place and although comes rolled up it lays flat once installed and the internal channel keeps an extension cord in place and secure. A good buy.
5,Just as described
4,Nice cord cover.  Well made easy to cut to fit your needs.  There is no adhesion capability. Ordered a second one!
5,This is what I was looking for! Used in a high traffic area and perfect for home use! Sturdy and don’t have to worry about it shifting on floor. Simple to install.
5,Exactly what I needed to stop the Roomba chewing up the speaker cables. Lay flat straight out of the packaging and the ideal size. Will probably get a couple more for other rooms now I know it works.
5,This is exactly as described. Seems to be good quality. But as always be aware that this will not hold more than one or two cords. It is not designed to hold a large bundle. I have one RCA subwoofer cable and two standard sized 16 gauge speaker cables running through this cover and it is crammed solid. I wouldn't be able to fit a human hair alongside the existing cables. Also the adhesive is generally useless. I fully expected that ahead of time (and so should you) so I'm not going to ding the product in that aspect.
5,I've needed this for a very long time.  I set up my sewing machine on the dining room table with a fairly long but ample extension chord.  We have been tip-toeing over the wires for months. This folds back so the cord lays inside then flattens against the floor.  Now I'm not afraid of tripping over wires.  Why didn't I do this long ago?
5,Exactly what I needed and so easy to install! I needed to cover a wire that runs through a highly trafficked area the sloped sides have made it so much safer.
5,Excellent.
5,This works great outdoors to hold down pool electric wires. Heavy and easy to use
5,This strip was very easy to install even when having to lay it in an S-shaped arc.  A perfect solution for dramatically lowering the 'trip factor' with loose cords and cables.
5,Love this cord cover! It lay flat and was good to go right out of the box! Dust pet hair etc does stick to the surface but a good sweep or vacuum takes care of that. Overall I'm super pleased with this product and would buy it again if needed!
5,We needed something to cover a cord running across our entry way during Christmas. This worked well and made things less unsightly. It also held well to the stone path it was on- preventing someone from tripping. We had it down for 6 weeks where it was in the rain and had a moderate amount of traffic. It held up well and still looks new.
3,I was looking for an outdoor specific cable cover and tried using this one but it didn't lie flat on the concrete and didn't cover the size of my cable. I returned it.
5,These came in a coil and being warm uncoiled just fine and remained reasonably flat in my cold pole barn. More than met my expectations as one of the cords measured 1/3" and fit inside reasonably well. This of course creates a bump on the floor but reduces the trip hazard. No adhesion that I recall (and didn't care as I may want to move things around over time).
5,Measure twice and cut. or cut on a flat surface. both which i did not do. but all is well. ended up 1" or 1.5" longer than what i needed. but all is well still it does the job. i am currently holding 2 cable wires that travels across the door way. so far so good. we are no longer tripping over the darn wires. it is flexible and it doesn't seem to hold any kinks from packaging. it was well worth my money
5,The cord cover I ordered was exactly what I needed for my home office!  I was able to cut it to just the right length that fits my small office space.  The whole procedure from unpacking to measuring to cutting and then packing the cords into the cover took 25 minutes!  Bravissimo!
5,Easy to cut to specific length. I used scissors to cut with no problem. Helps prevent trip & fall. When inserting wire bend open for easy access.
5,Works just fine. Lays flush with the floor no kinks no buckles no warp.
5,I don't know if this product was supposed to arrive with some adhesive or not but I didn't need it. Right now this is covering cables going across a doorway on carpet. It flattened out and stays put so well no adhesive is needed.
5,I like the fact that a tripping hazard has been avoided with my 2 speaker wires ensconced in this cord cover as well as the aesthetics of a  cleaner look to my room. The cover was easy to trim with some kitchen scissors.
4,Great to cover extension cords with a color that blends with the floor while preventing people from tripping. Good fix and look.
5,Perfect for cable runs across a hard floor. Im using it for heavy gauge speaker wire. Stays right in place on the floor. Very satisfied!
5,Product arrived coiled and straightened it by coiling counterclockwise. Not a perfect color match for my floor but will do. No adhesives but weight of rubber material is enough to keep it in place.
5,Used this to conceal cords from an electric chair.  The color is dark which makes it less visible.  Seems durable and I'm happy so far with the result.
3,Using on a hardwood floor to cover wires going from outlet to my workstation. No longer tripoing on wires and looks good. Lays flat but if it were a bit heavier or wider would move around less.  Still for cost and job it does it is a pretty decent value.
5,Rolled up tight takes a while to sit on floor. 14 gauge cord and 2 cat 5e cords is full. Set heavy weight on it for a while.
5,It was very easy to cut and it lay down perfect on the floor no more cords showing
5,Perfect for my cable run.
5,
4,Bought two of these strips to protect/hide speaker wire on a concrete floor. They work great.I’ve ordered a 3rd for a different location
5,Really nice product. Softer and more flexible than other cable covers I have used. It was easy to cut to size and easy to lay down. I did not need to stick it the the surface because it was not buckling like a harder product would.
5,Worked very well for my application  I’d buy it again but don’t need one
4,na
1,I ordered 6 ft because I needed 6 feet. There is not 6 feet in the roll. There are 69". This is false advertising and more than a little sketchy. I will be reporting them.
5,This comes rolled up and instantly lays flat. So easy to install.  Wish I had bought this sooner.
5,I purchased another cord cover that was coiling up and I wouldn't lie flats. this one lies completely flat and I have zero issue. Amazing.
4,It did the job covering holiday light cords across my walkway but the material is light and had a bit of curve from being rolled up. Because it was light there wasn't enough weight to naturally negate its desire to curve up. Luckily it didn't curve up too significantly and really only left the pavement at the edges of the path.
5,After being spooked by reviews of similar products specifically trouble with the cover laying flat it seemed like this one was the one to get. I’m glad I did because it lays perfectly flat on our concrete floor (not using any tape or adhesive to hold it down). The underside is precut to accept the cord you want to run through it which was a nice bonus. I love when something works as advertised!
5,Lays flat and hides the cord.  It's in a walkway behind a couch that doesn't get much use.  But this certainly solved the issue I had.  Recommend YES
5,I have an industrial fan cord running through this at work. It keeps the cord flat and it stays in place. I would highly recommend this.
5,Easy to cut easy to install exactly as what I expected. There is no adhesive that came with it I just used a double side tape. Happy with this purchase.
5,Like this one a lot.  Lies flat heavy weight decent sized channel and fairly low profile.  I did a lot of research and this one was not the least expensive but it is perfect to cover the light cord between the wall and the end table.
5,This product is soft supple and easy to cut with ordinary household scissors. It comes rolled but once out of the package lays flat immediately and--in my situation at least--stays put on carpet and hard flooring without messy adhesive that can fail over time and leave an ugly residue. Because the material is so flexible inserting a cord into the protective channel was a breeze. I'm very happy with this product.
4,The strip came on time. It was about perfect for this application.
4,Works great !
5,I'm very satisfied with this floor cord cover.  I had some Christmas lighting cords that could create a tripping hazard and I'm very happy that the cords are protected and also made it safer for anyone stepping over them.  I used them ( I cut it into two sections) outdoors by the way.
5,Organized my recliner's cable-laying all over the flow. The gray one looks like a duct-tape though but an upgraded version.
5,For half a year or so it’s held up extremely well. People walk over it daily and my cables underneath have had no issue!
5,Very easy to put the cords in lays flat. Good product to keep puppies away from cords that need to run for a distance.
5,Smooth design great for using a walker over it without the speed bump effect . It hides the cord well
5,Use it every day. Works as intended.
5,Hides cords from my kiddo perfectly
5,This is not adhesive so be prepared to apply double-stick or carpet tape. This (unlike others) lies totally flat (even without carpet tape) and avoids tripping on cables. I love how solid and stable this is for covering cables.
5,Bought this for work and works great.  The cord stays in place and is easy to see.  The only issue I saw was it doesn’t have any adhesive on the back to keep in place.  This is isn’t a big deal for us because this isn’t a high traffic area.
4,It was easy to unroll & stayed flat on floor.  Very easy to cut with heavy duty scissors.  Met my expectations.
5,Needed to cover an extension cord in a walk zone.  Cord fits perfectly into the cover.  Cover easy to cut with standard scissors.  Used matching duct tape to anchor to floor.
5,This was perfect for my home office and helped tidy up all the cords!!
5,Easy to cut and stays in place pretty well on carpet.
4,Nice fit on my floor. Easy peezy. I'd buy again!
5,Very surprised.  The material cut easy is relatively soft and laid flat right away. Would definitely recommend.
5,Flexible backing for easy wire or oxygen line installation. I'm very happy with the product.
5,Lays flat stays in place hides cord looks neat and tidy.
5,Have been working from home for a few months... Finally got tired of tripping over the LAN cable across my dining room so I snagged one of these.  Exactly what I needed.
5,This is an excellent product for covering cables on my hardwood floor.  It doesn't curl up.  Highly recommend.
3,It works but the space for the cables is a little on the small side. About big enough for one outdoor extension cord or a couple light indoor cords.  Also doesn’t lay flat out of the package as it is coiled. A little time and heat might fix that.
5,Just needed to cover cords in the living room. I was able to easily cut it into the two sizes that I needed. Blends in well I ordered the beige color.  Very sturdy.
3,I needed this to fit 3 cords in it. It only one fit. Couldn't use.
5,This is a great product and serve its purpose well. Very happy with this purchase!
4,It's pretty heavy but not really heavy enough to not tilt once cables get put inside it. It is difficult to make work but it reduces the tripping safety hazard by maybe 95%.
5,Lays flat on floor. Needed to cover cords going from a wall connector to the couch and corner table and lamp. Was perfect.
5,Best product & look for our black slate floors.
5,We had bought another brand in brown and it will not lay flat despite being in 95 degree heat for 5 hours. This brand lays flat immediately and looks just fine.
5,Unlike some other brands of cord/cable protectors the D-Lines flatten easily.  Even after laying the product after receiving it in cold weather it rolled out and remained flatter initially than others we've used.  The product is fine for home or light off use.  I recommend these cord protectors.
5,Makes my office look that more professional with hiding my cables and cords.
5,I am unsure of why the pic is oriented like I have it installed on my wall.  It does the job I pay it to perform.  I have yet to trip on it.  I would buy this again.
5,I liked the size perfect for what I needed.  Sturdy yet flexible enough.  Color matched wood flooring well.
5,Same quality as any used in an office. It was exactly what I needed.
5,This power strip was installed under a desk.  The two clips provided made for easy installation without fumbling with the long power strip. What is important is the orientation of the outlets that allows for many AC adapters to be plugged in without covering adjacent outlets rendering them useless
5,Right length. Contains a thick extension chord and a regular chord without a problem.
3,Very well made and very flexible.  Soft rubber. However does not accommodate a heavier cord. Channel is wide enough for two cords but not deep for one heavier cord.
5,D-Line 6 Foot Floor Cord Cover Cable Protector is very reliable and easy to install. It serves the purpose as described by the seller.
5,It was easy to install but is not sticking good at beginning and end
5,I use this for covering an electrical tree light cord that crosses a walkway.  It works perfectly.  Others I'd purchased would curl up and create a trip hazard.  Not this one which is perfectly weighted to stay flat.
5,Very easy to put the cables in (accommodates ~2 coax sized cables) and provides a nice transition / removes a tripping hazard.
4,Works with on maybe two cables. Nothing more will fit.  Lays flat on our carpet.
5,I don't need to tape it down and it stays down on my wood floor.  I ran with 1 thick cable as thick as the PC power supply cable.
5,Works as intended is very study and lays flat as advertised.  Would recommend!
5,Everything went well enough.  It would've been convenient if it had room for another cord but I'm not downgrading it a star for sizing: most people might think this is an optimal size.
5,I read many reviews of other products that talked about having to leave them out in the sun to uncurl.  This product didn't require that.  I took it our of the box and was immediately able to lay it flat.
5,Easy to cut to length and install provides just the right protection for several cables.
5,Cuts easiily with knife or scissors to a length needed. Fairly heavy to stay put.
5,Very heavy duty great quality. Perfect to hide all the cords behind my desk.
5,Worked great till it was taken by a workman i had it across the walkway out front to keep people from triping over a wire it was a good buy and did its job . i will buy again.
5,Used this to run floor task lamp cord to floor outlet. Matches my floor perfectly. Stays flat and easy to cut
5,Not really sure why some of the categories were on here.  There is no adhesion with these.  I bought 3M double sided tape to secure them.  They do great though!  No having to lay them out for hours in the sun to make them usable!  Great product!  Will buy again!!!
5,I needed to protect an extension cord lying on the hardwood floor  from sofa to electrical wall outlet and this cord cover does the job.
5,It met our need to cover an extension cord in our family room
5,Just what was needed to hide extension cords under living room sofas.  Cut to make a "L" shape very easily.
5,Lays flat.
5,This is exactly as described especially the part about lying flat which is exactly what I was looking for.
4,Office at work
1,Absolute crap! This does not stick to your floor. You need to buy one with adhesive!The description of "needs no adhesive" is not only misleading but dangerous!This slid all over my floor and I tripped over it several times once causing injury!Whoever wrote this description should be sued!Don't make the same mistake I did!
5,It is quite sturdyand will definitely help avoid a tripping hazard.
5,It works well protecting exposed electric cords.
5,Perfect to do the job with
5,So glad I bought this. Always worried about people or animals tripping over the cord.  Perfect and good price.
5,Works as expected would buy again..
5,This is fairly sturdy. The rubber is soft enough that you can get your cords into it. I've seen others where the rubber was real stiff and it was hard to get the cords in hard to get it to unroll flat etc. I had none of these problems with this one.
5,Really great product it is sturdy and high quality rubber but its on the expensive side.
5,Nice quality and easy to manipulate
5,Love it I covered my Christmas light extension cords crossing my stairs
5,I wanted to cover the cords on my patio and this is perfect! Very easy to cut and install and looks great!  Definitely recommend this
5,As seen in pics was easy to cut lay and takes heavy traffic with no problem. Hasn't moved or lost shape while being stepped on everyday & keeps my ethernet and cables hidden & secure.
3,I returned it because it could not handle the diameter cable I needed it to. This thing is very flimsy... I could see it being useful in some very low traffic areas but keep in mind it will only fit 1 standard size extension cord and that’s about it.
3,This light duty floor cord cover didn't meet my needs for using outdoors on the patio with a heavier extension cord.  I think it would be fine for using a regular indoor extension cord but it's too flimsy for outdoors and doesn't lay very well due to it being so narrow.  Had to return it and will just use a rug to lay over my outdoor extension cord.
5,Exactly as described online. It was easy to for over the cord. Even though it came rolled up tight after a day or two it is laying flat and helps keep the post cords from being a trip hazard.
5,This cord cover worked perfectly.  Low profile as expected but I was very pleased that it unrolled immediately and stayed flat.  No issues with curled up ends.
3,Not so easy to cut with scissors. Did a great job of hiding the cord.  Took awhile to lie flat though.
4,Good quality product. Easy to use and cut. Only thing missing that would make this a great product is if it comes with adhesive to add at the bottom of it so that it sticks to the floor.
5,Great product! Used to cover cords!
5,This was exactly what we needed to prevent a trip hazard. So far it has enabled us to roll items over an extension cord and prevent both damage to the cord and also keeping my mother-in-law off the floor. It has a channel that is large enough to accept most cables and can easily be trimmed to a necessary length.
5,Works well for covering light duty cables and wires.
5,It doesn't come with adhesion tape. I purchased carpet tape (XFasten Double Sided Carpet Tape; https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LT8OUHK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which works perfectly with this. I have set it up for more than 2 months now it stays on my carpet very well. Very satisfied.
5,Mine didn’t come with any adhesion. But it was easy to cut with a razor knife and I haven’t tripped over that cord any more. I wish it came in funky prints.
5,Installed for intended use. Very satisfied
5,i love how it unrolls into a flat on the floor cord hider
1,
5,Covers cords very well.
5,Used this product to run lamp cord across room so grandkids would be safe if walking over area.
5,Easy to install just unroll put cables inside... Done!
5,Flattens much more easily than rubber!
5,The adhesive was good however I put it on top of carpet so it makes it less effective. But the product is exactly what I needed.
5,Took maybe 1-2 minutes to setup. Heavy enough to to lay straight just open the package unroll and push the cable in. Sturdy too.
5,It works strong protection.
5,It does what it’s supposed to do. Easy to place the cord in the slot. I only wish the edges were a little more flush to the ground.
4,Simple and effective worked perfectly for what it was intended.
5,Works great and makes area safe
5,Stays flat right out of the package
5,I'm using this product for an electrical cord on my outside deck.  The grey color matched my deck perfectly.
5,Easy to cut to size lays nice and flat.  We use it to run a USB cord across a doorway and it blends right in - no issues with tripping or moving carts over it.
3,I have to tape the ends of this to the floor because it kept coming up because it came rolled.  It is in a doorway and my robot vacuum is always moving it now.  While it looks nicer than the painter tape I had it's starting to create more of a trip hazard than it was before.
5,Nice product easily rolls out and doesnt stay stiff lays flat on the floor. Also is easy to cut to what you want
5,Used to run wall electric in garage to a table in center of room.  Sturdy plastic item!Would buy again.
5,Simple. Effective.
5,So... there is a big black strip running through my living room but it is technically OHSAS approved. It isn't super stylish but it is safer than a stray cable.
5,Works exactly as advertised. Would buy again.
4,Sturdy product but will probably not hold multiple cords but very sturdy.
5,Very easy pliable so no issues getting 3 cords to fit nice and neat and lays on floor perfectly.
5,Works great
4,I really liked the product but it gets moved around from stepping on it.
5,Easy to use holds more than one cord
5,Good product
5,The ow profile makes it easy to roll oer and it was veery easy to open more channels to tuck in more cords.
5,This did exactly what I needed.  Hides cords well and lays fairly flat.  Could be slightly more sturdy but I’m happy with the product
4,Floor RacewayWhat I needed
5,awesom!
5,Easy to install
5,It lies flat right out of package.  Easy to cover the wire.
5,Easy to cut lays flat durable
5,The 10' cord has allowed me to revamp my work area. I no longer have 3 surge suppressors and wires all over the floor. It is positioned on the work table so that I can enter the room and turn on the switch. Cinderella thought she had it good!!
5,This worked well for me. I was able to cut into several pieces to fit the needed areas.
2,If you have more than a power cord or a couple of Cat 5 cables you will need something else. Not much else will fit.
5,Color was perfect matched my marble tile.
5,Was exactly what we needed
5,It is perfect it blends with my carpet color
5,I used this to cover a cord in my living room . It helpes to eliminate a trip hazzard.
5,Wasn’t very adhesive. Could be my own error. I really like this it’s sturdy.
1,I was very surprised at the poor quality of this cover. Was planning to use this to cover an Anker extension power strip. However once installed the cover did not lay flat. Gave it a couple days to let it settle but no difference. Compared to other covers I have it feels very thin and cheap. I would not recommend. It is a shame since the gray was exactly the color I was hoping for.
5,Lies flat and easy to set up. It is over porcelain tile. I haven’t bother to use any adhesive so it does shift but so long as it is lying flat which it is 100% then I’m not too concerned
5,Finally able to hide my couch cords.  The grey blends well with my Greyish wooden floors.  Doesn’t slide much.  Highly recommended!
5,Just as advertised. Good cord cover for carpet. Protects my Ethernet cord from vacuum and tripping. Heavy duty cover. I am very pleased.
5,Used for outdoor Christmas light cords that ran over a sidewalk.  Lays flat and stays in place.  Very good product.
5,It works well to keep cord under couch
5,Works great and I love it. Would buy again
4,Good product.
5,This was perfect for safely covering a couple cords across my office floor.  Cut easily with scissors and the curl from shipping fell right out.  I would recommend this for any cable covering needs
5,Met my need
5,Just like I needed wish it had been about 2 feet longer.
5,Hides an electrical cord preventing a potential tripping hazard and my puppy doesn’t chew. Works as designed
5,Easy to use works good on carpeted office floor. Keeps the cords out of the way.
5,Used in theater room so I dont trip over the cords.I laid it out in the sun for a spell to make it easier to adjust that worked well.
5,Exactly what we needed. I was a bit worried that it wouldn’t flatten out but it did. Easy to cut. Fast ship
5,Great product. Looks great. I did not receive any double sided tape though. Still very happy with purchase. My office looks much more professional and tidy now.
5,It's exactly as described very functional. If I wanted it to stay in place I'd consider using command strips or something but it's heavy enough that it keeps the cord flat without any issues.
2,very small does not fit one large extension cord
5,It works perfect in my home to make sure Ethernet cables don’t get stepped on and tripped over
5,Great Product
5,Room for two or three cables lies flat.  Flat back could be taped down with carpet tape on one side it flexible enough to lift one side to change wires.
5,Great product  I use it for my gigs when i dj to keep people from tripping over the cords just wish I would have got longer covers
5,Wide opening allowed all the cables to fit.
5,Just what we needed to cover a cable cord in an awkward place. The black one blended in with the edge of the rug so well my sister didn't even notice it.
5,Never had an issue with this. Works great!
5,Absolutely No complaints. Worked quite well as expected.
5,This worked well under a rug in the garage entrance. Just remember to warm the plastic outside in the sun or in a hot garage so it is flat. Easy to say when I’m in FL
5,It laid down nicely and we have not tripped on the wires since they were in it
5,Item is great and very easy to install. Recommended..
5,I rated adhesion lower because it does not come with any adhesive.  I used double sided tape and it worked perfectly.
5,I really love this item it worked exactly the way it needed too. Looks great on my hardwood floor....
4,Great product...good price
5,There is no adhesion that I could see. I used tape to keep the cord in place und this cover
5,What I like most about this product its color match to my carpet.
5,Works very well
4,Wish channel would be a little larger to fit another cord.
5,I use this to keep the cords in my massage room organized
5,Easy to work with.
1,There is no ribbed non-slip base on the product I received.  My product has a slick smooth bottom that slides freely on my wood floor.  The only reason I choose this product was because it required no tape.
2,These strips do NOT have adhesive and do not lay flat to the floor. If you dont buy 2 sided sticky back tape as we did ... these are more of a health hazzard than the cords themselves. The photos are very deceiving.
5,Cord cover wasn’t stiff like others I purchased. Needed it flexible and this was perfect.
5,Works perfectly! You don't have to worry about tripping over cable cords.
5,I used it outside it’s been a week so far and it’s been in the 30-45s in my area so far so good will see if it last the whole winter
5,Worked really well for my use. Easy to install and doesn’t look bulky at all.
5,Soft and supple.  Easy to cut.  Easily covered an extension cord running across the floor.
4,Perfect for running the electric recliner cord
5,Super Easy Install and Great Product
5,Works great  covered cord to my power recliner across the light maple floors.
5,REPLACED IT WITH THE FIRST ONE I BOUGHT. OUT OF THE BOX TO THE FLOOR INSERTED CORD AND LAYS COMPLETELY FLAT. WORTH THE PRICE
2,The center channel for the wires is not s big as the photos would have you believe I can pass 2 guitar chord through it max.but on the plus side it lays flat immediately
5,This product works great
1,The Main reason I did not like it is because it didnt come with a doible sided tape to install is correctly so It is not glued to the floor.
5,As expected.
5,a day late but fine. thanks.
2,I wanted to use this to cover up a couple of extension cords and a network cable but it did not even come close to fitting. Much too small and flimsy.
5,Does it's job well no need help to unroll since mine was laying in the sun when I got home.
5,Great product. Very supple and easy to install.
3,Would have worked perfectly for me if it wasn’t so thick and prevented the doors from passing over it.
5,the lobby is safe now for man and beast!
1,No size cord will stay in this. They all just pop right out. This is totally useless. I tried it with my laptop cord. Nope. I tried it with my phone charging cord. Nope. When I did get a cord to stay in the second I moved the strip even slightly it popped right out. I threw it out and have now resorted to twist tying excess cord and hoping for the best.
2,Not very impressed. It is like laying out a bicycle tube. It comes rolled up and doesn't completely flatten. No adhesive supplied. When using your own it still comes up in places. Can only hold one wire and it doesn't cut well.
1,Too thin. Cable does not fit. Canble elevated it off the floor making a worse risk for tripping.
5,If you have cords running across the floor then this is for you. Lays flat and easy to vacuum over.
3,No adhesive on the bottom. Cover slides around a lot but manageable.
3,I bought this cover to protect an extension cord that runs under a rug.  The cover is good quality and easy to use but its height makes it a tripping hazard under rugs.
5,Works exactly like we needed it to
5,Exactly what I needed. Does the job well.
5,Lays flat and easy to instal wire
3,Served its purpose in the conference room to help hide the wires
5,This is much easier to work with than others I have used. The plastic material is more pliable.
5,Easy to install; laid down flat - no curling; low profile; completely satisfied.
1,Product should have come in a tube. Came rolled up in a box. Won't straighten. Product is a rip off.
5,Lays flat & adherents to the walkway very nice..
5,I used for my shop
5,Good quality and sturdy
5,This thing has such a nice and heavy duty feel to it. Sooo much better than random cord messes!
5,Perfect color. Perfect fit. Lays flat.
5,This is a great product. Really good quality and it covers the cords on my office perfectly. Easy to use great price.
5,Great product!
5,It does the job.
5,A good product for me
5,Love it solved my problem
5,Worked great! A good purchase.
5,if you have a new puppy buy this before they chew up your electric cords
5,It’s good did what the job did
5,Super high quality.  Lays 100% flat right out of the box.
5,Easy to install looks good.
5,appreciate the timeliness of delivery. really looks nice in our conference room
5,Easily flattens once taken out of packaging. Does the job it was designed for.
5,Recommended.
5,Works great love it
5,It works and was not too expensive so good.
5,It really unrolled and laid flat right out of the box.
5,works exactly as i’d hoped
2,This is for smaller wires only. Lightweight material not likely to stay in place if you walk over it.
5,It works perfectly
5,NO MORE TRIPPING OVER WIRES
5,perfect
5,Great Product as described.
5,Works as designed. Keeps my cords protected from my puppy
5,Extremely bulky
5,Great color and not noticeable on the carpet.
5,Excellent product
5,Excellent
5,Came quickly exactly what we needed
1,It is sturdy and will stick to the ground but it can barely hold two extension cables. This is extremely overpriced for what you are getting.
5,easy to install
5,It covers a cord and lays pretty flat.
5,Nice
2,Pain to get the wire in too light to lie flat which defeats the purpose.
5,works great
1,It does not stay in place. I have had to put the cords back in place several times. I wanted it so I wouldn’t  trip on cords and this thing makes it worse. Very disappointed 😔
5,Great quality perfect for my application
5,nice fit
5,This is perfect for me.
5,Works as advertised
5,just want i wanted.
4,no adhesion but works great
5,:)
1,I wanted to use it to cover cords on my carpet to keep from tripping over them. It slips so it's not any better than slipping on the cords.
1,As soon as I opened the box I was taken aback by the powerful fumes emanating from the flexible plastic of this cord cover. I think it's a common concern with this type of product. However not wanting to add toxic fumes and carcinogenic poison to my office environment I returned this and was able to find an excellent silicone- based cord cover which is functioning wonderfully.
5,Works well
5,Great find
1,The opening is too narrow for a power strip cord.  Had to fight to get it in and it barely stays.  Not happy.
5,Awesome product
3,Didn't fit more than two wires it should specify that the inside can only take up to two lines/ wires
1,
1,It doesn’t work well it keeps going up and doesn’t hold cords.
1,Poor quality channels are too narrow. Not enough room to run size 12 electric cord
2,You can only fit 2 wirings. I had to tape the others on the bottom.
1,Product was not as it was advertised.  I returned it.
1,It was hard to fit one small electrical cord in.
5,Just what I needed to hide a couple of cords. Seems to be fine.
5,I use cord covers in my shop and I compare these favorably to the more expensive commercial cord protectors/covers that I have bought and used for years.  I am not sure why they are labelled light duty as these have a heft and quality that is at least medium duty and in many ways comparable to the heavy duty cord covers I am using.One can cut these fairly easily using a miter box and a hand held miter saw to produce 45 degree angles to go around corners.  I tried gluing these together using crazy glue but that did not work very well but these have enough heft to them to stay in place.  I recommend using carpet tape to hold them down.
5,When I ordered this I was concerned that it would be too stiff and not lay flat enough etc. The real challenge with making a good floor cord thingy liker this is the pliability of the rubber. Too stiff and it doesn't lay flat forever and causes a bigger trip hazard .. too soft and it can get trashed too easily ..I am very happy to say that this is very good and maybe perfect. It lays flat pretty quickly and the cords are easy to "thread". It isn't easy to cut but not that hard either.All in all a great floor care / cord protecting runner. Highly recommend.
5,Good product to protect people from tripping over cables.  Using pieces of this cover to cover temporary extension cords while I do projects around the house.  Easy to cut to what you need.  Can be used indoors and out doors.  Be sure that you the listing on Amazon to verify that the item is big enough to handle you cables that you want to protect.
5,I finally got this installed where I needed to place two power cords across an area where I have to walk constantly.I am 81 and can't take a change on tripping and falling.This is heavy it is easy to install fitting the cords in the spaces and sticking it down on a bare wood floor.The floor is light wood so the beige color is very innocuous.  The material is very sturdy very well made.
5,This works but it's kind of hard to create a cord cover that doesn't.  I recommend some double-sided carpet tape because it does tend to roll up at first and besides you want it to be stuck to the floor otherwise it's still somewhat of a trip hazard.
5,This cable cover in beige was plenty durable and worked well for our purposes.  Matches natural bamboo floor well.
3,Wanted a cheap cable protector for a extension cord Thought was decent in price and such. Its too light duty not much crush protection. I bought another  Legrand - Wiremold CDI-5 Corduct Overfloor Cord Protector- Rubber Duct Floor Cord Cover Ivory 5 Feet (60 Inches) off amazon Its stiffer a lot more crush protection and $5 cheaper.  Cheaper and not light duty go figure.
3,We got this cord cover strip to try and tame some cords that cross our path between the wall and one of our chairs. I kept tripping on the cords and it was becoming a safety hazard. This cover strip does do the job though not perfectly. As you can see by the photo it doesn't lay perfectly flat so there is still a tripping hazard there. I think there are 3 cords in the channel and they just barely fit. It should really be more roomy. Trying to stuff the cords into the slot was pretty difficult too. I recommend this with reservations.
1,The cover can't handle one 14g extension cord. Either the cable falls back out or the cover won't lay flat.It actually sticks up more than the cable did uncovered. This is after unrolling and letting the cover straighten out for 3 days.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Just what I needed to hide the cords to my electric reclining sofas. It surprisingly laid flat. There is no adhesive backing. For the section that’s still bowed if it doesn’t lay flat soon I’ll just secure it down with black duct tape. Ordered more for my other two sofas.
5,Well . . . . . it does unroll to lay flat even at each end.  Great bargain and a nice product.  I like all 3 that I purchased.  Two normal-size electrical cords fit through them quite nicely.
4,My Ethernet and power cables fit beautifully. The color blends well with my hardwood flooring so it isn't an eye sore. Also it is thick enough to be visible but not so much that it looks a bulky intrusion. The Cover laid flat on hard wood flooring (because of the review I read about products like these bending and not staying flat I did anchor the ends with weights for a day and have remained flat ever since).
5,I've bought two of these. The first one we use in our living room to hide/protect wires that run from a wall plug across the floor then under the coach. The second one we use outside on our patio to run the wires from the outdoor receptacle to our garden fountain. Both of these have been working out fine the cable is no longer all over the place and getting stepped on.
1,My single extension cord was too big for this. See my pictures - the cord cover was too small for the cord to completely go in the cover. Interesting how the advertised pictures show two thick cords going into cord cover.
5,These are great. My biggest issue with cable covers is being able to straighten them out. I had NO issues keeping this one straight. And it's big enough for an extension cord and ethernet cable.
5,Fantastic product.  Lies flat as soon as it is unrolled from the box.  Took 30 seconds to put the cord inside the rubber cover.  Color is as described and looks great.  Does not move around and serves its purpose.  Buy this one for sure!
5,This works for our purpose but we have noticed a dark stain along the entire length of the rubber.  It moves about if a wheelchair goes over it.  Need some two sided tape to make it stick firmly in place.
5,I cut each in half to put in doorways so people would not trip over ethernet cords. Easy to cut and easy to put the cord into and remove from.  great product
5,Easy to use and cut. Good price and  size. I ordered two rolls to hide electric cords in my living room since they were a hazard for anyone walking around there. Worked great.
5,I've bought other similar products and was not as impressed as I am with this one and i highly recommend this one.  All of these similar products come in a roll when you unroll this one it is good about not maintaining its curl flattens well.  Doesn't come with adhesive to keep it stationary but anything works to keep it down.  It is also very sturdy and thick.
5,Does the job. My puppy can’t chew on the wires anymore
5,Installing the extension cord inside was easy.  This unit laid flat and eliminated the previous tangle of cords.
5,This was fairly simple to install. I didn’t even have to cut any off. It’s still there in my high traffic living room and still holding strong. Vacuum pets and all!
5,Hides cables and lies flat--great!
5,We used this for a broadcast studio to tidy up some floor wires and it looks professional.  We were pleased with the pliability of the material which made installation a breeze.  Well worth the money.
5,Worked perfect for my needs easy to insert cord and very flexible and most importantly preventing a trip hazard.
4,Easy to cut - useful product. Excellent Customer Support.
5,We bought this to cover an extension cord stretched across the carpet to a table so people wouldn’t trip over the cord to my sewing machine. Product came quick and does the job. Would buy again.
5,Perfect size super easy to install
5,Excellent flatness on a carpet.
5,This was exactly what I needed to complete my home office.
5,As advertised...great buy for the money...
3,don't  lay  flat on floors
5,Very sturdy
5,It did exactly  what i needed to do! Cover cords
5,Easy to use easy to install.
3,I had to add Command Strips to keep it from curling up.
5,Like cut to length option.  Good product - performs as expected.
5,Bought these to protect my ethernet cable that crosses the middle of my living room.  I didn't adhere them to the floor since I have carpet but they stay put enough.  Fits both cat5 and cat6 ethernet cables easily.
5,It's exactly as you'd expect it to be. It's thick rubber. Just heavy enough and of course just the right type of surface to keep flat to the floors. It has a slat to push your cords into to keep off the floor and inside of it. It takes decent hits without taking damage (...suddenly sounds like I'm talking about a Skyrim mod lol) and it's the easiest thing ever to "install" - you literally just unroll it place it down and run your cord(s) through. That's it. Easy. Simple. Fast. Efficient. Cheap.
5,This product performed as advertised.
5,The D-Line 6ft Floor Cord Cover Floor Cable Protector Extension Cord Cover arrived on time and well packaged. I unrolled the cover a laid it on a flat surface in the sunlight for about an hour and it straightened out nicely. It's made of high quality material and construction. I use it to cover a #14 gauge three wire extension cord I use to energize a car battery trickle charger. It lays flat on my garage floor between the car and the workbench. I did not adhese it to the floor since I move it regularly.The low profile and wide beveled edges eliminate any tripping hazard while being strong enough to step on or roll an object directly over it without damaging the cord. Works great. No issues. I recommend it.
5,This works great. Unrolled let it sit a few minutes and it was flat.  Not only does it hide my cords now my iRobot vacuum can roll over this!  Easy to cut to any length you need.
5,Got this to protect my 14 gage speaker cable from getting chewed by my dog. It was easy to install. Has no adhesive but I don’t think it needs it. It sits flat enough so that the dog doesn’t lift it. I like that it has some flexibility to it to make it easy to adjust to the area or if it moves. It is a good width. Glad I picked this one.
5,I only needed about two and a half feet so this did the job for me. It was easy to cut however it is just sitting on top of the floor. I got it so the roomba would stop ripping the cord out of the wall however now the roomba just kicks this strip around still causing the cord to be pulled from the wall. It lacks adhesive but since the photos don't show one i can't knock a star for it not having it.
5,This is the 2nd time I have bought this type of product. The first had to be left in the sun for a while then it still wouldn't quite lay flat.This product was totally different. It almost laid flat as soon as I unrolled it. My cable was easily inserted however it was only a light duty lamp cord.In summary I was very pleased with this product. I did not rate adhesion as it has no adhesive applied to it. However it is pliable so it would not easily scoot across a smooth surface as long as some downward pressure is applied. I will buy it again if I have need for such a product.
5,Easy to put over the cords.  Worked great.
5,Used this to protect a plastic oxygen supply tube.  Worked so well that I bought another one to extend the distance to be protected.
5,Works great and the robot vacuum goes over it without getting tangled in cords!
5,These stay pretty flat and are really good quality!I may have underestimated and just ordered another set of these. Would definitely recommend these.
5,Easy to use convenient and helps hide cords or prevent potential trips.
5,D-Line 6ft Floor Cord Cover Floor Cable Protector - Works great
5,Awesome
5,I really like this cord cover it works great for a cord that has to go across a doorway in my house. It was easy to trim to fit the space. It did make it a lot easier to have 2 people to get the cord into it; one to hold it open and one to get the cord into it. It's soft to walk on I don't trip over it because it's nice and flat and it's easy to roll a vacuum over and sweep around.
5,We had a charger cord that was 1. a trip hazard and 2. ugly as all get out.  Got this and now 1. no trip hazard and 2. a stylish way to hide the cord.  Good quality.  Good price.
5,I used to cover wires behind power sofa. Just put up against the area with wires. Works perfectly.
5,Very sturdy and easy to install.  I had 2 thick cords to hide and they fit perfect.
4,The cord can't be too big in thickness but if it fits inside the guide it works great as intended.
5,Product was exactly what I needed and expected.
5,While some people want the ones with the adhesive backing those ruin the hardwood flooring. While they can slide a little bit they move right back with just a touch from the toe of my shoe. Recommended and would buy again.
5,Unlike the low ratings state on this product this cord looks exactly like the photos does not stink cord fits perfectly lays flat and stays in place. My robovac runs over it easil.  Believe the over 8000 users who gave it a 4 or 5 rating.
5,Everything is fine. I wish you could insert easily more than one cable. I did install power and a network cable but it was tight.
5,Worked great to cover a cord
5,Had mic cables on the floor that became a trip and fall hazard. This took care of the isue.
5,We needed something to cover the power cord from our recliner couch to the outlet in the wall. I didn't want a product with the adhesive sticker that keeps it from moving because I was concerned it would  damage the small area of Persian carpet and the wood floor. This product does not have that and its own weight hold it down perfectly!
5,Looks quality in our office! Love it.
5,Yes I liked it
5,As a home health nurse looking in patient homes for falling hazards these are perfect
5,We're using this outdoors across a threshold from inside the house out onto a concrete patio. We needed to run an extension cord that also crosses this threshold. We like that this cover greatly reduces any chance to trip over the extension cord and it looks very neat. We've only had it a month so can't speak to longevity.
5,Nice cord protector
5,I run a long USB extension cable across the floor from my computer to under the bed behind me.  The cord channel has thick walls to support my weight when I walk on the protector.I can use my SDR dongle across the room and far away from this noise machine called a computer.I use some extra ferrite split beads clamped onto the USB cords coming from the computer to quell radio-frequency noise.And importantly the install looks much neater than the alternatives that I had!
5,Easy Install
5,More rubber feel than plastic. Very flexible laid flat right out of the box. Delivered in summer so February sitting on porch...may need a hair dryer. Best of all it's hard to find a brown cord cover. Black looks great on my dark brown wood floor.
5,They work as advertised....if you are routing more than one pair of wires and/or thick wires the insertion of the wire(s) into the channel can take a little work. Between inserting the wires while the track is upside down and existing twists & curls in the wires themselves (from the spool they came on) it can be a bit of a challenge. In hindsight I should have run the wires through these *BEFORE* connecting to speakers & amp....would have been much easier.
5,The bump is a bit higher than expected but it works perfect.
3,I tried to put 3 wires (HDMI and 2 AUDIO cables) in this and it doesn't lie flat. Disappointing.
5,Works as advertised
5,Excellent quality. This cord cover is very flexible making it easy to work with; I could comfortably cut it to the specific size and angle I needed. It is heavy enough to lay flat right away on both my hard floor and my carpet. The underside is soft enough that I could easily slide my cord into the cavity. (There appears to be room for at least two additional cords.) I'm very pleased and will definitely purchase another of the same should the need arise.
5,Unlike many of these this one could be used immediately upon receipt.  There was no need to get it warm in order to have it lay flat.  Also it does not move around a lot even though there is no adhesive on the botton.  I am very please with this purchase.
5,Keeping it Safe
5,This works well for my cords.  It has room for 2-3 regular sized cords.  It blends in okay with my hardwood floors although if it had come in a bit lighter brown it would have been great.
5,Works great!  Durable.
5,Works very good on 12 ga. Extension cord
5,It does what it does.
5,It was easy
5,Covering wires for Christmas decorations
5,Nice heavy good quality rubber
5,Sits flat on floor but flexible enough to even in it in a curve. Don't want to know what's in it but it sure works good. vanishing color on flooring of the same color palette.
5,Well made. No issues so far.
1,"Rate featuresAdhesion"UHM DIDN'T COME WITH ANY LIKE PHOTO INDICATED
5,2 HDMI and 1 Power Cable don't quite fit.  It will work for now but will not be a long term solution for me.  Otherwise it is very nice.
5,maximum cable thickness for ease of installation about 3/16"
5,I used super strong double sided tape all along left and right side wish I didn't (it's like super glue now). This is heavy duty and will not move even without tape (unless you kick it hard). Recommended buy - just lay it flat and it works great.
5,The color was a nice beigh.  Just what we needed.
5,This cord cover is just what I needed for an outdoor extension cord. Does not fold at the ends it is sturdy and does well in the rain.Already ordered two more.
5,Protects cord(s) while eliminating trip hazard.
5,I've bought several different types of cable covers/protectors and this D-Line 6 Foot Floor Cord Cover Cable Protector is -by far- my favorite. It immediately lays flat after being taken out of the box and unrolling and it is easy to cut to size even with scissors (make sure they are sharp). Excellent quality product at a great price!
5,worked like it should
5,Installed it seems like decent quality.
5,Covered porch extension cord now hidden and safely out of the way year round!  Had a corner to go around and the cord cover cut easily with a pair of scissors.  Clean look that blends well with the stone porch floor. Did not use adhesive attachment.  It stays in place without it in the location close to the wall and behind door mat.
5,In an APT run this for my Ethernet Cable to PC. Looks better and no tripping over cord. Not sure why apartments don’t come with multiple ports but with my setup I had to utilize a 25’ cable. This is greatness
5,This was easy to use and was perfect for hiding a ugly cord running across my floor.
5,Put in a gazebo a few months back and before had a crappy extension cable running to it and it looked terrible. Bought these with a new outdoor extension cable and these matched perfectly with my patio. Looks a lot better
5,… as described.
5,Sits very well on the floor removing the trip hazard that the wires were.
5,Bought this to cover a coaxial cable fit perfectly and the cord is protected.
5,Was a little skeptical about buying this because of the bad reviews.  Well its a great product and works great. No problem unrolling it and it staying put.  Highly recommend.
5,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,Unroll push the extension cord into it and you're done!
5,Perfect for its intended purpose: Hiding wires and make them less likely to be tripped over.
5,Honestly this was a great purchase. It was soft so it lays flat without curling back up like the ones I bought from the hardware store did. Perfect length for what I needed it for. Will definitely but more soon.
5,This works perfectly with how I wanted to use it. Also it's heavy enough that I won't trip over it. I would buy it again.
4,The description of this is a bit misleading. It shows that this item either comes flat or doesn't suffer from being rolled up as it immediately lays flat "without boiling water" etc. This is not the case. It comes rolled up and like any other thing that gets rolled up it tends to want to stay rolled up. I rolled it up the other way for about an hour and it was fine but it absolutely did not just lay flat immediately as was implied. The cavity is a bit small (too small for my fairly standard surge protector cord) but it's close enough for what I'm using it for. Overall it's fine but be advised it will curl at the ends and will need a bit of adjustment and measure your cord diameter.
5,Sturdy and heavy but easy to cut. Lays flat right out of the box. Great product.
5,Perfect for my needs.  Great product just as described.  Fast ship.  Would buy again.  I'm in a wheelchair this is a perfect solution and can handle alot of traffic.
5,Used it to hide and protect the electric cord for our electronic recliners.
5,Easy to use. Looks good.
4,This is a small cavity version can even fit two HDMI cables need to allow a day for it to flatten. Otherwise decent
5,Just as advertised
4,My girlfriend started working from home a year ago. We've been running phone lines and ethernet cables from the living room modem / router all the way to her office I trip on them at least once a day.I was able to conceal them most of the way under carpet but nothing I could do about them running across the hallway. Now we're routing them through this cover and it's wonderful.The only downside is there is no adhesive with it. I ended up using Industrial Velcro mounted one strip on the carpet and the other on the back of this. That way we can pull it up if need be but it holds firm.
5,Great product and quality
5,This works as advertised. Used it to hide a cord on the office floor....does the job.
5,Worked great to conceal cords outside during the holiday season.
5,Have bought two now & have been pleased both times. Trim easily cords insert easily & they lie flat on carpet.
5,AS ADVERTISED
5,These are exactly what we wanted to cover power cords running across our carpeted finished basement.  No longer have to worry about tripping on loose electrical cords.
5,Works to hide cables to electric couches. Soft user foot on tile floor. Better then having errand cables running around living room.
5,I used this to cover a cord to a oil filled heater I keep in the middle of a room containing snakes. In this room I have wood floor and a older Roomba a 600 series that I run from time to time to keep it clean.Not only am I no longer having to avoid the cord but the vacuum goes right over it without issue. I didn't think that it would so I was very pleasantly surprised to see it.It was easy to cut to size and lays nice and flat. I would buy it again.
5,Easy to install and looks good.
5,It works well to hide my Ethernet wire. Should have bought earlier. I just have it laying on the floor didn’t try using any adhesive. Haven’t had any issues.
5,Its a speed bump for cables you have on the ground where traffic flow of people is a must.  Prevent a would be fall.  These are perfect!
5,Very flexible
5,Well manufactured heavy duty.
5,I laid it out for a day to flatten the cover. Inserted the chords and works perfect. Stayed flat on my bedroom carpet. (There is no adhesive) You can add a double stick tape optional.
4,It worked as advertised tho adhesive on the bottom would be better.
5,The quality and sturdiness of the product is great. What you see is what you get. Install is simple.
5,Good
4,Super easy to install. I wanted to hide an extension cord for a power strip and honestly the cord itself is almost bordering on too thick for this product. But it does get the job done. I'm happy with the look and how easy it was to install. My only complaint is that wheeled items like chairs or rolly tables don't go over this product nearly as well as I was expecting. But it works so I'm happy with the purchase.
5,I used it for 3 12 Ga speaker cables across the floor of a doorway lots of room inside the channel and lies flat. You cold use some two sided carpet tape to secure it if you don't want it to move at all but stays put on its own with only slight movement.
4,Le produit est facile à installer.Ce produit est assez long et il est facilement découpable au cutter ou avec de bons ciseaux.Il remplit bien sa fonction de protection on peut marcher dessus sans crainte d'abimer les câbles.Il ne possède pas de système de collage au sol.Après l'installation d'un fauteuil électrique chez une personne qui a des difficultés à se déplacer et pour qu'elle ne trébuche pas à cause du  câble j'ai installé ce passe câble et je l'ai collé avec un adhésif double face.J’espère que ce commentaire vous sera utile.
5,Just got this today and I absolutely love it! There's no sticker on the bottom of the cord holder but it still stays firm and flat on the floor :) It does it's job and I don't have to worry about it damaging my floors :)
4,It was longer than I expected. It was heavy enough so it will not be moved easily when walked on or accidentally kicked. Lots of room for cords. The beige colour was very close to online colour and matched my flooring well. Definitely will be getting more
5,Lo compre por que debido a la pandemia y a las fallas de internet decidí poner un cable ethernet y para no tener peligro de tropezarme esta fue un excelente remedio. Se ve fuerte de uso rudo y pesado en mi caso no decidí pegarlo al suelo solo con el peso del producto y me ha funcionado muy bien.Al inicio cuando abri el paquete ví que venía enrollado y pensé que sería un problema pero al momento que lo puse en el suelo se acopló muy bien.Muy recomendable
5,Produit de qualité petit truc: envelopper dans une serviette et mettre a la sécheuse 20 minutes il devient plus facile a étendre par terre parce qu'il arrive enroulé. J'ai placé un tape qui colle sur les 2 cotés sur le plancher avant de l'installer et il reste bien en place.
4,I purchased this to run from the outlet along the floor to underneath a table for our laptop. The idea was that it wouldn't be tripped over and would make vacuuming/ sweeping a little easier.The issue is that it quickly turned over on its side and the cord came out.My dog is weirdly attracted to it and won't leave it alone. Great in theory but it isn't quite working for us. I will be giving it another try as I really want/ need this to work for our space.It was easy to cut for the length I needed.
5,I'm using it outside to prevent people tripping over an extension cord that has to go across the gate to the back yard. I added some yellow electrical tape and so far it has performed well. I had no issues with it not lying flat as the weather has been a very hot and the box was hot when it arrived. I just laid it out in the sun for a few minutes and it was fine for my needs. My extension cord was easy to insert. I wish I'd ordered a longer strip to hide more of the orange extension cord!
5,After reading reviews of similar products I was a bit hesitant to buy this floor cord cover; but this is the one to get! I was able to lay it out flat on the floor straight out of the box and did not need to warm it up in hot water like some other ones require. The coaxial cable was inserted into the cable slot with ease. The cable cover lays flat and I have had no issues tripping over the cable or the cable cover. I will buy this one again in the future when needed!
5,When my local Canadian Tire stocked only grey cord covers I went to Amazon.  I found what I was looking for instantly and it was available in the color I needed for my office.  Had enough rough to cover power and internet cable and just right right length to reach from the wall to my desk.  Thank you.
5,En estos días que padres e hijos hacen home-office y home-school tuve que sustituir el uso de wi-fi por cables para evitar problemas con las interferencias de otras redes cercanas.  Dado que esto es una situación temporal el cable pasa en medio del suelo; evitar tropezones caidas y daños a equipos era un imperativo.  Esta ranura es suave asi que no lastima el pie si andas descalzo aunque esto mismo disminuye la protección al cable.  Mientras no pienses pasar patinando sobre el sin embargo no debe ser un problema.
5,Great product. Using it for my electric recliner chair’s cord and it is great for it. Not only does it hide my cord it also prevents my recliner chair from moving when the product is on our floor. Great for hiding unwanted cords.
5,This cord cover works quite well. I have two large appliance cords inside it and it lays flat and haven’t tripped at all. I walk on it daily.
5,Works great laid down flat and straight.
4,Debería contar con algún pegamento ya q al venir enrollado q tome una forma horizontal es muy complicado
3,Don't expect to run multiple cables through this channel very small cavity to be useful for my application. Couldn't even fit 2 power cords and 1 CAT6 cable into it.
5,Really happy with this product. Prevented our kids ourselves and anyone visiting from  tripping over the exposed wires. Stayed down flat immediately despite coming rolled up. Highly recommend this product as it is a great safety feature to have.
4,Its good just kinda expensive for what you get it's only about 6 feet and it costs around 20 dollars
5,We used these to keep the cords away from the new puppy. Worked like a charm and really helped organize some of the loose cords in the house.
3,I bought it then never even tried it. I think the look and feel of it turns me off
5,Nice thick rubber heavy and stable holds my cables nicely.  Does the job.
5,Semble résistant. Dissimule très bien les câbles.
1,This product is advertised as being 6 feet long. But it is actually short of even being 4 feet long. I contacted the seller via Amazon 2 days ago but have no heard a response regarding the matter.
5,Easy to cut to size and stays flat and in place even with our heavy treadmill cord.Would order again!
5,parfait
4,Worked really well to cover the cord and keep it from being a tripping hazard.
2,The housing should be a bit more rigid in order to protect the cables better.
5,Comes in a variety of colours. Matched our wood floor perfectly
3,It's ok. I only like it cause it rolls out flat. That's what separates it from the rest.
4,No bad
5,Lays flat instantly. No need for adhesive.
5,Perfect fit and color
5,worked
5,arrived on time and as described
4,My only concern was that the two sides tape that is needed to install this product was not included.
5,C’est vraiment parfait cache très bien
5,Works great
5,Simple easy works awesome
5,Works perfectly
4,Todo perfecto pero me hubiese gustado que tuviera adhesivo por debajo.
5,Needed to cover quite a thick 13a power cable
5,sollte man immer brauchen
5,Schön flexibel.
4,Acheter pour protéger les cables de mes animaux et après 1 an il est toujours intact. Je ne regrette pas mon achat.
4,These are good but expensive for a but of rubber.  Not great value for money had to buy a larger alternative.
5,Alles bestens!
5,Bought this to cover a large outdoor extension lead between garage and outbuilding. I only recently put the extension lead in to provide semi-permanent electric to my workshop. The cable is cleated to walls for most of it's journey but there is about a metre of cable which runs on the ground where it goes from the garage wall to the garden wall. As I drive the lawnmower over this sometimes I was very concerned that it needed covering not to mention it just being a trip hazard.It arrived rolled up lengthways and when unrolled it stayed flat quite nicely which was good. It was tough but easy enough to cut to length with a stanley knife and then I was easily able to push the cable into the recess underneath (which is easily big enough to take 3-4 standard appliance flexes).I've been walking driving etc over the cable protector for weeks now and its working brilliantly. Really please and a decent price too! Will definitely buy some more if/ when I need it.
4,Used outside the house stands up well to elements and impacts.
3,easy to use  the cables just slip in to the underside  durable  and it will help stop trip hazards .....BUT be aware 1.8m is approximately 6 feet that's not a lot when your running cables across a floor or such . there are longer versions available .
5,Materiale ottimo robusto e super morbido protegge i cavi in maniera totale aderisce con il peso bene al pavimento si puo usare un biadesivo per non muoverlo più. Quando si passa sopra è come se non ci fosse.
5,Very easy to cut and fit into place. I've used it to cover wires just inside the doorway of my campervan. Also helps to keep the laminate flooring held firmly in place.
5,Works well needed something for the swimming pool filter cable to prevent over excited children ripping it out or tripping. Well priced item
5,Exactly what I needed and does the job. Holding twin 8mm cables and preventing trip hazard. Took only a few minutes to put in place and so far appears to be quite sturdy and hard wearing.
4,This is a good product. It protects my loose cables and prevents any trip hazards. However it is not slim enough to fit under certain doors. Other than that it is easy to use and can be cut into smaller lengths if needed which is what I did.
5,Habe meinen Fernseher als Monitor mit meinem Laptop verbunden(HDMI-Kabel). Dazwischen liegt ein Gehweg.Zweimal im Kabel hängen geblieben. Einmal dabei Laptop vom Tischchen gezogen Gerade nochmalgut gegangen. Wollte ich nicht öfter probieren. Stolperfalle jetzt nachhaltig beseitigt
4,Der Kanal wird auf engstem Raum zusammengerollt versendet. Es dauert wohl Monate - falls es überhaupt passiert - bis sich die letzten 20-30 cm flach auslegen. Eine etwas größere Verpackung die einen größeren Biegeradius erlaubt würde Wunder tun
4,Der Kabelkanal hält gut auf unserem Laminatboden. Auch wenn er verrutschen sollte bleibt das Kabel gut in der Führung. Leicht zu reinigen quasi mit dem feuchten Bodenwischen zusammen.
4,Der Kabelkanal läßt sich leicht auf die benötigte Länge zuschneiden. Dass er etwas schmäler dünner und leichter ist als der im Nachbarzimmer schon vorhandene begründet meinen kleinen Punktabzug.
2,Does the job but cable insertion a pain. See how it goes
4,Super leicht zu verwenden nur leider werden sie aufgerollt geliefert wodurch sie (zumindest bei mir) nicht ganz eben am Boden aufliegen
4,Ma première plinthe de ce type avait un adhésif de bonne facture et ça n’a pas bougé pendant 6ans par contre elle a fini par s’éventrer (précision je fais passer un planche à roulette chargée de 120kg d’eau 3x par semaine dessus). Mes câbles d’enceintes arrières sont dedans.Celle ci a l’air aussi costaud mais pas d’adhésif et plus cher.
5,After I finished using it outdoors for running Xmas tree wiring I’ve moved it in doors to run cabling in front of a doorway and it’s still laying flat and it’s perfect no tripping hazard.
5,Used these outside to hold down camera cables on grass in wet weather - Worked very well.  Bought a few of them.  Sure they will come in useful in future not just for camera shoots.
5,This comes rolled up but it settles into place very quickly and protects the cables within. I have not had it long but it is well made and it will last. £13 seems a lot but you get what you pay for.
5,Saw some reviews saying it wouldn't lay flat after taking it out of the packaging (comes coiled up) but after 5 mins straightened out on the floor was fine.Only used for a single  power cable and works great. Probably can fit another cable 8n there but not more.
3,Excelente relación calidad-precio
5,Bought to secure and protect the outside lights cable that goes across the side of the driveway.  Easy to install.  Easy yo cut to length.  Been down a week and no issues at all.
5,o/k/
5,Uso este pasacables para un par de puntos en mi vivienda donde necesito tirar unos cables por el suelo y evitar que el robot aspirador se vuelva loco cuando pasa por esa zona. No es lo más limpio al coger la goma suciedad fácilmente al pisarse pero también se limpia fácilmente pasando simplemente la fregona.
5,Easy to use and worked a treat.  Used to run an electrical power cord during Christmas.  Cut tonsuitable length and stayed flat and safe.Good job
5,I bought this to protect cables as they pass infront of a doorway.  It was easy to cut and I fixed it in place with double sided tape on one half longitudinally so I can pull up one edge to add or remove cables.  If you dont have any tension on the cables as they enter or exit this wouldnt be neccessary as it is heavy enough to generally remain in place (I just have a tight 90 on entry and another in the opposite direction on exit so it was slowly skewing the placement).It is also surprisingly flexible so it could curve should you require it (not that I want it to but its a non issue)
5,Easy to cut to size and insert cable into. Protects cable well lessens the tripping hazard and can be used again and again.
4,Il prodotto serve a mitigare il rischio di inciampare sui cavi lasciati a terra. È calpestabile con tutto il peso di una persona e non si attorciglia. Sarebbe stato utile fornire la striscia anche di un biadesivo da usare se necessario così da garantire la perfetta adesione al pavimento. Nel mio caso è solo appoggiato sul parquet per evitare che la suocera anziana strappi via i cavi del computer ma ogni tanto la signora delle pulizie lo mette fuori posto...
4,Working from Home I kept tripping over cables - this Protector does that (Exactly what it says). Works well - has stopped me tripping over cables since I got it.
5,Ganz hervorragende Lösung für die schnelle Verlegung von Kabeln auf einem empfindlichen Fußboden. Besser als Tape aber anders als Tape auch für dauerhafte Verlegung geeignet.Der Kanale wird nicht verklebt oder verdübelt sondern einfach aufgelegt. Die Kabel werde von unten hineingdrückt. Das funktioniert bei mir auch bei dünnen Lautsprecherkabeln sehr gut. Der Kanal bietet nur begrenzt Platz daran ist zu denken.Das Material ist rutschfest und läßt sich sehr gut verlegen. Ich benutze die Kanäle für PA-Verlegungen ebenso wie dafür Video- und Audio-Kabel in der Wohnung an Wänden entlang oder unter Türschwellen unauffällig zu verlegen.Das Ergebnis sieht gut aus die Kabel werden "unsichtbar" und der Staubsaugerroboter kommt auch damit zurrecht.Klare Kaufempfehlung aber Verwendungszweck beachten! Einige negative Rezensionen sind eindeutig darauf zurückzuführen dass der Kunde die Produktbeschreibung nicht gelesen oder nicht verstanden hat.
5,Super achat. Ce produit me sert pour le passage d’un fils en 25 mm sur un trottoir devant chez moi. J’habite en rez-de-chaussée surélevé et j’avais besoin de pouvoir charger mon véhicule électrique.Ma crainte était évidemment que des personnes se prennent les pieds dedans. Le cache Cable remplit très bien son rôle personne ne se plaint du passage de mon fils électrique.Conforme à la description. Je conseille
1,Es ist ein gerollt. Und es gibt fast keine Möglichkeit das irgendwie auf dem Boden zu befestigen. auf normalen Boden rutscht es direkt weg. Selbst auf einem Teppichboden ist es sehr komisch. Man muss schon etwas drunter kleben damit es überhaupt irgendwie hält. Aber was soll man drunter geben. Gerade bei so einer Länge. Da ist das Produkt nicht zu empfehlen dabei ist wie man das irgendwie nutzen könnte. Ansonsten ist es eigentlich ein sehr gefährliches Produkt. Auf einem normalen Boden liegt. Kann man noch schneller drüber fallen weil es direkt mit rutscht.
4,Works as expected. would be good to have entrance points for wires along the length of the protector but you could just as easily add these yourself. takes a little while for the protector to 'relax' as it is delivered to you rolled up but once put down and left it goes completely flat after a few hours. Recommended.
4,Unsere Anlage wurde in Zeiten im Wohnzimmer installiert als wir noch nicht daran dachten Internet und Beameranlage da verbinden zu müssen. Bisher waren die Kabel dort eine stetige Stolperfalle gerade nach einem langen Fernsehabend im Halbdunklen nicht ungefährlich. Auf dem schwarzen Steinboden verschwindet die Leiste fast und nimmt LAN- und Antennenkabel des Sky Receivers gut auf. Man stolpert auch nicht mehr automatisch an dem Durchgang oder muss aufpassen dass man dies nicht tut.Allerdings wenn der Kobold Saugroboter läuft arbeitet der sich an der Leiste so lange ab bis diese auf der Seite liegt und die Kabel herausgezerrt sind. Ich habe erst mal gar nicht begriffen was passiert war. Jetzt legen wir einfach eine Magnetleiste da hin und der Kobold wendet brav.
1,Ordered and reported as delivered (Saturn failure) which means there’s Sat nav issues! But no one to contact to challenge or discuss
5,I ordered this to cover the cables for our exterior Christmas lights to prevent trips or falls.This was easy to install and fits its purpose.
5,partivo prevenuto in merito a questo articolo.invece mi ha risolto un problema di passaggio di fili.inizialmente avevo optato con un tappeto ma pessima soluzione poi ho scoperto quest'articolo ed ha sistemato la problematica permettendo di far passare un cavo in stanza senza inciamparci dentro.ottimo prodotto
5,Very handy to cover trippy wires
5,Je l'ai utlisé pour camoufler un cable électrique qui couré au milieu du salon.Une fois installé l'ensemble est propre et fini
4,Achtung Fußboden Kanal ist flexibel nicht stabil. Etwas fummelig reinzubekommen das Kabel aber sonst ist alles ok 👌
5,Wir hatten den Kabelkanal für die Seniorenwohnung meiner Schwiegermutter bestellt.Ein Kabel welches vor der Balkontür eine Stolperfalle darstellte wurde erfolgreich damit beseitigt.Das Material ließ sich gut zuschneiden. Da es gerollt geliefert wurde hatte ich es 2 Tage komplett ausgerollt ausgelegt. Ein Geruch wie beschreiben war dann beim Verlegen nicht mehr vorhanden.Da wir in der Altenheimwohnung nichts verkleben durften ist es eine gute und sichere Alternative auch ohne Selbstklebestreifen.Schön wäre es wenn wie bei uns benötigt Eckenwinkel geben würde so musste ich es selber auf Gehrung schneiden.
4,Bis jetzt hab ich meine DMX XLR und Stromkabel immer mit Gaffa/Tape am Boden angeklebt dass kein Zuschauer bei den Kabel hängenbleibt und hinfällt. Als ich diese Kabelbrücken bei Amazon gefunden habe habe ich mir gleich 2 bestellt und sofort bei der nächsten Veranstaltung ausprobiert.Nach dem Auspacken sollte man die Kabelbrücken ein bisschen liegen lassen damit sie gerade werden das sie eingerollt geliefert werden.Auch wenn in der Beschreibung steht dass sie nicht verrutschen würde ich trotzdem den Anfang und das Ende mit Klebeband etwas ankleben. dann hält die ganze Geschichte auch.Von der Qualität her sind sie ganz gut.Werde mir warscheinlich noch ein paar bestellen.
4,Arrived very fast as all prime products do!A product bought for a purpose that performs as it should the construction certainly seems like it could take some continued beatings. Fitting the wires was very easy as the underside is very pliable. Although a thick black line is obvious on the floor (as you'd expect) the cover isn't too distinctive it is a very matte dull black with no gloss or shine to distract the eye. I'm using mine on carpet and the only niggle I have is it can slip a little bit when knocked by a chair etc but causes no real problem and I understand you can buy some from of adhesive to prevent this.All in all good product clean aesthetics good construction. Performs very well!
5,I bought this to prevent a trip hazard due to trailing xmas tree lights and despite the price which i thought was a touch excessive for the amount of 1.8 Metres i'm happy with the quality and durability of the product. Its reasonably  easy to cut through i used a pair of kitchen scissors the D-line groove is big enough to hold a thick extension cable and 2 thin wires of small lights.
5,Passe câble souple et pas trop haut.On peut passer des câbles sans prise (genre câble pour enceinte) dans les 2 parties non ouvertes à gauche et à droite du passe câble. Cela laisse plus de place pour passer d'autres câbles au centre (partie ouverte).Dommage qu'il n'y avait pas d'autres couleurs pour se marier à la couleur du sol.
5,This is excellent for covering my cables it's well made and good quality and good value for  the cost
5,Facile da istallare
5,Easy to install
1,die reinste Katastrophe! Es gibt keinen Klebestreifen trotz Gummi verrutscht das Ding immer und wird zur Stolperfalle. Kurz angestoßen schon sind die Kabel raus.
4,Could have sold in longer length. A
4,Ras ça fait le boulot.Dommage que l'adhérence soit inexistante mais un double face règle le problème
4,Bon Passe câble souple. Par contre il n’adhère pas au sol mais c’est pas plus mal
5,Very useful
5,Matière solide et souple c’est super simple à mettre en place on peut y glisser au moins 5 (je n’ai pas essayé plus) 🔌Sur du carrelage blanc c’est pas hyper beau mais c’est toujours moins moche que des cables éparpillés au sol et c’est plus pratique quand on passe l’aspirateur ou la serpillière et même pour l’aspirateur il les tires pas avec lui 👌🏻Merci de me dire si mon commentaire vous à été utile ça fait toujours plaisir 😌
4,Need it to cover cable at path bins go over it no problem
4,Leicht in der Handhabung scheint einen stabilen Eindruck zu machen und kann man mit einer ganz normalen Schere zurecht schneiden. Durchaus zufrieden
4,Perfect for protecting outside cables.
5,The best alternative to those stick-on wire covers.So happy.Excellent material with anti-slip design.
5,Great product
5,Bought this to safely cover an extension cable running across the floor of my garage.  Simple to use - not much else to say.  No worries about tripping up as a result.
5,Covers cables for protection and does not slip or slide
4,Parfait
1,Too thin/skinny to lay flat rubber grips underneath where you put the cable in are too weak and loose so cable just comes out... it was less of a trip hazard before!!
5,I have been using it to cover my hot tub wire outdoors works as it should.Good value for the money.
5,Fait bien son travail : évite d'avoir des câbles partout et qu'on se prenne les pieds dedans (ou qu'un animal ne les ronge)
5,Very satisfied perfect to hide and tidy wires
5,5 ESTRELAS
4,Does an ok job. Cable not as easy to tuck in as I had hope - it was probably a bit too thick as was charging cable from my electric car! Worked fine though in the end.
3,No se adhiere bien al suelo y es demasiado blando en la base por lo que al llegar doblado le cuesta volver al sitio y quedarse plano. Deben haber mejores opciones yo lo aproveche pero no lo volvería a comprar buscaría algo de mejores acabados con la base más rígida
2,Hard to keep flat.  Using for quite thick wire but really hard to even put wire in and then not heavy enough to even keep wire flat on the floor
5,They do what there ment to do  good value for money
5,Buongiorno a tutti. Questo copri-cavi D-Line è di ottima fattura morbido e ben strutturato resistente al calpestio. Imballato in una bella confezione di cartone sigillata anti taccheggio.L'ho usata per mascherare una quadrupla serie di cavi cassa da 4mm di diametro ciascuno infilati nella tasca centrale in sovrapposizione.La sezione centrale del copri-cavi D- Line offre una ottima capacità di innesto del cavo e una ottima mascheratura.La gomma offre una buona stabilità e una discreta presa anche sulla pavimentazione in parcquet.Ho acquistato due di questi copri cavi.Uno l'ho diviso in due spezzoni di egual misura. Durante il taglio la gomma non si sbriciola e si seziona senza screpolature sui bordi segno che la mescola è omogenea anche nella sezione portante.Essendo in gomma nera catturano la polvere facilmente.
5,Does what it says it does and good quality.
5,It's easy to fit cables and cable protector then holds them firmly. Lays flat once it has settled. Been down months now and no-one has tripped over it. Protects the cables and protects from tripping.
4,Gut
4,Gutes Produkt lässt sich auch gut schneiden. 1 Stern Abzug: die Verpackung stinkt absolut widerlich
5,Parfait et acheté d'occasion. Si ce n'était pas noté je ne l'aurais pas vu. Découpe parfaite glisse un peu sur mon sol donc j'ai mis un petit double face et c'est impeccable.
4,Would have liked it to be a bit longer but otherwise it has done what I wanted it to do and cleared up trailing leads etc.
5,I was unsure from the photo whether this product would lay nice and flat or not but it's really good. Just the right weight and flexibility to sit flat on the floor and hold itself in place.
5,Absolutely great value does the job perfectly
4,Took a bit of straightening out to get it to lay flat but it seems to be doing the job protecting cable into greenhouse
4,Se puede cortar perfectamente con una tijera si te sobra un cacho. Lo que encuentro a faltar es que no venga un adhesivo en la parte inferior para poder pegar la tira al suelo. De todas formas si colocas la tira bien tirante y sin que los cables tiren de ella queda extendida bien por su propio peso.
4,Great protection for cables going across the floor. Using this for four quite thick speaker cables (2X2 stereo). Would have been 5 star but it was fiddly inserting the thick speaker cables into the back of the strip - they popped out a few times during installation. Now it's installed it looks great and unobtrusive. Seems robust enough too. I think it could be a bit cheaper for the length you get but does the job.
5,The product was easy to fit and laid flat across the floor straight from the box with no 'curling'.
3,It does the job but it most certainly does not "uncoils to lay flat" as the product description claims. Be prepared to repeatedly smooth it out warm it etc to get it to actually stay unrolled and flat.
5,great product would recommend
5,Did what it said on the tin
4,An excellent product for lightweight use. I use it to cover my thick speaker cables. It's easy to fit and grips the carpet well making it almost impossible to trip over the cables. For the price an excellent solutionProsGood priceWell made and hardyEasy to installGrips carpetLays flatDoes what it's supposed to.ConsIt's black and it would be good if it came in other colours.
4,Buona canalina passacavi
4,Does exactly what it says only problem I had with it is that for the first day or so it doesn’t sit flush with the floor but give it a bit and it’ll sort itself out overall brilliant product.
5,Produit solide souple tout de même et assez lourd pour ne pas bouger au sol. Pas d'avis sur l'adhérence car a été mis contre le murPour 2/3 câbles ça peut le faire.
5,Funciona muy bien pero no tiene ningún tipo de adhesivo para pegarla. Eso es aparte si se quiere. Es resistente flexible y tiene suficiente espacio en la canaleta para introducir el cable y se introduce muy bien.
5,Good product.  Helps prevent the neighbours tripping over the extension cable for my lawnmower.
3,It lays down ok eventually. Getting it warm helps. The slit cable entry is too wide/too flimsy so doesn’t retain the cable that we’ll. and it’s quite a thick 2.5mm core extension lead
4,Erfüllt seinen Zweck und kam auf einer Rolle im Pappkarton; so kann man es natürlich gut lagern und transportieren.Ausreichend Platz für Kabel werden gegeben; zudem ist der Kleber sehr gut. Mal sehen ob er diese Temperaturen gut mitmacht; ich berichte wenn sich was negatives ergibt!
5,East to cut to correct length.  Lays flat - suggest laying it out and leaving to settle before inserting cable.  Today and safe workspace now
5,Product arrived quickly and well packed. Quality is good and easy to install. Strips layed flat after an hour or two after initially being coiled up. Will be buying more for the next machine due in a month or so.
3,Difficult to get cable in
5,Si vous n'avez pas cinquante câbles à passer fait parfaitement le boulo.... Perso j'en passe 4 (diamètre d'un cable réseau); sans soufis Assez lourd pour rester en place. très satisfait
4,Poche parole per questo prodotto che ho trovato davvero ideale al mio scopo cioè coprire dei cavi su di un pavimento. Materiale flessibile e modellabile ma allo stesso tempo resistente. Nella sezione centrale ci passa tranquillamente un cavo elettrico (3 cavi inseriti in guaina) e un cavo ethernet. Al momento non ho applicato alcun biadesivo per tenerla ferma a terra. Si taglia comodamente con un paio di forbili "serie" non quelle da bambino con le punte arrotondate per intendersi.Consigliato.Se hai trovato interessante la recensione metti un mi piace.Grazie.
4,I'm using it to hide a power cable a network cable and a 9mm thick extension lead. It just about copes with these after a bit of work squeezing them in.It straightened out pretty quickly lays flat cuts to length with a pair of scissors and looks good.Definitely worthwhile if you have loose cables across your floor.
4,Produit utilisé dans nos bureaux.Mise en place rapide. Par contre le nombre de câbles est limité à 2 voire 3 maxi a condition qu’ils ne soient pas trop gros.
4,Great quality!  Cables come out of the bottom very easily though especially if they're thin.  I wish there was overlap between the bottom flaps.
5,It does the job it's very distinctly black (not grey as it looks in the pictures don't worry) soft enough to cut to size with normal scissors. Just one caveat: it's quite low profile so the channel is very shallow. I don't care - in fact it's what I wanted - but just be aware that all I put into it was one network cable and one power extension cable and they JUST fit. Couldn't have wedged another in there.
5,Ons of our outlets had to be replaced so I had to pull a power cord from the other side of the room. Unfortunately this meant going across a pathway. This is sturdy and visible prevent people from tripping and trampling the cord. You can "install" it in about 20 seconds
5,Putting Christmas light cables in this guard created a cover for the cables and making it NOT a trip hazard.
5,Purchased to go over the wires from our Christmas lights - good quality - nice and sturdy.Quick delivery good price.
4,Not really big enough to fit more than one or two cables in the centre opening so i customised it and cut open the side holes and tucked cables in there! Then they all fit !! Glad it was easy to cut to size that was fab.
5,Macht was es soll! Liegt flach und gerade auf dem Boden.Das Kabel ist geschützt und es gibt eine Stolperfalle weniger in unserem Haus ;)
5,It's never pretty having cables strewn around the floor and this makes the cable journey from my electronic drums to the mixer like a dream.  It was a bit of a pain getting the cables in the cover and it took a while for it to straighten out (it comes rolled up as pictured).Now however it's sat beautifully on my floor guarding the cables from unwary boots and people that might want to trip over them.  It won't protect you from dragons but it'll keep your cables safe and you safe from your cables.
4,Quite a lightweight product but ideal for the job
4,Purtroppo credevo che la canalina potesse essere fissata anche con l'utilizzo di viti o chiodini ma non è possibile. Inoltre in dotazione non è compreso l'adesivo per il fissaggio e una volta fissata se si vogliono togliere o aggiungere fili bisogna staccarla e quindi riapplicare dell'adesivo nuovo. Per questo motivo ho richiesto il reso del prodotto
4,after the third incident i decided to take action four months contemplating buying a cable protector i took decisive action and i haven't looked back since.  free cable
5,Very sturdy easy to use providing great protection for ethernet cable across a doorway.
5,Arrivata in tempi brevi in confezione come vista in fase di ordine. Si taglia facilmente ed una volta messa a terra rimane ferma. Se ci fossero dei piccoli adesivi e\o delle parti ruvide sarebbe ancora migliore ma già così è veramente ottima e se ne consiglia l'acquisto
5,A good solid product. Purchased to run a cable across a doorway. It stands up to regular foot fall and remains as good as new after a few months of use. Perfect for home or business use environments.
5,Exactly what you would expect it to be
4,Buona
3,Très bien pour cacher des câbles mais pas suffisamment pour des câbles avec des petites connexions par exemple pour des canapés relax électrique !!
5,This cover has finally brought me such peace of mind now that I won't trip and fall over a rogue cable in the middle of the night I can sleep! Great value worth the purchase.
2,Quite disappointed with this. Found it to be lightweight and will only just fit 2 regular leads in (made more difficult by it being so lightweight). As it's quite light it moves quite a lot so spend a lot of the day moving it back into place. If you need this for somewhere it won't be disturbed by foot traffic and just require it to cover the leads it might be ok but I don't think it would be suitable for a foot traffic area and might even be a trip hazard if knocked and not placed back in correct flat position. We have had to place a heavy rubber-backed rug on top of it to stop it moving so much (at least it will protect the leads under the rug - I hope). Sorry can't recommend.
5,Although not a heavy duty protector this product does its job very well. A single 15 amp cable is very easily inserted and I have cut the protector with scissors into 2 lengths for easy carriage ( I use it to prevent tripping when I use it while giving audio-visual presentations to village hall audiences).
3,Semble assez solide mais un peu trop souple.
4,Cacher les fils dommage que la couleurs ne soit pas blanche !!
5,Great product easy to cut to size cable protected by design of protector would recommend
4,Le falta el adhesivo
5,ottimo
5,Hab es auf der Messe verwendet!
4,Nécessité de le coller (adhésif double face) sur le sol
5,bonne qualite
3,Too lightweight it doesnt even have enough weight to hold the wires down without curling up. Bit of a waste of time
4,Was a little hard to get flat after being wrapped up to shop. Does the job intended but would bace liked something to secure to hard flooring as it doesn’t grip.
5,Theres enough length for 2 bedroom doorways which is what I used it for. The rubber can be cut to size I recommend using a metal cover blade as plastic ones may bend.Overall gives my ethernet and telephone line a clean presentation
5,Fantastic...bought this twice to tidy away cables and to avoid tripping over them. Easy to use and clean. Very durable.
5,Der Kabelkanal liegt auf einem Teppichboden und es wird eine Stromleitung bzw. an anderer Stelle ein Netzwerkkabel und HDMIkabel durchgeführt. Ohne Verklebung liegt der Kabelkanal recht fest auf dem Teppichboden besser als erhofft. Es passen durchaus zwei stärkere Kabel durch dabei bleibt die Höhe sehr in Grenzen das Ding wird nicht selbst zur Stolperfalle ganz im Gegenteil. Ich kann den Kabelkanal nur uneingeschränkt empfehlen.
4,Facile
5,Ich habe befürchtet das die Leiste ohne Selbstklebendes Band nicht am Boden hält. Ist in der Praxis allerdings gar nicht so. Die "Leiste" liegt am Boden ist wie gummiert und bleibt wo sie soll auch wenn man drauf tritt etc.Die Perfekte Lösung für mich im Fitnessstudio.Grundsätzlich macht die "Leiste" auch den Eindruck das sie lange halten wird. Echt Top besser als erwartet.
5,Works great. I used it to duct a network and a power cable in my conservatory.It's easy to cut with a regular pair of scissors or a sharp box cutter style knife.It could easily accommodate a pair of regular electric extension wires or in my case an electric cable and an ethernet cable.It feels fine to walk on the rubber seems to be high quality and there's no smell.
5,Purchased this for a little electric cable job for the garden to hide and protect the cable. Does exactly as needed
5,Parfait
3,Works well but needs to be glued down. The cables pop out from time to time. Also it tries to roll itself back up
5,Wir brauchten einen Kabelkanal am Eingang unter einem Teppich durch. Da dieser Kanal sehr flach ist und trotzdem zwei RJ45 Kabel (Netzwerkkabel) darin geschützt werden können ist die Lösung perfekt. Obwohl wir zwei Stück in Folge unter den Teppich gelegt haben gibt es kein Verrutschen. Wir mussten die beiden Kanäle nichtmal zusammenkleben. Hält perfekt!
5,👍
5,Easy to use. Does a good job of keeping cables covered. Flexible. Recommended.
5,This is a very handy cable management item that is a nice study rubber texture and works well
3,Die Anbringung fand ich recht einfach aber mir gefällt nicht dass die Leiste hin und her rutscht. Die Kable sind aber relativ gut vertstaut.
5,Sollte nur vielleicht nochmal festgeklebt werden da der Kabelkanal an den Seiten nicht zu 100% aufliegt.Ich finde den Kabelkanal aber TOP! vorallem weil dieser auch flexibel ist und sich leicht in der Länge anpassen lässt.Werde mir falls ich nochmal einen benötige erneut zu diesem hier greifen.
2,Gomma antiscivolo robusta relativamente facile da tagliare a misura. Includere del biadesivo non sarebbe stato disdicevole.Inoltre la gomma porosa e liscia tende a trattenere polvere e sporcizia dalla suola delle scarpe di chi la calpesta così la canalina passa in poco tempo dal colore originario a un chiazzato-sporco che in certi ambienti non è il massimo. Si poteva fare meglio.
5,Wir haben diesen Kabelkanal gekauft da wir Stolperfallen vermeiden wollten. Es funktioniert super. Der Kabelkanal ist rutschfest und sitzt super an Ort und Stelle.  Wir werden hier auf jedenfall noch weitere holen.
5,Heavy duty yet easy to cut to size.  Sits nice and flat on the floor
4,Stolperfalle beseitigt. Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen bei losen Kabeln die einfach über dem Boden liegen. Das Material ist einfach mit einem Cutter auf die gewünschte Länge zuzuschneiden.
4,Does the job.
5,cables feel secure when inside.  it's lightweight yet still protects well.
4,Très bon produit. Cache bien le câble + protection du câble ok.
2,Ich fand die Nudel einfach nur potthässlich.Ich hab sie fast 3 Tage liegen lassen ganz eben war die auch dann nicht.Ging sofort zurück.Hab mir dann die von ARLI geholt:Sieht um Welten besser aus kostet die Hälfte und liegt komplett Plan.
5,Ce passe cable est de bonne qualité costaud J'ai mis un double face sur le carrelage et ça adhére très bien.
4,Used this to contain and trail our internet cables safely. Sits flat on carpet floor once you put in your cables. Can get a little curvy over time (but still flat) so if you can somehow hold it in place it should remain straight.
5,Well worth the money
5,Just enough room in the channel for a HDMI and thick RCA stereo audio cable which is just what I needed to connect my projector across the room. Loose cable would be a bad trip hazard - especially in the dark. This I can leave there all the time with no worries. A choice of colours to match typical floor coverings would be nice however.
5,Un producto ideal para cubrir cables del suelo en mi caso 2 cables que según el fabricante es lo que cabe en el hueco central. Es grandecomparado con otros modelos pero nada de otro mundo.La calidad es muy buena de plástico flexible pero muy resistente se puede colocar en un sitio de tránsito sin problema.No es autoadhesivo yo lo puse con silicona caliente y quedó perfecto.
3,Funciona pero es bastante difícil de pegar se despega con facilidad. Yo lo tengo puesto con cinta de doble cara pero alguna zona está medio levantada
5,Produit arriver enrouler reprend sa forme originale super rapidement facile à poser
4,Está bien porque tapa los cables pero lo que no me gustó es que se quedaba un poco levanta tuve que apretarla con pegamento al suelo y ahora está perfecta
5,Spot on...
5,reasonably easy to fit over the wires strong and hardwearing
4,Works moderately well at covering unsightly cabling. The only problem being that my Roomba vacuum cleaner runs into them rather than over... Nobodies fault really
5,pratique
3,Good quality product. I would say it could hold 2-3 average sized cables without lifting off the floor. It doesn't grip to my Lino floor though which I was expecting.
4,Arriva arrotolato ma si srotola facilmente e assume forma piana senza problemiUsato 1 inverno per cavi all’esterno. Nessun segno di usura o irrigidimento della gomma.Fa il suo mestiere perfettamente
5,Good quality item. Easy to use.
5,Works perfectlyAs describedI'm buying another!
1,Really thin probably just for office use with thin cable. And extention wouldn't fit
5,Very happy with this. I don't need it for heavy duty work but as a safety precaution especially when there are cildren and OAPs around. I can put two or three wires comfortably through the conduit and it's easy to cut into smaller piece when needed. Rolls into a small bundle for storage.
5,Good value.I ran 2 power cords and 2 ethernet cat5e cables through this (using the lateral conducts for the eth cables).The lateral conducts are not open but they are easily cut with a cutter or some scissors.Once filled with the cables it stick nicely to the floor.
5,Parfait facile à refermer une fois les câbles placés dans la gouttière
4,Lo compre para pasar por el suelo un cable a otro lugar de la casa y la verdad que es de muy buena calidad aunque eché de menos la falta de un adhesivo en la parte inferior algo que pudo arreglar la cinta doble cara del bazar.
5,Great item for hiding wires away
5,Buena solución. Eso sí si cortas un trozo pequeño puede que tengas que eliminar previamente el vicio que trae al ir enrollada la canaleta en su presentación y no se consigue del todo.Para pegarlo bien compré una tira autoadhesiva de doble cara de gran capacidad de adherencia por el vicio ya citado a enroscarse la canaleta sobre sí. Lo recomiendo.
5,Ottimo prodotto soprattutto molto utile per evitare di inciampare nei filo a terra. Sono riuscita ad inserire due cavi di spessore normale senza alcun problema. Come suggerito dalla casa produttrice ne ho aggiunto un altro . La presa a terra e’ ottima e non scivola.
2,even with fairl moderat foot fll in a store room it soon broke up under not very heavy foot fall
5,Acheter pour cacher un câble de canapé électrique il fait son job mais une largeur plus petite aurait été un plus
5,Great at hiding the wires in my office.
3,Unter trittfest hatte ich etwas anderes erwartet.Es ist zwar richtig das der Kanal nicht beschädigt wird allerdings schützt er die Kabel kaum bis gar nicht.Bestenfalls Stolperfallen kann man damit beseitigen.
5,Je fais passer deux gros câbles de multiprises dedans sur un mètre de long et c’est parfait.Attention cependant il ne serait pas possible de mettre un troisième câble même fin...
5,does the job well.  Managed to insert the cables i needed and I would buy again.  D-Line CC-1 Black Cable Protector/Floor Cable Cover | Cable Tidy Trip Protection | Prevent Cable Trip Hazards in Home & Office. 1.8m & 9m length - Black
5,This is a perfect example of a quick effective solution.  Set it and forget it.  Easy.  Happy.
4,Serves the purpose well and a good quality thick plastic/rubber to protect the cables preventing potential  tripping on them
4,facile a installer
5,Protection de passages pour humain et robot
5,Gute stabile Ausführung. Ordenliche Kabelführung. Hält was es verspricht.
5,Perfect. We used this wire to hide our fridge cable due to kids going over several times a day. Before they used to try pull and kick the wire. Now they don't even notice it's there. Spot on.
3,Fällt in sich zusammen. Lässt sich sehr schwer bis überhaupt nicht am Boden fixieren.Aber der Staubsauger fährt darüber und bleibt nicht mehr hängen...
4,pratique protège éviter de marcher dessus quand même. Un peu cher
4,solide. bien fait.
5,Does the job. Would be better if it had a sticky surface on the bottom so it wouldn't slide about but I tacked it to the floor
5,Good sturdy product and could cut to size. Various sizes available works great
5,Habe es im Wohnzimmer verwendet damit der Saugroboter nicht alle Kabel am Boden frisst.Dauert ca 3 Wochen bis es flach liegt. Lässt sich gut schneiden mit der Schere
5,Mich hatten die Strom- und Netzwerkkabel auf dem Boden immer genervt. Jetzt liegt da zwar eine schwarze Gummileiste sieht aber ordentlich aus und ist sicherer für Mensch und Geräte.Unser Xiaomi Roborock fährt da drüber als wäre der Stolperschutz nicht da auch prima!
5,Es lo suficientemente elástico para q no se doble
5,Produit solide et pas trop large par rapport aux autres modèles
5,Vraiment comptant de mon achat. Bien conçu et résistant. Permet de bien protéger les câbles.
5,Molto utile buono il materiale
5,Das Material scheint von hoher Qualität zu sein. Der anfängliche Gummigeruch ist nicht unangenehm und verfliegt auch schnell. Der Kanal lässt sich einfach mit einer Schere zuschneiden.
5,Great for covering wires
5,Just the job for covering Xmas light cables on the patio!
3,Very lightweight indeed!
5,Does the job it’s meant to
5,Fits cables of a larger gauge decently well and is soft to walk on.  Total lifesaver around my small flat.  If you need to cut to make multiple it's not too difficult either.
5,Me gusta mucho la canaleta. Es pesada de goma como los neumáticos. Por su forma se adapta perfectamente al suelo sin necesidad de fijarla. Y sobre todo la veo muy segura. Alguna vez puse canaleras adhesivas para el suelo con otro perfil y era fácil tropezarse. Esta al ser de goma tan ancha y aplanada la encuentro muy segura. Immposible tropezarse
3,Sa reste du caoutchouc quoi et sa remplis sont taff.
5,Kam aufgerollt bei mir an. Ausgerollt und einmal anders herum aufgerollt. Hingelegt und Kabel reingelegt. Passt wunderbar. Kein aufrollen von sich aus. Liegt seit dem ersten Tag in seiner Position. Es gibt nichts zu beanstanden. Danke! Ich werde noch zwei weitere ordern.
4,Tutto ok
3,Pour un local oui mais pas esthétique dans une maison trop massif ...
4,Excellent value for money! and fitted the purpose beautifully.
5,Thick rubber pre split for cable entry in the base needs to be flattened by rolling in opposite direction to that supplied before using did the job admirably and I'd reckon you could drive a tank over it without incident it's that tough!
5,Came quickly and as described there is not a lot of room for wires so if you are looking to run multiple wires underneath then perhaps consider another product otherwise excellent.
4,Para lo ancho que es creí que se podían meter más cables. Pero muy bien.
5,Sehr zufrieden! Bringt genau das was es bringen soll: Sicherheit gegen Stolpergefahr und Ordnung
4,easy to fit just push it  in done great
4,keeps cords safe
4,Bit of a pain to cut but seems to be working well
4,Product was as expected and arrived on time
4,Mette ordine nel fascio di cavi a pavimento ma l’adesione al pavimento non risulta essere ottimale già dopo alcune settimane.
5,Does exactly as described.does not move around the floorPerfect solutionsafely packagedfast despatchhighly recommend many thanks
5,Super Kabelkanal.Super Verarbeitung habe schon den zweiten bestellt weil ich begeistert und überzeugt bin. Alle kabel versteckt und aufgeräumt.
5,Super. Ausgerollt eine Nacht liegen lassen und am nächsten Tag habe ich mein lankabel damit verschwinden lassen
5,gut
5,This was perfect for hiding a cable which needed to go across a walkway. The only niggle is it comes rolled upAnd it can take a while for the curve to drop out of it.
5,Just what I needed - I take a projector to various clubs to give talks - often the cable runs across where people are walking. This cable cover is great easy to use and lays flat.
5,Just what I wanted to avoid the family tripping up over Christmas cables which cross our landing floor. Easy to cut from the 1.8m to the exact length I needed
4,What can I say.
5,Trun a extension lead across a doorway
5,Ordered this for the office and does reduce the trip hazard. However over time it does "walk" and if cables are too thick they come out
4,Great product just the job Thank you
5,This cable cover is just the job for covering any wires across the floor.  It is solid rubber and sits flat on the floor it is ideal as it already has a split up the back saving you the job of cutting it open.  Excellent value for the money.
5,Reçu 1 jour plus tôt que prévu. Emballage parfait. Protection de câbles déroulée et sans problème mise à plat très rapidement. Installée de suite et stable (sans nécessité d'un adhésif). Pouvons marcher dessus (caoutchouc) très franchement car très solide. A acheter.
1,Das Wichtigste fehlt! KEIN Klebestreifen vorhanden OBWOHL der in dem Manual gezeigt wird. Also fliegt das Ding wild in der Gegendrum! Womit soll ich das fixieren mot Pattex???  Dieses Teil ist SELBER eine Stolperfalle so was zu verkaufen ist eine Frechheit. Absolut minderwertige Qualität die Kabel fliegen auch mangels Halt ständig wieder raus. Fühle mich total  veräppelt absoluter Fehlkauf! Also muß ich nun doch in den Baumarkt und genau um das zu vermeiden habe ich das Teil bestellt. Tja reingefallen. Kann ich NICHT empfehlen Finger weg von diesem Müll!
5,Does exactly what it says on the tin.  Easy to fit and strong and durable.  Perfect for covering up cables in the office.
5,Heavy duty item that does the job required.
3,c'est efficace par contre prévoyez quelque chose pour le coller parce que vous aller le recevoir enrouler sur lui même
2,Der als 180 cm lange gelieferte Kabelkanal ist deutlich kürzer.
5,Used at church. Hasn't failed yet. Be careful with storage kinks take a while to go away.
5,Bought to protect the wires for xmas lights that ran from the garage across the drive. Has worked fine so far. Wires intact and no issues with the car going over it.
5,Just the perfect thing for tidied cables across a floor that when walked on feel like a wee bump than walking on wires and recommend this very item
4,Fitted 2 Ethernet cables
5,Does the job well and at a good price. Keeps flat on the floor and covers the cables good value product too.
5,Ohne weitere Befestigungen wird das Kabel sicher am Boden gehalten.
5,Used this to cover Xmas light cables across a path to prevent a trip hazard.  Worked perfectly.
5,Did just what it was suppose to and was very easy to use.  Now no cable to fall over!
5,unliebsames stolper oder dergleichen!
5,It’s fine for the money.
5,Genau wie erwartet schön flexibel man bringt gut Kabel rein und er liegt gut.
5,Works perfectly and is just the right width and length.It also lays nicely flat even after it's been loosely rolled up.
5,Ottima canalina per far sparire i fili e non farli calpestare. Il prodotto è ottimo richiede però dell’autoadesivo se si vuole che la stessa rimanga ben ancorata al pavimento!! Può essere tagliata per l’esigenza del caso! Consiglio senza problemi!!
5,Perfetta se si vuole proteggere cavi liberi nel pavimento l'ho fissata con del semplice nastro biadesivo in silicone soddisfatto. Per il prezzo va bene così.
5,Conforms to description
5,Ben fatta è molto flessibile
5,Top Produkt.Gute Qualität / keinerlei Gummigeruch.Sehr flachSuper schnell geliefert
5,Utilisé pour passer un câbles ordinateur et electrique en usqge domestique.  Bonbe qualitexde produit epais  et souple a la fois
4,With lower temperature it's hard to flatten but further good.
5,Was just as expected :) no issues!
1,Prévu pour héberger un SEUL cable secteur et bien au delà que c'est un peu compliqué à l'intérieur mais ça se fait le problème vient du fait que le cable en question ne tient pas correctement et est plus épais que le logement. Résultat le passe cable ne repose plus à plat et perd de son intérêt car il n'est plus stable.Bref si vous avez des cables USB ok mais pas pour des cables secteur
5,Perfect to avoid tripping over a couple of cables. Comes coiled up but unrolls flat no problem. Nice low profile too. Would recommend.
1,Si tienes que hacer pequeños codos no vales… las lineas que tiene por debajo limitan que se adhiera bien
5,Faccio una premesse ho dovuto restituire il prodotto non perché non fosse valido anzi lo era ed è un buon prodotto molto versatile.Purtroppo non adatto al mio scopo.Cmq ripeto ottimo materiale e fattezza merita 5 stelle ugualmente.
5,Love the cable tidy.  Looks neat and is great for avoiding the trip hazard of cables running across the floor.
3,Serait nettement plus pratique avec de l'autocollant au dos
3,Using it as a bump stop.Stuck it to garage wall to protect car doors.
5,Does the job. Use a super sharp blade to cut.
5,Produit conforme à la description. Facile pour ranger ses câbles et surtout souple afin de couper en fonction de la longueur désirée.
2,Unfortunately the flap at the back and the groove are to ride ie tge flap does not meet or over lap or seal togeather so the leads fall out if moved .
4,Good quality cable cover
3,Tapa los cables y se puede pisar.
3,Come canalina per adesso va bene e pare resistente ma non inserire nel pacco la striscia adesiva per il pavimento non mi permette di dargli una valutazione superiore alle tre stelle.
3,does the job but if not fixed properly to the floor it moves....
2,MANCA L'ADESIVO
2,non capisco nemmemo io perchè l'ho presa. qualitativamente non è nulla di che se non un pezzo di gomma.Aderisce ma anche con del biadesivo potente tende a scollarsi mentre l'adesivo rimane sul pavimento.Non lo ricomprerei. L'ho preso per pigrizia per non andare in un bricoman o simili... apena avrò voglia la sostituirò sicuramente.
4,assez lourd pour être bien stablepeux accueillir 3 câbles ethernetcouleur noir mat passe partoutproduit perenne et standart
3,OK mais plastique un peu "collant" et prends la poussière ou les marques de pas
5,Découpage facile. Les 2 câbles à protéger se sont logés facilement. La chute sert dans mon jardin à protéger le fin tuyau d'arrosage goutte à goutte qui traverse l'allée.
4,buono ma non ottimo
5,perfect for what I  neededarrived quickly soon after I orderedeasy to use will buy again if needed.
5,Dieser Kabelkanal liegt sauber auf und lässt sich auf jede Länge kürzen. Unser Büro ist nun "aufgeräumt".
5,Can’t wait to use it at xmas to keep cabling out the way.
5,It came rolled up. letting it lay flat for a while helped get it flattened but after that it worked well.
5,Stable and comfortable when stepped on. Good space for few cables
5,Fitted with ease .l was concerned when it arrived coiledl laid out for about half an hourthen put it in its place ...very good result
5,C'est absolument ce dont j'avais besoin. Souple tien seul sur le sol et assez robuste pour qu'on puisse passer dessus sans habimer les câbles de trouvent dessous.
5,Good product easy to resize and it does tlwhat its supposed to.
4,Great product slightly pricey though.
3,Fissata al palchetto con un po' di colla a caldo altrimente si muove ci passano 1 cavo di rete per buco e 2 al centro. Per il resto esteticamente non mi dispiace.
5,Easy to use - great way to avoid any accidents.
5,Excellent pour les cêbles et éviter qu'on s'y prenne les mieds
4,It would have been better if a bit wider
5,Bella e funzionale. Dovevo far passare un cavo davanti ad una porta in ufficio e devo dire che ci sta veramente bene. Senza dover incollarla al pavimento sta li ferma anche se ci passi sopra. Ottimo acquisto.

5,Super!
5,Very good low profile. Ours has been used outdoors with no ill effects.
5,Good
1,Die Leiste ist leider viel zu dick und somit für meinen Zweck nicht zu gebrauchen.
5,Ottimo prodotto. Veramente efficace
5,As expected and really good quality product with a slit underneath to push in the cable through
1,Mal producto solo es válido para pasar un cable muy fino  como de teléfono para un cable normal no vale  queda con panza y no se puede poner en el suelo
5,It done the job I wanted it to do. Good service.
5,Sehr hilfreich und sicher wenn man ein Kabel im Gehweg hat
5,Este pasacables esta muy bien siempre que no necesites pasar mas de dos cables por su interior. El material puede cortarse si es necesario para ajustar su longitud
5,Great product excellent value for money  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !
5,un buon prodotto contiene 2 cavi di spessore medio senza problemi ma potrebbero diventare 3 forzando un po'.Inizialmente non è ben steso dato che nella confezione è arrotolato ma in poco tempo si stende.Rimane stabile sul pavimento e se calpestato non scivola.Tempi di consegna perfetti.
5,Einfach super
5,Excellent
5,Neat tidy & inexpensive. Saves on trip hazards in our office. Recommended
5,Good product saving all my staff from an office accident.
5,Pasacables que cumple su función perfectamente queda muy bien extendido fácil de poner el único pero posible es que caben pocos cables pero es lo que dicen en la descripción.

5,Did the job
5,Heavy weight works perfectly

5,All good thank you
5,Very pleased with product arrived as promised.
3,Prodotto come descritto arrivato nei tempi .All'atto pratico un po' piccolo entrano due cavi grossi più uno piccolo ma è resistente e ben fatto
5,Easy to use very straightforward to fit works well looks good
5,Money well spent
5,Just the job. Good price good quality
5,Works fine
5,No good for purpose
1,There is no adhesive and the duct is too light to stay in place by itself so the end result is a piece of rubber that flies around your floor.
5,bought to guard cables running over a hardwood floor Perfect for the job and also avoids my tripping over them
5,Does a good job hiding speaker cables etc.Thank you.
5,Covers cable.  Works great.
2,Not much cop. It. Wont lie flat and try as i might i cannot get the cable to stay in the groove on the underside of the product. Its useless.
5,I haven't tripped over my cable once since this arrived
5,Thankyou
5,Passt perfekt auf unserem Büro Teppich
1,Persönlich würde ich hier vom Kauf abraten. Nach mehrmaligen Versuchen hält der Kabelkanal einen einzigen Kabel einer Mehrfachsteckleiste nicht in der Mitte fest. Das untere Mittelstück hat schlichtweg eine zu "labbrige" Öffnung das das Kabel in der Schiene nicht festhalten kann und esl beinah sofort wieder herausspringt.
5,All as described
1,Looks ugly and huge not practical at all.. I'm Very disapointed
5,Right size for the PSVR cable  no more tripping over wires
5,Worked well for me - plenty of room for multiple cables and lays flat nicely.
5,This is lightweight and easy to secure the wires inside very pleased.
1,Not big enough to fit cables into unimpressed. Can't return as it has been cut.
5,TOP
4,Molto pratici e stabili. I cavi si inseriscono facilmente e le coperture si stendono bene sul pavimento e non tendono a spostarsi.
5,parfait cache les fils en un clin d œil
5,Great cable cover perfect length for my use case too :D
5,great for safety no more tripping on wires
5,exactly as expected. no issues and works well
5,Buone e aderiscono bene al pavimento
5,Great
5,Per aderire devi usare collo o nastro adesivo
5,il prodotto e' conforme alla descrizione e' robusto e copre bene anche due cavi si adatta bene al terreno
5,Very good
5,ottimo prodotto usato in ditta...magari sarebbe stato top se nella parte inferiore ci fosse stato del biadesivo
5,Buen material rígido y fácil colocacion no trae adhesivo para pegarlo estaría bien comprar cinta de doble cara.
1,This Is not how I expected it my cable width is slightly large and therefore will not fit in the groove.
2,Bit disappointing as it slides around on the floor resulting in cables underneath becoming dislodged
1,Cable doesn’t fit properly. Can I return it
5,Does the job
2,This product was returned as it is delivered rolled tightly which means that once opened it doesn't lie flat on the floor and therefore doesn't work
5,Aderisce bene al pavimento e passano tre cavi. La consiglio.
1,Non capisco perché siano tutti così soddisfatti di un prodotto così sovrapprezzato. La canalina fa il suo dovere sebbene il materiale gommoso di cui è composta sia una calamita per sporcizia e segni di scarpe. Però un pezzo di gomma non può costare quasi 20€. Purtroppo l'ho acquistata perché ne avevo bisogno e non pensavo si sporcasse così tanto. Adesso però l'ho sostituita con una canalina di plastica rigida della stessa lunghezza (più capiente e facile da pulire) ma pagata 5€ in una nota catena di bricolage.
5,Très bon produit
5,great buy fit for purpuse
3,Buon prodotto utile per coprire cavi pc o elettrici negli uffici.Da consigliare per chi in ufficio vuole ordinare i cavi.
5,Good quality.. perfect for the job
5,Looks really professional 👍👍
5,Great item
5,Good Just what I wanted.
5,Lo monterò effettivamente tra qualche giorno ma da una prima prova sembra essere perfetto!! Con una punta di silicone dovrebbe fissarsi perfettamente. Sembra molto robusto.
2,Pas très pratique à utiliser

5,Lightweight but ideal for what I needed.
5,very good.
1,È vero che protegge i cavi ma non è facile incollare la copertura al pavimento. Succede infatti che se si stacca e qualcuno ci inciampa sopra i danni sono ben peggiori di un semplice filo posato per terra.
5,Great for the office
5,just right>
5,Questa canalina da pavimento e a dir poco fantastica aderisce benissimo al pavimento all'interno si possono far passare dei cavi che non si vuole che vengano schiacciati ed è in grado di farlo egregiamente. È molto largo ed ha una lunghezza abbastanza utile da poter utilizzare ad esempio negli uffici per far passare dei cavi a terra che non si vuole vengono
5,"D-Line CC-1 Canalina Cavi per Pavimento Calpestabile Passacavo 17 x 9 mm - 18 m di Lunghezza colore Nero"Ho montato un Gazebo in Giardino e non ho la corrente vicino. La presa si trova al di la del vialetto e ho cosi due scelte. Far passare il filo dall'alto oppure dal basso sul pavimento.Ho scelto questa seconda soluzione e ho cercato una Canalina Calpestabile.Ho trovato questa della D - Line ed è perfetta allo scopo.E' flessibile ma allo stesso tempo rigida quando si poggia a terra. Si taglia facilmente con delle normali forbici.Può contenere più di un filo e l’inserimento e’ semplice.Nella confezione non c'è il biadesivo ma questo non è un problema.La Canalina ha un buon Grip resta ferma soprattutto su superficie e mattonelle ruvide tipo cotto o mattonelle da giardino.Ho letto che qualcuno si è lamentato del fatto che usando il biadesivo tradizionale  la Canalina rimane fissa.Se c'è la necessità di rimuoverla bisogna rimetterne del nuovo e rimuovere il vecchio.Il problema si risolvere semplicemente usando il biadesivo a VELCRO anziché quello normale.Ne ho preso uno della 3M che ho recensito. Di seguito il nome del prodotto: 3M Hook & Loop Sistema di Fissaggio Richiudibile ad Alte Prestazioni 25 mm x 1.25 m Nero 2 Rotoli.Il velcro permette di staccare la Canalina per mettere e togliere fili in qualsiasi momento e riattaccarla subito dopo senza sforzo.Il rapporto qualità prezzo è buono.Con circa 18 euro ricevi a casa 18 m di Passacavo robusto e residente.Con Prime la spedizione è inclusa.Pochi considerano la comodità di ricevere il prodotto a casa senza dover uscire prendere l'auto e girare per negozi specializzati.Non è un prodotto che in genere trovi nel negozio sotto casa o nella classica ferramenta. Poi l'eccezione ci sta.Per quanto mi riguarda è un prodotto che ricomprerei.Spedizione puntuale e pacco arrivato integro.Spero che di averti chiarito le idee. Se non l'ho fatto grazie comunque di avermi letto.Alla prossima. Un saluto.
4,Ho potuto avere due modelli di passacavo D-Line per la recensione questo con vano di 19mm x 7mm e un altro un po’ più grande con vano di 30mm x 10mm.Sono validi e permettono di aumentare la sicurezza dove vi sono cavi che passano sul pavimento sia per il rischio di inciampare sia per il rischio che i cavi vengano danneggiati o sconnessi involontariamente.D-Line produce anche altri tipi di canaline o battiscopa per il passaggio di cavi.Dei due modelli che ho provato questo è il meno capace adatto a due-tre cavi di dimensione medio piccola. Io ho usato questo tipo per far passare un cavo di una ciabatta più un cavo di rete ed è rimasto ancora un po’ di spazio.Questo modello non prevede di poter essere prolungato mentre l’altro è dotato di fori e spine per unire più segmenti e superare il metro e ottanta se occorre.Sul fondo del passacavo Il vano per i cavi ha una divisione e non è quindi necessario infilare i cavi lungo il passacavo ma si può montare il passacavo anche con cavi già cablatiLo spessore esterno è di 12mm e la larghezza è di 60mm.Il materiale è gommoso arriva arrotolato ma poggiandolo a terra il suo peso stesso lo fa stare al suo posto. Non scivola facilmente per cui può essere semplicemente appoggiato a terra e fa già un buon servizio. I bordi rastremati limitano al minimo la possibilità che si inciampi e che si possa spostare il passacavo.Per una maggiore stabilità si può certamente ricorrere a nastro biadesivo.Nel mio caso per raggiungere una scrivania con un cavo elettrico e un cavo di rete ho usato questo modello tagliato alla misura necessaria e già solo poggiato a terra ha migliorato decisamente la situazione.
5,È davvero una buona canalina semplice ma di ottima qualità produzione Made in UK.Da considerare che il profilo ha uno spessore ridotto (12 mm di altezza) e ha una larghezza esterna di 6 cm; internamente lo spazio per i cavi è di 17 mm ideale quindi al massimo per due cavi da 8 mm.È una canalina che non presenta viti da fissaggio va stesa e solo posizionata avendo nella parte sottostante delle scanalature che ne aumentano il grip.La canalina è in PVC morbida (e infatti arriva arrotolata in una scatola molto ben fatta) grazie a questa caratteristica si adatta  bene alla posizione necessaria. Altro pregio importante è che la si può tagliare con le forbici quindi partendo dalla lunghezza massima di 1.8 m si può accorciare.È resistente I cavi rimangono ben protetti schiacciati a terra e non aggrovigliati. Il profilo a "D" permette di passarci anche sopra con facilità sia camminandoci sia con sedie da ufficio o altro. È antiscivolo ottimo per garantire sicurezza negli ambienti in cui c'è necessità di avere pavimenti liberi e privi da intralci rischiosi.Si impolvera questo sì calpestandola con le scarpe si vede; si può lavare con uno straccio normale (mentre la lavo io la tengo ferma sempre con i piedi) e se voglio passare sopra con l'aspirapolvere procedo nel senso della lunghezza.Ad un costo di circa 18€ a mio avviso risulta un buon rapporto qualità - prezzo; si può trovare qualcosa a meno ma la caratteristica di flessibilità e facilità nel montarla sono per me pregi che ne giustificano il costo quindi 5 stelle. Ciao!
4,Dieser Stolperschutz ist aus Gummi als einzigem Material. Anfangs riecht das Produkt noch stark nach Gummi was aber innerhalb weniger Stunden verfliegt.Ich hatte den Stolperschutz im Hinblick auf mein bestelltes Auto einen Plugin-Hybrid erworben. Das Auto lasse ich tagsüber auf dem Firmenparkplatz laden gelegentlich wird das aber auch mal zuhause geschehen wo ich dann ein Kabel über den nur wenig frequentierten Fußweg legen muss.Dieser Stolperschutz ist eigentlich nicht für den Außenbereich gedacht. Solche Produkte sind breiter und schwerer wodurch sie auch auf glatten Böden sicher liegen. In der Tat rutscht dieser Kabelkanal etwas auf unserem Laminat wenn man z.B. mit dem Staubsauger dagegen kommt. Auf Teppichen oder Teppichböden liegt der Stolperschutz sehr viel sicherer. Für den gelegentlichen Einsatz auf dem Gehweg halte ich dieses Produkt dennoch für geeignet. Mit dem relativ schweren Kabel einer Kabeltrommel im Inneren liegt die Leiste ausreichend sicher.Die Anwendung ist einfach: Das Kabel wird von der Unterseite in einen Schlitz gesteckt. Dort ist ausreichend Platz für zwei dickere Stromkabel.
4,Kurz und gut:Es gibt bessere. Allerdings dann auch meist zu anderen Preisen und zugegeben auch selten in einer für Otto Normalkunde sinnhaften Menge. Von daher platziert sich D-Line hier mit der von mir rezensierten 18m-Variante schon mal recht gut.Wen der Preis abschreckt: Gucken Sie mal nach "Stolperschutz" und vergleichen Sie die Preise: Solche Lösungen sind nicht günstig ... und D-Line sitzt sogar irgendwo unten am unteren Ende des Preissegmentes.Von der Schutzwirkung her ist das ca. 1 Zentimeter (genauer: 12mm) hohe Kabelschutz sicherlich gut aber wie der Begriff "Light Duty" schon sagt ... nicht perfekt. Muss er beidem Preis auch nicht sein. Nur sollte man das auf dem Plan haben. So hat der Kabelschutz bei uns "auf der Baustelle" (wir renovieren gerade) die fliegend verlegten Kabel zwar gut geschützt - etwas Schwereres auf den Kabelschutz stellen würde ich aber nicht weil er dann doch nachgeben wird. Gerade bei punktuellen Belastungen.Im Fazit:Ich sehe hier "gute" 4 bis "sehr gute" 5 Sterne. Also eher 45 Sterne - und damit (eingedenk der anderen Rezensionen hier) eher 4 Sterne.
4,So einen Stolperschutz sollte man unbedingt installieren wenn Kabel nur über Bereiche geführt werden können in denen sich auch viele Personen bewegen. Der Kabelkanal kommt aufgerollt in einer Packung - ist also sehr weich/flexibel. Er ist mit einer Schere oder mit einem Cutter einfach auf die gewünschte Länge kürzbar. Eine gewisse Schwere hat er dann doch so dass er ordentlich auf dem Boden liegt.Zwei Nachteile hat er: trotz einer Breite von 65cm beherbergt er gerade mal 2 Instrumentenkabel. Gut die Breite braucht er um satt zu liegen aber ein bisschen mehr Kapazität hätte ich mir erwartet. Was auch unschön war: ich musste das Teil erst mal 2 Wochen auf dem Balkon auslüften lassen da es doch recht unangenehm nach Plastik/Gummi gerochen hat. Hat sich aber inzwischen gegeben jetzt kann man es problemlos ins Zimmer legen.
4,Den nur für Innenräume geeigneten Kabelkanal hat sich sofort mein Mann für seine Amateurfunkstation im Dachstudio unter den Nagel gerissen wo zwei hochwertige Antennenkabel so verlegt werden mussten dass zum Einen ständige Stolpergefahr besteht und zum anderen die teuren Kabel selbst in Gefahr waren. Natürlich reichten dafür 180 m nicht und er hat zwei weitere Kabelkanäle nachgekauft.Geliefert werden sie aufgerollt und sie müssen entrollt werden und eine Weile so liegen bleiben um sich zu entspannen zu glätten und auszulüften.Zwei Kabel passen mühelos in die Kabelaufnahme auf der Unterseite und die ist so beschaffen dass die Kabelkanäle samt Inhalt auf den Holzdielen im Dachstudio an Ort und Stelle liegenbleiben ohne dass sie verklebt werden müssten. Lediglich beim Absaugen kann es passieren dass man sie ein bisschen wegrutschen wenn man dagegen stößt. Arbeitet man vorsichtig genug lässt sich aber auch das vermeiden.
4,Geliefert wird der der Kabelkanal aufgerollt in einem kleinen Karton.Er besteht aus schwerem aber doch weichem Gummi und macht einen stabilen Eindruck.Bei Bedarf kann man ihn auch einfach kürzen.Bei uns kommt er im Wohnzimmer zum Einsatz wo er die Kabel der Rücklautsprecher des Surroundsystems vor unseren Katzen schützt - netter Nebeneffekt ist dass es auch gleich ordentlicher aussieht.Auf seiner geriffelten Unterseite liegt er sicher auf.Klar optisch gibt es sicher ansprechendere Lösungen aber da er sowieso nur die Lücke zwischen Couch und TV-Bank überbrückt und an der Wand entlang läuft finde ich das verschmerzbar. Oder frei nach Al Bundy: wieso ein Haus verschönern wenn man sowieso nur drin wohnt ;-)Ich finde den Kanal jedenfalls praktisch vom Preis her mehr als akzeptabel und qualitativ in Ordnung.
4,La canalina è in gomma morbida e flessibile e conseguentemente arriva arrotolata in una confezione di cartone di piccolo diametro. Questo la rende comoda anche per il trasporto a differenza di quelle rigide.Si srotola e prende la forma in poco tempo senza bisogno di fare niente. La lunghezza complessiva è di 18 metri ed a differenza di altri formati della stessa marca non è predisposta per il collegamento rigido con un altro pezzo (mancano i fori ed i perni alle estremità).Come detto nel titolo della recensione non è presente alcun biadesivo per l’applicazione e non è possibile montarla con i tassellini anche se il fondo lo permette. Difficile quindi usarla a parete invece che a terra.Comunque è zigrinata sotto e di conseguenza tende a stare ferma anche se non è incollata. Se ci si passa spesso sopra alla fine si sposta lentamente.Lo spazio all’interno è abbondante ed io ci faccio passare due cavi doppi da 4 millimetri quadri per le casse surround posteriori in attesa del montaggio definitivo.Non è bellissima da vedere e non è adatta secondo me all’uso in casa a meno che non si tratti di una installazione temporanea o che non la si metta in una zona non troppo in vista. Quando non mi servirà più per l’uso attuale la sposterò nella zona amplificatore per mettere in ordine i cavi facendoli passare all’interno.Il prezzo non è basso ma è adeguato alla qualità del prodotto. La gomma è abbondante ed i cavi all’interno risultano protetti. Quattro stelle perché visto il prezzo un minimo di biadesivo ci sarebbe dovuto essere.
4,Die Fußbodenleiste von D-Line ist qualitativ gut verarbeitet und machtim Großen und Ganzen auch diesbezüglich einen sehr guten Eindruck.Dadurch dass es sich um eine biegsame Fußleiste handelt ist sie auchsehr flexibel. Bei mir liegt sie im Wohnzimmer und sorgt dafür dassder Staubsaugeroboter hier unbehelligt seinen Job machen kann.Der Kanal ist sehr leicht installiert und kann bei bedarf einfach mit einerguten Schere oder einem scharfen Messer gekürzt werde.Preislich geht der Kanal auch in Ordnung. Die Preis-Leistung ist ebenfallsgut.
4,Nicht immer liegen alle Anschlüsse genau da wo sie benötigt werden und so müssen ab und zu einmal Kabel verlegt werden und es entstehen Stolperfallen. Um in diesen Fällen ein wenig Entlastung zu schaffen bieten sich Kabelkanäle an welche ebenso die Beschädigung von Kabeln verhindern sollen.Geliefert wird der Kabelkanal in gerollter Form mit einer bebilderten Anleitung die das Wichtigste erläutert. Er ist aus Kunststoff mit einem leicht chemischen Geruch der allerdings nach kurzer Zeit an der frischen Luft verfliegt.Von der Länge kann der Kabelkanal gekürzt und durch die glatte Unterseite auf den Boden mit doppelseitigem Klebeband aufgeklebt werden. Die Kabel können an der Oberseite in die Öffnung geschoben werden wodurch sie geschützt sind und nicht mehr als Stolperfalle dienen können. Jedoch ist die Kapazität recht gering und es können nur einzelne Kabel eingelegt werden.Fazit: Günstiger Kabelkanal mit einer oben liegenden Kabelführung
4,La canalina arriva ben imballata ed arrotolata in una confezione di modeste dimensioni.Una volta srotolata impiega qualche ora per essere completamente distendibile perché ovviamente ha preso la forma che aveva in confezione.Alla fine il prodotto è molto funzionale perché le parti della canala che devono permettere il calpestamento sono ben studiate e fatte in gomma dura e resistente.Si taglia bene con una forbice corposa ed io sono riuscito a nasconderci all’interno un cavo elettrico ed un cavo antenna entrambi piuttosto voluminosi.Il prodotto mi ha soddisfatto e ne consiglio quindi l’acquisto.
3,Davvero un ottima canaletta realizzata in PVC flessibile che si riesce bene a flettere e tagliare in base all'utilizzo.Nella confezione è presente una canaletta in PVC arrotolata larga circa 6 cm per una lunghezza di circa 2 metri. Lo spessore non è male infatti si aggira a poco più di 1 centimetro.È pensato tanto a mio parere per un ufficio magari per far passare dei cavi sul pavimento dascondendoli a dovere.Oltre ad avere dei pregi ho notato dei considerevoli difetti. Innanzitutto avrei preferito poterla attaccare al pavimento con facilità ad esempio una striscia autoadesiva sul retro sarebbe stata un'ottima idea.E come seconda cosa pur essendo morbida ho notato che in ufficio ad esempio con una sedia si rischia di schiacciare i fili quindi non protegge più di tanto.
4,Der Kabelkanal ist aus Gummi und kommt gerollt. Er lässt sich leicht ausrollen und auf dem Boden verlegen. Je nach Kabelstärke passen ein bis zwei Kabel hinein. Verlegt ist alles schnell und der Kabelkanal liegt fest auf dem Boden und verrutscht auch nicht leicht. Das Kürzen geht problemlos.Optisch bin ich zwiegespalten. Es sieht weit besser aus als ein lose herumliegendes Kabel fällt aber auch deutlich auf.Fazit: Sehr praktisch aber nicht unbedingt schick.
4,In dieser flexiblen Fußbodenleiste kann man bis zu zwei Kabel verschwinden lassen die dann durch die dafür vorgesehenen Kabelkanäle laufen. Insbesondere auf glatten Böden funktioniert das Prinzip recht gut denn die Leiste ist relativ flach und sorgt dafürdass quer durch den Raum verlaufende Kabel nicht mehr stolpergefährdend im Weg herumliegen. Durch rutschhemmende Rillen am Boden sowie durch das gummierte Material hat die Leiste einen relativ stabilen Halt ohne zu verrutschen.Optisch muss man sich allerdings darüber im Klaren sein dass diese Leiste nicht zu jedem Boden passt und gerade auch auf Parkett- oder hellerem Boden sehr auffällig und tendenziell ein wenig schlicht wirkt.Praktisches Teil das allerdings von der Optik her durchaus noch "Luft nach oben" mitbringt.
4,L'uso di questo prodotto è veramente importante L'utilizzo è specifico cioè è indicato per chi ha dei cavi che devono attraversare un tratto di pavimento questa canalina serve a fare passare i fili dentro e così evitare sia il calpestio che la rottura dei cavi inoltre risolve anche il problema estetico ed evita pericolosi inciampi e rovinose cadute.Il prodotto è fatto in PVC flessibile all'interno ci si possono fare passare sino a un totale di 16/20 mm. di cavi è lunga 180 cm. e larga 6 cm altezza di 12 mm. calpestabile e anti inciampo.L'ho usata per un tratto di pavimento accorciandola usando delle forbici ben affilate la canalina è ben distesa sul pavimento e non ho dovuto usare del bi adesivo anche perché non mi serve in maniera fissaOttimo il rapporto tra la qualità e il prezzo eccellente l'utilizzo.Spero che vi sia stato utile.
5,Kabel Kabel und nochmals Kabel - so schaut es bei und im Proberaum leider aus! ^^Das kam es schon zu manchem Stolperer und beinahe Unfall mit wertvollen Instrumenten.So konnte es nicht weitergehen und diesem Zustand musste mit aller Macht ein Ende gesetzt werden! ^^Der D-Line Fussboden Kabelkanal Stolperschutz CC-1 schien die perfekte Lösung für unser Problem zu sein.Wir waren überrascht wie einfach das doch geht und wie schnell wir Ordnung auf dem Boden hatten. Der unten offene Kanal wird einfach ausgerollt und die Kabel von unten eingelegt - fertig!Die ersten Minuten liegt der Kanal nicht 100% glatt auf dem Boden was sich allerdings aufgrund des Gummiartigen Materials schnell erledigt hat. Der Kanal ist weder geschraubt noch geklebt liegt dann aber perfekt.Auch wenn man mal ein Kabel tauschen muss ist das kein Problem.Wir verwenden jetzt insgesamt  5 dieser 180 Meter langen Kanäle und sind froh dieses Problem im Griff zu haben.Was hatten wir uns all die Jahre gequält und Stunts hingelegt.Was sind wir gesprungen und gehechtet wenn mal wieder ein Schussel am Kabel hängen bleib und fast eine Gitarre oder einen Synthesizer zu Absturz gebracht hat.Das alles ist jetzt Vergangenheit und dafür gibt’s 5 Sterne und eine Kaufempfehlung!
4,Schon bei der Entnahme des Kabelkanales strömte ein strenger Kunststoffgeruch in die Naseder nach kurzer Zeit vollständig verschwunden war.Der Kabelkanal ist 6 cm breit und 180 m lang und lässt sich mit einer scharfen Schere sehr gut zuschneiden.Die Kabel werden sehr gut geschützt wenn man z.Bsp. mit einem Bürostuhl über diesen Kabelkanal fährt.Je nach Kabelstärke passen bis zu 2 dickere Kabel in den Kabelkanal.Die geriffelte Unterseite verhindert ein verrutschen des Kabelkanales.
5,Canalina per cavi da pavimento per uffici per casa o per luoghi in genere di lavoro. Canalina molto grande calpestabile e robusta. Questa canalina di 1.08 m di lunghezza ha una larghezza di 7cm per 1.05 di altezza. La riga all'interno e al di sotto della canalina per inserire il cavo è molto capiente e larga dunque va bene per ogni tipologia di cavo o di cavi perché possono entrarci più cavi all'interno.Il materiale è perfettamente liscio gommato e dunque non da fastidio nel calpestarlo e non provoca " incidenti" per urto. Può essere tagliato agevolmente e accorciato. Facile da installare i cavi all'interno del foro più lungo centrale sono 2cm per 1.5 i fori più stretti sono di circa 0.5 per 1 cm.Ottimo materiale robusto e resistente che si può utilizzare in vari modi per far passare varie tipologie di cavi. Consigliato per qualità e prezzo e soprattutto per utilizzo professionale o semi professionale.
5,Der Vorteil dieses Kabelkanals ist dass er schwer genug ist um auch ohne Klebestreifen fest und rutschsicher auf dem Boden liegen zu bleiben. Leichtere Kabelhalter neigen dazu sich trotz Kleber von Boden zu lösen und sind eine Stolperfalle. Weiterer Vorteil des Gewichts ist dass der gerollt gelieferte Kabelkana l sofort nach dem Ausrollen flach auf dem Boden liegt und keine Wellen wirft.Zudem ist der Kabelkanal mit 6 cm schön breit so dass er zwar mehrere Kabel aufnehmen kann aber trotzdem nicht zu sehr vom Boden ansteht und so beim Geben nicht stört. Der Kabelkanal macht einen sehr robusten Eindruck und kann sicher auch draußen verwendet werden.Die Packung enthält 18 m des Kabelkanals und kostet mit knapp 20 Euro etwas mehr als andere Anbieter  überzeugt aber durch Qualität.
4,Un buon prodotto questa canalina copricavo da pavimento della D-Line. Il materiale da cui è composto è molto flessibile e ben si presta a contenere un massimo di un paio di cavi l'inserimento degli stessi al suo interno è molto semplice ed immediato un pò meno il posizionamento a terra che richiede un periodo di adattamento da parte dei materiali infatti la canalina è arrotolata all'interno della confezione e tende a mantenere questa posizione si può risolvere semplicemente con del materiale adesivo o lasciando per del tempo del peso su di essa una volta posizionata. Va detto che l'uso di materiale adesivo coadiuva non poco l'immobilità della stessa dalla posizione scelta.Il materiale esterno è un pò troppo morbido e per via del colore nero richiede spesso di essere pulito. La canaletta non è pensata per essere utilizzata sotto le classiche sedie con ruote data l'altezza della stessa.Un prodotto sicuramente ben fatto ma non perfetto. Sicuramente migliorabile il rapporto qualità/prezzo.
5,In diesen Kabelkanal passen diverse Kabel und Strippen problemlos rein.Besonders gut gefällt mir dass dieser Kabelschutz aus einem weichen aber stabilen Gummimaterial besteht denn so kann man ihn auch gut dort verlegen wo man gegenfalls auch noch mal drüberläuft. Nimmt man ihn so einem Fall einen Kanal aus Kunsstoff oder Alu dann kann es knacken oder auch splittern wenn jemand versehntlich drauftritt. So ist dieser Kabelkanal wirklich ideal für unter den Arbeitsplatz/Schreibtisch oder wenn man gezwungen ist durch den Raum zu verlegen.
5,Am Anfang dachte ich oh je nicht selbstklebend.Zu meiner Überraschung muss es dass auch nicht sein. Der geriffelte Boden des Kanals hat soviel Grip dass der Kabelkanal gut und sicher auf dem Boden liegen bleibt ohne zu verrutschen.Ich musste ein dickeres Stromkabel von einer Seite des Raum zur anderen führen. Das klappt sehr gut und sieht endlich ordentlich aus.Der Kabelkanal ist aus festen dicken und doch sehr flexiblem Plastik. Ich habe gelesen dass nach dem auspacken wohl ein chemischer Geruch aus dem Plastik kommt. Das konnten wir nicht feststellen. Sollte man ihn kürzen müssen geht dass mit einer Haushaltsschere je schärfer desto glatter die Schnittkante.Das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis finde ich als sehr gut da der Kabelkanal einen sehr robusten Eindruck macht sehr sauber gearbeitet ist und sich flexibel und einfach verlegen lässt.
3,Für einen Stolperschutz ist dieser hier angebotenen schon sehr günstig.Negativ auffällig ist der üblich krass chemische Geruch der beim Auspacken entweicht. Nach 3 Tagen war der Geruch immer noch stark wahrnehmbar. Da ich den Kabelkanal im Arbeitszimmer eingesetzt habe musste ich nun erst einmal eine Woche warten. Solange braucht der Kanal bis er vom Geruch erträglich wird.Rein von der Konstruktion bin ich zufrieden. Stabil und einfach zu verlegen.Meine beiden Netzwerkkabel liegen nun sicher im Kanal. Somit erfüllt er seinen Zweck...
5,Was soll ich sagen ... Egal ob Netzwerk Stromkabek oder Datenkabel .. Bisher lag es wild und ungeordnete bei mir auf dem Fußboden Stolpersteine ohne Ende. Damit ist nun endlich Schluss ... aufgeräumt und sicher verstaut können nun keine Unfälle mehr passieren. Klasse Idee und super umgesetzt. Sehr zufrieden und daher auch von mir volle Punktzahl und eine ganz klare Empfehlung.
5,Ich habe so manche Kabelfallen in meiner Wohnung. Vermutlich nicht völlig verkehrt für Diebe um sie mit einer "Kabelfallen" zu erwischen 😁 aber persönlich nahm ich mir schon seit einiger Zeit vor die Kabellage dezent zu verstecken und die Fallgefahr zu minimieren.Von D-Line habe ich bisher noch nichts ausprobiert die Firma lief bei mir unter ferner liefen. Der Kabeltunnel wird in einer Pappverpackung im gerollten Zustand ausgeliefert. Man kann kinderleicht die Kabellage einlegen und den Tunnel hinlegen. Sofern zu lang lässt er sich auch gut auf die richtige Länge stutzen.Resümee: funktioniert.
5,Avevo bisogno in giardino di sistemare dei cavi per l’illuminazione.Non avendo prese elettriche su di un lato dello stesso l’unico modo per fare un lavoro pulito ed in totale sicurezza è stato quello di utilizzare questo tipo di canalina.Non mi aspettavo tanta qualità in un prodotto simile.Quello in mio possesso ha una lunghezza di 18 m. E’ stato realizzato con una gomma morbida e resistente che si taglia facilmente attraverso l’utilizzo di una forbice da elettricista.Lo spazio interno consente il passaggio di 2/3 fili da 8mm ognuno.Pur non avendo fissata la canalina a terra vedo che in forza del suo spessore limitato rimane stabile evitando che si possa inciampare quando se ne entra a contattoProdotto consigliatissimo adattabile in qualsiasi tipo di ambiente.
5,In unserem Studio/Arbeitszimmer herrscht Kabelwirrwar. Wir nutzen normalerweise Kabelschutzmatten um der Stolpergefahr Einhalt zu gebieten. Das geht aber ist wegen der Katzen keine optimale Wahl. Sie schieben die Matten weg nutzen sie für ihre Krallen und legen sich drauf (Katzenhaare....). Der D-Line Fussboden Kabelkanal löst das Problem auf saubere elegante und zweckmäßige Weise: Sieht gut aus ist einfach zu verlegen und macht Schluss mit Stolpern. Wir brauchen noch mehr davon.
5,Ich habe diesen Kanal im Büro liegen da ich einige Kabel über den Boden ziehen musste. Damit kann niemand mehr stolpern und es ist Ordnung im Büro.Der Kanal lässt sich mit einer Metallsäge leicht zusägen und in der Lämge anpassen. Es passen einige Kabel hiein einfach gut.Wenn man auf ihn titt gibt es nur wenig nach die Kabel sind gut geschützt. Er liegt auch sicher auf dem Boden und verrutscht nicht.
5,Im Büro lag immer ein Kabel auf dem Boden eine typische Stolperfalle.Nun ist das Kabel im Kabelkanal den sieht man zum einen deutlich und zum anderen kann man auch drauf treten ohne gleich darüber zu fallen.Die Kabel lassen sich leicht im Kabelkanal befestigen.
5,Dieser Kabelschutz ist gut gemacht und überraschend weich und flexibel. Die Unterseite ist zudem glatt so dass es möglich ist doppelseitiges Klebeband anzubringen um den Kabelschutz an den Boden zu kleben.
5,Ein  gutes Produkt wir sind  zufrieden damit und begeistert von der praktischen Handhabung.
5,Man bekommt den Kabelkanal gerollt. Das Material ist sehr weich und flexibel. Rückseitig kann man die Kabel ganz einfach "verstecken". Das Material ist rutschhemmend und zuschneidbar.Eine geniale Sache wenn man ein/zwei Kabel verschwinden lassen möchte. Sieht damit auch optisch viel besser aus.Ab sofort heißt es bei uns: Stolperfalle ade.Unsere Empfehlung.
5,Den Kabelkanal gibt es in zwei Längen. Die 9 Meter werden wohl eher in Betrieben angebracht sein als in privaten Wohnungen. Da Kabel nun mal sein müssen  und auch unser Routerkabel ansonsten irgendwo über dem Parkett herumliegt ist die Unfallgefahr natürlich groß (oder die der Kabelbeschädigung).Der Kabelkanal ist daher sinnvoll. Er ist gut verarbeitet und Preis-Leistungs-Angemessen.
5,Ho ordinato questa canalina per sistemare finalmente i cavi che ho sparsi in soggiorno.Trovo questo metodo davvero perfetto specie per i cavi che si trovano per terra.Canalina arriva arrotolata ed è fatta con una gomma davvero robusta.Il montaggio è semplicissimo basta posizionarla inserire i cavi dentro e basta.Può essere ritagliata a seconda delle nostre necessità.Siccome canalina è di suo abbastanza pesante non si sposta facilmente ma se abbiamo bisogno di metterla fissa per terra bisogna vedere il tipo di pavimento che abbiamo e a seconda di esso utilizzare adesivo adatto.La canalina anche se bagnata (ovviamente non inzuppata d'acqua!) protegge i cavi a sufficienza.La consiglio vivamente.
5,Ottimo passacavi. L'ho installato e funziona bene fa proprio quello per cui è nato.
5,Una buona canalina il prodotto arriva arrotolato per questini di trasporto ma il montaggio resta semplice ed intuitivo è adatta a cavi sottili pratica e funzionale puo' essere messa per terra ma anche incollata al muro.Nel complesso un valido articolo facile da installare e plastiche abbastanza robuste.Consigliata
5,Perfetta per l'ufficioArriva arrotolata si srotola facilmente e si appiattisce subito da sola sul pavimentoPuò contenere sino a due cavi con diametro di 8 mm ed è tranquillamente calpestabileMolto utile in quanto si evita di inciampare di continuo in fili sparsi qua e laSi taglia tranquillamente con le forbiciLe dimensioni sono:1.8m (Lunghezza) x 60mm (Larghezza) x 12mm (Altezza)Canale interno = 17mm (Larghezza) x 9mm (Altezza)
4,Si protege pero en pisos lisos se desliza fácilmente
1,Very small barely holds a couple of thin wires. Can't hold ONE powerbar cable. A waste of money.
5,Met expectations
5,Good easy to uncoil as it was coiled inwards got a little worried after reading reviews of other cord covers that would remain bent but came out and laid flat the moment i unwrapped it.. regret not getting the white one as the grey was a little too grey. Other than that exactly what i was looking for.
1,Did not work for us not heavy enough to hold cords in place. It just slid around and made more of a tripping hazard than just the cords alone.
3,I bought this Amazon's Choice "Zoom"-branded product ($35) another cheap "M-Wave" suspension seatpost with a rubber harmonica ($25) and an expensive "Suntour" version with mechanical arms ($130). The M-Wave seatpost sits between Zoom (hardest) and Suntour (softest) in terms of firmness and suspension travel distance. "M-Wave" seems the best bang for the buck. This "Zoom"-seatpost is pretty hard but if you are 100 kg or heavier it might be just fine.

5,Needed to cover an extension cord that transects my tiny living room. This is perfect!
5,Parfait
5,Not totally suitable for larger diameter cords but fine for flat cable or extensions round… not so much. 🙂
1,Apenas cabe 1 cable delgadito como los de teléfono y aún así se deforma.Si se pone un segundo cable o se usa un cable un poco más grueso (como los cables de corriente para las computadoras de escritorio) apenas hay espacio y la canaleta no se mantiene plana.Este producto es un desastre.
5,Por cuestiones de arreglo en donde trabajo en casa tuve que cruzar algunos cables y para evitar tropezar con ellos puse por seguridad (Y estética) este canal funciona muy bien solo como recomendación hay que fijarlo con cinta doble cara (de la industrial) para que no se vaya moviendo...
5,Easy to cut to size. Heavy duty rubber. Arrived packaged in a coil but flattened out quickly. Would highly recommend. It's only been a few weeks but I can't see how this will wear out anytime soon (home office use).
5,Very happy with the quality.  The items measurements were accurate which makes all the difference when purchasing any such products.
5,Pricy but with good quality
2,much bigger and bulkier than what i wanted.
5,Works as intended. Straightened out fairly quickly once laid out
5,This is made from a nice soft supple rubber material that quickly lies flat on the floor and disappears along with the wires beneath-- unless you get greedy and try to stuff too many cables into it then not so much.  But you can definitely fit an HDMI cable RCA cable and a couple USB cables in there.  Maybe don't put a thick power cord under it..
5,I'm very pleased with the quality. Especially for this price. This is flexible soft and it's got a nice weight to it.
3,Quality wise doesn’t seem well made.But it serves its simple purpose.
5,I needed something to protect network cables running across the floor and this device is exactly what I wanted.  The cables are safe inside and the protector is heavy enough that I don't have to worry about it moving around or people tripping on it.  Would definitely recommend.
5,It works very well.
5,Discreetly hides dangerous cables without anyone tripping.  Perfect for my project.
5,Zware en stevige kabelbescherming...
5,das teil passt sich gut an - macht zuwas es erstellt wurde und das zu einem guten preis = passt!!
5,As described
5,im Baumarkt kamen wir nicht zurecht also bei Amazon geschaut und fündig geworden. Wir wollten Kabel verstecken welche direkt zum Kücheneingang quer liegen und hiermit gelingt es super Klasse. Bisher haben wir keine Klebefolie verwendet sondern lassen diesen Gummi-Kabelkanal so liegen. Perfekt.
