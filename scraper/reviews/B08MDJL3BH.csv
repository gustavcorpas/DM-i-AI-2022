5,Super fast charging great product 25 watts!! Great for my Iphone 6s Plus and 11.
5,Great product just wish it would come with the phone or device you buy it with instead of separately. But it does ensure a fast charge it says it takes one hour but with my phone after 30-20 min its fully charged
5,Great purchase thank you!!

5,works well for travel and ot desks
5,Great deal
5,Why would Apple send a cord with your phone but have nothing to plug it in with ? The cord stayed in the box until one of my cords went bad. But I didn’t have a C charger. Thanks to Amazon they had one and I got it very fast ! Now it takes no time to charge my iPhone or my iPad ‼️ Oh and I don’t need two charger plugs (boxes) yes it charges that fast.
5,So far this charger charges super fast. I've only had it for a week so I don't know how long it will last. My preliminary thoughts are that it works well...review subject to change.
4,Works great fits where I need it to.
5,Great product
5,Leave it to apple iPhone not to come with the wall outlet adapter. The phone only came with this funky cable. Very happy to find this outlet adapter on Amazon and to not have to buy an overpriced version in the store.
5,Works as expected
