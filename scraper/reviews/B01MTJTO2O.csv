4,This power source is great for what it is! Just be wary it only comes with four cord options for connection with the graphics card - I had to order one to fit my 1660 GTX.
4,Todo bien recomendado :3Tío Yanpol good UwU
5,Ordered 2 of these PSU for 2 servers of mines. They literally power up all 4 hard drives in each server without any issues. The stock PSU that came with the towers could not handle 4 hard drives but these power supplies are doing the job very well and very quietly to. It is worth the money
5,This guy has been supplying power to a R5 3600 + GTX 1660 super + 16gb RAM + 2 SSDs + Peripherals with no problems at all for almost 2 years by now.
3,Good overall product but don’t buy used I bought this for my first pc build used for 25 dollars it the power supply it’s self was lifted from the top as in damaged and it looked like the top cover was going to come off usually if a psu is damaged you shouldn’t turn it on in case of fire but Luckily nothing happens it worked good for a while the my gpu had coil whine and also none of my apps worked scince it was not getting enough power over just buy new not used
4,I like this power suply but I think they can do it better with the package. Great protection but since I see from the box for first time has a lot of scratches everywhere. I mean yes the power suply works but why the poor protection before put it in the box.
5,Purchased for a new computer build.  EVGA has a reputation for quality and I will always purchase products with a quality reputation. I have had power supplies fail and it is hard to figure out it is the power supply.  They tend to fail intermittently.  What happens is your computer goes blank and then after a while reboots.  The power supply has loss power but then powers back up after a short while sometimes in seconds.  The first thing everyone thinks is Windows has crashed which is logical given Windows reputation.  Then it works fine for days or even weeks and then it starts again.  Aggravating is not a strong enough word for what you will go through.Always pay for a quality power supply like EVGA and purchase one that is the next size larger than what you need so you are not stressing the power supply.This was used in a new computer build and it has worked flawlessly for six months and is very quiet.
5,Package came all the way from California to Florida and had enough bubble wrap to make Bubble Boy blush 😊Seriously great buy for a gaming PC setup has all of the cables and is an easy install. I assure you... you won't be disappointed.
5,Update 3/23/22:A few months ago and after about a year and half of use the fan began making a rather obnoxious rattling noise. Fan bearing most likely failed. I thought about replacing the fan myself but since it was still under warranty I went ahead and got a replacement unit from EVGA. I am pretty satisfied with their customer service. My RMA was approved no questions asked and I got a new unit within a week.Original review:Using this PSU in my first gaming PC build Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 ti FE. It's basically completely inaudible. I especially like that it's semi-modular so I don't have a huge mess of cables that you don't even need in your PC. I've only been using it for 6 months so I can't really speak about longevity yet but I haven't had any issues with it so far. I'm not worried about though considering it has 80+ bronze certification and a 3 year warranty.
2,Thinking this would be a quick swap I attempted to do this on my lunch break. After a half hour of trying to figure out why the computer would not post I realize that it wasn’t getting the power to the CPU for pin Molex connector.  I plug the old (albeit noisy) power supply back in and everything worked great.Returned. I’m assuming most people will not have a problem but maybe some light. Seems like some people are getting a random DOA’s on one level or another.EVGA’s are usually pretty good too. A little disappointing.
4,I bought this supply for a low stress and small form-factor PC. It works great but remember when building your own never get anything less than a gold power supply if you are doing something important with it.
5,I bought this power supply when it was on a deal of 32 dollars and trust me this power supply can handle a 3060 and the noise level is super low literally you can barely hear it for the price and quality it’s a 10/10 and super easy installation I did it by myself
5,Typically I buy direct from EVGA but Amazon has had stellar deals on EVGA products as of late. Needed a good PSU for a budget Plex build and this was probably overkill but it was too good a deal to pass up.Being semi-modular is great as I didn't need the PCI-e cables since there was no GPU and didn't need one of the SATA cables. This made it easier to manage the cables inside the case. The fan on this PSU is very quiet and keeps things running cool. This thing is on 24/7 and not a single hiccup. EVGA also has excellent customer service. Only had to call once in the past but they go above and beyond to make it right. Great company great product...highly recommend.
5,Been working good sense I got it and great for the price
5,Exactly what I just said in my headline it's EVGA you cant beat it I have and will always buy EVGA power supplies.
2,When I got this product I didn’t open it up right away which was my first mistake. Once opened I examined the product and found out a wire was missing from one of the sockets. Let’s just say I’m kinda disappointed.
5,Quedamos muy satisfechos con la compra porque además de ser super fácil buscar y comprar lo que uno necesita los pedido los envían y llegan muy rápido además de nota que es de muy buena calidad
5,EVGA makes good stuff and this power supply is no exception. Install was a breeze and because it's semi-modular cable management was super easy. Would definitely recommend for anyone trying to build on a budget.
4,Works totally fine haven't had any troubles with the thing other than the smell it had when it came in. Don't know what it was but it freaked me out at first. Thought it was some kind of burning even though it hadn't been plugged in at all. Wasn't anything burning just some weird smell on it that mostly dissipated after a few brief uses.It's very quiet though. I don't have a whole lot to add for this other than it does its job just smelled odd when it came in at first.
1,I generally don't like leaving negative reviews but there's no way around this one. Don't risk your system by rolling the dice on a lower-end PSU just to save a few bucks. I had this thing for under a year before it nearly caught fire yesterday and fried my motherboard. The fan seemed to be faulty and while running a game on Steam there was a loud pop followed by a noticeable burning smell. Everything shut down. When I tried to remove it the unit was incredibly hot to the touch. Following that I put in a PSU replacement and the system wouldn't turn on anymore. Even before all this the coil whine was rather audible. Think "hard to sleep because of persistent noise" audible.Just don't do it. I know money is tight and all but it's not worth risking your entire system. Anything else sure. But when you're potentially ruining other components just to save on one of them it's simply not worth it. EVGA is a great brand but go for their higher-end power supplies. Not this one.
5,Broke in a week
4,Bastante buena y creo que fuwe una de las mejores inversiones
4,Install went well until connecting the modular "Perif" cable to the power supply. It would not clip into place and therefore continually loosen at the connection point. I did not check connection prior to the install (that's on me) so I had to pull the supply back out. Upon closer inspection of the connection point one of the internal Electrolytic capacitors was leaned up against the internal connection preventing the clip from catching. So I had to gently poke a toothpick at the opening and convince the capacitor to bend the other way. Now the cable fits securely into the power supply. It has been running well for about 5 days.  3-stars on install because the average layperson may not have figured out the problem.
5,I'm no expert when it comes to PC's.  I've added video and audio cards and memory but as far as getting into the guts no experience.  I followed the directions referred to my operators manual and turned it on and voila!  It works!  It's quiet and was not a complicated removal and replace.
5,Works great plenty of power for my setup! Never overheats or anything like that.
4,Es una buena fuente de poder aunque queda un tanto "corta" con respecto a los cables ya que he visto otras de 600W y entregan mayor cantidad de conectores.
4,I bought this power supply to power my current build but when beginning my build realized it would not be enough so I had to swap it with a 750w power supply I still have this power supply in storage. if you're looking to buy this make sure its enough for your pc.
4,It's fairly quiet. I don't actually think the fan even spins unless it heats up quite a considerable amount (probably ~200-300w pulled at once at least). Cables seem high quality and I had no problem using it. It's only 80+ bronze (better than 80+) so I can't give it a high energy efficiency rating. For those who aren't very tech savvy below is a list of what the ratings are. Left means it's more efficient (Titanium is 90% efficient Bronze is around 80%). I'd say shoot for Gold rather than Bronze if you're building a high-end gaming PC.80+ Titanium > 80+ Platinum > 80+ Gold > 80+ Silver > 80+ Bronze > 80+
5,Muy buena marca ademas de tener un buen precio en el momento de la compra. Valio la pena.
5,theres no downsides to this psu if its at a decent price its a great buy.
5,In retrospect I did not actually need a new power supply but as my 3 year old AM3+ based system began having erratic issues I did numerous hardware and software tests and narrowed down the elusive issues to motherboard and/or power supply.  I need to get another year or so out of this system and had no alternate psu to test with.  Since a nice reliable modular like this was available at a reasonable price I was willing to begin by replacing my old power supply as it is a good investment anyway.Ultimately the problem turned out to be my Asus motherboard but after finding a replacement my system has been back up and running great for a couple of months now.  I don't frequently monitor voltage but when I do all of the values on this psu are correct and stable.  I've been using EVGA products for close to 18 years now and have been satisfied more often than not.
5,La fuente cumple con su función al ser modular permite una mejor gestión de cables y no hace ningún ruido
4,I guess that main thing that I liked about this powersupply was that it was semi modular. However the cables that are attached to the power supply were a bit hard to manipulate at first. However I regret buying this early because just a few days later the price dropped to about 59 dollars.  Still a good product tho.
5,One of the higher quality power supplies made in Taiwan by professionals.
5,Llego en excelente estado y al día de hoy ya casi 6 meses de usarla. Una gran fuente ya que protege mucho la PC de relámpagos y bajones de luz.
5,Look man but it especially if your budget building don't get no better or cheaper im telling you
5,Depending on your power requirements mine being relatively low this is an excellent PSU. Months into operation still going strong.
4,Does what it's supposed to for a bronze rated 600W power supply.
5,This is a Great power supply it is definitely worth it price for what you get it makes zero to no noise and i had no problems till mine stopped working
5,As part of a new build I bought this after seeing how reputable EVGA's PSUs are.  At first I was going to jump for the 500w B1 version but after I saw how cheap this variation was I decided to spring for it even if I may never need the extra watts.I can't say much that others haven't already said about it. It was obviously built very sturdy feeling hefty right out of the box.  The cables are stylish and durable able to bend around for cable management needs while not feeling like they're about to rip apart.  The semi-modularity is a nice touch for anyone looking to cut down on cables!I'll revisit this review if anything were to happen in the near future but for now I'd easily recommend this PSU and any in its family for anyone looking for a budget-friendly but powerful power supply.
5,Lo pedí a Colombia llegó en menos de lo que esperaba y sin ningún inconveniente. Excelente que sea semimodular la relación calidad precio es excelente buena fuente fácil de instalar aspecto premium no hace tanto ruido. Compra segura.
5,I like it. Works great. The modularity makes it much easier for cable managements and just less headaches from tracing cables. It's bigger than than what I'm used too though but hopefully the size difference makes better efficiency.
5,Hasta el momento ha sido una buena inversión rendimiento y estabilidad no se han visto inconvenientes con el producto.
5,This is one of the best budgets psu you can get and it works just perfectly fine.
5,I have red these horror stories comments about the box being open or it being attacked by lions but nope it came sealed and in perfect condition. It's worth the buy guys.
4,Item was as described and within the original sealed manufacturers packaging no complaints.
5,Great PSU hasnt disapointed me highly recommed it i use it with my 1070 ti a Ryzen 5 1600 (3.9ghz) using 300-350 watts under load it is bq rated so it should not go over 600 watts and one cable came messed up with a pin broken but i didnt need it and i doubt yours would come with a broken one. If you do have the extra money you should get a gold rated but this one wont dissapoint if you get this one. Very easy to install Not loud at all and my power bill has not went up at all.
3,I replaced my old PSU in my dell OptiPlex with this and went a whole day with my ram not working. Had to get it fixed.
5,It works as advertise and even though this power supply is a little bigger than my old one it runs cooler.For those that do not know what a modular power supply is it is a power supply where you plug wires in as you need them (the power wires are included).  The advantages are this.  For fat fingers it is easier to work with less wires.  For cooling I'm sure the less wires equal less air turbulence in the case so your air flow is more efficient and therefore cools down easier.  Finally it is really meant for those cases with glass sides there is less wires there so you see less dust accumulation inside the case and make it easier to show the lights on the inside.
5,La furnte me llegue en perfecto estado la caja tambien sin abolladuras y sin cortes.Soy de santiago de chile y me llego como en 2 semanas super rapido el envio
5,Great product runs all my components like a champ wouldn’t have any other way or product need to get a gpu next from evga
5,This is a lot of power for what I needed. However the price was so good $50 that I just couldn't justify saving a few dollars for a smaller wattage power supply. Plus this power supply is semi-modular. The 20+4 motherboard power and 4+4 cpu power cable is needed for all builds so it doesn't matter that those cables are not modular. That was a big plus for a small form factor case itx. It's pretty quiet. Have never had any problems with my EVGA products.Powering:Intel Core I5-6500Noctua NH-L9iGigabyte B150n Phoenix-WifiMicron M600 256GB m.2 ssdMSI RX 470 Gaming XCrucial Ballistic Sport DDR4 2x4GBCooler Master elite 120 advanced (old case I had laying around)2 120mm Corsair fans1 80mm Cooler Master fanLG DVD Drive
5,Bought it for my new build running a i7 9700k and a rtx 3070 this PSU handles it all just fine and runs perfectly. Great bang for your buck
5,Works
5,Great value I got this on prime day for a discount but it’s still worth it!!!
5,I waited for a while to review this to make certain that it wouldn't suffer an early death.  About 6-months in and is working well.  Voltages are stable and while not quite as quiet as the Antec that it replaced was when new it is not at all intrusive.  I like semi-modular because the hard wiring that it has are for connections that I always need.  The included cabling was of good quality and was sufficient for my use.  This was purchased for a computer that I built 8-years ago.  It is now only used for email and correspondence so the power supply is not stressed at all.  I don't know how well it would preform in a game box.
5,Lo encontré con descuento buena compra instalación estándar hasta ahora todo correcto.
5,This is a quality power supply.  I like the Bronze edition so I could choose what cables I wanted to use and eliminate the extra ones that I don't need to use.  The PS fan is very quiet.  I highly recommend this EVGA power supply for your build.
5,Love this psu works great. Got it for $65 semi modular 80+ bronze 600w so thats a great price.
5,Me parece que está bien construida que sea semi modular es una gran ventaja para organizar el gabinete
5,Great PSU affordable semi-modular (the only thing not modular is the motherboard power cable and the CPU cable but those are required so you don't need them to be modular. The rest is totally modular. Comes with two PCEI 8 pin for video cards. Comes with plenty of peripheral power for storage and anything else. Installs standard. Quiet. Handles full loads. Great value.
5,i don't know much about pc parts so i can't give much of an opinion on this but it turns on and that's all i needed.
4,It worked. Bought 2 of these and both fired right up. Cables are long enough for small ATX case. Fan isnt silent but isnt too loud either not an issue while wearing headset.  Its a 45 dollar power supply didnt expect a mind blowing experience just that it would work and it did. I'm happy and Kids are even happier on thier new PCs. Matched with ryzen 5 2600 b450 motherboards and rx 570 8gb graphics cards.
5,Installed it into my system a few days ago haven't had any issues with the cables themselves or managing them.
5,Me gusta es silenciosa y se instala fácilmente es una buena inversión
5,llego perfecto es lo esperaba! :D
5,It works as it should!
5,Soporta muy bien la configuración de mi PC. Ryzen 5 3600 con gráfica gtx 1650 super disipador cooler master 212 black edition. DDR4 EVOX GEIL 2x16 m.2 de 512gb. Realmente no escucho ruido por parte de esta fuente es algo mínimo.
5,Muy buena elección para esas personas que no quieren invertir tanto dinero en una fuente de poder.
5,I was building a PC for my sister and wanted a better than stock PS. Well this one does the job very well. It is silent and runs all of the devices attached to it. I highly recommend this PS to all I know. It is very well built and it looks like it will last awhile.
1,Well it worked at first. Dead as a doorknob now.  Still looks good no burnt smell. Would make an OK paperweight if you cut the wires off.  Not quite 11 full months of use.  Just because a company charges more than the bare bones clone company doesn't mean they put in any more quality or have any more integrity. Oh that "3 year warranty"? Yeah good luck with that.
4,I've been using this PSU since 2018 and it's been flawless .....  👍
4,Seems to be working good but its not noob friendly. The clips that connect to the cables was very difficult to connect the box. Also it would have been nice If i knew it wasn't gonna turn on immediately. You may have to short it out and if you don't have a paper clip then youre screwed.But heres what I did...take the wire clip that comes wrapped around the cable and strip it. Now you can use this to short it out. After that it started up perfectly every time.
5,Used this psu for a flip build. I only use Evga cause their customer service is damn near legendary
4,It's power supply seems to do all the power things necessary. The cables are nicely made and mostly black for ease of cable management
5,El producto tardo muy poco exactamente 1 semana menos de lo esperado estoy contento :D. Llego en excelentes condiciones.
4,Buenas tardes.Realice la compra de este producto hace aproximadamente 4 meses y el sábado pasado tuve un inconveniente. Me podrían decir como actua la garantia?? cabe aclarar que soy de Argentina y el producto lo traje en un viaje que hiceQuedo a la espera de sus comentarios.Saludos.Sergio Polo
3,I had a PSU failure which killed my motherboard and graphics card.  EVGA customer support and RMA was super slick and I had a new PSU in my hands within one or two weeks.  I've had nothing but good experience with EVGA otherwise but I have to deduct stars for a catastrophic product failure.
5,Bought this BQ unit to replace a crappy EVGA 750 n1 I mistakenly bought thinking it was one of the 80+ white line up. Stopped the random blue screens and shutdowns I was getting was easy to install  and only a little more than other 600w and 500w white models.Would recommend a G3 650 if you are going to go high end but for an I5 6500 RX 480 combo you'd got the job done.
5,Great power supply for the price definitely worth it
5,i have had mine now for about 10 yrs i guess you could say this review is a little late  but it is still going
5,Easy to install don’t hear it at all. 10/10 turns my computer on. Used with 3070 / i7
5,There are not a lot of extra cables to add on but it had everything I needed for my build. If you're looking for a cheap PSU for gaming this gets my reccomendation.
2,Power supply failed on me after just a few months
5,Nothing bad to say at the moment. It does exactly what I need it to do. Used it for my first PC build and it seems to be a solid choice for a budget power supply.
5,Bought this for a PC I built for my mom it gets the job done can be a bit noisy at times but nothing unbearable. Doesn't get too hot and works great for what she needs it for.
5,Perfect for a high end Rtx 2060 and ryzen 5 3600 build no problems with it except there can be a whining noise at times but it depends on your case and how you install it. Other then that it’s amazing.
5,Good and easy.
5,no problems with the psu does its job with leeway for future upgrades such as the graphics card. Cables are quality that will last for a long time.
5,Maybe a tad pricier than I wanted but so so happy in the ease of installation the quiet fan and the cabling. Thanks so much for a quality product!
2,Good Silent and easy to install. also modular and 80 plus bronze 600w at 70 bucks kinda of a steal at that price point.Update: This suddenly got louder after a month of using not worth it. Ordered a seasonic 850 gm to replace it. I rather not risk my parts worth over 900 bucks on a psu worth 70 bucks. Also my return window expired. I do not recommend it. Worth it to spend more money on what powers your system. It does only get loud when my gpu is using like 200w but all the new gpu's use that much power. I have a 5700xt and the psu fans are so loud underload that I cant even hear my gpu fans.
5,Great power supply. Only issue I have with this power supply is it only has two cables for SATA. I didn’t research what I would need enough. I wish I had gotten a bigger one that comes with 3 separate SATA cables for my server with 8 drives. It supports 6 drives and was able to use a SATA expanded to connect all.
5,Order my Power Supply one day (said it was coming on the 10th of June) and got it the next day best delivery ever also packed very nice and no damage to the Power Supply love it thank you!!!
1,First one I bought was missing a whole cable making it useless couldn't refund or return since I passed by a month I went to buy another and its the exact same issue. Get something off a more reliable brand.
5,Muy buenos
5,What more can you ask for? Easy to install runs quietly and seems to run cool. Everything you would want in a tower fan.
1,I used this in a PC with an AMD Ryzen 3 3100 CPU an ASUS B450M motherboard a GTX 1060 6GB two HDD's and an SSD. Power was provided through a $100 surge protector. It worked flawlessly for 14 months. Then today I noticed that the computer was off when I knew I had left it idling. I turned it back on and all was well. A few hours later I sat down at the computer double-clicked an icon and the lights went out. It would not turn back on. Troubleshooting proved that the problem was the power supply and replacing the power supply cured the issue. I thought EVGA was better than this. I bought this power supply due to their good name. I never skimp on power supplies but this time I got screwed.
5,Worked perfectly for my newly build gaming pc
5,bastante buena y silenciosa
2,Great while lasted. Started getting random shut downs during gaming after almost 2 years. Guess I got my $'s worth.
5,I got this for my Dell Optiplex 790 (M.T.) with the 0hy9jp motherboard. I'm writing this review on my Dell! It works perfectly. I only had to use two cables both were "SATA" cables. I'm new to the whole computer thing. Fast delivery as well and good packaging. UPDATE: It gave up and stopped working all of the sudden. I'm very disappointed.
5,If you don't really need power go for this boy right here.
5,Was super easy to install is super quite and packaged nicely!
4,The only reason I'm giving it a four star is because the included VGA cable comes with two that are closely connected and it was a hassle for cable management. Other than that it's an EVGA power supply and will work great for years to come.
1,First of all I bought several of these to build company PCs and I did not build all of them right away. I should have checked them all as soon as they arrived so that one's on me. Not to mention I paid 2x the cost due to 'supply constraints'.The issues I had is that one unit was very clearly used - not NEW! Zip ties and screws were missing (I have plenty on hand so no big deal) and also the peripheral cables (also not a big deal for company PCs). Some of the wires had shielding scraped up exposing bare wires and there were scratches on the unit.AND there wasn't a POWER CABLE! To the power supply unit...I never write reviews but I wanted to share this. Don't be like me and look through your package as soon as you get it. Now to find a cable and test if this thing even works.
5,So far so good it's working perfectly paired with 2070 and 3700x.
5,esta bonita
5,Its a powersupply.It has everything you need to power your pc and a few more things. I believe this is exactly like EVGA's other model just a new design. And its definitly a nice one
5,Can’t complain about this productIs a really good power supplied
5,Super quiet and dependable. Been running fine for 2 months so far. Happy with my purchase.
5,excelente ahorra espacio el tema de ser modular
5,Great psu for the price. Highly recommend evga they make quality products. Also being semi modular it makes installation a breeze and have a very clean look. It leaves the 2 connectors you need anyways so you get all the freedom you truly need.
5,Nice product
5,system runs smoother with this power supply over stock one. can't hear the fan when it run's under normal loads.
5,Works fine per my 13yr old who built this. He did say how he appreciates the semi-modular make and all black cables.
5,Power performance is as described with absolutely no issues out of the box.The semi modular is very good for cable management.It comes with 2 EVGA Velcro ties which look a lot better than Zip ties.So far so good. Thankfully i didn't get a dud.
5,Works great in my RTX 2060 + Ryzen 5 3600 system. Great efficient power supply.
1,Ive owned this PSU for about 4 months and have had nothing but terrible experiences with it. I bought this for my new pc build after seeing that all of my hardware would pull no more than 350W and I figured this would suffice. I was wrong. After about the first week I experienced random pc restarts multiple times a day. Im pretty experienced with troubleshooting most hardware/software issues and i have given up with this. Im now getting 5+ restarts a day even without anything running. Ive ran multiple power monitoring software both while gaming and casually using my pc. Not once did it reach a point in power consumption where i could understand a full restart. Wish i would have realized this was a hunk of junk from the start and returned it. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this product if you want any sort of performance in your pc build.
5,Nice psu for a cheep budget friendly pc. I recently uograded to a 100 watt psu of evga and i have to say i have had neither quit or act up on me.
5,Working flawlessly all the cords were black decent value considering the sale price and whisper quiet
5,Es un buen artículo cumple con lo que promete y bastante económico. 5 estrellas.
2,Usually EVGA makes very good PSUs and they are a very reputable brand but when I got my power supply I put together my PC and it worked fine for about 48 hours when all the sudden everything just shut off me and my buddies went a troubleshooted everything and when we got to replacing the PSU everything suddenly worked fine again I wouldn't say that this is necessarily EVGAs fault but I definitely got a lemon (and a mini heart attack)
5,Honestly high quality power supply. no issues and is very quiet. Ya pay a little more but you get the quality of EVGA. very happy.
5,I’m building my first computer and this is a great product for the job.
5,It was delivered on time was easy to install and works like a charm.
3,The 24-pin connector doesn’t connect properly to motherboard or extension cable. Almost broke my thumb twice trying to force it as a last resort. Can’t use it as a result
2,As the title says this PSU failed in about 3 hours of use. Beware of EVGA warranty/RMA process- You are expected to wait possibly weeks while you return the unit and wait for them to ship a likely refurbished unit. No refunds! Most people do not have time to wait on that so I went to a local store and purchased a similar Corsair model. Luckily Amazon has great customer service and refunded my money after EVGA would not.
5,Used this to replace the 750 version that thing started having a micro short until it finally failed after 3 years of use so much for the 10 year warranty thought it best to just get this then to go through the process of claiming the warranty had this for half a year and so far so good
5,Producto en perfecto estado venia todo sellado 0 problemas 2 meses de uso
5,Been using this PSU for at least 30 days without a single issue.
5,So far happy with product
5,Great semi modular power supply. I have not experienced any issues or noise from the unit. The Mobo and CPU cords are a little short for some taller cases but should be fine for any medium builds. I have an antec 1200 v3 case and was just able to get the cords routed through the back panel from the bottom of the case. Any bigger and the would not have fit.
4,I dislike the 8 pin vga cable because of the extra 8 pin making cable management look bad but other wise great buy with the 80 plus bronze and seminmodularity.
5,Works really good so far would recommend this to anyone on a budget and looking for great performance as well!
5,This is good
2,Had a strange startup sequence when i first installed but I thought nothing of it. 2 months later it was dead. Evga rma process was sufficient thought their website was garbage. They did make me pay $20 to ship my $60 psu so i was salty about that.
5,Got it installed. Quiet fan. So far works like a champ. (fingers crossed for the future) ... ;)
1,luego de 10 meses de uso una de las dos unidades que he comprado fallo lo cual me sorprende por que una fuente de esta calidad deberia durar años sin problemas y la garantia exige devolverla a USA lo cual no tiene sentido por que resulta ser mas costoso que adquirir una nueva.
5,Good cables. Fit fine in my mid tower. Doesn't seem louder than any other ps.
4,Quick relatively inexpensive replacement for EVGA 850 that went out on me with a huge blowout boom from the back of the ps. The 600 went in and works fine. The 850 did protect my motherboard so that's why I stayed with the EVGA brand...for now.
5,It works well and still has left over power.
5,Me encanta muy potente es lo maximo lo recomiendo mucho
1,I bought this for a new pc build all new parts I figured ill go with evga as its a trusted brand and I am truly disappointed. its been about a month since i bought this and it just stopped working i use my system for work as a content creator so you can imagine not having a system is not good i am in Jamaica and the cost to send this back to the manufacture would be more than the cost of the item. So i am forced to stand the cost of purchasing and shipping in a new one and the lost for the faulty item I would not recommend purchasing this at all .
5,Simplemente excelente no se puede pedir algo de mejor calidad
5,Love how black and it and all cables are abled to hide it in the bottom of my case with ease. The modular cable setup made it nice to keep clutter down. Plenty of length and not loud at all. Happy customer.
5,Seems to work very well. semi modular makes for ease of use.
5,thats it
5,Works great easy to install
5,Awesome addition to my new computer with plenty of power
5,Un afluente poderosa y muy confiable para un gran equipo.
5,Good power supply design upgraded with connectors.
4,great quality.
5,This PSU is great for the value and is great for cable management. For example let's say I don't have a need for molex power. Instead of shoving the molex power cables somewhere in my case I can simply unplug it from the PSU.
3,So my power supply died after one day of use
1,Amazing how it waits to die a month after the return period expired with Amazon and frankly it's not worth utilizing EVGA's warranty on a $40 PSU.  Settling for a cheap P.O.S PSU is not a mistake I will repeat.
5,Great quality  0 to no noise  multiple connectors and allows space for adding more
3,My power supply came in and it didnt work
5,I am not into psu the only thing I can say is that it did the job well and it died protecting all other components inside the pc so at first I was like.. is that bad or good? But I just swapted my psu after something with the power tension and this EVGA died like a hero
2,I got a bad one
5,Easy to assemble and EXTREMELY quiet
1,Connected everything just fine. Went to turn on my tower and sparks started flying from the power supply. Looks like maybe the capacitors blew. Decided to double check all connections by using a separate power supply. No issues with the second one. I’ve bought this power supply 2 times. One I’ve used for 4 years and this one that failed.
5,Easy install and sooo quiet. Initially wary because of a couple of not-so-great reviews but for me it has operated well.
5,Worked great
5,small volume. Suitable for use in ITX case.
2,I got this in august of this year and in October it just stopped working out of no where
5,Somewhat hard to get the cables into the back but otherwise it's easy to install quiet and worth the money
5,It took me more time to remove the old PS than to install this new one. The modular cables allowed installing only the ones I actually need which really reduced the clutter inside my chassis. The fan is super quiet.
5,Quiet I can't hear it running. I had to put my hand behind the exhaust to be sure that the fan was working. The semi modular design is nice as now I don't have a mess of wires to hide in my case that aren't being used. Very happy with this PSU.
3,Did not work out of box. Tried same components with an older supply and they worked while this would not. Not much more to be said about it.
4,I had bad luck with evga psu this is the first one that hast lasted more than a week.
4,Power supply is working well so far.
5,Muy buena fuente y semimodular
5,first PSU and its simple to install.
5,Great psu just the price sky rocketed
5,5*
2,Bought one in July 2020 and it's been running great (6 months at the time of writing this). Lots of use and no issues. Then I bought one for a nephew's computer build and it failed within two weeks. With the rest of the reviews on amazon it looks like the manufacturing quality is inconsistent at best.
5,Fits perfectly on a   Corsair Carbide Series Air 240 High Airflow MicroATX and Mini-ITX PC Case - White        Ryzen 7 1700Wraith cooler64GB ramSamsung 960 EVO 500GB NVMe - M.2Two 1TB HDD at 7200rpmand a crappy video card.
5,Very stable!
4,deben modificar el peso en la descripcion
5,Does what its suppose to good quality PSU you'd expect from evga was easy to install to replace my old one which only took about 20mins or so due to having to route all the cables again.
5,Good semi modular
5,Simple to install!  Super Quiet!  The only cables that aren't detachable are the mother board and cpu.  You need those anyway!  Black cables were very nice looking and easy to route.  Very nice quality!
5,Works amazingly would definitely recommend
5,Unfortunately I had to return this product as it did not fit with my computer.  No hassle returning it.
4,Worked great but it turned out the Motherboard was also a problem.  So I replaced the whole computer.
5,It's not a Nova G2 but exactly a no frills semi modular perfect solution for a minimalist
5,Nothing to say. It works and isn't too loud and hasn't burned my house down.
5,The EVGA 600 watt Power supply is replacing my short lived cosair 500 watt PS. With the extra power and easy connectivity This Power supply has help boost my PC/ gaming experience.
1,Worked for less than 2 weeks and randomly stopped working. It turned on for a blink of a second and then shut off. Tried everything nothing worked except for using a replacement. Also couldn't even get a full refund for a broken item.
5,excellent I like how my setup looks
4,La fuente de poder llego en excelentes condiciones y funciona ala perfección buena compra
5,Works great no issues after a month.
1,When I buy an item on Amazon the selling point is the reviews. This has decent reviews out of 5 stars so it must be good. Wrong. I build PCs and this is not my first rodeo so I know what I am doing. It worked for an hour before my computer shut off. Thinking it was Software related I just re-booted to find the case fan flicker on and off. Ok so its a loose connection after a couple minutes checking all cables I tested the power supply voltage. Way out of line to where 12 or 5 volt devices need. Since most of the computer is Corsair such as the case liquid cooler RAM case fans ect i will spend the extra money for it. You have been warned. Any sign of fluctuating voltage dont think twice return it! Thanks to Amazons amazing return policy its being ship back as we speak!
5,It works just fine in my pc build.
5,First psu in first build no ketchup and mustard cables very quiet easy to build with 10/10
5,100% positive feedback!
5,metal fan grill... thumbs up evga… and semi modular is the way to go in my opinion... all the power wires going to your cpu and motherboard are soldered to the psu.
5,Great
1,I can't really say much about how this PSU actually performs since it never worked properly. I installed everything on my new computer and only the RGB lighting would light up the fans wouldn't spin and it wouldn't even post. After hours of trouble shooting I finally discovered that the 24 pin connector for the motherboard only had 23 pins installed on it. I decided to return it and opted for a totally different PSU to avoid the same issue. Your mileage may vary but it appears that QC is not great for this model.
4,The sata power can be a bit longer you know...
5,Works well with my ryzen 5 and Radeon rx 570!
5,No es compatible con mi computador
5,Can’t complain for the price and easy hook up and potential for upgrading to other parts best power supply for your money 💴
5,Install in my computer
1,The power supply stopped working after 3 months.Warning - EVGA makes it really difficult to do an RMA.Probably won't purchase another EVGA product because of that.
1,I’m not one to ever leave reviews as I’m pretty easily satisfied with the research of my products. Attached is a picture of how the item shipped to me I actually took this picture on line in UPS to return it. I put my wallet on top to hide my address but also to show you the packaging label on top of the box. I can’t believe computer parts can be shipped like this. There was minimal protection inside the box and it seemed to have been opened before I received it potentially used. The power supply was dented however I attempted to see if it would work it was defective. I was left very unsatisfied with this product and with decent reviews good price point and mentioned in YouTube videos I expected better. I would HIGHLY not recommend this product or it’s related products to a potential buyer.
5,Great power supply
4,Fit great in my Mocro ATX case. Love the semi modular feature. Love the 12mm fan built in.
5,Works like a champ in my Gigabit/Intel Core i5 system.  The modular cable connections means things can stay nice and tidy inside and also helps reduce heat build up from cramped quarters.
5,Glad I went with this product. 10/10Easy install looks very clean in my gaming rig.
5,very nice just wish it came with a 6 pin gpu cable that wasn't doubled up. but if you have sli its very nice that it comes with a double 6 pin
5,Great product. Works out of the box and 600 watts is more than enough for my budget gaming rig.  The semi modular interface is perfect and a no-brainer. Such a good deal and a quality product from EVGA.
5,That was my first one and I am happy with it.its great and really quiet
5,Great power supplyGreat for a mid to budget build all cables are well made and well protected sturdy frame over all and awesome product EVGA the best in the class ...
5,Works perfect very quiet perfect fit
5,The 600W BQ that I purchased has been reliable so far supplying enough power for my build with a single GPU and CPU both overclocked along with all the fans and smaller components.  Had all the cables/connectors I needed.
5,Nice and clean design. and trustful
5,Quality!  Quality!  Quality!
1,Installed this PSU on a new build. Worked for 2 days then the pc turned off while in use. After trouble shooting by removing each part of the pc I discovered that the PSU itself was the issue. The power would come on for a fraction of a sec then shut back down.  I have since replaced this unit with a much more expensive unit. I'm just glad that nothing in my new pc was affected.
5,600w probably overkill for most systems but it gives you room to grow. The cables look nice and so does the unit itself.
5,So far this has been a great product. The fan is nice and quite which is a big issue for me.
1,I bought this psu and i had to wait a couple months so i could save up for my gpu and now that im trying to turn on my pc i find out that the psu never even worked and it was brand new and now i cant have my pc because they scammed me and i cant return because the return date was till August and i bought this psu on september and right now it's February 3 so someone pls explain to me how does that make any sense
5,I suggest this power supply for any new or experienced pc builder great product and Price
4,Works nicely would have been nice if the SATA connectors were further apart.
5,Build quality is nice including the cables and for the price I’d recommend to anyone going for a mid range build.
5,Good texture with nice evga branded Velcro cable ties... The screws that came with it get tough about half way in and need some force...
5,Awesome EVGA product per the usual.
1,This worked fine for 6 months and tonight it died on me. I put my old Corsair power supply in that has lasted 10 years and everything back up. I'm not even going to RMA this. It's going right in the trash. If you ever walk away and come back to a PC that only shows a power light and not much else no fans spinning etc - replace it. Buy something other than this brand.
5,Great for my  first time building a PC with an RX 590
5,Works great in my PC. I was tired of cheap power supplies so I thought I'd give EVGA a shot. So far so good lets hope it lasts.
1,PSU didn’t work right out of the box. I have a PSU tester from another unit and proved this didn’t work after I had installed in my system only to find it did nothing. I had higher hopes for EVGA power supply as I’ve only ever heard good things. Guess I’ll have to find another one.
2,Bought this Powersupply for my first build and worked great for a month until recently the Powersupply started making ticking noises it still works and I think it's the fans but dont know how to fix it and its gets really loud
5,Nice Power Supply. Greta value.  Works as expected.
5,Great psu
5,I like the modular system; don't have to clutter the box with wires I'm not using.
1,Bought this item in September installed in November as I wait on more parts for the PC.  By December it already stopped working...be careful test out right away.
1,Built computer out hit the button and had nothing. Luckily had access to another power supply allowing me to verify it wasn't simply a case of user error but the frustration of having to rip out a psu and install another when it's brand new is a major annoyance. Really expected better from EVGA.
5,My computer is more stable and this thing is SILENT. The build quality is amazing even the cables look great. Ii can't believe the price is so low on this.
4,He said it works. We shall see how long it lasts.
1,blew up 3 days after installing. now that i replaced it with a new one having major problums with my brand new graphics card and motherboard. highly recommend using a diffrent psu.
5,This is the best thing that happen to me tonight
5,It is a power supply there isn't much to say. The semi modular design is great for cable management. A great buy for neat freaks!
5,working great in my PC build i am using it for a Ryzen 5 1600 AB350M motherboard and a GTX 1060 for reference
1,Insane easy installationTook me 30 mins to uninstall my old psu and wire this new one in and it worked well can not commend EVGA enough for making this PSUEDIT: i removed 2 stars because after one day it just gave upRE EDITPSU ONCE AGAIN AFTER 2 months stopped working dont buy it they are junk
1,Install was easy semi modular design is nice cables are all black in braided sheaths. It's nice and quiet too. It worked great for about three hours and then completely died.Won't do anything with the paper clip test. Now to wait another 5 days for Amazon to ship a replacement. Fingers crossed the next one works better.I thought EVGA was going to be a reputable brand shame on me I guess.
1,I’m not sure if you’ll do anything and I know it’s past the return date but I am just now able to set up my pc but sadly the power supply was busted. would not work at all. I bought a new one and luckily it turned on but I’m hoping that I could get my money back on this one. Thank you
1,I've used many PSU's over the years.  This one was the most disappointing... died after a few weeks.  The 5V rail still provides power but the rest of the unit is out.  I tried to start the RMA process online but they make it intentionally difficult.  I'll cut my losses and buy another brand.  Lesson learned.  Never will I buy another EVGA.
1,Ordered this for my sister who wanted to build her own gaming system. Got her computer all installed and goes to turn on and no power. This power supply has been tested by a trusted computer tech and is faulty. I contact Amazon and guess what? It is 4 days past 30 day window and they won't help. She literally just got all her parts and installed and this happens. Very disappointing.
2,Working now but one of the included cables was bad and fried my hard drive.
5,Nothing to complain about this purchase. Quality power supply looks professional clean and simple.
2,Plugged it in and fired it up and there is a super high pitched noise I can hear from all the way from the couch from my PC. After using it for a few hours I actually got a headache. It's also there (but not as loud) when the PC is OFF! Strange thing is when I'm gaming it sounds normal. My last EVGA psu was a 500w silver and it was MUCH more quiet than this. I'm going to have to return this. Ugh!
5,had to replace a previous 600w power supply. This one is notably higher quality.
5,Easy to install powers exactly what I need no issues.
1,When I received the product I wasnt able to install it because it had a dent.I had to unscrew and fix the dent in order to install it.It is working fine but when Im doing video editing or using other software it shutoff without any sign.It may be problem with my motherboard but Im pretty sure the problem is from this product.Now Im waiting for another power unit to figure out the cause of it.Thank you for wasting my time and money.
5,Beautiful. I loved it. The only PSU that managed to power my 270x Toxic. Also its semi-modular nature allowed me to save up space from my case. Definitely recommended.
5,It seems to be made well. Runs cool and quiet.
5,Excellent PSU for the price. I'm using it with a GTX 1060 i5 7600K 16GB RAM Corsair DDR4 and this PSU is working very well. A++++
2,It worked great and was very quiet until it just popped and never worked again after just 5 months of normal use.
5,Bigger than my case can hold but its great
5,buen producto la verdad que hasta el momento a funcionado bien
5,a good power supply I can even do upgrades even I want to one thing is to make​ sure you're motherboard support 12v rails
5,Easy to install. I don’t hear any noises.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I got the power supply and everything looked amazing I was so excited to switch out my old 450w for this 600w but when I switched it and had everything ready to go it was defective. I tried to switch out the power cord with the old one I had but still nothing sadly.
1,This PSU doesn’t represent EVGA it just stopped working after less than 4 months of low usage. The system contains Ryzen 5 5600x Gtx 1650 oc.
1,I ordered this power supply 2 months ago before I had ordered the rest of my parts. When I had put it all together the power supply was shorted. I tested all the pins and they gave no output. I would not recommend this brand of power supply especially if it’s a long term system.
5,works perfect upgraded my factory desktop power supply so I could run a new video card.  so far everything is great
3,It really should have power outputs for more than one graphics card at 600W. or at least put in the description
4,Word well
5,Had to replace a failing PSU. So far this thing runs quiet and gives me better cable organization.
1,Aunque el producto funciona perfectamente no me gusta que diga "700 B1 EVGA 80+ Bronce" pero llega es la que está en la foto una fuente de 600 B1 EVGA 80+ Bronce y la dejé porque la necesitaba pero ese detalle me parece que es publicidad engañosa.
5,Perfect
2,i’m sure this power supply is great but i ended up getting a defective one and it made the loudest whine iv ever heard and returned it
5,Its been a week since i installed it in my pc....still works great!!
5,Super quiet
1,Lasted 4 days then completely died won’t power up fan does half a turn then stops. Don’t waste your time or money like I did. I had to completely take apart my build with the wiring harnesses and replace with something else. Garbage.
5,no problems so far
5,What more do you need?
5,Replaced failing power supply.  Drop in replacement. No issues. Runs great.
1,I got this 600W PSU for my i5 9600k + RTX2070 setup. After one month of normal usage my computer starts shutting down and rebooting every time I playing games. I monitored the temps of cpu and gpu and there were both under  65C. Some others also have the issue of loss power with this PSU. I cannot return it cuz the time window has closed. My friend bought a GTX1070 from EVGA before and it died in less than one year. Won't buy any PC component from EVGA in the future.
5,Easy to install and a great product
1,When I received mine it didn’t even work. All the connections were proper everything was plugged in yet the thing would not power my computer. Ended up returning it but a few of my friends had similar experiences with this same model. I went with a Corsair as a replacement and it has worked great.
5,Great product and is as described.  Would buy again if needed.
4,Good
5,Disregard my last review I received this and works great! Thank you
5,Love the simplicity and flexibility of the modular cords only putting in what you need and increases air flow.
1,The product stopped working randomly on a pc that was using no where close to the max power and won't even turn on now. Horrible product.
5,Good price for a semi modular power supply. Works as expected fit in my Corsair 100R nicely.
1,The box says evga and the product in the box says delta.  Not what was shown on site.
5,Works as described included good quality necessary cables.
5,Sturdy power supply. Power my build with no problems and is still working great.
1,I finally get my power supply and luckily thought of looking at the reviews and found a review of someone saying they where missing a pin to their power cable. I happened to look at mine and realized mine was missing the exact same Pin. Very disappointed but glad I caught this in time before building my PC. Will be returning ASAP come Monday.
5,As expected
1,El producto se le dio un uso decente y aun asi pasado un mes de funcionamente se dañó la tienda TAMPAPCG no quiso hacerse cargo del reclamo y tampoco brindo instrucciones adecuadas.
1,The 24 pin cable only had 23 pins so I returned it and got a new one and it had the same issue so I will be returning it. I’m going to try a third time with this power supply (fingers crossed).
1,This power supply is cheap but you get what you pay for. It worked with very few problems for the first few months then suddenly just kicked the bucket. I would stay away from this particular power supply at all costs. (spend the extra money don't skip out)
1,Esto seguramebte es problema del vendedor AmazinXpress Wholesale Group.Donde el título de la publicación habla de 700w las imágenes y caracteristicas ofrecen 600BQ (600w)y finalmente después de esperar una semana por el producto llegan fuentes de 500BQ (500w)INACEPTABLE
5,good quality.
1,Buen día el el titulo del producto no coincide con las características y aun mas con el articulo recibido la publicación anuncia fuente EVGA de 700w pero en realidad lo que venden es una fuente atx de 600w..
1,I bought this PSU as a first time builder. Long story short I ended up having to take my entire rig to microcenter to figure out what was wrong with it. It was this power supply. I had already replaced this PSU on Amazon but it was still faulty. So I ended up having to just return the PSU to Amazon and buy a corsair PSU with 80 plus gold rating. So all in all I would say don't skimp on the PSU get a good one (as in 80plus gold) so you dont have to go through the headaches I did.
5,Ggreat product for price
1,Worked for a week and died. Waste of time and money.
1,I bought this a while ago and when i finally built my gaming rig after 3-4 days it died on me waste of money or evga did not do a good job
5,Great product
5,The fan of the product is very quiet.
1,This was actually sent as a replacement for a non functioning unit I had purchased earlier. Unfortunately I installed it and just as the previous unit it failed to power on. Such a pitty as it is a really nice looking unit and has some good reviews behind it.  Unfortunately for me neither unit worked so I'll be shipping the unit back for a refund. Plugged in a separate power supply from another manufacturer and the PC powered up just fine.
5,Loud...but powerful and reliable.
5,Solid product that does exactly what it's supposed to do. Energy efficient and quality.
1,I liked everything about the product except it didn't work.  In fact I played with it for over a month trying to figure out my problem and overshot the return window.
5,Insanely quiet power supply. Works great have had it installed for about 2 weeks.
1,I installed int into my computer and not even a week later there was 2 loud pops then a huge smoke cloud came out of the power supply.
1,Shipped in an envelope? Seriously?I pushed the dent in some before I realized I should take a photo. Damage was / is worse than the picture. Things happen. This is one of those things. 1 star until I nervously test it due to time constraint forcing me to use as is work.I decided to return this and go with a different product.
5,Very good
1,Bought used arrived DOA hooray
1,The 24 pin cable only had 23 pins. Absolutely wack. So many other customers are saying that they have this same problem. An absolute garbage machine. Do not buy this aldi brand power supply.
5,Amazing.
5,evga forever
2,After installing this psu it seemed like it ran fine but I would lose power to my peripherals after a couple hours and the only solution was to unplug to power supply and wait hours for it to reset
1,I cannot say for certain whether they all are junk or not but my product came in July and I didnt have the rest of my parts yet so i waited. I have just now finished building my PC only to realize that some of the lines are missing and it doesnt fit quite right as the plastic is molded. Save your money.
2,Did not start up once installed. I think I got a defective product.
2,SURVIVED ONE SAD YEAR BEFORE it died.
1,Bought this item as new and it obviously wasn't looking at the packaging and the PSUThen when I went to hook it up the cords that were included were incorrect most importantly the SATA power.Refunded
1,It simply quit working one day.  Won't power up.
5,The power is very well and I love it. Good value good product.
2,It seems to function but the cpu case is damaged.
5,Amazing product!
5,Evga FTW. Inexpensive and gets the job done.
5,Went in without any problems and has held up so far.
5,one of the best companies for PSU
5,love the semi modular good price
1,I got unlucky I got a faulty power supply these things happen but I do know this is a reliable brand I’d still recommend this product however you do Tun the risk of getting a power supply that is faulty
1,This thing is absolute garbage. Completely failed in 3 months. RMA process is garbage. You have to either ship it back and wait for them to receive it then send another or put up collateral of the item to get one sent.Update.The replacement device arrived today. It is dead on arrival and not working.
5,Buena
5,Just as advertised
1,Power supply shorts and turns off immediately after pressing power button only one week after installing. Replacing with the same unit and if it happens again I'll provide an update.
5,Awrsome
5,Great for budget build
5,good price
5,recomended
5,Escelente
5,Amazing
1,I got my tower all set up and running. The first time I used it (1 day) the power supply stopped working completely. I'm very disappointed.
1,Mine died after 3 months of usage... the thing just blew up. No idea why. I have a current regulator at the source socket I just plugged the cable and switched the PSU on then it blew out.
1,I really trusted EVGA but I received mine with a dent in it as if it was dropped. Mind you the box was in pristine condition wrapped in shrink plastic and the PSU was in bubble wrap. Which is why I was surprised to see it damaged it had to happen during production and EVGA NEEDS to improve their quality checks. I can't even mount it properly because of the dent! This NEEDS to be fixed!
1,I built 2 computers using the 600W power supply. One of the units arrived and didn't work. No big deal - I returned it and received another without any issue. Installed them in two different computers. After 11 months of limited use (1 or 2 hours a day) I have a another PSU failure.
1,Lasted less than 2 months.  PC just wouldn't turn on today and of course we're past the return period. Extremely disappointed and wishing I'd read some of these reviews before purchasing.
1,Compré 4 una falló después de 3 semanas instalada. No la recomiendo. Ni siquiera con fuentes de mala calidad me ha pasado.
5,great little PSU
1,Mala compra no funciono al llegar. nada enciende. Probé todo con otra fuente de poder y enciende. Pero con esta nada de nada.No puedo hacer la devolución ya que no hay soporte para mi ubicación (la recibí vía courier).
1,It gave with a missing cable in the 24 pin connector  my pc wasnt working and it really stressed me out until i took it out and realized it was missing a whole cable . So disappointed  i lost a lot of time and got really stressed out over a problem that shouldnt have occured.
1,Everything came in good condition but I missing my AC power cord to connect it to the outlet can’t seem to run the machine without an actual power cord
5,Great gift well loved.
5,Sound of silence edition
5,excellent
5,EVGA makes stupid good PSU's. Would recommend to all.
1,Bought two of these power supply and both are having voltage issue the first power supply lastes about 20 days then shut down the PC and never worked again the second power supply had no start up or any sort of power being pushed through I sincerely hope you read this review and save your time and money
5,Works. Delivers. Quiet. What more would you want?
1,I literally just came with the power supply and the VGA cable it didn't even come with a sata cable or the cable to give it power.
5,Works cheap semi modular.
5,perfect
5,Love the products
1,Like the title said. PC suddenly turned off. Have to pull out working TX650M and PC runs fine now.
5,Good price for a quality PS. Would buy again.
1,Less than 7 months and already dead...
1,Got a faulty unit power supply keeps shutting off PC randomly and couldn't figure it out until now.
1,This is a top rated power supply and we purchased based on reviews and reputation.  Expected it to last more than 6 months of normal use.
5,Works as expected.
5,good
5,Awesome product... easy installation
1,We have no idea why it completely stopped working - had to take the entire computer apart and troubleshoot for days only to determine that this is broken used less than 2 months and they didn't respond when I requested a refund.
1,Very bad product! I’ve only had it for about 2 month and it already went out. Spent your money somewhere else and get something better. TRASH. 👎🏽
1,Didn't work out of the box. Had to return and get another one. Buyer beware. I'm surprised EVGA has a good reputation. Had me questioning my build but new one worked as soon as I powered it up.
1,It's possible I got a bad unit but when i installed this i to my system r7 2700x and rtx2060 it completely killed the momotherboard I tested the psu with a cheap mobo and killed it aswell I'm disappointed that a psu from evga would fail.
1,Unfortunately right after the warranty period it died.  First time it has ever happened.
5,Excelent!
5,Solid PSU for the price
5,quite!
5,Masiso alv 10/10
1,Tried to see if it worked when I received it and “big suprise” it never worked I like EvGA and their products but this one is not my favorite
5,Great . i like it
1,Have heard wonderful things about EVGA and was recommended this brand. Unfortunately when I received it it was Dead on arrival verified by a pin test. I know it’s no fault to EVGA just disappointed it happened.
1,the plug in fit into the wall but it doesnt work and theres also no holes for a phone charger im pissed waist a ma damn moneyim asian
1,Be sure you test this power supply before you install it into anything. Bad test on PG and -12v rail. Obviously not tested before sale.
5,Very good
1,fried after one month also my 24pin connector only has 23 pins. very disappointed
1,Worked for 2 days then went bad...idk if i was just unlucky or if it’s truely a bad product
5,As advertised. Works perfect.
5,Works really well!
5,amazing
5,Great product. Great price!
5,Does the job
1,I only had the item for about a month and it stopped working...not happy!
1,15 year old son spent yard mowing $$ on a gaming computer build. We built it over the weekend. Every part is new. PSU isn't supplying power to motherboard!!!! He's very disappointed. He was so excited when we installed the last part.
1,I used it for one day and it stopped working
1,It was dead on arrival.
5,Great
5,works great
1,firdt I thought it was just the power button was broken but it turns out it was okbut then when I checked to see if my PSU was dead by using a paperclip it turns out it was dead.
1,This unit was DOA.
1,writing on the 600W BQOrdered one plugged it in to the Tower I was building didn't work fan never spin meaning no power was resiving or sent ordered a second same issue DO NOT GET
1,pretty sure mine just came defective
1,They gave me a dead one
1,power supply came dead. smelt like burnt rubber.
1,Arrived DOA
1,literally blew out
1,Got it straight out of the box and clamps are broken and pc isn’t turning on. Come to find out after testing the PSU it’s fried. Thanks Amazon.
1,This PSU was dead on arrival. Tapping the side caused it to power on using the paperclip test but when hooked up it would not power motherboard.
1,Did not work
1,The power supply was not functional out of the box.Unable to return.
1,the psu arrived dead after me testing it for a while i finally noticed that the fan won't even start up
1,when I get this item it never works. I’m don’t know why they sent it bad item to me.
1,Turned it on for the first time and immediately starting to smoke. Will be returning
1,Like similar posts...we built the computer just to discover the one we received doesn’t work.
1,This PSU only works for 20 minutes after this time the PC suddenly shut down and the PSU die I put my old PSU and my PC is working.
1,DOA! Verified paper clip test. Have to pay to ship it back in order to receive a return. Wish Amazon would take it back and cover the cost of this!
1,2 months and stop working don’t buy
1,box was damaged and seal was broken when I received it. Broken parts were also present. Seemed like a used product
1,Worked perfect for about 2.5 weeks then died. Not much else to say.
1,Well there are some problem when I put it in my pc. I dunno why but it keeps shutting down my pc for after 5 mins.
1,Me llego dañado no funciona
1,Blew after a few power-on attempts. Had to return. Hassle.
1,Smelled like burning garbage. Took a day before I noticed it smelled up the entire house. It's been 2 days since I decommissioned it and I still smell burning electronics. Thanks for ruining my air space. I bought a Thermaltake and it did the same thing but not as bad. Spent $$$ on a Corsair and it smells like nothing out of the box the way it used to be...
5,Running close to 9 years on my sons computer. NO PROBLEMS NO ISSUES at all.
1,It don't work.
5,For the money this is a good value and works well. If you are a gamer it might not be right for you. But for a working desktop it fills this bill nicely. I replaced the same brand a 650 that was shorting out and losing power after three year of 24 hr operation. I go 3 years for about the same price so at $25 a yr it is a decent power supply. This is a step about a house brand and not a high end unit so you will get what you pay for. But the band is reliable and it is a Bronze rated power box so it should do a great job in an everyday work machine. It runs a bit hot so make sure you have good fans and ventilation around your box. It is fairly quite and that is a huge plus.
4,said 600 watt but I got a 500W instead. Saw another comment a while back saying the same thing. Just beware that you might get a 500W instead of a 600W. Don't really care tho it does it's job well.
3,Although the unit comes with OVP UVP OCP and OPP the power supply shut down out of nowhere while gaming and the computer will no longer turn on. I have had it for about 6 months. Luckily the power supply has a good warranty but i just went ahead and replaced it with a corsair psu instead. I'm not sure if my experience with it is specific to me but everything else about the power supply regarding the cables and fans was pretty good.
5,Works good
1,My wife purchased this power supply in 2016 and the far started making noise a few weeks ago.  I went to get a RMA and the customer service reports that they will not honor the warranty.  Apparently the power supply was received without a serial number label.  Not my fault no idea why it does not have one.Be warned if it lacks the serial number sticker contact support or send it back IMMEDIATELY!  They will NOT honor the warranty.  I have  the proof of purchase and i DID buy it through Amazon.  Their initial rejection was because my wife's name was on the purchase.  They changed their tune when i explained this. Then complained about the label not being there. Lastly the power supply model DID NOT EXIST more than 5 years ago so it is IMPOSSIBLE to have a device that is older than 5 years. They still rejected my RMA based on a $5 fan replacement.I have never had any issues with a RMA to EVGA before but i guess they are hardening their policy.  I can 1000% guarantee that the replacement will NOT be an EVGA power supply.  I will also re-evaluate my other component purchases as I really do not need the static on getting something repaired.
5,A+
2,My dad recently bought this for me so I can build my own pc. It was great at first. Easy to install and always quiet. However I was playing COD than all of a sudden my of turned off on its own. I was shocked. I had to test every component and I didn’t suspect the power supply because I just got it. However it WAS THE POWER SUPPLY. I worked greatly for a month than just died on me. I did the paper clip test and it failed to pass. I’m very disappointed in what I got and upset that it’s quarantine so I won’t be able to return it.
1,It died after a few months. i was playing a game and it just shut down with error
1,I bought this power supply and when I took it out the motherboard cable was missing three pins and gpu cable did not fit.-_-
1,It did not even work
1,DOA...
4,I bought this when i put a little gaming pc together and it has also been nothing but good to me just like all my other parts it does collect a great amount of dust but thats normal so. I love this power supply alot its more than enough to run a pc with most of the newer cards on the market! Overall i rate this at a 8/10
5,Substantially weighted power supply.  Feels like a good power supply  and is quiet.
5,Low noise level and great for my build
5,There was nothing to dislike! It is very easy to install and the product itself is worth the money and it’s fast.
5,Tal cuál lo que se pidió fue lo que llegó y a un muy buen precio llegó un día antes de lo esperado
5,Great product.
5,Quality of item was superb. Ever so radiant packaging. Delivery was optimal.
5,Buen desempeño.
5,Super quiet all the power and more needed. Only plug in what you need. It's was ordered 8:00pm and by 7:30 am next day was delivered
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I received an opened item that was wrapped with another plastic film and the company sealed was already cut through you can see it in the the last 45 seconds in the video
5,This power supply is an ABSOLUTE STEAL for $40. This 600W Semi Modular 80+ Bronze can power up to an RTX 3070 Super. Unless you have the money for an RTX 3080 and up this is as good and cheap as it gets. This is a no brain-er investment. I would even say this beats the SuperNOVA Power supplies that go on sale for $60 frequently in terms of price to performance. The only caveat I would say is that it only has a three year warranty. That's it. Get this while you can for $40 folks! I think the 450w or 500w version of this was recently on sale for $35 as well.Pros:- $40 (STEAL!!!!)- 80+ Bronze Certification- Semi Modular- Includes Velcro ties- Quiet Fan- Black Well Sleeved cables- Very good built quality/QC mine is virtually perfectNeutral:- 3 Year WarrantyCons:- None and if you had any problems I'm sure EVGA or Amazon would help you out considering it's still in warranty or return window.
5,La calidad de los materiales es buena. Los cables tienen buenas protecciones.
1,Its simple it came with a power supply with a missing pin
5,I really love the modularity of this power supply even though its semi modular. I havent had any issues with it. I dont notice any noise from the fan while gaming. I would buy this this anytime i build or need to replace a psu in a computer.
4,In all honesty. I love it. It came perfectly wrapped no dents no damage to the box what-so-ever. Everything was included in the box nothing missing. I just wished it arrived on time. Arrival dates change I understand that but eh what can you do. My build only uses 384W so I can still use this for upgrading would recommend to a friend
5,Easy to install for gaming
5,Excelente  muy buen producto llego rápido 👍🏻
5,Always buy a PSU from a trusted manufacturer highly rated 10/10
5,So far so good. Easy enough to install.
5,Me encanta esta fuente de poder siento que es unas de las mejores del mercado muchas gracias 😘
5,it worked as expected installed easy and is relatively quiet.
5,Looking at all these budget power supplies you will find tons of reviews thrashing the power supply claiming that the product died within weeks makes a lot of noise or even fried their whole system. Yes it could be a problem but most of the time it is bad luck or the reviewer's own fault in their setup. If your home's electricity is properly setup your PC system uses high quality parts that are compatible you should have no problems. If you really do get a lemon/DOA return it to Amazon.It's a great budget power supply that is easy to install. The cables are all black none of that ketchup and mustard stuff. The fan is extremely quiet when idle. If I didn't have my monitor on I wouldn't be able to tell that my PC was running. In my opinion semi-modular PSUs are underrated. They're cheaper and have the bonus of better cable management.
1,Worked for a couple of weeks and then died.  No smoke or show just dead.  It was on a fairly light load so there's no reason for it to fail.  The 5V standby rail is there but it will only give a short twitch of the fan on startup.  Tested outside the computer on a load tester etc.  Nada.I probably won't be buying any more EVGA PSUs.  There is a reason for the relatively low price.  The wire harnesses are minimal at best.  The other unit that I have does not perform well under load due to drop across the small gauge wires.  I bought this one in a pinch when prices on better PSUs were high.  Replaced with a proper Seasonic...done.
5,Pues para el ensamble que tengo perfecta la fuente. Es semi modular la utilicé para una MB Aorus b550M Pro P Ryzen 5 Pro 4650 e instalé un MVme por lo cual no tuve que utilizar ni los molex ni los sata aunque tendré que después creo que usar un sata para el hub de fans pero bueno al ser modulares esos cables el ahorro de espacio es muy bueno. Primer ensamble que hago y recomiendo para los que se animan a hacerlo revisar varias páginas para calcular el consumo en el mío me daba muy bajo pero pensando en expansión a futuro 600W según lo que leí va bien. También si se tiene un poco más de presupuesto invertir en una 80 Plus Gold aunque para mi está bien la electricidad donde vivo es bastante estable y con el regulador pues doble protección a los componentes internos. Recomendada.
5,It’s a power supply it works good and has a good amount of connections. The price is grate and you get what you should.
5,Had a NZXT power supply that wouldn’t work in spite of an even higher power rating. EVGA has always stood behind other products so I went with this power supply. Nice semi-modular design and the build sprang to life after installing it. Good workmanship too.
1,Pacakege came damaged. Internal and external damages. Product's casing got damage.
5,Perfect
5,This 600 watt psu offers just enough for my PC. This price is good for EVGA.
5,I used this to replace a PS that was bad. I like the modular cables to prevent a wad of cables that will never be used inside the case.
5,It's EVGA semi modular and works like a charm. What else needs to be said. A sweet PSU!
5,I've never noticed the fan rev up on this thing even when my system is pulling close to 400 watts. The semi-modular is perfect for my PC with a PSU shroud it looks very clean.
5,Exelente producto todo llegó muy bien embalado y en perfecto estado. Al instalar funcionó correctamente y es muy silencioso al estar encendido
4,Needed an inexpensive PS for a cobbled together build
5,normally  EVGA 400w or 450w is round $40.600w is $40 ??? it is good deal.u can run up to rtx3060ti.no noise at all. even 3 Year Warrantygood product good price.  i love it.
1,Now I’m not entirely sure what happened but everything was working fine until my pc started to randomly crash. My motherboard was saying that it wasn’t detecting the GPU so I talked to some people to try to diagnose the issue and they all pointed at the psu saying that’s probably what did it. I wouldn’t recommend or at least I’d be very careful when buying. This psu is rated E (avoid at all costs) on the psu tier list.
5,It's an EVGA power supply what else do you expect? Very quiet and I am never switching back to a non-modular psu.
5,Runs as speed and very quite
5,I like the fact that you can plug in what you need and leave out what you don't. Very nice and it powers my new build very good. Thanks again.
5,Output cables fit my ATX board and powered up instantly - no problemo
5,Nice and affordable.
5,Coming from someone who previously had a non-modular power supply this product is great. The cleanliness of even semi-modularity is great for a PC build with a screen. I've had no power issues and haven't noticed any noise coming from the unit. Included cables are enough and they even include two velcro cable strips that I've used to tie down my main ATX cables and such. As alluded to in the title I bought this for like $20CAD more than some other power supplies as of writing but I'm definitely satisfied with this product so it's definitely a win.
1,Mon bloc d’alimentation à arrêter de fonctionner après 3 mois d’utilisation. J’essaye de contacter EVGA pour profiter de ma garantie mais leur service à la clientèle est mauvais. Ils ne répondent pas aux messages que je leur ai envoyé.
5,Ce powersupply fonctionne extrêmement bien depuis maintenant 3 ans dans mon PC qui à 6 disques durs à alimenter ainsi qu'une carte graphique RX VEGA 64. Je le recommande sans hésiter.
5,Al ser semi modular me da la opción de conectar y tener en mi pc los cables necesarios para su funcionamiento viene preparada para dos tarjetas gráficas de 8 pines cada uno y 2 conectores de 4 pines (depende tu TM) para alimentar el procesador. me funciona a la perfección lo recomiendo ampliamente.
5,This model has better specs than a B1 or white model but price is very similar.  Only semi-modular but everyone uses ATX and CPU 12-pin so not really an issue.  Only has two PCIe connectors which limits your expansion options.  Great quality for a good price for excellent value.
5,Muy buen empaque.Excelente producto gran marca y certificado.Para la calidad del producto vale la pena ya que es lo que alimentara los componentes y debe darte entera seguridad.
1,Product broke down right after warranty was over. Bad power supply on a computer that was very rarely used!!!
1,Bought this power supply as it was a good amount of power and a well known brand. The system i have this thing gave way more than enough power than i needed. I used this for just one week and it decided to die and fry my motherboard as well. Not recommended.
5,Llego a tiempo en empaque original y con todo lo que especifica la publicación.Lo uso en mi primer equipo que arme (Ryzen 5 3600 GPU AMD rx 5600xt) y no tengo ningún problema de voltaje.
5,Exactly as described. This solved my power supply issues I was having with my Corsair CX600. The 600 BQ is providing nice stable power as expected. The module design is great for cable management. my PC hasn't looked better!
5,Great power supply to work with. Modular cables for the extras Nice and quiet. No issues whatsoever. Would definitely recommend for a new build.
4,Fairly easy install.  This was an upgrade from a 500BQ which had cratered after 1.5 years.  I've had lots of trouble free years from EVGA products.
5,It's been awhile since I bought this regular cleanings and she's silent and still going
5,Everything works perfectly nothing much to say about the product.Tout fonctionne à merveille aucun autre commentaire à faite je recommande.
1,Don't buy this psu. I got a defective product. 600 watts should be able to run games but this one really can't. I had to get another one just so my new gaming pc could work.
5,Quiet and powerful. Excellent psu.
4,Great price for what it is. But I still wish I could have gotten a fully modular for the same price but that is ask a lot.
5,Perfectas condiciones. Muy buen producto. Exelente entrega en tiempo y forma.
5,Great product. Always go semi modular so less wires in your build.
5,No problem installing works great!
5,Amazing huge fan lots of cable even has velcro for cable management. Very happy
5,Great to be able to install or leave off the cables you want
5,Good price for what you get.  No issues it's quiet.
5,Great PSU at a good price
5,Works perfectly!
5,Worked
5,Wonderful product works amazing and is not noisy at all
3,Have to get use to it is all  still good for the money
4,Works good!
5,works well great value
5,Surprisingly one of my favourite parts on my new PC build beautiful all black cabling and a very nice finish on the box.  Came with a couple Velcro EVGA cable management straps.
5,Semi-modular quite nice so there is not a huge mess of cables.
1,Faulty. Will only power fans and pc will not boot. Not happy
5,excellent product
5,Hasta el momento todo bien llegó antes de tiempo.
5,Es mi primer fuente de calidad todo va a la perfección el envio llego en el tiempo estimado y todo muy bien
5,Good & stable.
5,great product  great service
5,perfect
5,so far loving it
5,Used for personnal matter
4,Worth it
5,El nivel de ruido es muy bueno.No tuve ningún problema al instalarla.
5,Wow
5,Been working great.  Enough power
1,Shipped broken
5,Gran calidad del producto y excelente funcionamiento
5,Good quality.
4,Très bien :D
1,Dead on arrival. :(
5,Quality is with ous
5,I read the reviews and decided on this PSU and I am glad that I did. I had purchased a different one before I read the bad reviews saying that they could cause serious problems. I lost a bit of money but I feel that my new computer is doing very well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love it! it's compatible for my build so I'm satisfied with it.
1,The product came smashed and out of shape. Would not recommend And now we find it actually doesn't work.
5,Excellent choice!! I chose this product to build a good gaming rig for my 13 year old kid that is playing Overwatch Battlefield Raindow6… on line with friends I did not have a 2k budget so I carefully chose excellent items. This is one of them it runs super well. No lagging super fast.  I bought GA-Z270-sli LGA1151 Gigabyte EVGA GeForce 1050TI SC  Patriot Viper Elite extreme (2x 8Gig) I5 7500 EVGA600 80+.
5,Great little unit. Does it's job and seems to be a quality PS. It helped that I got it for a BANGING price. Remember to calculate the power requirements for all the parts of your PC before buying this. It's probably not for you if you'll be running SLIed cards. A simple rig with one or four drives and a single video card would be fine with this PS.
5,Part of a build for my son. First time in almost 20 years. Everything as specified. Completely happy. Would get a bigger componentized model next time. So much to learn.
5,Great value for money
1,Received this power supply for my sons build but it was completely dead. Paid to have it tested and paid to ship it back which wasn’t cheap.  Was refunded for cost of item only.
4,Good value and works as advertised
5,Does it's job after few days it still runs great and not louder then other components. Could change in future but for now is great!
5,works well with my computer now :) no problems do far
1,The product stop working after 3 months
5,No problem
2,the PSU worked for 3 months then it stopped working the warranty is basically useless because you have to pay the shipping to RMA it. I have to pay $70 excluding taxes to fix a defective product? this is unbelievable
5,works great arrived on time
