4,I am going to give you all of my thoughts on this $850 headset. For some background I am a CFI with roughly 1500 hours flying C172s and PA-44s.  Virtually all of those 1500 hours were flown with my first inexpensive headset: a Pilot USA 1171T with passive noise reduction. A few of my comments on the Lightspeed will be in comparison to my old Pilot USA which should be similar in quality to the basic David Clarks. So here's my review of the Lightspeed Zulu 3 aviation headset:Build Quality:This headset has a solid build quality but it is not necessarily something that is going to blow you away. Yes there is a fare amount of metal but there is also plenty of plastic. However this is expected as an ALL metal headset would undoubtedly add to the weight. Compared to my old headset the weight is similar which is a plus given this headset's added capabilities (such as active noise cancelling). Adjustments are done by simply pulling the earcups down and settling into pre-set notches. This is a little less desirable compared to my old headset which used a tightening knob and sliding rail (no preset notches which allowed perfect precision of your setting).Fit & Comfort:I find this headset very comfortable. The earcups are soft and form nicely around your ears. They create a fairly good seal and maintain a decent seal even with thin framed sunglasses on. Given it's light weight I've worn this for hours on end without fatigue. I am a bit skeptical on the longevity of the ear cups and head cushion as they feel as though they are thinly covered with a fabric like material. I think Lightspeed states they view these as wearable aspects of the headset and recommend replacement every year or so. I certainly hope they last longer than a year. In my opinion anything less than 3+ years is unacceptable. My previous headset's earcups and head cushion are in mint condition after 7+ years and 1500 hours...and those were also very comfortable and good quality. Time will tell.Audio & MicrophoneThe quality of the microphone and audio is...average at best. This is one of the most surprising parts of this headset. When I say this I am referring to my own audible voice as detected by the microphone (and heard in my ears) and the audio quality of others in the cockpit/over the radios (again as heard in my ears). To me this headset does not produce better sounding audio than my $125 old Pilot USA headset. To clarify the ambient nose is greatly reduced in this headset compared to my older passive headset. That is because this headset utilizes Active Noise Reduction (ANR). However ambient noise aside the actual quality of the sound produced by the earcups is just OK. It's more than good enough for what it's needed for but I was disappointed that it was no better (and perhaps slightly worse) than my cheap headset. Perhaps this is not so much an insult to Lightspeed but a massive compliment to Pilot USA. I don't know. Also concerning ANR you should know this headset is terrible the moment ANR is disengaged (via the inline control module). The ambient noise is terrible and the audio quality sounds significantly worse. My old headset was ONLY passive and did excellent in this area. The Zulu 3 is terrible as a passive headset. Of course this is probably due to the fact the headset was designed to utilize active noise cancelation so I suppose the amount of passive sound deadening could be significantly less in this headset than in my old. Nonetheless it's still surprised me that my $125 headset could wipe the floor with this headset the moment the ANR was turned off.Microphone Boom:This is actually my single biggest complaint about this headset. As other reviews have noted the microphone boom is a flexible arm that has no extending ability. It is as long as it is and will not get longer. This makes it difficult for the mic to reach all the way around your head/cheek and be positioned in front of your mouth. The best I seem to achieve is to reach in front of the left third of my mouth. If I'm ok with the mic being pressed firmly to my lips I can just barely make it reach the middle of my mouth but that is far too uncomfortable and makes for poor audio pickup. Make no mistake I do not have a big head...at 5' 7" and 150lb my head is average. But I find myself fiddling with the mic constantly searching for a sweet spot. My previous headset (and MANY headsets) have a microphone boom that can extend to various lengths. I am still slowly becoming accustomed to this headset so perhaps I will find the sweet spot. I have also adjusted the mic gain (under the foam mic piece there is a plastic cap covering the gain adjustment) which seems to help the situation.The Inline Control Module:I feel that the control module is large larger than it needs to be. Not only can this be cumbersome in the cockpit it can be difficult when it comes time to store the headset away after a flight (more on that below with the case). Practically speaking there is no reason the module cannot be designed to be roughly 25% smaller. The volume adjustment bars also move extremely easily making accidental volume adjustments very possible. The module does include additional settings but these are made in the battery compartment with tiny "dip" switches. This isn't as big a deal as these setting are not ones you'll be adjusting all the time. Be sure to check them though as by default one of mine was set to mono audio when the audio panels in the aircraft I fly are stereo.The Case:The included case is simply too small to properly this the headset. This or the control module and the cable protruding from the earcup need to be redesigned. Check the attached pictures and you'll see fitting the module is awkward as any place you put it places stress on the cables on one end or the other. Similar stress is placed on the cable protruding from the left earcup. With pressure on these points a failure is much more likely. The case is very sturdy and otherwise great.So those are my thoughts. Despite its shortcomings I am keeping the headset. I got a good deal on it. However if I had the money I would most certainly spring for the Bose. But with time I suspect I will become fully accustomed to this headset. Overall it's a good headset....I just feel the price should be something closer to $600.
3,Sadly the Zulu3 has turned out to be a big disappointment for me.  When they work they are awesome everything everyone says comfortable excellent sound etc. is accurate.  Unfortunately however they have not held up for me requiring warranty service two times now in 3.5 years.I'm a professional pilot flying 80+ hrs a month.  They worked flawlessly for 2.5 years but one day popping and clicking began in my ears any time I moved my jaw basically talking it was extremely annoying and made it difficult to communicate & concentrate.Contacted Lightspeed to return for Warranty service.Cost of shipment to them is on you and they return the way you shipped IOW if you send Ground they return Ground use 2-day they use 2-day overnight well you get the idea.  They promptly fixed them and as a courtesy replace the ear seals head pad and mic muff unfortunately something I had just done a month prior so that purchase was wasted!When they came back the repair order (RO) indicated they replaced the mic boom and a speaker and something about internal wiring.Well 9 months after getting them back my left ear started popping and clicking the other day.  Remembering the RO notes I started gently pressing the mic boom on the headset cup and issue would come and go and actually get worse where the left ear completely cut out which indirectly was a blessing as it stopped the annoying pop/click!Contacted Lightspeed during one of my stops and they setup a quick turn RO again the issue for me is I don't really care about warranty I care about working!  Last time I sent them ground and used a cheapo backup headset for my 8 day flying cycle not doing that again.  As I only have 6 days off between cycles to get them back in time this time I paid to overnight them which cost $130 so not digging Lightspeed right now!Bottomline I regret not considering where the manufacturer of the product is.  I live in NH Lightspeed is in Oregon.  Ground shipping across country takes a week return another even if they repair promptly you're without a headset for at least half the month nevermind the hassle of packaging and running to a shipper too.Warranty is great and all but a design that is robust and doesn't require warranty service is far more important to me.  Seems there's a weak link in the design of the Lightspeed mic boom.  I consider myself to be one who is easy on my equipment.  I wear it I take it off and place it in the cuby next to my seat during stops nothing unduly harsh.All this said I have a new headset on backorder from a local to me manufacturer (not over hyped over priced Bose) so in the least if I do require warranty service it's going the next state over not across the country!
5,This product is incredibly high quality. The noise cancellation is incredible it’s unbelievably comfortable and the volume controls and Bluetooth features work great! I wouldn’t buy another headset for flying
5,I had a Bose set on order with no delivery date given and I could no longer wait so I ordered these once I learned my instructor had the same set and was happy with them.  The set works well.  My head is a bit small so I have the free larger padding on order to be received this week.  This should prevent the occasional slippage I experience today.  Overall the price for this was less than Bose delivery was next day and I think I ended up with a comparable product.
5,Noise cancelling won't make it completely quiet but you don't really want that.  Its good to hear the engine.  It does a very good job.  I recommend turning it off for takeoffs though.Sound quality for music is very good in my opinion but I haven't used that in flight.  When noise cancelling is on music can sound a little "funny".  Almost like digital garbling but it's minor.  Maybe it's a quirk with my particular headset.My instructors headset gives off wind noise but my headset gives off no wind noise.  I sound really crisp and clear.
5,I have had my pilots license for several years and have about 150hrs of flying time. I have wanted a quality headset for years but never justified the expense. I finally decided to pull the trigger and purchase this Zulu3 headset and I am so glad that I did. I researched and compared this headset with the Bose and decided on this headset simply because of the cheaper price and raving reviews. It has not disappointed. It's comfortable has Bluetooth and has amazing audio quality. If you are debating whether to get this or a cheaper headset don't. The quality of this headset will last you years and it's worth the investment if you will be flying for a long time.
5,I’m a student pilot currently taking three lessons a week. My flight instructor has this same headset and he let me try his one time during a flight. I was sold. Well worth the money. Very comfortable and durable. The noise cancellation is fantastic yet you can still hear the engine / prop at a comfortable background like level. The ability to pair a Bluetooth device is a nice plus.
4,This is an excellent headset and in terms of noise cancellation performance in the steady state I cannot tell it apart from the Bose A20. Some reviewers have complained about the length of the mic boom but that was not a problem for me. I wear glasses (Oakley steel plate) and those didn't pose a problem either. The seal around the ear was just as intact with glasses as without with no perceptible difference in noise.Unfortunately the one thing that didn't work was bad enough to force me to return it. Turning my head to look over my shoulder was causing the seal to open ever so slightly and increasing the noise level significantly. Even a 45 degree turn of the head did it. As a student pilot I don't need any additional distractions.I understand there might be anatomical factors specific to me that cause this so YMMV.There is one other minor issue -- the volume control is too plasticky and the slider has a bit of lateral play which doesn't feel like a premium product.
5,Serious upgrade from my David Clarks.  I don't use the Bluetooth so I can't comment on that  but the noise canceling is awesome they are light and comfortable and they amplify the radio audio a bit. Stereo is great with Garmin  3D audio and they auto shut off after 5 minutes of silence so if you forget to turn them off it won't kill the battery.
5,The Zulu 3 are a great headset. I’m a student pilot with around 40 hours and the Zulu 3 have made a tremendous difference in my radio comms. I know it’s just packaging but the unboxing is a great experience in itself. The semi hard shell case offers great protection from repeated trips in and out my flight bag/backpack. Of I ever swap to another set these will make a great headset for the right seat.
5,My husband always swore by David Clark headsets but when I started flying with him the pressure from the David Clarks would give me a headache within 10 minutes which made me feel so nauseated. After much research we found that the Lightspeed Zulu's had the least pressure on the head. I am extremely happy with my headset (actually the Zulu 2) and have been using it for over 5 years (longest flight 2.5 hours with no issues). When my husband flies without me he found he preferred to use my headset! So this pair he purchased for himself and is very happy. The only difference I can tell between the Zulu 2 and 3 is that the cable in the 3 is nylon braided and more flexible (no big deal for me). I'm sure there are other upgrades which you can research for yourself. The battery life is excellent. The only negative I can think of (and I'm reaching I still think it's a 5 star headset) is that since the headset is so light on the ears that the "seal" is broken easily. So wearing chunky sunglasses that pushes the ear cushions out do interfere with sound quality even yawning big disrupts the seal momentarily. Sometimes when we are taxiing with the windows down the wind/air pressure difference causes the seal to not be ideal. However we are still able to communicate without difficulty during these times. Seems to me it's a trade off - I require the very light pressure on my head (as opposed to a headset with more pressure where the seal would not be broken) and we are definitely Zulu customers for life!
5,Great headset for general aviation. First class customer support from Sarasota Avionics so if you have a choice order it from them...7 months later: March 2021 I still find this to be an excellent headset however I am having issues as an instructor moving from one airplane to the next at my local airport it will not work in a particular skylane that I fly that has a G750 set up I'm not sure of the exact model/type of headset jacks that were used but it has the standard aviation jacks plus the single point Jack also all controlled by the G750 which gives you excellent control over all four headset positions however the way the Zulu 3 is made with the extra segment on the mic plug it does not contact the jack properly in this particular airplane and it'll shut down the whole headset system to where I can't hear the radio or communicate with any other position on the intercom.  Sometimes you can find the sweet spot by pulling the Mike side out maybe an eighth of an inch but it usually doesn't stay there due to vibration.
5,I am glad I did not buy bose. Saved me $300.00 and the ear cup has superior fit. The features are great. ANR is superb. The overall look and fit is great a little heavier. But hey! it's stronger! not plasticky feeling. The hard case protects really well. I see no difference in sound quality from this headset and bose. 7 years warranty. I called both brands just to check the "response" to warranty. Lightspeed a girl responded right away my call (here in the USA). Gave me all info I asked in case the headset goes bad. Great service on that. bose on the other hand made me wait way more to have a guy from india tell me the warranty is for 5 years. where to send? didn't even bother to ask. Didn't like that at all. I am very happy with my Lightspeed Zulu! It's an awesome head set. The price is unbeatable! It's  the best headset out there. You are buying value! Go Speedlight! beat bose! I love that!
1,Bought this upon entering flight school as a gift from my parents. The gift really was learning to deal with extremely poor customer service. (On amazons part as well.)Upon first use on my very first flight the noise canceling created a high pitch crackle inthe left earpiece. Amazon directed me to the vendor who promptly told me that they couldn't help.  Amazon does not give out any information so my only recourse was to return the product so they could try to repair it. Why would I send a brand new pair of $950 to be repaired??? However due to it high cost Amazon and the vendor don't offer a replace option.Due to the fact that I can't be without the headset during my flight traininv I tried to call the vendor who are supposedly real pilots so that I could explain the situation. Was never able to get a hold of anyone. I recieved email responses saying that I didn't leave the order number in the messages I left so they couldn't get back to me. If you can send an email you can make a phone call...Long story short I had to pay an additional $950 to have them send me another pair. I'm currently using the broken headset without the noise canceling feature which is extremely difficult. The audio isn't great and now you have all the background noise of the cockpit. The perfect combination for someone new to airport communications...All in all an aweful experience. Even if the new headset works perfectly I will never purchase from this vendor again.
5,Bought these for my wife who is a student pilot.  She loves them and when I told her we could replace them if she were unhappy she said "No way".  She loved these.They don't cause pressure in her head or ears and the sound is clear.  The noise reduction is superb.I will definitely buy them for her passengers as well.  Yea!!!
5,I bought a PFX previously and had to return it because of the problematic noise cancellation.  The Zulu 3 retains the same high quality workmanship that I liked in the PFX but the noise cancellation works fine.  The cancellation does not seem to be as aggressive as the PFX.  I am using these in a Van's RV-6.  My cockpit is very loud with both low frequency engine noise plus high frequency wind sound.  The Z3 does a very good job.  The clamping force seems a fair amount higher than the Bose and these headsets feel heavier than Bose.  Neither is remotely objectionable.  The higher clamping force is better I think for the higher noise environment.The ear cup is the largest I have personally used.  My ears are pretty big yet there is ample room.The headsets also work fine for music listening.  I would not mistake them for even moderate quality audiophile headsets but for listening to music while flying along they are fine -- noticeably better than most.  I did not do an A-B immediate comparison but my perception is they sound a modest amount better than Bose.At this point I have flown 10 hours with these headsets.  Definitely happy with them.  In contrast I have flown 500 hours with Bose headsets over the years. Bose are fine headsets no question.  I got the Lightspeeds instead of Bose because I think they are better for a really high noise environment and the Lightspeed seems sturdier.  For a quieter cockpit I might get the Bose instead because of the lighter weight and lower clamping force.  I am saying both those qualities without double checking the measured values for the two.  That is just my subjective perception.
5,I’m a new pilot and these headphones were highly recommended.  I was about to order the new Bose for about $250 more but after reading ALL the reviews decided to go with the Lightspeed and definitely don’t regret it
2,Lol when you buy a $900 headset supposedly comparable to Bose but the mic stops functioning after 48 hours and the customer service number is non functional.I feel like I’m on punk’d. When it was working for the one flight I had it functioning it worked like a charm. Not feeling too confident in this company or headset after the mic stopped working after 48 hours though. Make sure you know lost comm procedure if you’re gonna run this headset all I’m going to say.
5,I love the braided lines as they don’t get all tangled up. Noise cancellation and volume control is awesome even under full throttle in the airplane.
5,As an FAA Designated Flight Examiner I get in and out of a lot of different airplanes. Over the first few weeks of use it seems they are going to work well. The "rope" plug-in cord makes it easy to adapt to the various plug-in locations on different planes. I needed a headset that is rugged and this fit the bill. The ANR is terrific.
3,I will start by commending the sellers and manufactures customer service. It was top notch and they stayed on top of everything.  However the problem I was experiencing was never resolved and resulted in me returning the headset.  When picking out a new headset I narrowed it down to the zulu 3 and bose a20.  With the Zulu 3 being recently released and the great reviews I decided to save a little money and go Zulu 3.  When the headset arrived I was impressed with packaging and build.  It was comfortable to wear and the ANR worked great. However whenever I played music via Bluetooth from myiPhone I would get this horrible echo that made the music inaudible and destroyed the vocals. After sending it in once to Lightspeed they told me I shouldn't be hearing that and sent me a replacement headset within the same week.  When the second headset arrived.  Same issue.  Sent it back in and after a few days Lightspeed called to say that the only thing they can figure is that the Bluetooth antenna they use in their headsets is older and probablyThe cause of not transmitting the music as clearly one should expect. I was told they are looking to address this in future models but that they designed this headset with the ATC communications in mind and not so much the music.  So I returned the headset purchased the Bose A20 and low and behold - beautiful music sound in addition to the great ANR and comfort. A bose headset that was released a year or two ago is able to better transmit Bluetooth music than a Zulu 3 headset that was released a few months ago.  Makes no sense to me.So in conclusion if I didn't want to listen to music on long haul x countries I would go with the Zulu 3. The ANR and comfort is just as comfortable and good as the bose.  But the music feature lacks.  Lightspeeds customer service is fast and friendly!  Very fast!  So I commend them on that. But not so much on being able to provide a resolution to my problem.  Bose A20 all the way!! It's worth the money.
3,I absolutely love this headset I just have a few things that I don't like so I can't justify giving it 5 stars.1) Price - a thousand dollars is a lot of money and to me a headset doesn't really seem like that is justified. If I didn't consider this a major investment in my future as a pilot I would not have purchased these.2) The length of the mic - it is NOT LONG ENOUGH! When the headset is sitting comfortably on my head the mic rests against the CORNER of my mouth NOT THE CENTER!! Because of this the mic does NOT ALWAYS pick up every word I say it's almost like I have to half shout to make sure I am being picked up by the mic.3) The length of the cord - I love the cord it's a great braided cable that doesn't feel like it will break soon but it is NOT LONG ENOUGH! I fly in a 172 and when I plug it in I rest the control panel in the side flap and it barely has enough length to reach up to my head.Conclusion - for a thousand dollars I really don't think these problems should exist. BUT the headset is just too damn comfortable too damn quiet and the mic/audio quality is just too damn good for me to return it I just like it too much! Maybe in ten years or whenever the next gen comes out they will fix these issues and lower the price because I love them as is and if these problems were fixed they would be absolutely perfect!!!!
5,If you are in the market for a top of the line General Aviation headset the Lightspeed Zulu 3 deserves your consideration. The performance of this headset is superb and the company backs up the product with warranty customer support repairs wear item replacement (at cost) and more. The only other headset in the same ballpark is the Bose and they are even more expensive.Has Bluetooth connection plus auxiliary cable connection so you can use your phone or listen to music with options for priorty of incoming calls or headset activity. ANR sound attenuation is startling in effectiveness. Mic bias/gain is adjustable. Earpads quite large soft comfortable superb quality materials. Interchangeable top head strap cushions for different head sizes or clearance issues with cockpit headroom. The volume/control pod is well made works well and is well designed. It even has an option to reduce the brightness of the LED indicators for night time use. The Zulu 3 is a pleasure to use in every way and makes flying - even in loud GA aircraft - a pleasure.The one downside to this kind of quality is the price. To be honest it should not be priced as high as it is but it is hard to argue with how well it performs...
5,excellent in my opinion I have several sets of Bose which are top of the line these in my opinion are just as good!  and they are 150-200 less in price
4,I compared this headset to the DC ONE X and I prefer the lighter David Clark headset. I am sure both will protect your hearing but I found the DC more comfortable.
5,I use this headset professionally in a noisy turboprop. Honestly for the $$ and battery life this version is better than the ZULU PFX (slightly better ANR huge battery box less battery life) and the fact it had the same type of cord as the Zulu PFX is a plus.My original ZULU us still serviceable but the rubber/plastic cord is failing after 10 years so no worries about durability....I do notice that the sound quality (Bluetooth) isn't quite as good as the original ZULU or the ZULU PFX but that is nitpicking IMO since radio/intercom use is just as fantastic as ever.Big plus is the "soft touch" coating that would get gummy on the battery boxes has been discontinued so no need to remove it yourself with solvent after 5 years or so.Try one on like sneakers some will like the feel of one brand better than others.
4,I bought these and the David and Clark One-X.  I'm a PPL student and I did 2 maneuver and 2 XC flights in each.The ZULU 3's did have good ANR and overall noise reduction was quite good.  The sliders on the volume control make it easy to adjust the volume to a comfortable level.Of the top three ANR headsets (Bose D&C and Lightspeed) these are the heaviest and they gave the tightest squeeze.  They are still much lighter and a lighter squeeze than any of the passive headsets I've tried but that was the main reason I chose a different headset in the end.
5,This baby does exactly what it says it will.  The ANC is great the fit is super comfortable and the Bluetooth was easy to set up and user friendly.I only have about 10 hours with it but I’m very happy this far.
5,Student pilot. The school provides some dinky el-cheapo passive headsets with their rental fleet. The school's headsets work but they clamp way too hard (hurts my ears) and are not durable (always falling apart). Had to buy a real headset to keep my sanity.The Zulu 3's are not cheap but they are well-constructed. They are incredibly light and you can barely feel them once you have them on. No idea how well the ANR stacks up to the competition but the cockpit of my SportCruiser was quiet and peaceful enough for me while wearing these.ATC and I can hear each other very well no issues. My cockpit partner says I sound great as well.One negative I would say is that Bluetooth music sounds washed out but I didn't really buy these as audiophile headphones so I'm not going to dock any points. You should be more worried about your surroundings and flying the airplane than how well Taylor Swift sounds while you're on your XC.
5,Just received my Zulu 3's yesterday. Though I haven't had a chance to use them I am extremely satisfied with them thus far.  The case is very nice it's packaged well and the shipping was very fast!(I took advantage of the two day shipping for an extra 5.99). The headset is made very well its very comfortable and looks fantastic!! The new cord will be nice as it isn't very stiff and comes with a shirt clip. The controller is just the right size and easy to operate.  I was a little nervous the mic boom would be to short but that is not the case at all it is just fine.I'm sure the Bose is a nice headset but to me the materials seem to be a little cheaper on it. With the Zulu 3's it came with Bluetooth without the extra price and from what I have heard in the past the customer service for Light speed is better. And love how Light speed stands behind their product with a 7 year warranty!!!  Cant wait to try them in the 172!
5,I really debated about buying the Zulu or the Bose. I feel pretty good about the decision. I really like the fact they have added the Kevlar cord! It protects it very well. For the same price as the Bose I think it might be the better choice. I flew with the Bose for a while and it is better noise cancelling barely. But the overall value of the Zulu is better. I have about 150 hours so far with the Zulu and it has not disappointed one bit!
5,I got this when I started flying about a year ago and I've flown 180+ hours with it. It's comfortable even for long amounts of time the noise cancellation is superb and I love how clear both coms and bluetooth audio sound. I even tried a Bose A20 during one flight (because my backseat passenger's A20 plugs couldn't fit in the Piper Archer's rear headset ports and mine could) and found that the Zulu 3 audio quality is much better IMO.  The braided cable is also great never been tangled and seems very strong and durable. If I have one complaint it's that the switch for mono/stereo is under the batteries in the battery compartment so if you switch between planes with mono and stereo COM panels be sure to plan ahead and carry a paperclip. For most pilots though this shouldn't be an issue.
5,As a student pilot I was not in a position to purchase the Bose A20 however whilst doing research into ANR headsets the Lightspeed was well liked in the market. I spoke to a few pilot colleagues who all suggested it as a great alternative to the more expensive A20.Having completed a vast number of hours in the air now I find the headset comfortable over long periods the clarity is great and the mic crisp and clear.I rarely use the bluetooth function however it has worked great when I have.
5,I have about 40 hours on them now. I've just replaced the batteries that came with the headset. Without the ANC turned on they are still pretty quiet though I would highly recommend keeping the ANC on. They don't clamp your head like the David Clarkes my flight school loans out.
5,Love these noise canceling headphones.  Reduces a lot of the plane noise so you hear radio communications better and it does not pick up any noise through the mic when talking.  Cheaper than Bose too! Comes with a nice carrying case just be careful to store the headphones correctly so you don’t pinch a cord. I will never  go back to regular headsets.
5,I have two of these bad boys now and they are both super solid and incredibly comfortable headsets.  The noise cancellation is amazing and when you turn it on after starting the plane and initially hearing the loud engine noise it's like stepping into a quiet room.  Lightspeed support has been amazing with an older model headset that my father needed refurbished.  Definitely register the product and I have no doubt Lightspeed will support your purchase far into the future.
3,I purchased the Zulu 3 when I started working toward my instrument and commercial ratings 14 months ago. My David Clarks were still in great shape after several years but I figured it was time to try a "better" ANR headset. I was initially happy with the Zulu 3. The sound quality is good the construction seemed solid they are comfortable battery life is good and they have a good feature set.However a few weeks ago I noticed that the ear seals were coming apart at the seams and the coating is starting to crack and peel. I contacted Lightspeed customer service convinced that this would be considered a defect even though the soft parts of the headset are considered wear and tear items not covered by the warranty. I was surprised to find out that this is considered normal wear and tear and that Lightspeed would be happy to sell me a new set for $30.Next year I'll begin flying into some remote rugged areas and I've got real concerns about the durability of this headset when I start using it in those conditions considering it's falling apart after a little over a year of light to moderate use. Based on my experience I can't recommend the Lightspeed Zulu 3 for durability or customer service.
5,Coming from an inexpensive passive headset these were a night and day difference. No longer fatigued after a couple hours in a small piston single. They don't squeeze my head nearly as much as my last set and they don't give me a head ache after 2+ hours in the cockpit. I bought these while training for my instrument rating and they were well worth it.Only negative is Bluetooth audio quality is some what lacking but that isn't what I bought them for nor is it worth the 400 premium compared to the other premium headsets available.
5,Earcups are very comfortable and spacious. Noise cancellation is superb and the clarity is unmatched. I would recommend these to anyone serious about flying. The benefits outweighed the costs. I wish I had started with these but then I wouldn't know the difference. Excellent all the way around.
5,My son wearing his new lightspeed zulus.  In the air over Traverse City and this headset is game changing.  After using many different ones we bought these.  Instructors said Bose was the "must have" but my son is big 6"3 and needed something with the right fit.  These are perfect according to him.  Noise cancellation was excellent and comfort was the best!  No headache feeling after wearing for hours covers his ears completely and doesn't pinch.  So happy we spent the money on these.  Worth every penny even on a tight budget.
5,There are many lower cost headsets on the market but you won't find any that out perform the Lightspeed Zulu 3.  The blue tooth capability allows me to use the "voice" option of my aircraft checklist contained on my tablet.  The intercom and radio communications are flawless.  The Kevlar cables prevent kinks and cuts.  I've tried Bose and  David Clark but they simply don't compare to the Lightspeed Zulu 3.  I highly recommend this headset.  They may cost more but you get what you pay for and they have an industry leading warranty.
5,So far so good. Been used in turbine powered aircraft and ithey cancel noise very well. Have not used it in a piston powered aircraft yet but I'm guessing it'll be just as good. Looking forward to finding out. The Bluetooth is a nice feature if you want to spend the money to get it. It pairs up easily and mutes the music when incoming ATC calls occur. Overall I'm very happy with this product.
4,I have several Bose A20s and a couple of these for our aircraft (airplane and a helicopter). Noise canceling is better in Zulu hence we use them in a helicopter (R44) but bluetooth is noisy in both and the way they manage mic feedthrough is not great - in A20 when you talk while on the phone over BT Bose feeds through part of your voice into the earpieces which makes for a very natural experience similar to what you would have when just talking without headphones. Zulu doesnt do that so you feel like talking with earplugs in.
5,Great headset very comfortable and with very effective ANR.  The battery pack and volume control is on the cord and it’s a little awkward as to where to place it so that it doesn’t get bumped around but it’s a minor inconvenience.
5,I’ve just started flyingworking towards my private pilot certificate. I’ve been using the headset the school has and they were a bit noisy and the sound quality was just ok. I now have the Zulu 3 headset and was blown away by the sound quality. When you turn on the noise canceling button the sound from the 172 engine goes away. They are also very comfortable . I would definitely recommend this product.
5,I looked at a lot of headsets and it was time to spend the money to get a very good one.  I decided on the Zulu 3 based on recommendations from others and I am not disappointed.  Great sound easy to use easy to pair with my iPad for alerts and VERY comfortable to wear.  I cannot express enough how happy I am with this purchase!
4,Awesome headset ANR works great and it’s super comfortable.My biggest complaint is that the carrying case is just a bit too small for the battery pack/control unit. I always feel like I’m kinking the cables when I pack it up. I’m not real worried about the cables with their Kevlar braiding but I bought this headset to use for the next decade or more and I know it will take its toll eventually.
5,I have flown for 40 plus years now and have owned and worn out many headsets over the years.  So  far this is hands down the better of the ones I have used from cheap to high end as far as sound quality and noise cancellation works.  I can't speak to durability of product yet due to only using twice so far.We'll see how long they last.  May last longer than me.  One note I am anxious to  see how they work in turbine versus piston noise cancellation.
4,Very good sound dampening. Makes flying my LOUD Glasair very tolerable. The cheaper headsets I used for years in Cessnas couldn't do the job but this one does. I found some radio calls hard to hear until I bought this now no problem. The bluetooth feature allows me to hear my phone through the headsets so I can call for clearances after the run-up at non-tower fields. Comes with excellent hard-shell case. Will be buying a second for the passenger side.
5,EXCELLENT!!  I had no previous bias with these type headphones and the Zulu 3 is the comparable model to the Bose A20's.  There is no doubt in my mind these are every bit equal to the Bose and are 250.00 less.  I honestly have used both of them as a new pilot and I actually prefer te Zulu 3's.  They are more comfortable on the ears I like the headband better the mike is more versatile and there is no difference in the noise cancellation.  Save the 250.00 and get these!
1,bought this product yet two weeks after we got headset left ear started putting out loud share sounds into ear. attempted to correct condition and no response tried in different plane still put out obnoxious sounds. Called customer service and they gave us run around for two weeks then took back head set and still did not work on return same problem. Call amazon and returned headset and got money back. Not happy though litespeed was good company. Will not buy from them again.
5,Career pilot.  Highly recommend this product.  Great sound and noise cancelling.  I have David Clarks as well and this product is as good.
5,I was using a cheaper headset before this and after a few hours my head started to hurt. I fly 6-8 hours a day and by the end of the day I had to take an aspirin. Not anymore this headset is amazing. It's light and comfortable. I can wear it all day and it's fine. Also the Kevlar cord is great I have shut my door on it more than once and its still fine. I am really happy I went with this headset.
5,I absolutely love this headset! Great noise canceling a very comfortable fit and the cord is awesome for CFIs who are always jumping in and out of different airplanes. If you spend a lot of time in airplanes this is by far a worthy investment on your ears. Additionally I believe it contributes greatly to improving safety of flight with crisp clear communications. I catch pretty much every radio call made even when I'm in the middle of instructing. Of course there are many other great features that come with the Zulu 3 as well.
4,Compared to Bose A20 this has slightly higher noise when the outside is quiet and is putting slightly more forces on my head (both heavier and stronger clamp). The earcup is also significantly bigger making it quite awkward to wear outside the cockpit which I do sometimes (the subway is actually pretty noisy).I decided that the price difference is worth it for the Bose A20 YMMV.
4,Overall the Zulu 3’s are an amazing option especially for the price. My only gripe is that the Bluetooth quality is poor when I play music connected to Bluetooth it sounds tinny but when connected with an aux cord it’s too notch.
5,This is my second Lightspeed headset. I tried the Bose A20 and prefer the Lightspeed Zulu 3’s fit and feel over the A20’s.
5,When I bought my plane it came with a pair of Sierra. I like them and bought The Zulu for my primary. Very happy with
5,I regret not buying this immediately when I started flying this completely changed my flight experience and got rid of the headaches I used to get after extended flights. Not to mention that the Bluetooth feature makes listening to music extremely easy on long cross country flights and does not interfere at all with the intercom.  I am moving from David Clark's 10-13.4 and the Zulus blow them them out of the water.  I liked it so much that I purchased a Zulu original as well for my passenger headset
5,I bought this headset during a promotion so the price was about 75 off retail making it a little easier to digest.  This is my 4th lightspeed headset so I knew the quality would be great and they would last a long time.  The older headsets move to the back seat and co-pilot.  They are still going strong!  Over the years I have found customer service to be good.
5,Headset is amazing!!  The noise reduction is so effective I recommend that you turn it off during takeoff until you reach pattern altitude because you won't be able to hear the engine if it's making a sound you need to know about (or not making that reassuring full power sound). Listening to music on my iPhone worked great.  The cancelling feature worked very well on a recent 400 mile cross country.I never missed microsecond of any radio traffic while listening to music.
5,A lot of thanks! Great headset and very quick delivery!
5,They’re incredibly comfortable noise cancellation works almost too well and very durable. The audio quality is great except for playing music via Bluetooth. It has a bit of a twang to it. All other aspects are A-1 on all accounts.
5,Literally used this for the first time today and I absolutely loved it. The noise cancellation is awesome bluetooth was stupid simple to set up forgot I had them on nearly they were so comfy and the quality seems really good.  Anyone looking for a new or an upgraded headset I would recommend this set. Of course its my first time out with the Zulu 3s but I have no doubt in them.
5,Dont listen to the idiot who said the cord was too short unless you're sitting 5 feet away from your plugs you'll be fine.Great ANR for the money. Pack some AA batteries if you're on a trip.
5,Excellent alternative to Bose A20. Good quality and solid build battery consumption is great too Duracell batteries on my A20s gave me 4days with Bluetooth music etc. lightspeed 3 gives approx 2weeks
5,I've been using this in a C172 and have been thrilled. The battery life has been excellent the noise cancelling performs better than I had hoped and the additional bluetooth and recording capabilities are all a nice bonus. Shipped promptly received as expected all at a competitive price.
5,These replaced a set of Bosr A20s.  I wear them on a daily basis and have not had any issues.  The noise cancellation is great both passive and active.  They are very comfortable even for long flights more so than my A20s.  I will be buying another set for my wife.
5,I fly pipeline patrol and am in the cockpit 7 hours a day. I used to get so tired with my passive noise reduction and my head hurt from headset discomfort. NOT ANYMORE!!! Love this headset.
5,I'm a student pilot. I struggled with communication. Tower ground even getting ATIS. I was starting to think I was getting dumb in my old age. I promised myself a better headset once I passed my written knowledge test. These things are incredible! I can hear everything so clearly now. I'm not listening to music yet but I look fwd to that too. The blue tooth is cool.
5,We have four Zulus the Zulu three being the newest.  They have provided superb service.  We recently upgraded to a Garmin 345GTX ADS-B in/out transponder.  The shop which performed the installation indicated that some owners with other ANR headsets including Bose had noise from the GTX 345 injected into the headset but this is not a problem with the Zulu.
5,Nothing more to say about this generation of headset other than AWESOME!  I have no issues with the boom on the mic being too short.  Overall a 5 in comfort 5 for audio and a 5 for finish.  Great product at a excellent price.  This is 3rd set....now I just need one more and I will have Lighspeed Zulu all around!
5,All I can say is WOAH! The Zulu 3 has crystal clear sound  is super comfortable has a 7-year warranty a Kevlar braided cable and amazing ANR. (in my opinion better the the Bose A-20) Lightspeed has outdone themselves with the Zulu 3. Highly recommend!
4,Nice headset - I have to wear a ballcap in order to get the headset to fit properly. Otherwise it feels like its slipping off my head to the rear. I guess I have a smaller head.
5,This is my second Light speed Headsetduring my moving process I have misplaced my original headsetso I have several David Clark headset's but none have the clarity that Light speed has so I purchased another one.Thank you Light speed.Ray
3,Great headphones !!! But I couldn’t register for the warranty because it says that the barcode is not valid. But really comfortable to use and it’s a good buy.
3,Comfortable headset with good sound quality.  One of the reasons I wanted it was the Flightlink app that enables voice recording.  Unfortunately the app has a fatal flaw in that when converting the files  to M4A format for easy listening and sharing the files get deleted!  Tech support says they are aware and "working on it".  Meantime I lost some important files!
1,Was excited to try it out after reading all the reviews.  Plugged into the aircraft.  Pilot to pilot comm was great.  Turned on the noise cancellation and heard continuous thumping.  Closed the windows and adjusted the headset and the thumping did not go away.  Turned off the headset and was barely able to hear incoming transmissions from ATIS or other aircraft.  Contacted Lightspeed.  They rep said that it may be an issue with the mono/stereo dip switch and possibly the shape of my head so they would send out taller pads.  I lowered the ear muffs and the thumping was only audible when I turned my head.Paired it to my phone and Ipad to test the bluetooth audio and Foreflight but the audio volume was so faint that it reminded me of taking an audiogram at a military clinic.  Clearly defective out of the box.  Aside from not working they are really comfortable.
5,Spent $850. Didn’t regret once. Highly recommend. Makes life so much better. If I could go back and I was shopping for a headset I’d buy another without thinking twice.
5,Amazing sound and comfort. Just plug them in and go. Have put thousands of miles in then in a short period of time and they have never let me down. You can get different sized pads for the top to make the fit even better. Worth every penny.
5,Possibly the best headset in the market. Everything works as advertised and they look strong enough to last a very long time. Very comfortable.
5,These are great  They work great and are comfortable
5,Great sound quality talking to ATC and ground. Bluetooth works well for calls and music on those long flights.
5,This is my first Active Noise Cancelling headset I am impressed with how well it works. The auto-shutoff feature saves batteries too. This is a first-rate product.
5,It was between this or the bose A20's. Just couldn't justify the extra cost of this headset. First flight I did with them was a 5.6 hour day. Very comfortable and I really enjoyed the noise cancelling. I had been using the same headset for about 10+ years. Great value!
5,Noticeably more comfortable than our early-generation Bose A20s.  Bluetooth audio works seamlessly with an ipad for entertainment and alerts from Foreflight.  I've bought a second set and relegated the A20s to the back seats.
5,The best!!
5,Awesome headset! Highly recommend it! Very comftorable noise canceling is really great!
5,so far so good.  We will see how they hold up over time....
4,Noise cancellation is not as good as Bose 20
5,Great fit. Audio is crisp and clear. Microphone is crisp and clear. Bluetooth works well with phone.  Battery life is longer than you will fly on a leg....
2,I purchased a Lightspeed Zulu 3 on August 16th Great comfort very good sound.  This is my second lightspeed and I had a great experience with the first reasoning for my second purchase. First headset: It made a horrible chirping noise in both ears this got so loud i could not hear radio transmissions.  got it repaired sent back then it had same issue again. Lightspeed then replaced the headset. This second headset does not do the chirp noise however has a constant static as if a phone is right next to the ear cup causing interference. My old lightspeed never had a single issue however I can not catch a break with the new Zulu 3
5,Tried as many noise cancelling sets as possible at OshKosh. These came out on top in every test.  I could not be happier with this purchase.
5,Great headset very comfortable and the ANR rocks7/7/17 UPDATE-  I have about 50 hours in these.  Everything still works great.  I've been flying in a fairly noisy cockpit a PA-18 Super Cub and it's crystal clear to the ears.  Glad I saved some money over the Bose.
3,Great quality and noise cancellation but uncomfortable for anyone with a larger-than-average head. The connecting headband presses into my head and hurts after an hour of usage.
4,Comfortable. Quiet. Durable.  Battery friendly.  One set of rechargeable last about 20 hours.  A bit heavy.  A bit costly.
5,ANC works great on a DA-40. Slight thumpy noise with the little window flaps open but once closed up it's very quiet. Build quality is great. Clamp force can be adjusted by gently bending the top band slightly. Comfortable with very nice build quality.
5,Softest ear pads on the planet. ANR amazing; ATC crystal clear. Can be comfortably used with a ball cap. Now the best part of flying is talking on the radio.
5,I had never used noise cancelling heatsets before--amazing.  They are very comfortable & really change the sound of the airplane.  I will have to learn what is the "normal" sound of my 182 all over again.
5,What a huge step up from my old DC head clamp.  Amazing comfort and quiet.
5,These headsets seem to be higher quality than the previous model time will tell. They are more comfortable and quieter so far very happy with the purchase.
4,Good product. Not as good as the bose especialy the mic part. It was not as impressive as I thought
5,They’re very light and comfortable.
1,The headset fits fine but I immediately realised the microphone boom is too short. In a noisy environment as a cockpit you need the mic in front of the mouth but with this headset the best I can do is put it on the side and i have to work the boom stretched straight otherwise would sit on my cheek.I still have to try it on the plane but it's obvious that this will be a problem and it is also a pretty poor design for such an expensive headset; I will probably end up having to yell in the microphone.I will ask for a refund and I don't recommend this product at all. Save your money for something else.Yes they are comfortable and ANR works great but if you can't talk to tower decently it's a completely useless headset better a cheap passive one with a longer mic boom.
5,If you’re not sure- buy it. Won’t regret. As a full time CFI- I’ve noticed an improvement in my hearing after using this device. Don’t tell my wife though.
4,So far so good. My only complaint is the mic can only be worn on the left side.
5,Most comfortable headset money can buy
5,My husband is a CFI & needed a good headset for daily use. He absolutely loves his Lightspeed Zulu 3! It's lightweight & comfortable.
1,This was a horrible experience- the headset arrived with no bubble wrap to protect the headset and the box it came in. When I opened it up I found that on of the ear covers was hanging off by a wire. it was also very over priced- i paid almost $950 including taxes for it originally. I returned the headset and bought one directly from Lightspeed and they were great! only paid $850 and it came with all sorts of free goodies- portable charger wireless earbuds and $50 gift card for SiriusXM
5,Awesome headset for my job in an aircraft!
2,I bought these for flight school and the left side it’s going out only after 5 uses now I have to return them and get something quick!
5,I like most features.
5,Great choice
5,Sturdy Good Noise Cancellation features and mic works perfectly.  As a side note on bluetooth the mic noise cancellation is incredible as well.
5,Nice
1,I bought this after I owned my Bose for about 3 years - wanted to check cheaper competition. Well let me tell you it is NO competition. Just tried it again yesterday and today and audio doesn't work. Usual check done - batteries different headsets in the same plugs etc. It is the headset. Not even a year old. My advice spend another 3 hundred bucks and buy Bose for quality. Used to fly Aztec now B58
5,Have a pair of zulu Bose A20 and the new zulu3 i think they will be another quality unit from lightspeed which has great customer service.
5,Excellent product. Love it!
5,Very comfortable headset with great noise cancellation and audio. Very happy
5,Great head phones
5,great cables
5,Overall great product
5,In a word- WOW!  These work wonderfully.
5,better than my bose and 300 cheaper
5,Great build quality.  Sound great too
5,Great headset
5,Excellent headset for noise cancelation.
5,Great product and super fast shipping! Thanks!
5,Meets expectation and required standard.
5,Outstanding headset.  Super comfortable and quiet!
5,Everything is fine!
1,This aviation headset does not adjust to right side boom. It also does not say that it is not adjustable and allows its retailers to show pictures of the headset with the boom on the right side giving the purchaser the false impression that is is reversible.
1,The noise cancelling feature was terrible.  Very scratchy.  Amazon then charges a restocking fee.  Do not buy a headset from this vendor.
5,I bought this headset about half-way through my private training and it was a substantial upgrade over the david clarks I was using. I am now a CFI and use this headset daily and it is one of the best investments I have made. I used to get out of the plane with splitting headaches because of the clamping pressure but this went away with the lightspeeds. I can wear them for hours comfortably and forget I have them on. I have seen some reviews about premature wear but I have had this headset for almost 2 years and it does not show any signs of wear. A lot of my friends have the Bose A20's and this headset competes extremely well with it. I even swapped with my friend for a flight and struggled to find that much of a difference. The A20's are lighter but I felt that the large ear cups on the Zulu's distribute the pressure better. The materials are actually better on the Zulu-the A20 has much more plastic. However some people make a big deal out of this when it really isn't-provided you aren't gronk spiking your aviation headset into the ground. The braided cable is also a nice touch on the Zulu but once again not life changing. The Bluetooth feature works very easily and gets pretty loud. The com priority button on the control module is great as it automatically turns the music off whenever ATC says something. Overall I think this headset is a great investment if you plan on spending a lot of time in GA aircraft. I don't agree with the people saying passive headsets are just as good. The general consensus at my 141 flight school is that noise cancelling is almost a must for a CFI. The A20's are great if you have the money but I could not really find any reason to buy them over the Zulu 3's. I have recommended them to all of my friends looking to upgrade.
5,I had the Zulu 1s for my first solo all he way to my 1st-3rd job as a professional pilot put a few thousand hours on them traded for the Zulu 2s few thousand hours just got my 3s. Most of the planes I fly these days also have Bose A20s that come with the plane and live in the cockpit good for a spare but I prefer my Zulu. When I fly smaller loud bush planes or piston helicopters the larger ear cups on the really shine keeping the noise down.  I have about 5000hrs spanning zulu1s - 3s and I don’t see myself changing things up.  Also warranty wise mine have taken a few hits closing the cord in a door etc and lightspeed always took care of me.
5,I’m a flight instructor and have been flying with this headset for 4 years…it’s flaking a tiny bit around the ears from nonstop use but aside from that it works and feels just like the day I bought it. The Bose noise canceling is a hair better but not $200+ better. This is absolutely worth the $$ and their customer service is as good as the headset itself. If you’re serious about flying and want a top quality headset with fantastic customer support get this one!
5,This is just an outstanding GA headset.  The noise cancellation and comfort are outstanding and the price though substantial is reasonable for the level of performance it provides.We've owned 2 Lightspeed 25XL's for about 20 years since right after they came out and we've both loved them.  Light quiet very effective.  But they've been showing their age and recently Lightspeed stopped selling replacement parts for them.  I had another of the plastic parts break (the "wishbone" piece that holds the earcup on seems to be a weak point on the old one) and I was unable to sufficiently repair it this time.Therefore it was time to retire mine and I naturally looked at all the Lightspeed line since we'd been so happy with our 25XL's.  I'd tried Bose Sennheiser and a couple of the other even more expensive ones as well as a selection of the cheaper models out there.  All were lacking either in the noise cancellation or comfort departments.  Some substantially so and not necessarily in order of price.I looked at the entire Lightspeed line.  I don't need (nor want) the wireless features of the Tango and the PFX didn't impress me much for the extra $$$ what with the strange noise cancellation issues some have complained about online with that one.  I considered the Sierra but decided the savings weren't that large compared to the difference in the construction especially after I tried out my neighbor's Zulu recently in my airplane.So off went my order for the Zulu 3.  With the trade-up program they're pretty reasonable all things considered.I love this headset!  No it's not quite as light as the almost all-plastic XL series were but I hope that will translate into fewer chances to break something.  This thing feels like it's built like a tank.  But it's reasonably light as light as any of the premium headsets and the noise cancelling is second to none no matter what the other guys tell you even in my noisy 55-year-old Cessna.The comfort level is great even after a long flying day.  Yes you'll know you've been wearing a headset but if you take it off for a minute in the air you realize just how good a job it's doing at knocking out all that noise and you know it's worth it.  I wish these had been around when I was flight instructing back in the late 70's!So far my only complaint has had to do with the length of the cord.  The total length is fine but I'd like a few more inches of cord between the plugs and the control/battery box to make it easier to adjust things in my airplane.  At least they give you a really heavy-duty cord clip to carry that box's weight by clipping it to your clothing or shoulder belt.  In my case the geometry is such that if I were able to move that box about 6-8 inches higher on the cord things would be perfect.  But with the clip I can live with it for all the other advantages this guy provides.  This might not even be an issue in other airplanes.When my wife's Lightspeed 25XL (which she still likes better) dies or breaks unrepairably we'll be ordering another one of these for her.  She still prefers the feel of the 25XL but says this one is good too.  (I just hope the trade-up program lasts until then.)I have tested but don't use the Bluetooth connection capability since I don't listen to music or use the phone in the airplane but some may find it worthwhile.  It also includes a link to an iPad app that lets you record conversations on the radio and intercom.  Again it works but I don't use that feature as I don't see a purpose for it in my flying.Don't get stuck with a $1000 Bose you won't like as well as this one.  Try them all for sure but if you do I'll bet you'll end up with a Lightspeed Zulu 3.(By the way I didn't receive anything from Lightspeed for this review.  I purchased it at full price minus the trade-up discount for my old one.)
4,Great headsets! My primary headset is AKG AV100.  Also have Bose A20's but don't like those very much.  If comm quality is important to you then Lightspeed is the way to go.  Nobody makes anything that is as clear as these are.  Noise cancelling isn't as overpowering as the Bose.  The Bose headsets cut out just a little too much noise in my opinion.  It's a personal preference I know but I myself still like to be able to listen to the engine.  With the Bose I just can't hear the subtle changes.  Not an issue with the AKG or Lightspeed headsets.Now Lightspeed also has the best cable out there.  I HATE the cable on my AKG.  It's thin and tangles up too easily.  The Bose cable is too short for my setup and I have to clip it to my pants and it's annoying and awkward and the controller is always in the wrong spot.  Lightspeed nailed the cable and controller.It would be a 5 star set IF it sealed just a little bit better.  My girlfriend uses the Zulu 3's as they're her favorite but they don't quite seal all the time on her smaller head.  If she twists to look over her shoulder then these frequently lose that seal around the bottom of her ear. Maybe it's cuz she has a small head but these definitely are on the larger side for ear cups.  Not a huge problem just a slight inconvenience from time to time.Now I would buy these again but only as part of a trade-up program.  I was lucky enough to snag my AKG AV100's for just a couple hundred bucks on eBay.  I didn't want to spend the full $850 on the Zulu 3's but thanks to their awesome David Clark trade-up program I was able to get a couple hundred knocked off the Zulu 3's.  Totally worth it at that point.  Thanks Lightspeed! These are keepers for sure.
1,I had so much faith in zulu that I bought 3 headsets.  This year all my headsets started to decompose.  Cables breaking open  plastics like wet glue ear muffs falling apart.  When I called zulu to inquire about repairs I was told mine are not supported any more and can't be repaired.  The best they offered was 200.00 on trade.  Zulu wants 2400.00 to replace perfict performing headsets.  This is cosmetic problems.  Obviously poor design and poor quality of parts.  I find the trade in offer to be insulting.  I have 30 year old David Clark's and one bose that is 3 years older than these and they are performing like new.Zulu..  you need to support your customers better.  You need to live up to your claims about how durable your headsets are.I guess zulu headsets are disposable.  Be careful of purchasing the zulu 3.  One day you will find you need to throw them away..  I'm going with bose from now on.
5,for 7 yrs my set of Zulu's have taken it and taken it and continued to work through some very difficult conditions. I'm a flight instructor full time arriving at the airport at 5:00am and working through the day sometimes til 5:pm in the afternoon in heat that just would melt you.  I don't take good care of them. I don't put them back in the case. I don't gently fold the cord and put it in it's very nice supplied case. I do take the cord and stretch it around the headphones and throw it on the seat of the plane or back in my office in a drawer.  I deliberately started treating them that way because that's how I have to use them.  No time for me to be gentle. Sometimes they are left in the plane all day in the heat in direct sunlight (big mistake when you put them back on) and they have always worked perfectly.  The ear and head cushions do wear out but no faster than the Bose headset ear-cushions and when after 7yrs I sent them back to Lightspeed they replaced the cord the cushions the case to the electrics and the mic cover for a ridiculous $100.00 (post paid) I tried to hurt these headsets deliberately and they stood up to it all.  I'm able to compare them with Bose and Clarks because I'm in the air with different pilots in different airplanes all day at least 6 days a week in THE harshest conditions and these headsets sound as good for a lot less money than the nearest competitor and customer service is the best.  They will take more than you would believe possible and still keep providing reliable noise attenuation. Which is also unbelievable. Turn them on and all the noise just disappears. You can't loose with these.
4,If you are coming from a passive headset these will rock your world and clear up so much unneeded stress in the cockpit. My ears feel great after a normally noisy flight in an RV-12. I wish the cord was a little longer (maybe 6' more) and I wish there was some way to keep the plugs from hanging off the GA plug ins in our PA28. I'm worried the wires will wear out from the battery and ANR box hanging and swinging around in flight over the years. I'm just using the shirt clip it came with for now but this makes the cord another 8' shorter. Lastly I wish the boom could be on the right or left side. This isn't a major problem but as an instructor I fly a lot from the right side.All in all way better ANR than the famous Bose headsets and with a little more metal on them they feel like they'll be more withstanding to the rigors of a fast paced instructor.*Disclaimer I bought these direct from Lightspeed and not from amazon but I've never had any problems with Amazon's delivery or quality of higher end products.
5,I own several Bose A20's and X headsets and bought this because my ears were ringing after flying my Citabria 7GCBC (150 Hp Lycoming).  It was either get rid of the airplane or get a better headset.  I won't sacrifice my health and hearing is linked to health and longevity - don't take that lightly.  So I thought I'd give the Zulu a try.  It's definitely more effective than the Bose at keeping out noise and my ears don't ring after flying.  It's big and clunky nothing elegant about it but it protects my hearing so who cares about looks.  Kind of like 3 blade propellers..look cool on the ground but they all look the same when the engine's running and they're less efficient and cost more to buy and maintain.  So as the wise man said always make health your top priority because if you lose it you lose everything else.  This headset works better than the Bose at protecting my hearing so I recommend it.
1,Microphone failed in 1 year
5,I have 3 zulu3 ANR headsets and one Bose A20Both are excellent! I keep one of each in my cockpit and reach for the Lightspeed 99% of the time.That says a lot
5,I bought my first Lightspeed Zulu about 9 years ago and use it for towing gliders while flying Piper SuperCub and Pawnee tow planes--no mufflers.  A typical tow day includes 4-6 hours in the summer. The hearing protection is superb and the comfort is the best.I bought a Zulu 3 to use flying a corporate jet. The jet's cockpit environment is much more quiet than the towplanes but the flights are quite long. Again I greatly value the comfort. Also the BlueTooth enables the use of other devices while flying greatly enhancing information flow.Importantly the customer service is the best. Though I've only had to call them a couple times in 9+ years and several thousand hours flying time their response has been top-notch.I highly recommend Lightspeed Aviation.
1,Item came used and dirty :(
5,PLUS:1- New cord (PFX quality)2- Great ANR and Clarity (Clarity is the main reason I did not buy the Tango)3- Solid feel and looks4- 40 hours of use (compared to my PFX 20hrs)5- Great product at the right price point (I fly with PFX and Zulu 3 are perfect for passengers)  you don't have this variety with Bose this fact along with comfort was the reason I decided to fly with Lightspeeed. CONS:1- No clip ( I purchased a phone clip: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007CBSBM4/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) Works perfectly as it is very narrow fitting on either side so I am using it on the right  for Copilot and rear passenger and on the left for my rear passenger.  This way everybody can hang the unit on the right or left pocket accordingly.
5,Love the sound quality with ATC but the Bose has better sound quality for Sirius XM. Love the FlightLink and used it to record all my IFR training and other training with CFI’s so I have a library of great training audio I can use for review. I’m sure it save me $thousand in training and helped me advance faster in my flying work.
5,I had used a pair of the original Zulu in my very noisy Husky for about 8 years and they were getting rather grody. I learned of the trade up policy at Lightspeed and took advantage to buy a Zulu 3 replacement for the most forlorn of the pair. I have now had the good fortune to have used the Zulu 3 for about 30 hours between my copilot and myself (alternating with a Tango headset). I love this Zulu 3 headset!. They are light far more comfortable quieter and less twitchy than the originals. With very limited space in the front office of the Husky I like the wireless Tangos but for comfort reception and all around utility I would probably use the Zulu 3 if I didn't love my rear seat co-pilot so much. She loves them too.
5,No one could possibly ask for a better headset period! You will NOT find any headset equal in quality or brings to you better customer service thanLightspeed and their Zulu 3! There is no company or headset product that offers better quality or technology period. If you are lucky enough to reach Jan in Lightspeed customer service you will not find anyone with more knowledge than she has about her products and her competitions products.The Zulu 3 sets the bar so high that there is no competition. You can not beat the technology quality comfort price and customer service that Lightspeed and their Zulu 3 offers. Give them a ring and you will not be sorry. Tell Jan that Bruce from Fort Worth Texas asked you to give them a ring. You will have no regrets!
5,As an older pilot with some hearing loss at higher frequencies it is important to minimize noise and maximize the sound quality of incoming transmissions esp. from fast-speaking ATC.  The headsets fit nicely over my hearing aids.  Compared to my prior use of non-APR cheaper headsets I am able to hear calls clearly no longer occasionally missing a word or two or being unsure exactly what was transmitted.
5,Zulu 3 is a great headset.  Bought a second pair so I can use with my son while he is flying.  Great features.  I was most impressed with the active noise cancellation.  Very quite and the large earpads do a great job of sealing out noise without the active.  Although earpads are larger than I would have liked the headset is comfortable to wear and I'll make the tradeoff in noise reduction.  Nice 7 year warranty too.  Great customer service. Only feature I wish it had was for the mic to swivel either left or right.
5,In my opinion the best GA headset available.  It is extremely comfortable and the ANR is exceptional.  I upgraded from the original Zulu to the Zulu 3 so I have been flying with a Zulu headset for around 5 years.  The Bluetooth is great for listening to music on long cross countries and for calling for fuel while I'm taxiing to the hangar.  Most people can't even tell that I'm calling them from a loud cockpit with the engine running when I tell them that I'm still in the plane.  Highly recommended.
5,I have been flying commercially since 1990.  This is the most comfortable headset I have ever worn during my aviation career! I have worn both the Bose A10 and A20 and they are well made and are quality but just not as comfortable as this Zulu3. The new cord on this model is thin and very flexible. The ear pads are super soft and the headset is light. The Bluetooth function works very nicely and is very clear. I would buy these for all my passengers if I flew friends frequently.
5,I have had both superb service from Lightspeed  and a superb experience using the new Zulu 3 headset that I acquired on their trade up program recently.  The trade up program worked smoothly and was a significant part of my decision to buy the Zulu 3 now. As a product the Zulu 3 headset is the best headset I have owned. It is comfortable the noise cancellation is excellent and the Bluetooth integration to my mobile devices is completely seamless and stable. All in all a great company producing great products and offering great service.
5,I've been very extremely pleased with the comfort and clarity of this product.  It's sound dampening is very impressive and had worked flawlessly with Vans Aircraft RV-8.  The best part about the Lightspeed product line is what my wife thinks.  She likes the comfort of the headset and being able to speak to me without yelling into the microphone while we are flying.  I could not imagine owning any other type of headset for aviation.
5,First class product in every way. Bought two one for my girlfriend a fellow pilot as a gift and one for me. We've flown with them for several hundred hours in multiple aircraft and absolutely love them. Although we haven't had to use it yet with these we did use customer service with our Lightspeed 33gs. Lightspeed's customer service is without parallel. Top quality innovative products and world-class customer service means I will be a Lightspeed customer for life.Carl HicksN180JL
5,I purchased my Zulu 3 about six months ago replacing my original Zulu.  I have been very pleased with the new headset.  I like the single cord and I think the fit and comfort is improved.  We travel from Michigan to Florida and back frequently and the comfort this unit provides is exceptional.  I have owned Lightspeed headsets for the past 20 years and have always found there products and service to be of the highest quality.
5,I traded in my Bose X after Bose refused to repair a defective headset without charging me a full refurb price. It's been the best thing I could have done. My headset is more comfortable fit's better and the sound quality is better too.I have since purchased another Zulu 3 for the right seat... My passengers deserve the comfort too and I plan to purchase 2 more for the back seats.
5,I'm a student helicopter pilot. This is the first headset that I have owned. Used loaner DC before. Did a lot of research before I purchased. Didn't let me down. I am very happy with my Zulu 3. Seems to be well made and durable. It's light and It's very comfortable. I connect it to FlightLink and it works terrific. The noise reduction system is amazing.
5,I flew with my Zulu 3 for the first time today and it was a monumental improvement over the rental headsets at my flight school. I wish I would have purchased my Zulu 3 at the beginning of my training.
5,I've been a longstanding Lightspeed customer and the Zulu 3 with the new cord design is great.  Light weight quiet active noise cancelling and audio inputs in a well constructed tough design is perfect for general aviation use.  Lightspeed customer service is terrific too.  They stand behind the product.
5,I have been a Lightspeed customer for  headsets now for 5 headsets.  They are the best quality and customer service can not be beat.  Why try anything else?  I am a 19000 flight instructor and a lot of my students buy from my recommendation.  Good stuff!!
5,As good as the Bose A20 headset but considerably cheaper. The lightspeed is also very comfortable and extremely reliable I would also note that their customer service is fantastic. Lightspeed a definite five stars
5,The earlier Zulu headsets were great but the Zulu 3 is even better. The sound quality and comfort are outstanding. My experiences with the Lightspeed Company have been very positive. They have been responsive and have been wonderful about repairs even when products are well pass warranty.
5,Just made the switch from Lightspeeds Sierra headset and what a difference in weight and tightness on the head.  It’s created a much more relaxing atmosphere when flying 5+ hrs a day.  So far so good after 200 hrs on the headset in 3 months!
5,Of the 3 or 4 sets (we have bought them 2 at a time) of light speeds we have had in the last 15 years the Zulu 3s are the best ones!
5,Excellent sound quality! I can now hear radio calls and passengers better than ever before. I utilized the trade up program with no issues or "hiccups" and am happy I made the switch from Bose.
5,Extremely comfortable best noise canceling if ever used.  I highly recommend Lightspeed for quality customer service and performance.  Battery life is excellent as well.
5,Great headset.  Moved over from the Bose A20.  Now everyone in the plane wants to trade their A20 for a new Zulu 3.
5,These are very comfortable and the  ANR works great I would recommend these to anyone that does much flying.
5,Excellent headset.  Well constructed and I love the new reinforced cable.  They work very well in all the types of flying I do.
5,Have flown my Zulu 3 almost 300 hours this summer and have been very impressed with the comfort of the headset and the noise canceling will buy another one
5,Great headset. Flew a 3.5 hours and had no fatigue. Eyeglasses may be uncomfortable after a while but move the headset a bit and that seemed to help.
5,Fully satisfied. Be aware that if you use Bluetooth with your phone connected the batteries won't last as much. Keep spares on hand.
5,Best headset that I’ve ever owned!
5,This is a great headset.  They keep getting better.  I can indeed recommend this!
5,l've worn in on 4 hr flights completely comfortable.  Noise reduction is first-rate.  I love this headset.
5,Excellent noise-cancelled audio. Great fit! Superb customer service.
5,Well engineered aviation tool.  Very comfortable and noise canceling is excellent.  Highly recommended.
3,I’ve been wearing the Bose A-20 since they first came out but I was unhappy with Bose’s customer service. LS seems to have a lot better customer service and the Lightspeed trade up program was very attractive.However the Zulu 3 isn’t on the same level as the Bose A20 or even the Bose X. The Zulu 3 has an oil can sound that I just don’t like. The oil can sound happens whenever I turn my head. Other Zulu 3 owners I’ve spoken with have the same compliant. The Zulu 3 mic isn’t as clear as the A-20 either.I’ve told those in the market the Zulu 3 is a good value but does not perform at the same level as the A20.
3,Purchased the Bose A20 for myself. My wife didn't want to spend the extra money so she bought the slightly lower-cost Lightspeed Zulu 3 which is supposed to be similar in performance to the Bose. We have now used both headsets and we both agree that the Bose is lighter more comfortable to wear and--perhaps more important--has noticeable better noise cancellation and sound quality than the Zulu 3. This in a somewhat noisy Piper Archer II. Spend the extra money on the Bose; it is so worth it!
1,Customer Service at Lightspeed was very unsatisfactory in my experience. I had my last Zulu sent in 4 times under warranty and they were unable to fix the ANC and they could not come up with a better solution other than for me to buy a new one.
5,Tried the Bose a20 and these are more comfortable and sound quality is right there with Bose and $300 cheaper.
5,I have tried flying with the Bose A20 the D&C and now the Zulu3 and I can say without a doubt that this is the best feeling headset I have ever used  the ANC is on point  I can still hear things like the stall warning and ATC comes in loud and clear but the noise from the engine is dulled to the point where I can deal with it for a while  Also the ANR doesnt give me a headache after a while like the Bose did.  5/5 would buy again
5,Here's why I went with the Lightspeed Zulu 3 instead of the Bose A20:1 it fits my large head much more comfortably (Bose tension spring on the top clamps inward a little too much for me)2 better warranty (7 years v. 5 for Bose)3 more durable construction (much less plastic plus kevlar cable)4 $250 cheaper5 better carry case (hard sided v. soft for Bose)From my testing of both the only advantages I saw for Bose were slightly better ANR (though Lightspeed is still more than sufficient) slightly longer battery life (no biggie I always carry spares) and the ability to switch mic boom sides. Perhaps these areas mean more to you than they did to me but as renter pilot the difference in cost was 2 full hours in a 172 when money is tight.... You cannot go wrong with the Lightspeed Zulu 3!
5,Nice headset. Anr is on point. Only issue is when I turn my head they don’t seal super well and there is feedback. Not worthy of removing a star as these are well worth the money
5,I found this the be more better in all categories (noise volume and clarity) than the Bose I also own. Very pleased with my purchase.
5,I just started my flight training and decided to go all in and purchase this headset. The zulu3 is EXTREMELY comfortable. They have very large ear seals with lots of space inside and proper clamping force distribution. I used it for 1.5 hours so far in flight and I cant see this headset ever becoming uncomfortable even after several hours of flight.in comparison the Bose A20 is much smaller and very uncomfortable. After a very short time you can feel the speaker pressing against your ear which for me is a very big drawback. A comfortable headset is one which has sufficient padding and ear space inside the ear cup to prevent direct contact of the speaker on the ear. The lightspeed has plenty of space and allows your ear to rest comfortably inside with only the pillow like ear seals resting on your head.Sound clarity is excellent on the zulu and communications are perfect. The only small negative point i would have to point out is the sound quality it lacks a bit of bass for music listening. I use the zulus on my PC at home as well with an aviation GA plug to PC adapter and it is just great. Most comfortable headset ive ever worn.thank you Lightspeed!
3,My objective was not to fly on an airplane but rather to have a quiet environment to work and study. I have compared this with my Bose quiet 35 and it does the job for me for a fraction of the price. No doubt the quality is there but not so sure about the price difference. The  Bluetooth performed equally on both
5,I like the effective noise cancellation and the way they can be configured for the onboard radios..
5,Alles bestens!
5,Super comfortable and the ANR is great. Bluetooth is okay not the best out there for the quality of the sound but the other features make up for it. Also the kevlar around the wires is a must.Shipping was fast and people of Hammond Aviation are the sweetest :)
