rating,review
5,They sound amazing for what they are and even though they're not silk dome they're definitely not bad.  I would highly recommend for stock speaker replacement in oem vehicles. Bass is decent.
4,The Toyota Tacoma factory speakers are HORRID. When you remove the first one you'll see what I'm talking about. The magnet is about the size/weight of a quarter. These things probably cost about $2 to produce. The Kicker speakers transform your Tacoma's audio if you do at least the front/rears. Tweeters can be done later if you want. Rating BEFORE Kicker's....2/10; Rating after Kicker's....7/10. Much better.
4,Super easy to install and some amazing sound i can hear every noteüëç
4,Ok so I bought one pair so far and installed them easily after getting the brackets I need to fit my car. The first speaker I installed sounded great! Bass was good and the sound was clear and loud. The second one I installed sounded like it was rattling or distorted or something. First I checked to make sure it was secured tight in the door and it was then I checked the sound when it wasn‚Äôt in the door and it sounded the same so it‚Äôs definitely the speaker. Ended up taking it out because I couldn‚Äôt bare it. Not sure what the return policy is but hopefully they will let me return it.
4,Very good product.  Easily installed it myself except that the speaker wire seemed to be tough to push all the way down.  Sound is very good.  Came with all I needed.  Value was good but I was disappointed seller discounted immediately after I bought two pairs.  I could have saved another $20 if the discount came a day earlier.  If seller had done that it would have been five stars all around.
4,PUT THESE IN THE DOOR OF MY 08 SILVERADO DIDNT BUY ADAPTERS JUST GUTTED THE OLD SPEAKERS AND USED THEM FOR ADAPTER WORKED GREAT .SOUND PRETTY GOOD WITH JUST THE STOCK STEREO
4,I installed these in my 2009 GMC Sierra. Better than stock mids and highs are great but less bass than stock. It‚Äôs sounds clearer than stock so that‚Äôs good would‚Äôve like a little more kick from these.
3,Speakers sounded great when first installed about a year ago I'm running a small Soundstream nano amp which doesn't put out huge power. Just wanted to be able to hear the music in my Jeep at 65 MPH.They've never been wet never been left outside overnight always garaged or had the top up never been bumped abused or overdriven.Right speaker's voice coil separated and now sounds like hell.
5,Installed in a 2010 ram 1500 for front door speakers these only play a bass tone in rams and it sounds very good for the price
5,I put these on my Honda Beat pp1 JDM car it‚Äôs not a direct fit but drilled a couple of hole to mount it behind the door panel and now fit great. The sound is awesome for the price.
4,N/A
3,I mistakenly bought these instead of the KS series. These sound okay basically OEM+ assuming you have an amp driving them. I'd probably only use these in a budget system since they definitely don't sound bad and are good for 90% of the people buying them. I plan on moving these to my daily driver.
5,Just ok
5,Great audio clarity for the value.
5,After looking on the net for speakers  that fit the Element's doors and after purchasing a pair of Pioneer's that said they fit - they do if you leave the  grills off I finally decided to give these a try. Have you looked at the many speakers that say they fit but when you study the pictures you still have doubts that they will??? OK so let me say that these do with absolutely no problems. You will not be able to use the original screws or screw holes but the housing is plenty thick to hold the new screws. Simply pop off the grill remove the old speaker hold the new speaker centered as much as possible in the housing hole mark the hole drill mount these speakers and pop the grill back on. You will have to cut the old speaker housing tabs that are plastic and part of the door housing - this takes 15 seconds or less with a razor knife. These speakers sound incredible and they fit the back doors just as easy. I am not sure I would get the speaker wiring adapters the ones that clip into the original speaker clips and then plug into aftermarket speakers. Also be very careful when attaching the wires to the speakers and do not push the slip on connectors real hard onto the speaker tabs - they can break. Support the speaker tabs with your finger underneath when attaching the wiring. Total time to install 4 of these speakers - about an hour. Highly recommended.
4,magnet looks small but mids n high did the job
5,Installed on a 2014 lancer ES. Compared to factory speakers the output is about 2 or 3 times louder without distortion as well as the sound quality. They have to be broken in to get a better low range and mid and high range are outstanding.
5,I bought some aftermarket adapter along with these speakers and I changed the front speakers in less than 30 minutes! If you're not an audio geek but want better sounding speakers for your old car then I highly recommend these. Songs that I used to play with heavy bass no longer sound like static!
4,I bought this pair to replace one blown factory speaker in a 2014 Ford Fusion. They were listed on another site as direct factory replacement. This was not the case. I had to modify/utilize the old speaker's outside edge/rim as a "gap filler" as the hole that the 6.5" speaker came out of was about 7.5-8" in diameter. Mounting this 6.5" speaker to the cut off outside rim of the old speaker did the trick. The sound is great but not as "full" as the old speaker. But atleast now it isn't rattling and I can listen to music with the balance back in the middle! Would definitely buy again for the price.
5,Purchased these speakers to replace the stock speakers in a 2008 Toyota Rush. They're powered on a DS18 amp and sound amazing. Worth the money.
4,Al comprar el producto sent√≠ que eran parlantes muy chillantes muchos altos y pocos medios.. para mi gusto musical no sonaban bien. Me habia decepcionado de la marca Kicker!Luego de estar investigando descubri que los tweeters estan con polaridad invertida y el filtro que traen es de 1er orden.Luego de invertir los cables del tweeter mejor√≥ increiblemente. Las voces se escuchan bien los altos ya no son chillantes y en conjunto con los bajos se escucha agradable y muy balanceado el sonido.Me parece bien extra√±o que Kicker coloque el tweeter con polaridad invertida si no utiliza filtro de 2do orden.En fin ya adquir√≠ 3 sets e hice lo mismo ahora el sonido es increiblemente bien. Esto era lo que esperaba de Kicker!Saludos.
5,Better than Bose !!
5,The quality of speaker is great and I‚Äôm super happy with it. Thank you.
5,Fits in 1999 Jeep TJ. The stock speakers were 5.25 and I was able to fit the 6.5 speaker in its place. It requires only a minor modification of cutting the foam around the sound bar speaker hole with a utility knife after removing the sound bar cover. Removing the foam under the cover will let you mount the speaker flush onto the soundbar. Then you drill 4 new holes for the speaker screws. I also did pack some poly-fil into the soundbar before putting the new speaker in.Now these aren‚Äôt top of the line speakers as you can tell by the price but they are better than the factory installed ones.
5,Great speakers. Cost a little high but it's worth it.
5,I've never had better speakers and I've had a lot. I have subs so don't use these for bass but have about 80 watts each speaker and only halfway up it's too loud to sit in my car. EDIT- about 6 months later at least one of these is blown and it's connected to a 420 watt MAX amp along with the other 3 speakers so definitely isn't overpowered. As annoying as this is it's probably my fault in reality for having it too loud I would still recommend for the average person but apparently for someone like me I'm gonna have to spend $400 on a pair to get what I really want. Anyone complaining about bass doesn't realize these aren't really meant for it  they're 6.5 Kicker's who probably assumes you have a sub as well if you're buying this high of a power rating.
5,For her birthday I upgraded my wife's stereo in her 2010 Genesis.  It already had a factory sub but you couldn't tell it was there.  You can now! I replaced the factory components  including the stereo  speakers sub and amp.  All speakers were replaced with Kicker as well.  Car sounds amazing!Recommend!
5,I am really content with these speakers that I swapped out for my stock rears in my 2020 Silverado RST Crew Cab. I also purchased the 6x9s for my front doors and the sound is really crisp and clear. Kickers are the best bang for your buck. Always check when received they do not package speakers in another box with extra protection to manage the handling during shipping.
5,Awesome sound. That you for replacing the ones that were stolen.
5,The back speakers on my Tacoma were a$$ the magnet in the back were the size of a nickel (ridiculous) so I upgraded the front and then added these to the back door. You will need adapters ($10-12) for the pair. Good sound
4,I really shocked at how small 4x6's are but over all they sound good. I'm no audio tech but hey.
5,Sounds fantastic and fit perfect. Would buy again for my other vehicles
3,Honestly it‚Äôs pretty decent for it‚Äôs value but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend you this if you really trying get next level sound. Only reason why I bought theses was to replace my stock broken rear door speakers. Depending on the type of car you have you might have to do some custom trimming.
4,Easy to install reasonably priced nice upgrade from OEM speakers. You get your money's worth
5,Have these in the front doors of my 2016 Honda Accord sport and wow what a difference sounds so good I don‚Äôt need to take out my factory radio just need to add my subs in now wow 63.00 these things bang crystal clear tweeters and the bass is nice now I gotta add these to the back. Kicker you done the job on these 6.5 wow! My highs are screaming and mids are high and can hear everything in the songs . Buy these don‚Äôt even look anything else! I was gonna spend 150 on jbl but I went with these instead and wow! Get these u won‚Äôt be disappointed
5,Love them. Just not competition level. Overall amazing for price. Still keeping them
4,Decent for price point. Replaced the door speakers on SLK 230 which were BOSE. Original speakers did not have tweeters. On the SLK the tweeters are in the trim piece where the door handle is. Anyway that being said I got new tweeters also for the aforementioned space. Now too much tweeter. Bose speakers are known for their bass I suppose but they were 20 years old. I have to turn the bass up 3/4 of the way up on the radio now. Overall not bad. I'll see how they last for the years to come.
5,I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would need an amplifier with these but they work great! BIG difference from factory speakers. Installing them was a learning curve because of how the factory ones were made and mounted in my Buick.
5,Used these in a 2017 Nissan SentraThe Bose (Blow-se)speakers in the front started popping and warranty just expired..These are better than the factory crap/paper Bose speakers by FAR! Better highs (may be a little bright but I like this) mids and lows.
4,not the best sounding speakers I've had but they work well and were a good fit for my 2006 GMC sierra. I used the self-tapping screws provided to drill into the door and eyeballed the mounting location because I didn't want to find an OEM adapter. someone with minimal knowledge and access to youtube could easily DIY these speakers.
5,Perfect for my lil truck music gets TOO loud (I‚Äôm getting old haha) happy with purchase
5,These work well with the 95-2005 Tahoe speaker adapters. They sound great at a decent price.
5,I have a basic JVC head unit In my 2000 Accord Coupe that was installed before I bought it. I thought the speakers in my car were old but not factory (because the head unit made them sound louder). All were factory and mostly blown out. I dropped these kickers into the doors and HOLY SMOKES. Great bang for your buck. With just a basic head unit and no amp these will make you supremely happy as an upgrade from any factory speaker.
5,Bought a pair for my Harley Davidson Street Glide to replace a blown Polk Audio speaker and WOW was I surprised!  The highs are super crisp and the bass response is hands down better than the Polk.  Glad I blew a speaker!!  haha!  Great buy!!  Buy them....you won't be disappointed!!
4,It's a great speaker however I'm a bass head I got these thinking they'd cover for my mud range needs but they're high hurt my ears high not my thing at all the Tweeters on these are louder than the speaker itself.
4,For the cost these are some of the best speakers i've heard. They get nearly twice as loud as my expectations will be ordering again to replace my front speakers.
4,Excellent treble.  Bass is weak but then again is a small speaker.  Overall happy and way better than GM factory
5,These sound crisp and clear there not cheap but do sound great for the comparable price of others..
4,They were perfect for my work truck and the sound quality was far better than my old stock speakers.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Speakers sound great clear used them on my motorcycle with a 1000 watt amp they handle it with know problem
3,These as a SLIGHT upgrade from stock speakers. Don‚Äôt be expecting anything major. My front door speakers were old and had holes in them and I used to have some kicker subs that hit hard but these speakers just don‚Äôt hit like I thought they would. Buy these if you need a quick switch from your old stock speakers but I‚Äôd save your money and go with something better if you want your speakers to really punch. I‚Äôm not disappointed though because they were cheap and they do sound better than my old speakers.
5,They sound great and are super easy to hook up definitely would recommend.
5,Used these to replace my factory speakers in Honda Accord. Huge upgrade from factory. The sound is so crisp and clear and any volume. Not a ton of bass but that‚Äôs expected from these kind of speakers. Definitely need a subwoofer to pair with these. Did not use any amps or anything just direct to factory system. I have zero complaints about the performance of these speakers.
4,Pretty good sound!!
5,These speakers were easy to install in my 2012 honda accord they came with brackets to install onto the door. I ordered a set of different speakers from another popular brand that starts with an 'A' and they did not come with brackets. Sound quality is superb for the price point. Would order again !
5,These speakers are great. I put 4 of them in my Silverado. Sound quality is way better than stock and I haven‚Äôt even hooked my amp up yet. Bass is decent for 6.5‚Äù & the mid and highs are fine. Buy speaker wire adapters and fitment adapters too & its a quick job.
4,These speakers work well not perfect sound but great product for the price point
5,I was hoping to get a little bit more than I did out of the speakers. There‚Äôs definitely better than the stock speakers that I had. Not a bad upgrade though.
5,Love Kickers. Won't use anything else.
4,These fit in my 2003 Honda Accord EX V6 Instillation wasn‚Äôt too hard. Just have to drill. Sound is ok. Not bad for the price.
5,Upgraded from Polk Audio to these Kickers to handle more wattage in our beloved 1993 Toyota Landcruiser.  Great price super easy to I bstall and noticeable improvement in audio quality and loudness.  I recommend this product.
5,...real good value speakers with great mid range frequency. The best part of the entire equipment i bought for enhancing the sound on my car audio. Delivers a rounded up tone after the first disappointment with a smaller sizespeaker from the same brand!
5,Buen sonido cambia totalmente el sonido de mi 2020 silverado  solo le coloque un adaptador a la speakers en la puerta trasera y el sonido es claro y limpio.
3,I replaced two old Bose speakers in the rear of a Silverado with these.  They sound OK nothing special.
4,Product met my needs but most impressed with Customer service.  item returned late so I was provided a substantial price discount for being late. Will definitely buy from these guys again!
5,These speakers sound so good the I can't hear my front speakers which are still stock so I order two more of these. Stay tuned...
5,I just used these speakers to replace factory speakers on a 2002 Xterra. These speakers are a huge improvement over the factory ones. Sound is crisp and i can feel the bass for sure. I would buy again if needed.
5,Great replacement for my front door speakers on my 2003 Silverado. Easy install and sounds great!
5,Great sound for a great price. Very happy with them.
5,Bought these in tandem with the 6.5 inch GTO series JBL's and these 6.5's eat those JBL's up. These bump are loud and are a huge upgrade to my current build. Will be buying another set to replace the jbls for sure.
2,Good sound out of the speakers with the tweeters but no bass at all wich is fine if you just want sound good for rear doors if you have subs in the trunk just recommend better front door speakers ü§òüèº
4,I installed in my 2015 TOYOTA rear speaker. way better than OEM for sure.
4,Sound great would give them five stars but not as loud as they could be but a great option for the money .
5,Easy to put together! Came with wires and adapter for conversion connect but I upgraded to plugs. Either way will be buying again for rear speakers.
5,Purchased these to replace my 2007 Honda Civic front speakers that after 10+ years gave out. Installation was super simple (YouTube for the win!) and the sound quality is great.
5,Great upgrade for my 2015 Infiniti Q50. But customizations had to be done to install. Still happy. The hardware that comes with the speakers are trash but speakers are still worth it.
5,Installed it in my Chevy Express. So far so good. Much better then the stock. Sounds great.
5,Didn't fit but I made it fit. The factory  speakers couldn't handle MetallicA or PanterA or any other music. Now I can turn the volume up to max without rumbling and blowing out the weak factory speakers. ü§òüòùü§ò
4,Great replacement for worn out 15+ year factory speakers. So glad I made the upgrade.
5,Killing the game I replaced factory speakers with these n now Im turning heads
5,I replaced my blown stock speakers with these and they sound great. They actually have a lot more bass than I thought they would.
5,Replaced stock speakers in 2005 Honda Element.  The entire process took 1 hour from unboxing to driving listening to music that finally sounds great!  Awesome deal and very happy with this purchase.
4,Their good for the money. But theirs a little bit of static but their not bad
4,sounds great alot of bang for the buck
5,These were purchased for my son's truck.They were very easy to install have great sound quality are great structurally and have great bass quality.Our son is very pleased with them.
5,It is a good pair speakers for you aftermarket unit with a decent bass sound that i was looking for. Would buy again
5,These speakers are a major upgrade to the OME ones loud and clear sound. Easy to install in my girlfriends Acura RDX 08.
5,My son's speakers finally quit as had been in his used car for years. He had everything to complete the job and was not hard to replace. He really enjoys his new speakers!! Thanks!!
5,My vehicle has strange speaker housings so it was a pain to install these but they sound amazing so it was well worth it. Most vehicles should be much easier to install too
3,A purchase is based on other reviews and they are marginal difference from the existing speakers at best
4,Installed in an older vehicle.
5,I used these to replace all the door speakers in my car and they sound great! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for some nice door speakers for cheap.
5,great speakers for the price.
5,Screws do not perfectly line up but I still fit them in. Will need to drill holes if you want to use all screws.
5,Perfect
4,Good sound..
5,Best overall for price- amazing sound quality for my aftermarket sound system (clear sound no fuzz or white noise handle bass well) and were super easy to install.
5,Sound great in our ‚Äò18 F-150. Good value for the price. Happy with the purchase.
5,I Love the sound and quailty of these speakers with a great price!!!
5,Great buy great sound without an amplifier. Outstanding sound with amplifier
1,

4,üëåüèΩ
5,installed in 2010 maxima back doors sound good
3,Great product worked as expected except one of the speakers don‚Äôt work and can‚Äôt find out how to get a replacement
5,Sound awesome. Way better than my Bose. Totally worth the money.
5,We really like the product and it works really great they sound amazing in the car.
5,Everything is of great quality. I‚Äôm just disappointed it didn‚Äôt include a sticker
5,Great quality and seller is great easy to deal with and very fair I would definitely recommend and buy again
5,Used to replace my stock speaker in my 2007 Nissan Altima. Make sure you get a universal kit to fit your door
1,Sounded ok to start now crackling
5,Good speakers nice crisp sound and at a good price
3,Good sound quality but they are definitely not a standalone speaker. You will need some 6x9's or a sub to hear any kind of bass.
5,Always quality. 2nd time using it
2,Didn't come in the manufacturers box like in the picture they were just thrown in a shipping box nonchalantly thankfully they didn't break upon shipment. Came with absolutely no hardware/wires or adapter plates to install so unless your a pro at jerry rigging id buy them from the store where it actually comes with wires screws and adapter rings.
5,Great speakers for the price
5,My husband loved them perfect birthday present.
5,Sounds awesome good crisp sound. Better than the other new ones I had in.
5,Very good for the price
5,Speakers work great! Would recommend to anyone! Easy to install!
5,Great value  sounds crisp
5,Se lo instale en mi chevy colorado 2005 y se escucha genial
5,Anything is better than factory
5,Perfect fit for my door speakers in my rsx. Sound is way better than stock and even better than my pioneers.
5,Easy to install but the most important thing is they sound great!!!!
5,fast shipping just as described. sound amazing for the price happy with the purchase.
5,Great speakers. Sound great on my bike with amp. Good clean sound.
5,Great value and great upgrade from factory
5,Sounds great in a 2004 Chevy Silverado single cab.
5,Good speaker
5,bought because of clearance issue very clear highs and good lows
3,I love it
5,The best on the money range.
5,Great sound and a great price!
1,Not much better than stock speakers on Harley if any at all. 2013 Harley with a fosgate amp. Don‚Äôt buy! Not worth it!
5,Fits 08 Tundra sounds great
5,Liked everything especially sound!!
3,Easy to install great product not very loud
1,Bought alittle over a month ago & one speaker has blown. I have 2-12in subs in box & amp as well. I never have the bass turned above the middle. Bass is set on head unit at -2. I use my amp to adjust the bass not the head unit. So 90% of the bass is coming from subs through amp.  Extremely frustrated! And no way to contact seller!!
5,Son loves them
5,Great quality great price
5,Installed in the front doors of ford fusion; sounds great!
5,Awesome sound additions
5,Easy to install
5,As advertised
5,Used to upgrade speakers on my HD
5,Good price .
5,Good sound quality
1,If you like crisp clear sound or deep bass stay away from these speakers. I purchased these since I've always had good luck with Kicker subs. Unfortunately these combined with the 6x9 kicker speakers sound terrible in my 2017 F350 Superduty Crew Cab. I did keep the Kicker Comp VR 10" woofers installed though. Kicker needs to skip the mid range and stick with subwoofers.
1,I wish I would have hooked them up sooner but it's winter and I was installing them on a Harley not even to a amp and one blew right away total junk would not buy would not recommend for anybody only reason I gave it one star is because I had to.
5,They sound awesome
1,These are not loud at all factory speakers where louder üôÑ what a big disappointment. I don't know what to do at this point.
2,Great speakers. Sound good.
1,Installed to head unit. After installed it sounded ok. Next day speaker started to smoke and now crackles.
2,price good no base
1,The speakers did not fit in the car despite the fact that the description said they were compatible. Will be returning.
1,Is not working
5,I purchased these through a local car audio retailer and paid a much lower price than they are being sold here for.  The installation on these was straight forward and I am impressed with the quality considering the price point they are at.I am currently running these off of the factory head unit in a 2017 Nissan Versa.  The sound quality is surprisingly good considering they are running off of factory power.  They are much better than the stock speakers that came with the car and think they sound fine for the average music listener with factory power.The bass on these definitely could be better but the highs are VERY bright.  I am going to hooking up a 4 channel amp in the coming weeks that will increase the overall power on these to about 100W on each speaker and look forward to them really coming alive with the additional power.  I will update this post after that happens.All in all I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to replace their factory speakers or wanting to do a full build on a conservative budget.
5,Amazing sound quality. Very easy to install if you have the proper tools to remove door panel. Fits great on 2017 Volkswagen Jetta
5,I put these into an 02 Civic LX and into a 2013 Scion FR-S.  AMAZING speakers with very shallow magnet.They hit hard and aren't weak on highs either.Would recommend for anyone who wants a basic upgrade
1,Broke within a year of installing them
5,Running these speakers with a Kenwood Excelon 4 channel amp 50 watts RMs per channel 4 ohms. With the gains set right they perform perfectly with no distortion. Very strong vocals and highs with some bass.  Using them for mids/highs and running a separate sub/amp. Very strong and stable. Also rand them with just the OEM HU at 14 watts per channel and they still sounded great until you reached max volume due to not enough power from the OEM HU.
5,I had a problem with my rear speakers and replaced these when I replaced the ACDelco head unit with an Eonon. I think these speakers are a decent replacement for stock and now I have sound in the rear which was non-existent before for more than a year...
5,Being new to working with sound systems these speakers were easy as cake to set up in my 2000 Blazer. Only two hiccups; First the wires on the speakers don't just plug into the car's sound system you need to splice the wires although that wasn't difficult with a standard wire stripper and some orange wire caps. Second the screw holes in the speaker mount didn't line up with the speaker housings in my front doors but that was an easy fix with a drill. Sound quality is phenomenal bass is incredible and they haven't failed yet at one month having them. Definitely considering buying another pair to replace my back door speakers as well.
5,Swapped out the stock door speakers front and rear in my 2006 access cab. They mounted up without any adapter rings or modification to stock brackets. I would suggest soldering the wires on instead of using the provided connectors for a more secure connection. Happy with these.
5,Great sound
2,Lasted 2 years
5,I was really amazed how good these sound in my truck!! I had MTX Thunders and they don't even compare to these Kickers the difference is night and day. From now on I will stick with Kickers well worth the money.
5,Good quality speakers on a budget. The sound is much better that the old speakers in the car.
5,Perfect fit as an upgrade to a 2016 Toyota Sienna Le (stock head unit NO navigation). These are thin enough to fit in rear just behind sliding door and sound great. Stock head unit Audio control lc7i alpine 6x9 component front door & dash kicker csc65 cs series alpine 5 channel amp jla 12w3.
5,I really like these speakers clean crisp decent power.
5,Super loud
5,Crystal clear sound even at max volume do your self a favor and buy these!
5,Exactly what I was looking for in my 70 vette
5,Great sounding speakers. I replaced the factory speakers in my 01 Tahoe with these and it‚Äôs a night and day difference in sound quality. Combined with a 8in Kicker subwoofer the sound quality is amazing.
5,Installed on a 05 accord. I reused the old brackets to mount these speakers on. Had to get a little creative but it worked and fit. These sounds better than the stock. Lots of clarity in the mids and highs. The lows are a bit muted. I'm enjoying it quite a bit after a break in period and months worth of listening. Definitely recommend these over stock.
5,Installed on a 1999 c3500 crewcab super happy even cut and installed in the rear doors
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I bought these to replace front speakers in 2000 chevy silverado. I have an upgraded jvc head unit and polk speakers in rear doors. These speakers are amazing! For the price they are awesome. Other reviews said  no base but my head unit paired with them has great base. My old truck sounds great and has better sound and video than my dad‚Äôs new $50000 truck haha...
5,It‚Äôs kicker what do you expect‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ good sound quality they hooked up easily and sound crystal clear and no distortion when after market radio is all the way up. I recommend kicker to a lot of people. Can‚Äôt go wrong with kicker
5,You need to amp these. If you are not pushing at least 60 watts to these they will not perform. Stock spears are lucky if they get 30 watts. It is typically closer to 10-20 watts on your average stock system. So if you hook these up to a stock system they are going to sound weak and way under perform. I have 4 of them hooked up to a 4 channel 75 watt amp and they sound pretty good. Because I don't plan on keeping this truck for more than a year I was not interested in spending big money on speakers. For the price and if you are willing to amp them you will not be disappointed. If your goal is just to hook them up to a stock system you will be very disappointed.
5,I read some mixed reviews on these door speakers. I bought them because my right front speaker blew out about 2 years ago and had been driving without it working. Secondly because i put 2 Kicker 12's in my car and i needed upgraded door speakers. Let me tell you. They sound absolutely amazing. They are super loud with clean crisp sound. Im very happy with buying these door speakers.
5,Easy install great sound.

5,Used to replace stock door speakers in Chrysler PT Cruiser with original factory radio.The new speakers came with pigtail connectors however if you don't want to cut into the factory wiring harness consider buying  wiring harness adapters for your vehicle.In my case the speaker mounting holes did not match so new holes had to be drilled.I was impressed with the sound quality of these new speakers the bass is not much but about equal to factory units.Overall very happy with the purchase & seller.
4,Package came 5 days late. One set of speakers looked already open as the inside plastic was torn open. One box was taped up like crazy and one had no tape what so ever. Product works great though.
5,Originally got the used to replace my front door 6.5s and they sound great
4,Nice sounding speakers. Good value for the money.
3,El vendedor fue muy amable y r√°pido.En cuanto al producto este no es muy bueno las bocinas de agencia de mi Civic se escuchaban mejor creo que las mandar√© reparar.

5,Good speakers they have a real good sound to them but the highs and mids were over powering with the factory fitted tweeters in my car. Needed to do some work on the EQ's but once done they sound superb.  Great bass too!
5,Quedaron muy bien en la puerta del veh√≠culo buen sonido.
